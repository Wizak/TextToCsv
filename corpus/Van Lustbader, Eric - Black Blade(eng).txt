 the shrine tokyo new york the waterspider traversed the small still pond moving from rock to rock without a sound or even a sensation of motion the emergence of the waterspider from out of the blue winter shadows on the far side of the pond was beautiful to behold and quite terrible the flat grey rocks were covered in moss brown and crunchy at this time of the year but the waterspider seemed to disturb the living nap not at all the pond was in a small but exquisitely composed garden around which on all sides the steel skyrises of tokyo loomed like a futuristic forest there were two people in the garden a man dressed in a darkgrey chalkstripe suit black loafers thin gold wristwatch and a woman in a silk kimono the man stood near the side of a muscular boulder at the crest of a small knoll covered with sleeping azalea behind him and to the right the woman in the silk kimono knelt head bowed snowwhite hands folded obediently in her lap her eyes closed as if in the same hibernal slumber that gripped the azalea before her sat a black lacquer tray with the ingredients for the chado the formal tea ceremony the kimono that wrapped her in lush comfort was a silver that smouldered in the wan sunlight it was embroidered with phoenixes their red and black plumage quivering whenever she stirred leave it to nishitsu to have a beautiful woman at his side at all times the waterspider thought naoharu nishitsu was a trim wellmuscled man in his early sixties with a neat moustache shaggy eyebrows and an iron disposition the iris of his right eye was entirely white not milkywhite as one sometimes saw in blind people but a lustrous hue similar to that of a pearl beyond nishitsu and his female companion in the tatami room that looked out on this improbable urban glade darksuited sunglassed men prowled no doubt illegally armed with the glowering faces of all professional goons nishitsu was never without a set of bodyguards even here at forbidden dreams where his word was law it was said that this man never raised his voice but then again he had no need to his anger could manifest itself in such a palpably physical way while it was true that this was part of nishitsus frightening mien it was also true that he possessed an intensity that was best equated to a gathering of gravity around the energy of a black hole you summoned me and i have come the waterspider said as he came to rest in front of nishitsu his name was mizusumashi kafu his given name meaning waterspider but he was known to his friends and enemies as suma he had the face of a predatory raptor a creature beyond the bounds of gravity whose scars came from wind and salt and sun his hatchet face was crowned by saltandpepper hair and below that heavy brows eyes that seemed more like holes in his flesh because they never appeared to move and yet they took in everything in his immediate environment suma was dressed in black slacks shoes with paperthin soles a black formfitting tshirt that displayed his sculpted torso the extraordinary thing about him was how well he masked the sense of menace that was at times so tangible as to be painful perhaps this had something to do with his size so small even for a japanese in all ways he had used his lack of size as an advantage and it was nishitsus opinion that the waterspider embraced his smallness because it had about it a vaguely feminine cast the waterspider had that rare confluence of koha an eagerness to experience the spiritual tests of manhood and ninkyo a personal code of honour ninkyo was wholly unlike the western definition of justice which was impersonal objective rather it depended solely on his relationships within the black blade society tea was forthcoming the ritual long complex and relaxing for the two men because it acknowledged more profoundly than any words the respect they had for one another though the waterspider was not a man comfortable with social amenities nevertheless he like nishitsu relished the ceremonies of respect also he could appreciate the deft precise manner in which the woman made the tea served it folded herself like a stunning origami silent waiting for their cups to empty so she unbidden could refill them he envied nishitsu this woman her therenotthere attitude rare in these modern times the toshin kuro kosai the black blade society welcomes you back to its bosom sumasan nishitsu put down his cup suma inclined his head just a fraction lower than nishitsus all that was required to show his obeisance you summoned me he said something has happened something indeed nishitsu said what outsider would believe the power secreted within this shrine like the ghost of a whisper nishitsu thought the toshin kuro kosai the black blade society hidden away from the world at large was protected as we gifted people at its hub busily spinning our webs of power schemed in shadows the conquest of the world no one would believe it of course which is our ultimate strength no interference and none to oppose us but even for us it seems times change once we had so much time far more than a mere human lifetime to formulate the perfect plan to stretch the wings of our influence to the ultimate unimaginable to minds more limited than ours but now time a finite boundary whose leash we had traditionally slipped has become a factor a hideous spectre stalking us as if we were mere mortals the implications were appalling all our dreams built in darkness for decades would crumble to so much dust as times great scythe cut us down none of this of course was told to suma what nishitsu said was sumasan it appears as if we need the benefit of your skills in america there was a humming in the air as of cicadas but this was wintertime and there were no insects in a moment nishitsu became aware that the humming was emanating from suma you have only to ask the waterspider said the task is complex nishitsu said and may take several months all the better suma said he looked as if he were licking his chops there is one caveat nishitsu said you will need to coordinate with an agent already in place suma frowned this is not my agreedupon methodology different times dictate different methodologies nishitsu said firmly it is our duty to adapt as the willow adapts to the changing weather hail suma bowed i understand i truly hope so nishitsu said because the storm is upon us circumstances beyond our control have dictated that we enter into our final stage and every step we make now is critical i will not fail you nishitsusan no nishitsu said looking at the waterspiders bowed head i do not think you will lawrence moravia was lying on carpet that cost more than many peoples yearly salary that was okay with him because he saw it as a symbol one of many he collected like a legion of personal guards a billionaire he felt strongly that he had a duty to help keep in business the shrinking number of true artisans and artists left in the world as a selfmade billionaire he had learned that having so much money forced you out of the mainstream of everyday life people unattractive and venal beautiful and predatory were attracted to the scent of money the way a bear is to honey he supposed they couldnt help it like pavlovs dogs they were highly programmed hooked on the junk of wealth he had dealt effectively with these sharks just as he had dealt with the changing face of his business which was commercial real estate development of all of new yorks superdevelopers lawrence moravia alone had had the foresight in the runaway eighties to salt away huge contingency funds for what he foresaw would be lean times at the beginning of the nineties no party ever lasts was the first and only rule drummed into him by the man who had taught him the urban real estate business while every other developer was either living on a shoestring or testing the waters of bankruptcy court moravia continued to make money money it was so easy to say money didnt matter when you had so much you couldnt possibly spend it all in this lifetime or the way it continued to amass possibly even the next but several years ago the fact had become clear to him that what he was doing no longer lit a fire under him in the end that was what had made the proposal so intriguing because he could see right away that what he would be involved in would deliver the excitement he craved and he could see their point he was the perfect man for the job they had in mind he was a man with an innocuous business who had spent many years in japan spoke the language fluently had made many contacts and friends over here had used japanese production and marketing techniques and so was fully versed in the japanese mind he was also rich enough to attract the attention of the right people in tokyo and thus gain an invitation to forbidden dreams and of course the kicker was that he already knew naoharu nishitsu the leader of japans allpowerful and incredibly wealthy liberal democratic party the two had had a number of business dealings that had helped make moravia rich and which had given nishitsu access to certain contacts in new york where these days he often found it difficult to conduct business nishitsu was apparently more than he seemed was in fact the key into the world moravia was meant to investigate clandestinely it was proposed that he become a spy an offer he found utterly irresistible besides he felt no compunction about conspiring to bring nishitsu down nishitsu had destroyed so many people it was no longer possible to keep a body count and beyond that through his control of the political climate of the country he had warped the lives of countless others without their ever becoming aware of it nishitsu had a secret life just as moravia himself did and now moravia had been charged with unearthing those secrets dangerous work undoubtedly but all the more exhilarating because of it moravia watched now as a beautiful japanese woman almost a girl yes but not quite brought over a refill of his drink she had done this without him asking that was the japanese way one of the reasons why he had been so drawn to japan as a young man as she sat naked beside him in the tiny windowless room she became another piece of art with which this room was furnished she was smiling that sincere but empty smile that was the symbol of modernday japan he considered in what ways she reminded him of that first japanese girl he had met in new york when he was a young man she had been so freshfaced and in the arena of sex so willing to do anything he wished she had beguiled him luring him back to japan and she had almost convinced him to marry her but just in time he had backed out and since then he had never considered marriage again once he had imagined it was his great wealth that was an impediment to a lasting relationship with a woman now he knew better it was his secret life the one that opened up for him at night like a poppy whose kiss could bring all his delicious dreams alive and there was no better place than tokyo for him to indulge his appetite for sexual excess he picked up the red silk cord wound it around his hand he tugged gently at it and the woman the other end of the cord tied around her ankle was pulled closer to him he got up and stepping away from the comfort of the sofa brought her over to the restraint of a hard armless ladderback chair he jerked on the silk cord and she straddled the chair facing the back he knelt tied first one ankle then the other to the chair legs now he began the most enjoyable work using other lengths of silk cord when he was finished she was bound around neck wrists waist breasts across eyes and open mouth in a kind of complex puzzle of tight loops and knots that in concert with her smooth firm flesh created a kind of artwork a living sculpture that was as aesthetically pleasing as it was sexually arousing her helplessness and her enjoyment of that helplessness was an irresistible erotic magnet to moravia he stood naked himself with his hands on her shoulders knowing that she could not move even if she wanted to of course she did not want to his hands slid down her bound back caressing her flanks then gripping her pelvis his knees bent until he was at the correct height then pulling on the tightly bound cords he entered her she gasped through the silk her head falling back onto his chest sightless and therefore feeling him all the more deeply but this kind of heightened pleasure could not last long and it was over for both of them too quickly well he thought gripping her hardnippled breasts there would be more to come after his requisite interval of rest and recovery he knew that she was ready to go on now moravia just returned from his latest trip to tokyo was assaulted by memories of his last night there spent with a girl named evan in all ways he realized he had just now attempted to duplicate his inchoate coupling with the extraordinary evan together they had celebrated his newfound endurance well into the small hours of the morning it was only when he had finally been sated that a discreet knock at the fusuma had announced the arrival of naoharu nishitsu moravia had noticed that as nishitsu passed her evan bowed so low her forehead touched the tatami just as if nishitsu had been the shogun of feudal japan when she raised her head moravia signed to her to close the fusuma much to his annoyance she had looked to nishitsu for confirmation of this command a minute incline of his head and she shut the sliding door the incongruity of the situation had not been lost on moravia nishitsu the traditionalist in neat western suit and tie and he a westerner in traditional silk kimono nishitsu had turned that eerie opaline eye on moravia and they went through the ritual of a formal greeting evan brought tea though it was not green tea and had not been handwhisked to a froth nishitsu nevertheless gracefully accepted a cup moraviasan my friend he said when the tea had been drained and evan had refilled their cups my apologies for disturbing your relaxation but it has been put to me that in a few days it will be your birthday this is true nishitsusan moravia said using the most respectful syntax but i am amazed that such an insignificant event would be of interest to you nishitsu had sat as still and erect as a toy soldier the teacup was lost in the palms of his callused hands hands that if one were any kind of a student of japan it was apparent had been assiduously exercised for years on karates wood stone metal and hot sand practice stations as you must be aware nishitsu had said markers of time passing have great significance for us and what more important marker is there than the day of ones birth we will have a night of celebration moravia bowed very pleased indeed thank you nishitsusan nishitsu gave the smallest of bows then rose and exited the room leaving the atmosphere charged with the residue of his presence and what a celebration his last night in tokyo had been evan had only been the appetizer he had been wined and dined by nishitsu and some of the inner circle of forbidden dreams then when the sky was turning from pinkblack to nacre the other members of their party either departed or dead drunk nishitsu had pulled him to his feet saying the celebration is not yet over moraviasan he and nishitsu had wrapped themselves in overcoats and had gone out into tokyo proper a taxi was waiting for him its automatic doors opened for him and he climbed in halfdrunk he had turned to see nishitsu standing at the kerb arent you coming not this time nishitsu had given him a rare smile enjoy yourself moraviasan happy birthday the doors closed and they took off the wind whipping in through the partially opened windows began to revive him so that by the time they slid to a stop he felt more himself he exited the taxi saw he was in a warehouse district near the sumida the smell of fish was very strong great lights burnishing the newly coloured sky just beyond the warehouse rooftops and he assumed he was near tsukiji tokyos mammoth fish market there was a woman waiting for him at the entrance to a warehouse one lone bare bulb dropped gold light at her feet lawrencesan he walked towards the woman recognizing her now minakosan she was a beautiful woman of indeterminate age whom nishitsu had introduced him to one night perhaps a year ago at a glittering restaurant high above the ginza she seemed unattached and curious about getting to know an american firsthand he had been flattered and in the manner of the japanese they had become friends there had been no sex but rather the comfort of trust far from home minako laughed when she saw his bewildered face poor lawrencesan she said being led from temple pillar to gatehouse post she took his arm companionably led him into the warehouse how has your birthday celebration been memorable he had murmured good then we mustnt disappoint you now they went up in a gigantic steel and chrome elevator the servos almost silent he could smell oil and disinfectant and wondered where he was the elevator deposited them on the third floor and minako took him down a hallway smelling of sawdust and hot machinery in a room rather smaller than he had expected in such a structure he saw a matteblack cube on a dolly unaccountably he was reminded of an illustration he had once seen of humpty dumpty sitting on his wall the cube was set with all manner of interfaces and a kind of led panel in front lawrencesan minako said i would like you to meet the oracle with that she pressed a miniature remote in her hand and as if at the unseen behest of a prestidigitator the oracle came to life greetings moraviasan came a voice that undoubtedly emanated from the matteblack cube i have awaited this moment for some time moravia had tried not to look startled out of the corner of his eye he could see a tiny smile curl minakos pressedtogether lips then he grunted annoyed at his momentary discomfort its some kind of recorded tape i must correct that surmise the oracle said although i am equipped to tape conversations and play them back on request moravia stared at the thing trying to fathom it but in truth he was struggling to understand the unknowable he had walked towards it tell me more about this thing he said to minako the oracle supplied the answer i was created from a combination of heuristic neurologic circuits and an entirely new technology called lapid lapid is an acronym for light wafer prism gate image data in other words enough minako said sharply then smiled these explanations are wearisome to everyone but the most fervid scientists moravia took another step forward peered into the face of the cube but what are you just what you are thinking the oracle said a life form out of the silence that ensued moravia said i am a life form you are not i suppose we can assume that you no longer believe you are conversing with an audio tape machine moravia didnt know whether to laugh in secret joy or at his own cupidity he stared silent at the oracle in any case it seems clear we are having a conversation the oracle said pleasantly a conversation yes with what moravia stupefied at being outwitted by the oracle could not bring himself to utter a sound are you talking to a rock a tree a blade of grass moraviasan have you lost your mind perhaps dont be ridiculous moravia had said before he could stop himself he bit his lip his face dark with the implications of this discussion i am a life form the oracle said but you arent life moravia had said you have no living tissue or organs inside you i think therefore i am the oracle said with simple but profound logic but in any case you are wrong here too moraviasan the lapid technology devised for me contains a quantity of human dna which i continue to break down and analyse so you see i do have life as you know it inside me fluttering like a butterfly inside a bell jar moravia had said softly what minako said because she hadnt heard precisely the oracle said because it had now moravia did smile so he said standing before the black cube as forcefully as a sumo what is it you think you can do for me what you want has already been done the oracle said with the air of a mischievous child and now here he was back in new york a spy in amber clinging to deliciously warm flesh awaiting his masters call making the best of his down time unwittingly nishitsu had opened the doors to an inner sanctum and moravia had absorbed all the information he could and still there had been more so much in fact that he had sent a coded fax demanding a facetoface debriefing this was a dangerous precedent certainly and against the strict regulations that had been explained to him upon his recruitment but he felt justified given the extraordinary nature of his latest information on the oracle that was when he felt something surely no more than a shadow fall across the periphery of his vision it was akin to the sensation one experiences falling asleep during the day and awakening at night perhaps he felt the prick of a needle but if so it seemed dull and far away nothing to do with him his eyes hooded and dulled in the aftermath of sex made out only a vague darkness as if out swimming in deep water he had been abruptly pulled downwards into a darkness thicker and more silent than he could imagine he awoke dizzy and sick to his stomach he had sampled enough drugs in his lifetime to know that something very powerful was swimming in his veins he tried to struggle against it but it was no use he turned his head noticed with a dull surprise that he was no longer at home but had been taken to his office abducted but surely one was not abducted to a place one already owned becoming aware of movement he turned his head again was rewarded by a slosh of vectors a wobbling of direction and dimension he was going to be sick he gagged tried to puke but he lacked the strength even for that it was a wonder the air was going in and out of his lungs he saw someone swimming like a manta towards him who great wings undulating wicked barbed tail fluttering up down up down moravia tried to scream then but there was something stuck in his throat no his mouth filled with soft cotton so much he could not bite down he tried to get it out gagged reflexively again could not manage to budge it how does it feel now a voice said male female he couldnt tell to be helpless moravia closed his eyes tried to use some of his newfound strength vitality endurance to break whatever interior bonds were holding him fast but succeeded only in accelerating his heartbeat to the point where the muscle began to pain him he squinted up at the mantas terrifying amorphous shape blinking again and again to clear his vision here let me help you lifted like a baby head cradled in a lap do you want to know who i am moravia then ill tell you just like i tell all of them all of who moravia thought dazedly every morning i pray to the gods for enlightenment because enlightenment breeds success there are those who would tell me that the gods will spurn me because i am unclean stained as i am by blood spilled at my own hands to them i say let the gods do what they may i have no control over what they may think or do but i will not cease my prayers in that i am pure a hand tenderly stroked his cheek and i am right moravia because i have known nothing but success he was rocked as he had been when he was a child this is all that i am what i have just told you the rest is just a gloss two arcs of rouge brushed into the cheeks before performing the important occasions in ones life a brush delicate as a butterflys passage against one cheekbone then another ones birthday perhaps or ones death lips soft as butter cold as a dewdrop pressed against his and then something as concrete as a fist had seized his heart clamping down on it with the strength of a god moravia screamed or rather struggled to scream his mind shredding like clouds before a chill north wind commanded him to scream but nothing appeared to work there was only the pain and now a pressure inside out insupportable that stilled one by one every element inside his helpless form that pumped sighed pulsed and finally thought book i inbetween days three can keep a secret if two of them are dead benjamin franklin one new york city on a night when thick ugly clouds hunkered across the full moon of late february wolf matheson was crouched on a rubblestrewn rooftop six storeys above the fetid swamp of east harlem it had been a long run nearly seven weeks longer than hed ever been on a case but now on this dank malodorous night wolf was certain he had run his quarry down just as he had brought to justice the three other serial killers whose cases had been handed to him by hayes walker johnson the commish a year ago when he had appointed wolf head of the nypds special homicide task force the werewolves as the force was quickly dubbed out of a mixture of respect and fear inside the department was an elite unit created specifically to direct wolfs talent for tracking down the worst form of psychotic murderer who could from either guile or utter randomness sometimes god help them all a combination of the two otherwise frustrate whole divisions of overworked city detectives wolf had first come to the commishs attention when he solved the murders of two prostitutes a mother and daughter the savagery of their particular deaths was grisly enough to get the attention of even the most jaded street bull but typical of the overworked department nothing was done until a tourist more or less the same age as the demised daughter was offed with the same mo prostitutes were so much street fodder but a tourist was after all a tourist and still represented the lifeblood of a city stumbling without the knowledge of those who ran it for their own benefit straight from first world to third world status the swiftly following meeting with the publicityminded hayes walker johnson as canny a black politician as ever held the office of commissioner confirmed what wolf already knew the case had become a top priority trouble was no one had a clue as to where to start the search for the killer but wolf at the end of that long day of visiting the scene of the second crime lying alone in his bed had known watching the flickering streetlight which in this city passed for starlight seep through his bedroom skylight he had slowly closed his eyes but not into darkness within the pellucid red glow of an inner heat he had seen the face of the murderer could smell his sourish stench sense his peculiar tread as light as a dancers had felt the insistent demand as debilitating as the pressure of an abscess of alien voices just as he had known the murderer did how he knew these things he could not say but he found his murderer within seventytwo hours and although already a lieutenant of some wide renown throughout the five boroughs of new york city wolf was instantly thrust into a media spotlight arranged to promote the commish the special homicide task force was a direct result of the publicity fallout of the successful conclusion of the case the commish had had to do something visible with his hero in fact to be perfectly fair he had wanted to reward wolf in some special way for sending his qrating his recognition among the populace soaring the nuts and bolts of forming the unit had given wolf time to think about his bizarre talent which considered in the new light of his rapid advancement must have been with him in some form or other all his life now alone on the rooftop waiting for his quarry to emerge into the darkness wolf crouched as still as one of those stone gargoyles guarding the rich safe in their oversized prewar apartments on the west side it was nearly four in the morning that time when all colour had drained out of the city a time when he and his quarries existed listening to the cacophony of voices and acting on their cries his tour of duty would not be over until he brought in his man or one of them was dead a far cry from his childhood games of hideandseek his favourite because he had never lost or was it he was on the edge of el barrio a burnedout festering canker that was nominally a part of new york city but which might just as well have been a section of calcutta for all its resemblance to any place in the modern metropolis that contained bloomingdales and st patricks cathedral swirling precipitation littered the sky in another less inimical clime it might have been snow but here it had picked up so many kinds of noxious hydrocarbons on its way down that the waxy flakes disintegrated on contact with the ancient iron and the potholed macadam nothing much was happening on the pavement below him sirens rose and fell streets worlds away dogs barked skirmishing with the homeless for scraps of food in the piles of litter along the gutters garbagecan fires burned here and there huddled shapes bent over them surrounded by supermarket carts piled high with scrounged junk further away a razed lot had been turned into a permanent reservation of cardboard tents their lopsided conical shapes throwing shadowy fingers into the clogged gutter an old man bare feet as white as maggots under the fizzing sodium lights picked his way through the broken green glass that served as the reservations border spying a rat in his path he hawked and spat a thick gob of phlegm guffawing as the rat went tumbling back into the darkness a piecedtogether black firebird waited at a no loading zone its exhaust rumbling softly opposite an old soupedup chevy with stylized flames painted on its sides revved then roared away from the kerb adding to the stink of the night air somewhere within that jungle of iron and fire his men bobby connor and junior ruiz were hidden in the specifics of his job wolf worked alone but he always had backups in the immediate environment in the event his quarry outran the perimeter of his own personal defence or of course killed him with men such as those he had been given a mandate to find one was obliged to consider all the worst possibilities wolf did not need to look at his watch time had become insubstantial irrelevant he was living inbetween days immersed in the inner language used by his quarries as they went about trying to make sense of a disordered and dysfunctional universe this time his quarry was a colombian named chucho arquillo a major player in narcotics bought from the cali cartel and arms which he had cleverly siphoned out of us military bases had arquillo graduated out of bigtime conduit to bigtime assassin or had he simply gone stone loco this was a question though intriguing not sufficiently central to the problem of locating him and bringing him in so that while wolf had turned it over in his mind like a crystal its facets had remained opaque much like the enigma of his own talent for unearthing the whereabouts of the citys most unappetizing and dangerous denizens there was no set time when arquillo would appear he would come when he would come and wolf would sense his approach as always after he had identified his quarry wolf knew the identity of arquillos next victim there was a synchronicity between victim and murderer he had found as if the stalker was somehow able to tap into the life pulse of the victim as unique as an individuals fingerprints and match his own pulse to the other identifying in some way with the victim with what was to come the cessation of breath sound heat life wolf closed his eyes thought he could sense both bobby and junior although in truth he couldnt be sure and wondered not for the first time whether his talent was genuine or merely some form of eerie parlour trick beyond his ken kill you maricone wolf turned his head towards the barked shout the movement in the street below saw a squat puerto rican with a barrel chest running after a lithe young man skin so black it glistened like oil in the light reflected off the rutted pavement the two men raced diagonally across the street through the sulphurous steam billowing up through an iron manhole cover and out the other side around the black firebird in their wake laughter rather than concern over the murderous intent from the spectators who lived in this brechtian theatre who had nowhere else to go when the curtain came down on the last act wolf felt something as of a puff of wind inside his mind as he became aware of arquillo he heard the snik of the gravity blade even though it came from very close at hand he did not turn his head he had the vivid premonition that as with a shark that had tasted blood any movement on his part would result in the commencement of an attack with which he could not effectively deal arquillo was crouched behind him a big man muscular with a sense of subliminal menace that like an oceans tide reducing cliffs to boulders and thence to the rubble of sand caused in those close to him the surge of primeval fear arquillo crept towards wolfs back secure in his safety in the shadows of the roof the stealth of his attack wolf felt the murderous intent as arquillo leaned forward tongue licking dry lips wait wolf whispered to himself wait at the last instant he spun already in a crouch and there was arquillo in motion handsome moustachioed face like a bull with the square shoulders and majestic bearing of a matador lunging towards his kidneys everything and everyone else was still wolf was acutely aware of a suspension of the snow swirling the bonfires in the reservation of new yorks damned the hiss of traffic over slick pavement the continuing altercation that might possibly be resolved by murder the bark of a dog denied its meagre scavenged meal in the slowness of time came magnification wolf swung to the side saw arquillos face distorted by hatred and the killing effort he saw his own reflection miniaturized in a bead of sweat hanging at the end of arquillos sideburn then from stillness there was motion an instant before the point of the knifeblade would have punctured his flesh wolfs right elbow crashed into arquillos forearm for a time they were locked in an almost immovable struggle veins popping hearts pumping desperately lunging surging with inhalation and exhalation muscles knotted pitted one against the other as bull and matador in the end come together locked in a dance of death the viscous snow whirled down all the harder hanging from his brows and eyelashes tasting of iron and cinders and then he gritted his teeth applied the last ounce of leverage he could manage in that next heartbeat the sharp sickening crack as the radius then the ulna splintered arquillos handmade gravity knife with which he had disembowelled three effete men the mules of a rival drug dealer exlovers or the connection between the four something unfathomable except in madness lay on the dark rooftop empty of menace as innocent as a childs finger arquillo slammed the heel of his good hand into the bridge of wolfs nose with sickening impact wolf took off after arquillo thinking of alerting bobby and junior via his throat mike but changing his mind as he swung open the metal door to the roof listened for five seconds gauging distance and direction of his quarrys flight took the iron stairs three at a time selfish of him to want arquillo himself but there was something undeniably intimate between the two of them now the stealthy approach the slow dance of death on the rooftop a personal challenge that swing at the kidneys the slap in the face that signals the intent to duel an affair of honour now the killing effort on arquillos face etched into wolfs memory the dark pupils fixed on death were what wolf imagined those three effete men had seen in the instant before arquillo had taken their lives the girl arquillo had been after this time lived on the fourth floor in a halfabandoned apartment scoured by fire more suited to the rats and roaches that nested in its darkest corners and yet wolf had discovered earlier tonight this girl had three mattresses stuffed with cash nothing smaller than fiftydollar bills evidence that arquillo wasnt stone loco but was motivated by business concerns perhaps but then why didnt he hire someone to off the competition why take the risk of doing the wet work himself unless it kicked him into gear wolf hit the door to the girls apartment at a run the wood not giving him as much resistance as the awful stench within of a graveyard overturned by an army of bodysnatchers his eyes watered as profusely as if someone had thrown formaldehyde in his face he heard the girl screaming and he thought this is what arquillo wanted to kill her after he had warned me of his presence once again he did not know how he knew this did not question the truth of it and just how arquillo had become aware of him was another question to ponder after arquillo had been taken into custody it was discomfiting to say the least for the watcher to be made aware that he had become the watched like a hound he could smell the blood thick and cloying like confetti at new years the taste filled his mouth making him want to gag he went swiftly from room to room dizzy with a surfeit of stenches and the mirror of the girls imminent death held up to him by arquillo as if the bastard knew how could he know of the link that drew wolf to him as surely as sonar brings a destroyer to a submarine rotting burlap used to keep the cold out of a heatless apartment slapped dolefully like the fitful thrashing of a child with night terrors wolf rounded a corner saw the thin cocoa hand fist really clutching burlap to bring it down or the body that belonged to it up he became aware of a rhythmic sound as of an engine labouring beneath a load too great for it but there was an obscene quality to it that he recalled from rookie days patrolling sleazy peepshows on eighth avenue cheap plywood floor and walls sticky with ejaculate and vaseline he was aiming for the body because a shot through the head would mean finis for them both wolf and arquillo because he very much wanted to take this one back alive even knowing that it was pride that pricked him now like a thorn a desire to drag this beast among miserable beasts into one police plaza like a trophy and make of him if not a spectacle then at least an example for the other monsters out there he thought of the romans then great warriors undefeatable in their heyday with their massive shields because arquillo was using the girl draped over him from shoulder to shin in just that way arquillos expression made him seem even more the bull his lips were pulled back from his teeth his breaths were coming in small excited pants and his eyes had that look people get when they are engaged in a private act his broken arm held the girl tight and on his face wolf could see that surge of endorphins killing any pain he might feel from the pressure he was exerting on it he didnt care about his own pain he had other things on his mind wolf hesitated fatal because maybe just maybe he had had a splitsecond when arquillos right temple was exposed and for a nypdcertified sharpshooter like wolf a high percentage risk even in this low light then the girl her face pale and pinched with pain and fear moaned and wolf saw that she was exsanguinating how far had arquillo gone with his butchers work it was impossible to say but the moral dilemma facing wolf was what if she had already lost so much blood that she would be doa no matter what action he took if he put his gun up put three shots into the human shield at close range to get at least one bullet into arquillo but that kind of thinking would never do no matter the circumstances arquillo gave him a wide grin just as if they had engaged in a hardfought but friendly round of golf and exposing a homemade hand scythe formed from three razor blades held the girl up by her hair sliced right across her throatneckspine onetwothree just like that severing her head from the rest of her and with a laugh tossing it like a bloody ball at wolf blood all over him wolf leaped past the decapitated girl reaching the window through which arquillo had exited he was on his way down already two floors below on the rusty fire escape that ran along the tenements spine like a scar that would never heal wolf moved but this time he raised bobby and junior on the mike gave them arquillos likely egress point from the building got him he heard bobbys tinny voice from the receiver in his ear canal he was almost to the second storey when he heard the shots a flurry of eruptions not so very out of place in this unquiet and unfriendly neighbourhood wolf hit the pavement running bent his shoe soles to the concrete of the garbagepiled alley he rounded a corner saw bobby connor kneeling over the prostrate form of junior ruiz said shit under his breath and then when he recognized the blank look in juniors eyes said more loudly where is he bobby stood up his hands were covered with juniors blood the two men looked as if they belonged in an abattoir he pointed mute with shock to a corner of the alley wolf went across kicked the body over chucho arquillos mahogany matadors face was covered with blood good work bobby he said i i didnt do anything lieutenant wolf hearing some hoarse and semihysterical note looked back at bobby what the hell is it look bobby said then swallowing hard look at the bastards face wolf turned back to arquillos corpse the dark face made so familiar to him over the past seven weeks as it hung in his mind like a black moon the blood still seemed to be bubbling out of wounds he could not see he knelt looked more closely really bubbling as if with a terrific heat that emanated from the inside of arquillos body he started had he seen the flicker of a flame dancing along the edge of the cheekbone but no that was impossible still he put a hand out over the face and felt a heat he could not explain wolf stood up and acknowledging bobbys reluctance to approach arquillos corpse came over to where he stood shivering bobby in his early thirties broadshouldered and strong with an open midwestern face paleblue eyes and sandy hair looked like he could use several stiff drinks wolf put a steadying hand on his shoulder just tell me what happened here he could see bobby struggling to maintain his composure said if youre gonna be sick do it theres no shame in it bobby nodded wiped the cold sweat from his brow said a bit shakily im all right lieutenant and when wolf nodded encouragement began again junior and i saw arquillo coming down and we identified ourselves he was already in shadow theres so much of it in here he shivered again as he looked around the black alley anyway after arquillo hit the ground everything seemed to happen at once and i dont know im not sure what happened we both had our guns out junior fired first and he thought hed gotten him he went into the shadows and i covered him then i heard two shots and junior was thrown back almost into my face he stopped there as if come to the end of his debriefing and then you saw arquillo wolf prompted bobby shook his head i saw something but i dont know what it was it was like a i dont know a fireball a blue fireball i heard a sizzle smelled jesus the smell was sickening then someone screamed arquillo im sure and he came staggering out of the blackness one arm was hanging like it was broken but the other hand was held to his face his burning face bobby blew out air very fast as if by these hearty exhalations he could rid himself of the memory wolf thinking of the heat the hint of a flame flickering along arquillos cheekbone at the periphery of his vision said i want you to think about this carefully bobby arquillo was on fire is that right bobby looked at him his face only his face sirens coming wolf could hear their familiar clamour even this far off he said gently then what happened then something went past me you mean someone yeah i guess to be honest lieutenant i dont know what the fuck it was it was dark and thick heavy you mean no bobby shook his head thick like syrup like a stew filling the alley it felt like it had suddenly got darker in here a cold sensation began to wind itself like a viper through wolfs belly he used his mind to search the vicinity for a new aura perhaps stronger even than arquillos but there was nothing not even a lingering afterscent the viper already having been awakened began to stir coiling and uncoiling restlessly bobby took another breath then the darkness lifted like and i turned saw someone heading out of the alley the guy i guess it was a guy had a car lieutenant a black firebird pieced together looked like shit beneath the shine someone was waiting for him to get by us wolf recalled seeing that car from his rooftop perch part of the background environment in motion any description at all on this person bobby think now i have lieutenant but i cant come up with anything i mean if i had to swear to it i wouldnt even know whether it was a man or a woman bobby sighed got a partial on the licence though that was great work wolf appreciated bobbys discerning eye but he also recognized the young mans need for positive reinforcement now not to mention his need to be busy get onto dmv now get them to clear the computers tell them to run the partial with your description of the car i want an answer inside an hour then he knelt beside junior ruiz afterwards wolf would remember that bobbys face was as pale and pinched as that of the girl arquillo had decapitated toughminded and as loyal as any terrier he had nodded darted away into the sharp acidwhite false dawn made by the revolving lights of the blueandwhites he or maybe junior his last call in had ordered up the lights bloomed and faded like nuclear flowers born and dying in the same brief moment at wolfs shouted commands the uniforms began to seal off the area some of them trooping dispiritedly into the tenement to hit the crime scene and round up any witnesses even so engaged they haphazardly broke windows rousted drunks and brought out their burnished nightsticks mainly he supposed because they were bored scared or both they had a life it was true but it was another kind of life unimaginable to civilians where the fear of being a target filled the days and nights like decay fills a rotten tooth through it all wolf still knelt holding junior ruizs wet head in his hands keeping it raised even when the mes men arrived as if even in death his man needed protection from the street the werewolves were headquartered in a rundown movie theatre in chinatown that had shown a stultifying succession of cheap racist kung fu films until a teen tong war more violent than any of the films had closed the place down its decomposing exterior hunkered on the decayed thoroughfare of east broadway like a ragged dog beneath the vibrating steel underside of the manhattan bridge there were large gaps now in the bridge where girders had rusted away leaving exposed timbers which were spirited away in the middle of the night to fuel the bonfires in the burgeoning communities of the homeless under the east river drive and elsewhere around the city wolf liked the anonymity of the location although he had been somewhat surprised that he hadnt been afforded space at one police plaza southwest of the theatre in fact commissioner hayes walker johnson had requested just such a spot and the werewolves would have been assigned a suite of offices there had it not been for the clandestine interference of chief of police jack breathard who did not like wolf or his swift accession into the stratosphere of the nypd breathard saw wolf as his one true rival in the department and as such deserving of every administrative snafu breathards machiavellian brain could throw at him seeing the interior of the dilapidated theatre for the first time wolf had decided to simply pull out all the seats plywood over the rotting threadbare carpeting and treat the space as if it were a loft dividing off cubicles for each of his staff providing a larger space near the front where the movie screen still hung as glossy as the hair of a forties film noir heroine the other walls however were still as dark as pitch with the spilled blood of young chinese wolfs repeated requests for a paint crew were still being rerouted by breathard after a necessary detour it was to this odd office that wolf and bobby connor headed when they had wrapped things up at the crime scene by that time dmv had got back to them there was no match between the partial licence plate number and the black firebird naturally stolen plates it was to be expected but you needed to run down every lead wolf and bobby went to see juniors wife and kid and bobby had watched mute and numb while wolf held the sobbing woman in his arms and had gently rocked her the kid eight years old had sat on a corner of the shiny couch holding a baseball bat in his hands saying nothing at all bobby had wondered what the kid might be thinking maybe smashing in the side of their heads for taking his daddy away from him this may not mean anything to you now maria bobby overheard wolf talking softly in idiomatic spanish to juniors widow but your man was brave he was doing something important making his force felt on the street thats something youll be able to tell julio when hes old enough to understand and it will change his life i dont know how you do it lieutenant bobby had said in the car on their way to the theatre i wouldntve known the right words to say were they the right words bobby wolf had stared straight through the windshield oblivious to bobbys weaving in and out of early morning truck traffic im glad you thought so werent they you calmed her down wolf had made no move it was this uncanny ability to lapse into utter stillness that often unnerved bobby as it unnerved wolfs quarries i dont know any more whether i believed what i said or whether it was just bullshit but you were right what you said wolf his mind on other matters burning faces the thickness of the dark vipers uncoiling in his gut said maybe in time but for right now the only thing that matters is that juniors dead bobby had waited a moment thinking as he steered around a newspaper van no lieutenant he had said at last what matters is that juniors dead and his murderer is still at large there was an overpowering sense of gloom at the office someone had thrown junior ruizs photo up on the screen as a kind of memorial he looked wideeyed considerably older than his twentynine years and so serious youd never know without having spent time with him how funny he could be wolf went to his cubicle sat back in his metalandvinyl swivel chair and thought about just how much he despised his life when had he come to the conclusion that the city was no place for him last week last month or last year he was sick of living in the soft yellow underbelly of a rotting metropolis patrolling its filthstrewn byways inbetween days his head filled with the monstrous voices of his quarry my god he wondered how had a boy who had grown up in elk basin wyoming got himself into this particular sewer he closed his eyes he knew why he had fled elk basin the truth was he didnt want to think about it the reality was he was here now and he damn well better decide what he was going to do about it live in the sewer all his life or or what lieutenant bobby connors voice not now bobby backed off rank aside there was something uniquely formidable about wolf matheson with his highcheekboned face straight brushedback hair and curiously shaped eyes the colour of cinnamon beyond anything physical however he possessed an intensity of bobby was not sure of the right word stillness maybe that set him apart from anyone else bobby had come in contact with wolf his breathing slowed deepened had too much to think about such as who had killed arquillo and junior ruiz for that matter it was easy to say that in the dark arquillo had wrestled juniors piece from him and had shot him but was that what had really happened wolf projecting himself back into the alley junior ruizs blood covering him had in fact felt the residue of his slain mans aura like a teardrop left behind on a jilted lovers cheek and he knew knew that junior had not been shot by arquillo who then had taken his piece from him turned it on him pointblank bobbys anthropomorphic shadow figure thick as syrup scary as shit and who had been waiting for the shadow in that piecedtogether black firebird and how in the hell had this shadow managed to conceal its aura from him it was becoming clear to him as it should have in the instant he had seen the blood bubbling as thick as syrup upon arquillos proud mad matadors face that this investigation was something more than any of his others he tried to think but his mind was cluttered with images of the girl arquillo had decapitated not innocent surely but what sin was grievous enough to deserve such butchery images of juniors eyes like copper pennies already patinaed images of his widow who had known because every cops wife waits for it fears it why he had appeared at her front door in the grim light before dawn and most vividly images of the eerie fire that had come simmering up from inside arquillo he had better listen to himself the clutter a clear indication of how far this mystery was pushing his emotions around here is your mind held in one gnarled weather beaten hand and here is your body the other hand held a forearms span from the first the young wolf had watched with a combination of fascination and dread as the old man had brought his two hands together at first they seemed to be moving so slowly but at the end they came together so swiftly and with such a force that the resulting sound as sharp startling asa sudden thunderclap had caused wolf to jump and in the aftermath the familiar jingling of the carved animals bear bison hawk and wolf on the old mans beaded bracelets the old man had smiled as if he enjoyed startling his grandson in the place where he dwelled the smells heady and pungent of hide tanning into leather the ashes of a fire and herbal oils too exotic and complex for the child to identify combined to make wolf lightheaded the old mans smile had turned benevolent you do not believe me that is good belief in anything especially yourself can only come over time he had reached out so that his thin long fingers settled over wolfs shoulders they were strong those fingers and wolf remembered their strength as he remembered few other things in his past now settle yourself his grandfather had said fixing the boy in his careful gaze wo this way keep your back still like that yes very still he was a tall handsome man and though not particularly bulky wolf imagined him to be the largest man on earth perhaps the child was responding to the old mans aura which was formidable wow observe soon you will cease to feel your body in a moment there is only your mind gorged with the chaos of youth are you happy with this running running and never thinking how could you be only in the stillness of thought can decisions be properly made think of a mountain or a tree how still they are when you become as still as a mountain or a tree you will at last be able to think it had taken the young wolf a long time to understand what his grandfather had meant kineticism was such an integral part of his life as it was his fathers wolf always playing baseball hideandseek running races seeing his endurance and strength multiply as he ran with the wind river shoshones on the marathon races so important to them a reminder of a past they could no longer remember wolf started opening his eyes had he fallen asleep or was he still being haunted by the old man haunted by something for certain matheson wolf stared up at the wide black moustachioed face of jack breathard chief of police and in wolfs estimation an exceedingly dangerous man breathards small yellow eyes were as cold as a meat locker though his wide mouth was smiling in that practised expression only those in media or comfortable with it could muster breathard a big man by any standard you cared to name loomed over wolf like the ogre just slid down jacks beanstalk hows it goin going just fine chief this said neutrally but somewhat warily because breathard was far too busy to waste his time with idle chatter heard you lost a man this morning shot with his own service revolver his face had taken on the expression of a stern schoolmaster thats not the kind of news we like to disseminate to the press ill pass your rebuke on to junior ruizs widow breathards tree trunk arms went rigid as he leaned over pressed his palms onto wolfs desk now look here wise ass i dont take shit like that from anyone hear any time a man of mine is killed in the line of duty its bad enough killed with his own gun stinks you know my meaning it makes us seem incompetent we already have enough shit shovelled at us by civilians in the way of charges of brutality racism graft and protectionism without this kind of crap i can see your point wolf said while grinding his teeth no you fucking well cant mr bigshotbringemindeadoralive he lifted his hands off the desk pointed a sausagelike forefinger at wolf you may be the commissioners fairhaired white boy but you aint mine i got my eye on you matheson im just waiting for you to fuck up so i can get you out of here fill this place with my people you got any of my people here you know squire richards works for me one breathard lifted the forefinger as if by this gesture he could test the tenor of the atmosphere one of my people on a staff thats how big six all told wolf dutifully provided though he knew damn well breathard was the first to keep track of such things one in six matheson not a justifiable percentage of afroamericans not fucking justifiable at all i pick the best people chief you know that i know thats the bullshit you put out i know the commish buys it breathard said but i dont he nodded i got two of my best people washington and white just waiting to get in here even out the odds i know them both wolf said ones failed his detectives exam twice the other i hear was caught by his precinct captain shaking down store owners thats a lie honky shit detective exam results are a matter of record wolf said and whites precinct commander is a friend of mine i know who bullied him into burying the shakedown he leaned back in his chair besides my manpower manifest is full breathards yellow eyes darkened sure as shit matheson somethings gonna happen here and when it does im goin to be the one who comes in cleans up this mess he gave wolf his best sneer who knows maybe this ruiz fiascos just what ive been looking for he didnt wait for wolf to reply but turned on his heel and went out wolf watching breathards linebacker figure disappear into the theatres haze let his breath out in a hiss he supposed the man as corrupt as the mayor the city council and all the rest of the macho politicos who ran the city hated the fact that wolf was directly responsible to hayes walker johnson the commish being out of the chainofcommand loop in this one instance didnt sit well with him his virulent racist leanings needless to say never made it up to the commishs or the mayors level with them he was the very model of an impartial arbiter the calm voice of reason he was a cool customer like a moray eel he would be passive invisible for long stretches of time until you just about forgot he existed thats when he took his opportunity to pop up like a deathshead and tried to put the fear of god into you wolf pushed himself away from the desk stood he found himself looking up into the largerthanlife face of junior ruiz up on the movie screen take that down he said sharply because it was reminding him of how much there was left to do even after he had run arquillo down there was still the same shit to deal with the ever multiplying amount of work it never ended on the contrary it continued to grow like a cancer out of control and for the first time he found that idea intolerable the confluence of body and mind the inner stillness necessary for both thought and action of consequence began for wolf with aikido being by nature kinetic he required a conduit for his energy but he also needed a discipline so that he could discern the essential stillness within even the most violent burst of movement this discipline he found within aikido a harmony of mind and body control that revealed to him the form of intrinsic energy the circular forces within everyone that could be used against an opponent the essence of martial arts for wolf was not in being able to put his fist through a concrete wall but in being a practitioner of ken the stillness of the mountain to harness intrinsic energy bringing to heel the agents of chaos his mind weary with questions without answers his body not tired remarkably never tired no matter how hard he pushed it he purged himself with aikido he put himself through a rigorous set of movements of centralization extension and evasion the trine of the disciplines function of selfdefence aikido actually refined such instinctive responses as heading directly into an attack to finding ways to evade the attack while using its energy to guide it away from you he took on as many of his werewolves as he could cajole onto the hardwood floor he had had installed in the balcony since most were either leaving their night shift or coming in for the day shift his opponents were limited to three bobby connor squire richards and tony three times tony three times his real name was pugnale but since he had stuttered as a child no one called him that was strong but impulsive given to taking chances even when he suspected he was being suckered into reacting he had almost as much stamina as wolf but in the end wolf took him down by feinting a blow to the left side of his head when tony reacted grabbing at wolfs shirt as he extended himself forward wolf used two tenkan spinning first to his right pulling tony momentarily offbalance then to his left as he did so he grabbed tonys right wrist with his left hand and bowed low pulling tony up and over him so that he flipped over sprawled on the floor immobilized by wolf squire richards a black man as big as any stevedore was as lithe as a panther his bulk was deceiving he could outrun any of the werewolves with the exception perhaps of wolf squire liked contact so much that he could wear down an opponent who might otherwise be able to figure out a way to defeat him wolf worked with him for perhaps ten minutes before it appeared to squire that wolf was tiring squire took the opportunity presented him grabbing wolfs right wrist with both hands for an immobilization wolf waited until the last split instant before pivoting to his left this dragged squire with him his momentum carrying him forward lifting wolfs arm up over his head wolf planted his left foot transferring his balance as he turned his lower body to the right sliding beneath squire and dropping to one knee reaching up and back for squires hands locked on his wrist and pulling hard forward squires feet left the floor as he tumbled over wolfs ducked head onto the floor in front of wolf bobby was another matter entirely not as strong as wolf he was a serious thinker who conceived the most remarkable combination of moves to defeat opponents even more advanced than he was wolf got him down by using the ikkyo the first and simplest of immobilization techniques using a firstlevel circular irimi on bobbys left arm to twist it up over his head bringing him to his knees wolf spent the next hour instructing the three of them on how he was able to use their own weaknesses to defeat them by the time he showered he found that he was famished he was about to take bobby out to breakfast when a call came in from the commish who wanted to set up an immediate briefing im not at the office hayes walker johnson said in wolfs ear come to my brownstone but not the front way in fact i want you to use the entrance i use when im ducking reporters no one knows about it except a few of the brass so keep it to yourself wolf and bobby took one of the unmarked werewolf cars a medallioned yellow cab its top spraypainted with infrared dye that could be tracked by a helicopter that innovation was wolfs idea and he could think of at least two times they would have lost their quarry had it not been for this link invisible to the human eye between types of police vehicles as bobby drove wolf speculated on the meet usually the cases the commish wanted wolf to work on were faxed over from his office a facetoface briefing was rare the same thing must have been on bobbys mind because he said must be some important murder victim involved probably something political that the commish can make headlines with the commishs brownstone was in the east eighties a perk he had insisted on when james olivas the mayor wooed him to nyc from houston wolf directed bobby to swing around onto the street one block south of the building and he pulled over parked without putting out the police business sign commishs orders this meet was strictly hush which was no doubt why the commish was going to get to the office late this morning wolf led bobby into the basement entrance of a sedate wellgroomed greystone as johnson had predicted the black iron gate was closed but unlocked and they went through it the door just beyond in the minuscule cement courtyard was the same and they took a long walk down a perfectly straight dimly lit corridor smelling pleasantly of aromatic pipe smoke and some heavy cloth perhaps velvet at the end of the windowless corridor was an oldfashioned wooden door with a glass panel frosted and etched that allowed what appeared to be outdoor light inside wolf opened the door found himself in the rear garden of the house a pair of bald english plane trees arced overhead guarding privet and boxwood whitepainted boxes for annuals rimmed the perimeter their earth turned over waiting for the sun at the far end of the garden a twelvefoot fence of some basketlike material had been erected there was a door in this fence but had johnson not described its location to wolf he would not have known it was there he pushed the door open bobby following close behind and they found themselves in the back yard of hayes walker johnson the commish mature honey locusts their long branches reaching upward were underplanted with sheared ilex and holly still glossy green beyond an ancient wisteria as gnarled as a brawlers fist wound itself up the brownstones fourstorey facade the commish was waiting for them at his back door beckoning them across the brown grass and fieldstone pathway a bandylegged man with skin the colour of milk chocolate his cheeks were dusted with black birthmarks he had small inquisitive eyes offset by a telegenic smile that could put anglos if not latinos at ease this was no doubt more due to the colour of his skin than it was to his manner in his dark suit white shirt and regimental striped tie he looked quite formidable he ushered them into a kitchen area sunlit and homey with that livedin and loved air that could not be replicated by money or an interior designer good of you to come the commish said just as if he had issued an invitation that had been in jeopardy of being refused heard about your man going down wolf sorry about that then added its always hard isnt it without expecting an answer but at least arquillos taken care of he waved them to a dark wood refectory table that dominated this section of the woodpanelled kitchen it was covered with food hot and cold the commish mindful of the hour considerate of his heroes just coming off shift as they sat wolf thought apparently word had not got out about the strange fire that had consumed arquillos face he had told bobby not to include that strange bit of info in his written report and to say nothing of it to anyone which was just fine by bobby he was too busy right now to wonder why he had ordered bobby to do those things standing at the head of the table like a patriarch at thanksgiving johnson apparently anxious to show his avuncular side loaded up their plates with smoked salmon curried chicken lobster salad from a drawer hidden at his end of the table he took a bread knife sliced a loaf of freshbaked seeded rye help yourself to juice and coffee or i can make you decaf espresso he said wolf noticed he made himself a double espresso but no food at all he allowed them perhaps ten minutes to make appreciative noises over his breakfast before he got down to business i for one am damn glad this arquillo thing is wrapped up he said because what ive got now for you is top priority he handed over a buff folder someone iced lawrence moravia last night in his own office no less pranced right through moravias vaunted security did the deed and split without a trace the autopsys being done even as we speak he nodded at the folder tell me what you think hayes walker johnson slowly drank his way through three cups of his double espresso while wolf and bobby read the file this is what they learned lawrence moravia a multimillionaire before he turned twentyfive was an anomaly in new york city a selfmade man from brooklyn moravia whose immigrant parents never spoke fluent english had built himself a burgeoning real estate empire to rival those of the helmsleys and the kalikows but lawrence moravia was the exception to the rule instead of making deals with the city to infringe on its already diminishing air space he took his tax breaks and created desperately needed middle income housing in part he could do this with a good deal of costeffectiveness because of his ties to the japanese he had spent a number of years in tokyo learning alternative construction and management techniques and up until his murder had continued to shuttle back and forth between new york and tokyo with some frequency to keep himself current and to fulfil the complex but enigmatic obligations of friendship so important to the japanese increasingly polarized into a city of the elite rich and the abject poor new york in the decade of the eighties and the early nineties was dying from an exodus of the middleclass who were fed up with the escalating costs of rents essential services and taxes frightened by dark and forbidding neighbourhoods overrun by teenage drug pushers and the homeless moravia sought to change all that on a scale that could make some real difference until last night he was murdered in his office on the top floor of a fifth avenue skyscraper he owned he had been shot twice in the back of the head with what appeared to be a mm gun in classic execution style and the only fact immediately apparent was that it had been a thoroughly professional hit no murder weapon had as yet been found no fingerprints except those of the deceased and those of his assistant and secretary moravias security people who had discovered the body had been careful not to touch anything on first glance the only thing close to being odd was that moravia had been found with his cheeks rouged but this was new york and after a while almost nothing seemed odd bobby was still scanning the last page of the report when wolf said there must be more to it than just this otherwise you couldve faxed me this file hayes walker johnson put down his cup on the surface this guy was golden and i do mean golden he probably meant more to the revitalization of this city than anybody else i can think of but something wasnt kosher with him i got a call from the cme himselfearly this morning on prelim he says moravia didnt die from the bullets in his brain maybe hes got to do some sophisticated toxicological tests the commish sighed in any event this isnt the clean hit it appears to be and i want you to find out what is going on before the shit hits the fan and believe me unless you can close this down immediately its going to in a big way because and lets take the simplest answer if moravia was a user his close ties with highranking members of the city government are going to rock the areas economy to its foundations given moravias rep and influence as a dealmaker i can guarantee you that his shit is going to become our shit and it will cast a long ugly shadow the pullout of new business weve been trying to coax back into the city will take on the impetus of a stampede we cant allow that our economic survival is in the hands of these people wolf sat back while bobby returned the last page to the folder and closed it the commish took it out of bobbys hand wolf watching how carefully hayes walker johnson guarded the file imagined he knew why he hadnt received it by fax in other words you want this covered up wolf said i want it cleaned up the commish held up his hands do it any way you want wolf just make sure you get to the bottom of it asap i dont want the media to get wind of any dirty laundry his watch beeped and he glanced at it i got a meeting in five any other questions as he got up i want a paint crew wolf said im sick of seeing the blood on my office walls you got it hayes walker johnson said just call my office and no wolf said pinning him with his eyes tomorrow morning first thing im not handing any more requisitions to your office handle this yourself ill do that the commish said his telegenic smile almost wiped away the chronic apprehension in his eyes just get this job done quickly neatly and on an eyesonly basis so we can all breathe a little easier okay back on the street having left via the circuitous way they had entered bobby climbing in behind the wheel of the cab said what do you think the real story is he fired up the engine to get some heat into the interior wolf about to answer paused it occurred to him that he didnt really much care what johnsons own motivation was and this concerned him even a month ago it would have been an intellectual puzzle he would have pored over until he had unearthed the answer he wondered what was happening to him whether he was going a little crazy the power he had been given was sought after by every member of the nypd he regularly gave audiences not only to the citys chief prosecutor but to the states attorney general both of whom treated him as if he were some sort of guru giving them advice on how to pursue the convictions of the most dangerous felons in short he was living the dream of every person who entered law enforcement he had worked hard to get to this place of privilege and yet now that it was his he was beginning to realize he no longer cared about it what was the matter with him maybe he just needed some sleep the arquillo hunt had been in its final stages and he hadnt slept in thirtysix hours now this lets get over to moravias apartment he said as bobby threw the cab in gear but moravia was iced at his office i think wed better get a sense of the man before we visit a crime scene thats likely to be sterile lawrence moravia had lived on the top floor of a new condo he had built on central park south the building catered to arabs and japanese his quarters took up the entire floor holy jesus bobby exclaimed when a uniform guarding the door let them in wolf said nothing bobby had said it all moravias apartment house was a better description though somewhat less than adequate seemed endless room after room replicated itself before them all decorated in the most exquisite and expensive taste all looking out on one half of manhattan island from up here wolf thought you could almost convince yourself that new york was as glittery and majestic as it appeared in this picture postcard view that there were no monstrous deeds being perpetrated even as you looked out on its streets you were so high up you wouldnt even hear the squad car sirens but in truth the panorama sickened wolf he had had experience in the pyrrhic value of a lofty dispassionate perspective of monstrous deeds bobby ran his hand along the missoni fabric covering a vast semicircular couch i dont know about you he said but i wouldnt mind having a tenth of this guys dough wolf stared out of the windows at the gleaming towers of manhattan the stink of el barrio might have been on another planet see what you can turn up here ill hit the rear of the apartment wolf made no sound as he went from room to room the place had that decorated look that made the rooms appear as if no one lived in them the perfection and harmony of the colours patterns styles of furniture set his teeth on edge so much money had been spent in furnishing this vast space but it was a place to look at rather than to inhabit it occurred to wolf that he was looking at a video image an advertisement perhaps meant to sucker you into parting with your hardearned bucks he tried to imagine lawrence moravia moving through these rooms what did he do here did he put his feet up on the highly polished mahogany burl deco table did he drip ice cream on the ayard fabric of this stylish but uncomfortablelooking chair did he leave hair and dandruff in the handcarved jade sherl wagner sink who cleaned this place it was a job for hercules the master bedroom seemed as large as half a football field like the other rooms it was filled with artwork by minimalists whose names flavin and lewitt meant nothing to wolf neither did their work there was a circular whirlpool spa set in the floor near the window that looked north over the bleached bare trees of central park a vast skeleton dropped down into the centre of bleak manhattan wolf climbed into the spa stared out the window what had lawrence moravia thought of while he had soaked in the steaming water perhaps if he was not alone in the spa he had thought of nothing wolf got out went over and stretched out on the bed it faced a blank wall not the picture window why it was important before the data of any murder case began to accrete to scope out the victims psychological profile without knowing what was important to the victim the incoming data could be ineffective or worse lead you in the wrong direction what did moravia look at when he was in bed wolf got off the bed looked at the blank wall it was perfectly featureless different somehow from the other painted wall in the room as if someone had sanded it down for some reason between the wall and the bed was a small table on it was an electronic object of some kind wolf switched it on saw it was a sharp flatvision tv that projected its picture onto the smooth wall below it was a vcr and a laserdisc player wolf bent down extracted the first halfdozen laser disc titles these would be moravias favourites being on the top eyes without a face in the realm of the senses mдdchen in uniform the mask psycho woman in the dunes wolf knew some of the films read the synopses on the jackets of the others the bizarre themes of dual personalities and kinky sex linked them all not your typical home film library he thought replacing the discs but already he had a better sense of lawrence moravia than he had got from reading the avalanche of police paperwork on the case he went to the wall that contained moravias wardrobe and slid open one mirrored door after another suits from brioni and armani handmade shirts from ascot chang off the rack from comme des gargons ties from sulka and frank stella wolf paused curious it was as if he were looking at the wardrobes of two distinct men one conservative the other loose highfashioned he thought about the duality theme that ran through the storylines of the films moravia obviously liked best to watch he felt it now it was as if this place had been inhabited by two men not one he moved on encountered a series of japanese kimonos exquisitely embroidered with feudal devices cranes peony blossoms pine trees the snaking path of a shimmering river something here what the fantastic images seemed to shiver as a small breeze stirred the silks and wolf turned back into the room to find the source his hand went to his gun and he pulled it out he went all around the perimeter of the bedroom he stuck his head into the adjoining marbled bathroom he was alone what was out of sync what was he missing or was he imagining things he closed his eyes not into darkness but into the glow from the heat emanating from the core of him he could see lawrence moravia see the muzzle of the gun as it was placed against the back of his neck but there was no struggle no wildly beating heart in fact there was nothing at all no emanation no aura no face to go with the killing again he thought of kneeling in the alley with the corpse of junior ruiz knowing junior hadnt been killed by arquillo but finding no trace of any other aura feeling nothing but the slither of the vipers cold and clamorous for attention so in this the commishs info had been correct the two bullets to the base of moravias head had penetrated an already dead brain who had murdered moravia and why why make it look like a mob hit from which world had his murderer come the straightandnarrow world of brioni suits and business lunches at the staid four seasons or the twilight world of the sexually bent in the realm of the senses wolf had got no clear signal but on instinct he was willing to bet on the latter he returned to the bedroom back inside the wardrobe he stood for a moment feeling again the press of cool air he went past the suits stared hard at the kimonos felt again the small but discernible pulse of air on impulse he passed his palm across the kimonos silken fronts they moved he pushed them aside felt the breath of air more clearly he knelt down and saw what before he had missed behind them was a crack of dim light putting his hand against the crack he felt the stirring of air knew this was what had ruffled the edges of the kimonos he reached out opened an almost seamless doorway set into the back wall of the wardrobe stooping he went through and found himself in a small room no more than a rather large cell there was a distinct scent faint but still discernible it was musky herbal unfamiliar but not at all unpleasant his hand found a light switch and he flipped it on the room was so sparsely furnished it could have doubled as a monks cell a reed mat sunk flush with the floor in one corner an antique carved standing mirror against the opposite wall a hibachi a japanese wood and copper grill nearby charcoal residue in it showing that it had been used a seemingly authentic knights armoured helmet and a pair of long doeskin gloves sat on one corner of the hibachi an antique oriental rug was rolled up along another wall there were no windows no doors but the walls were hung with large blackandwhite photographs blowups meticulously and lovingly printed as if they were themselves artwork the photos were variations on a single theme sexual bondage nude female forms one could not accurately say bodies since the faces were never shown but were always twisted away from the camera lens were tied with cord not merely wrists and ankles but artfully patterned cords striping the flesh of breast belly thigh and crotch the lighting caressed the naked flesh as would a lover lending a threedimensional quality a kind of innocent yearning to the images as if there was hidden amid these grotesque fleshscapes a hunger for forbidden knowledge all the photos were highly charged with either erotic or pornographic content depending on your point of view in any case they were shocking were they insulting alarming or merely outrageous wolf suspected that a coherent case could be made for any one of the three but in a sense wolf took in all of these eerie sadomasochistic elements with only a portion of his mind filing them away for future reference in the end he was obliged to concentrate on the object in the centre of the room an eightfoot sculpture hulked there seeming even larger and more hideous in the close dense atmosphere of the cubicle it was constructed of trapuntoed fabric kimono silks wolf noted almost absently and black leather strips affixed to sheets of burned twisted metal like the photos it was disturbing and fascinating all at once like witnessing some disaster bringing out all the worst instincts in the human soul it had a title engraved on a small brass plaque art or death or wolf thought in lawrence moravias case art and death he bent down to take a close look at the plaque noticed a tiny corner of white wedged beneath the sculpture he pulled it out without difficulty it was a bill for the piece very recent a week ago on top was the name of an art gallery down on the lower east side alphabet city he folded it put it in his pocket wolf took the unmarked cab uptown to morningside heights parked illegally on broadway near th street ive got to get out of here he had told bobby back at moravias get back to the office and brief tony send him to sit on the me get everything he can from him meet me back here at nine tonight now he slapped the police business sign on the dashboard climbed the steps onto the campus of columbia university he had come to love this oasis of plazas ivied walls narrow walkways smelling of bricks and books not the least of the reasons being that amanda taught here as he approached the redbrick building she taught in he thought about their first meeting just over a year ago he had caught sight of her as she rushed across the campus notebooks crammed under her left arm a battered pigskin courier case clutched in her right fist he had been up here investigating the murder of two barnard girls who had been strangled and raped in that order the me had confirmed he had followed her to a classroom and had stopped a student on his way in minutes later in the registrars office he had produced his badge asking for the class schedule of professor amanda powers it wasnt until he had tracked down the morningside heights monster as the new york tabloids called him that he had had a chance to take the time to return to her classroom he had waited for the end of the seminar she was teaching then had contrived to bump into her as she was emerging from the classroom in order to properly apologize he asked if he could buy her a cup of coffee he could remember the coffee and doughnuts ordered at a nearby restaurant the laughs they had shared she had surprised him attracted to her physically he had perhaps expected her to be an utterly seriousminded academician instead he had found a funloving free spirit fearless in questioning academic tradition who was therefore constantly in trouble with her departmental head but her transgressions were always excused because of her success with her students he went into her classroom now sat down in the last row watched her as she lectured to her students on the social responsibilities of mass communication amanda had a phd in sociology and the postmodern extrapolations of her field never ceased to fascinate her her ability to bring her subject alive was evidenced by the fact that her courses were among the first to be fully subscribed at the beginning of each semester wolf often thought that she was far too clever to spend her life teaching but then he would visit her seminars and witness the galvanizing effect she had on her students and he would have to change his mind amanda was of medium height blonde hair blunt cut just above her square shoulders she had a wide laughing mouth searching grey eyes and the kind of peachy complexion most new york women would kill for he was certain when they had met that she was in her early thirties and had been somewhat astonished to discover subsequently that she was a decade older than that she lived in a university apartment in morningside heights that was pleasant enough highceilinged with lots of light from the south and west but wolf did not trust the neighbourhood despite attempts at gentrification in the eighties it had slipped back into the armed and dangerous category as far as the nypd was concerned the seminar over the students began to file slowly out there was already a line to talk to amanda but as wolf stood up she saw him made her excuses to the students and came up the central aisle smiling she put her arm through his leaned happily against him as they walked out onto the campus grounds he put her coat around her shoulders the weather had cleared and it was mild for february the sunshine less watery than any new yorker might expect what a surprise she said kissing him now that they were out of sight of her students i thought youd be home in bed at this hour of the morning the only bed id like to be in now wolf said is yours she laughed quickening her pace past the ivyclad brickwork ill race you there this must be the worlds oldest dance amanda whispered light as pale and thick as milk spilled through the oldfashioned venetian blinds striping them both a shadow arched over one naked breast spilled down her belly where wolfs mouth moved in concert with the beat of her heart she stood on tiptoe knees bent still and shivering at the same time ice and fire churning through her while she whispered to him words only he understood hips canted forward she bit her lip wanting this to go on and on but she wanted something more and she curled down twining herself with him bringing them both up together already her thighs were trembling so strongly she had to reach up grab hold of him her breasts rose and he took first one then another in his mouth laving the nipples until she gasped he pulled her off her feet turning her slowly as she let go of him so that her back arched like a cats and her buttocks curved into his groin wolf curled one arm around her waist the other across the swell of her breasts her thighs opened and she locked her ankles behind his knees she reached down rubbing him against the hot liquid core of herself using both hands to stroke him until she felt a shudder ripple through his heavy muscles then she fitted him to her felt him arch his hips up and the wet connection sliding all the way up her so that she felt a rush of blood radiating up through her chest into her brain she convulsed on him and groaning closed her eyes letting her head fall back onto the rock of his shoulder while he jolted her over and over with a pleasure she could feel all the way to her fingertips oh my god she heard her voice escaping from her like helium from a balloon an odd sound erotic in its own right so that she heard herself whispering more more dont stop ohhh then she felt it rising like a wind before the onset of a storm because in her mind she was standing in a midwest plain watching a black funnel descending from heaven heading her way she could feel it moving like an animal or at least something animate this mysterious ecstatic force emanating from her lover and it transformed her world she was dimly aware of the curtains billowing like clouds on a summers day the sweep and curl of her bedspread like surf on a brilliant beach the door to her closet halfopen the interior bathed in the soft twilight of a long languorous septembers day all images from her past stamped with the sweaty heat of the moments eroticism all extensions of the ecstasy welling in waves through her so that her immediate environment was transmogrified her pleasure increasing exponentially until she reached down dizzy with lust and cupped him drew him up inside her even more that last inch bringing a sharp cry from her halfopen lips a deep heartfelt moan from him that took her over the top on the bed he stayed inside her a long time as he always did because she liked to feel his strength his pulsing the ebbing of that thrilling force the whirling funnel on the horizon sweeping her up in its dark arms that came only from him she imagined unconsciously because he had never mentioned it to her and gradually the softening that often she could do something about this time however she turned him over on his back knelt astride him friendly as a sister now and gently stroked his forehead the warm colours of the apartment enclosed them the curtains and blinds obscuring the grillelike extension of the fire escape just beyond panda he said softly it was an old family nickname given her by accident by her younger sister stevie who early on had had difficulty pronouncing the am sound in her name whats the matter she kissed his cheek he looked up at her with his heavylidded cinnamon eyes how do you know theres anything the matter she smiled for one thing you came onto campus while i was working you havent done that since we first met what do you mean i ran into you by accident oh come on wolf dont you think i have friends in the registrars office he was genuinely surprised you mean you knew all along that our first meeting was a setup she nodded and you never said anything i thought it was sweet she kissed him lightly again and terribly romantic besides i didnt want to spoil your triumph and i thought id been so clever seeing his expression she laughed again you shouldnt have used your badge people tend to remember that kind of thing especially on campus he grunted and she knew he was filing the information away in that very clever brain of his she smiled not unkindly men are so vain they think the world revolves around them that the secret of life is to control everything thats not what i want amanda put her palms against his chest lowered herself so that her face was very close to his what do you want to control why should i want to control anything because darling thats what men find most exhilarating and most fearsome and what are women most afraid of thats simple she said age youre kidding thats one thing women never kid about i never considered it a subject to think about you wouldnt its easier for you men isnt it you grow old and all you need do is look for a young woman to hang on your arm she tossed her head and what happens to us wolf thinking of his father touched her firm body skin as smooth as satin breasts as firm as a twentyyearolds well you have nothing to worry about youre certainly not growing older we all are she twisted her fingers through the spaces between his im no longer young i look at myself in the mirror sometimes and wonder i dont know maybe what i feel is the years rushing away from me like a river and what i really want to do is reach out and hold back the flow she gave a little laugh but just the same she buried her face in the hollow of his shoulder wolf stroked her hair you cant do that panda he said kissing her gently no one can of course i know that but still i want oh i wish i was younger maybe what you need is a good hot affair with a younger man thats just what i have im three years older than you are she passed a finger over the line of his jaw wolf she whispered hoarsely you look so beautifully young no older than thirty thats ridiculous panda listen to me time passes for everyone be happy youre here three hundred years ago you might have been dead already now theres a comforting thought she sighed closing her eyes so that he felt the butterfly brush of her lashes against his skin then in a furred voice still what a dream it would be to be eternally young in a moment she rolled off him snuggled into his side now tell me why you came up here to see me when you should be sleeping i dont want to sleep no she said softly you want to talk he was silent for some time white pillars striped the creamcoloured ceiling their edges as diffuse as gauze light reflected through the blinds because the windows were closed the traffic sounds were as muted as a domestic quarrel in the next apartment panda what am i doing with my life she put a hand over his heart what answer do you want practical or philosophical maybe neither he said i think right now i need a metaphysical answer mmm i think youre on your own then metaphysics is more your field than mine he knew what she meant he had told her enough about his grandfather so that she knew that much of wolfs early schooling had been in a kind of metaphysics though it would no doubt be unrecognizable as such to the columbia academicians in that field but she didnt know it all not even wolfs parents did there is a way things should happen in the world he said slowly as if trying to translate thoughts in another language into english the way a tree grows a river flows a leaf dies in winter but if for example you see a leaf shrivelling in summer you know instinctively that something is amiss he took several long slow breaths so that amanda was aware of just how deeply he was being affected i feel as if i dont know how to say it theres something growing out of season do you know what it is then because she could feel the words congested like lead in his throat she took his hand in hers said if you want my opinion this is not a matter of metaphysics something has disturbed you and that great sex or no is why you came onto campus today she pressed close to him is it breathard its always breathard wolf said but in a curious way now its becoming what he stands for he and i are members of an exclusive club but i never bought into using my badge as privilege for guys like breathard it has become second nature its symptomatic of how they see themselves different apart a member of an elite group above the law its a disease panda ive seen it in action the first step and believe me its only the first is flashing your badge to get special attention the next step is using it to cadge free meals when youre on the run then expensive free dinners just once in a while as a return for a favour done for a restaurateur then getting some criminal off a bust charge because hes part of your snitch network or important to you in some other way cops like to say they make their own perks but theyre not in fact perks at all what they are are bendings of the law cops saying to themselves were a brotherhood apart we take risks and we dont get paid shit for taking those risks weve got to have some other compensations but those compensations are dangerous because theyre by definition amoral and so represent a special corruption of their own a contempt for the law you bend the law once panda and it only gets easier to bend it just a little bit further until you no longer realize youre bending the law at all so its the system thats getting to you right he said nothing and she waited patiently beside him knowing he was used to the vast silences of elk basin wyoming that he needed the silence to build now before he could get to the core of his distress at length he nodded after seven months we were closing in on this madman who had already killed three times before i had him but i allowed my need to get to him alone to get in the way in the process a girl was killed and so was one of my men amandas eyes were deep and as dark as amber of course thats tragic wolf im terribly sorry but to be brutally frank i doubt that you were negligent in any way i know you too well something else entirely has disturbed you so vipers uncoiling i dont know who killed junior i couldnt feel him he said in a rush then later this morning the commish dropped the moravia murder in my lap i came here from moravias apartment i couldnt get any hint of who had murdered him there was no psychic trail at all amanda said what you really mean is youre afraid that in both instances the psychic trail was there and you couldnt detect it he nodded she caught his eyes held them with her own wolf she said whatever mysterious thing is inside you has not abandoned you i felt it before as i always do when were making love she squeezed his hand nothings changed but it has he said sitting up abruptly i feel as if im a dog chasing its tail like i should be carrying a white stick then theres a bigger mystery to solve than just two murders she said have you considered the notion that whoever killed your man might also be the one who murdered moravia why theres nothing to connect the two perhaps not on the surface amanda said but what about the lack of a psychic trail you said in both cases you felt nothing do you think that can be explained away by coincidence wolf felt the vipers climbing his spine it was such an obvious conclusion standing there in plain sight but he had missed it poor wolf she said not unkindly and she kissed him hard on the lips do you want my suggestion a little r and r stevie is hosting a party tomorrow night downtown in alphabet city for a group of new artists she promises its going to be a lot of fun i want you to come with me i cant panda the commish made it clear that this new case is politically explosive ive got no time for she put a hand over his mouth if i know anything at all about you youre already doing everything you can but you cant work it twentyfour hours a day even you mr iron man wind river shoshone is that how i appear to you she laughed softly hugging him affectionately thats who you are but since even you are made out of flesh and blood a brief time away from work will do wonders for your concentration she reached down between them stroked him softly not to mention your mood she laughed again as he grew in her hand heres a case in point staring me right in the face two new york city tokyo vernon harrison the chief medical examiner for new york was an exceptionally tall stoopshouldered man with the dolorous face of a basset hound his thick glasses attested to his poor eyesight but that was about the only thing poor about harrison wolf had found he was a man who always seemed calm and cool in the midst of the kind of political administrative and forensic chaos that could only be engendered by a metropolis on the verge of collapse they were in the basement of the cmes building on first avenue and th street in one of the autopsy cells that adjoined the cold room where the citys corpses awaited disposition it was almost three oclock in the afternoon wolf having spent the morning going over forensics on moravias office and apartment catching up with ballistics reports and past due paperwork a chief of police breathard memo had been waiting for him the gist of it being that he was continuing the internal investigation into the manner of junior ruizs death and he would advise wolf of the disposition of the matter at his convenience more intimidation breathard was a master shakedown artist you get to arquillo the drug dealer yet wolf asked what a mess harrison said snorting looked like some lunatic took a blowtorch to his face he shrugged well as the romans so eloquently put it you live by the sword youve got to expect to die by the sword eh he put down his bone saw the smell of human tissue hung in the air like a pall so the blowtorch snuffed him looks that way harrison said lining up his instruments someone did a nice job on his right arm too that was me chalk up one for our side wolf unaccountably relieved that the cme had found nothing suspicious in arquillos death decided to change the subject about moravia ah now youve given me something to sink my teeth into harrison said as he pulled back the tallowy skin on junior ruizs chest except i honestly dont know what to tell you he wielded his chrome tools as if they were batons and he the drummajor at the head of a parade the whole thing is beginning to give me agita blood samples tissue crosssections the whole nine yards are being run through every toxicological test i can think of so far what i got is bupkis wolf had noticed that harrison very much a wasp must in some way be selfconscious about his status immersed as he was in the rich ethnicity of the city his speech was peppered with idioms from as many different cultures as he could pick up you check out the rouge on his cheeks anything there not unless youre estee lauder harrison said ingredients were choice quality stuff but just what youd expect in a premium rouge he looked up no exotic poisons if that was what you were thinking wolf shrugged i need some answers and soon madre de dios im dancing as fast as i can harrison grunted as he peered into junior ruizs open chest cavity he pointed now this guy is different oyasui koto desu no trouble at all he got whacked with two thirtyeight slugs at pointblank range that just about tore his lungs and heart out wolf was having difficulty looking at the yellow corpse mottled by purple bruises and redblack patches of dried blood that had been junior ruiz back to moravia he said now to harrison forcing himself to focus any sign of drug addiction good question the cme said as he began to sew up the long vertical incision with a thick suture he was shot full of coke no doubt about it was he a longtime user no was he a user period quien sabe wolf waited while harrison finished dictating his postmortem report into the steel microphone wolf wished he would set the sheet back over junior ruiz so what killed moravia wolf said at last the billiondollar question harrison said then paused frowning ill tell you what didnt kill him he was already dead when he was shot and as for the coke we found none of the telltale signs of an od the coke was okay and the levels we found in his system were not consistent with a lethal od he pulled the sheet up over junior ruiz at last turned to wolf id say weve got a helluva mystery on our hands kahuna wolf was on his way out when harrison stopped him one funny thing about this guy moravia wolf turned whats that harrison rubbed the side of his nose well you ever hear of an adult lying about his age to make himself seem older no what would be the point exactly harrison said according to his birth certificate moravia was fortyeight years old and yet when i did the autopsy it was clear to me that i was looking at the insides of a man who was no more than thirty naoharu nishitsu lay in utter darkness behind him across the tatami mats through the sliding doors out to the snowcovered garden that was to him something of a shrine he heard the frail clatter of the moso bamboo because the sliding doors were partially open it was very cold in the room nishitsu naked did not mind he heard a gentle stirring felt it really as one catches the whiff of a scent and he stretched upon the futon in a moment evan was kneeling beside him her slim girls body warm and smelling of a certain kind of exotic fruit tell me evan he said as she served him bitter green tea frothy and pale are you happy here i never considered it nishitsusan she said settling herself on her haunches forbidden dreams is my home it always has been it is my duty to be here to serve you her voice was like cotton that you could pull apart with your hands mould back together in another shape at whim then can you tell me whether you have ever been happy i am content nishitsusan he grunted i am not evan that statement hung in the air like a straight razor about to fall off a shelf there is a growing sense of dissent dissent yes nishitsu said lying quite still i am speaking now of loyalty something that up until now did not seem to be an issue he watched her a dim charcoal outline in the blackness of the room historically from the time of the shoguns we of the toshin kuro kosai have always been of one mind set on one path and that path was secure now i believe it is not are you speaking of a traitor nishitsusan from utter stillness he shot up on one elbow his left hand gripping her right wrist so hard he could feel her bones give clever girl evan made no sound but he sensed her head had swung around and a moment later he could smell a change in her scent slightly acrid musky less delicate his nostrils dilated as he feasted on the odour complex and heady of her fear yes a traitor his voice was a harsh whisper i believe that someone close to us has turned against us is working from within to undermine our plan his other hand came up cupped her breast he clamped down so hard that now despite her iron discipline he heard a distinct whimper come from between her lips you wouldnt know anything about this would you evan what he had startled her surely and this was good because it meant he could trust her but he did not relax his painful hold on her on the contrary he ground down harder on wrist and breast until he could feel her vibrating with the pain until bending over he could taste her pain in the bitterness of her newly produced sweat someone evan and it could be you he said rolling the taste of her around his mouth no less precious than the finest wine someone we know well is betraying us or thinking of betraying us and it could be you who slept with the spy lawrence moravia again and again but i did not know he was a spy if i had i certainly would have tried to discover who he worked for nishitsu was grateful for the darkness because he could not stop himself from smiling it was true what he had learned about the sexes men were duplicitous but women knew how to discover their duplicity it did not matter that nishitsu already knew who moravias masters were that he had known from the moment the amateur had sent his coded fax from the american express office on the ginza it had not mattered to nishitsu that he could not read the message only that his people there had reported to him the destination of the fax evan need know nothing of this it was his experience that too much information could become an insupportable burden in any event he had a more important use for evan he loosened his grip on her felt in response a lessening of that odour he loved so completely who would betray us i dont know his mouth was so close it brushed the skin of her cheek the corner of her lips the suspects are limited there are only a few people with enough power experience and guile there was a thin line of saliva sealing her lips and he wanted it a male has the strength of ego required to oppose us a woman the subtlety of character what is your sense which one a man i would have said a man shoto wakare in fact is my prime suspect he let go of her wrist and was gratified to see that she did not move it i know how your gift works and i give it full credence in these matters i have always done what you have asked nishitsusan he could not help himself tasted the wetness between her lips and you will do so again he said throatily you will help me find our traitor in answer evan lifted her head revealing the long arch of her neck nishitsu felt a commingling of poignancy and lust at the sight of that tender flesh at how she so willingly exposed it to him he moved over her his powerful legs spreading her thighs in a moment she was crying out but it was a different sort of cry from her whimpers of before wolf had decided not to tell anyone about the door in the back of moravias wardrobe the cell behind it or its bizarre contents including the photos and the sculpture he couldnt even bring himself to tell bobby why not he didnt know except some instinct told him to keep that part of the investigation to himself for now the late afternoon was cold and still as if there was no weather at all only a vast frozen grey pall that threatened to smother the city in nothingness he parked on east third street opposite an old brownstone the ground floor was given over to an art gallery if you could call fabric and black leather strips affixed to sheets of burned twisted metal art the huge pieces were visible in the window behind reinforced steel gates painted hideous shades of green purple and yellow like a raw bruise upon which was scrawled like elegant graffiti urban decay at least they got the name right he thought the painted iron gates were drawn back but even so the sculptures in the windows seemed to drink in the acrid winter light absorbing all illumination inside the gallery it seemed as dark and drear as midnight the dreadful gallery was presided over by a painfully thin young woman with the figure of a coat rack long lank hair as red as a fire engine and a repellent bluewhite complexion her eyes were circled by thick rings of kohl and her lipstick and nail lacquer were as black as the walls of the gallery all of this made her appear closer to death than to life which wolf supposed was the point charming he thought or very hip depending on your point of view the young womans name was moun which she informed him in words clipped out between tiny sharp teeth rhymed with noun wolf told her he was an attorney representing the estate of the late lawrence moravia when moun looked at him blankly he pulled out a snapshot of moravia showed it to her oh larry moun said hes dead gee gross then she shrugged off whatever grief had momentarily seized her sure he came in here a lot he liked to look around i played this game i always do you know at first i was sure he wasnt interested in the art just you know taking a friend from out of town around a kinky neighbourhood playing mr new york but then i got to know him better and eventually i knew hed buy a piece she opened a wad of bazooka bubble gum crammed it in her mouth you usually get a feel from people you know like i knew when you walked in you werent here to buy like why did you think i was here if moun had any idea that he was mocking her she gave no sign of it she cocked her head to one side as if he were a sample a new artist was bringing her to evaluate she chewed reflectively then popped the biggest bubble wolf had ever seen i thought youd made a mistake theres a boutique down the block called urban design sells you know like trendy stuff isnt this trendy stuff wolf said spreading his hands is art trendy moun asked seriously its not meant to be bought then thrown out next season no no its timeless thats what makes it art she watched him as he moved around the gallery popping bubbles now one after another all these pieces are made by one artist chika she said trying to be helpful then nervously you arent going to ask for larrys money back wolf turned to look at her why would i want to do that gee i dont know moun said but well since larrys dead i thought your being here and all that well she lapsed into an uncomfortable silence how come you call him larry moun shrugged thats his name isnt it she popped another monstrous bubble anyway larry and i she hesitated i think thats why he came in so much it wasnt anything just well one saturday afternoon we went back behind there she indicated a matteblack door at the rear of the gallery and you know fucked she giggled it was kind of cool because there were customers in the gallery and we could hear them you know moving around and talking while we fucked it was very cool ill bet it was wolf thought he said when did mr moravia larry buy his chika at the opening moun said he came for the party chika was here and he bought the piece after talking to her that would have been gee about a week ago thats why i thought well you know that the estate wanted to return the sculpture yeah moun made a face well you know chikas stuff isnt for everyone in fact i really didnt think it was for larry but he flipped over it he was talking a blue streak to chika the artist uh huh do you think he fucked her too i dont know moun popped a bubble maybe i think he liked that kind of thing what kind of thing moun made a moue with her black lips the effect was frightening are lawyers always so dense trip up larry liked to fuck but i got the impression he didnt want any you know entanglements relationships you mean wham bam thank you maam that was larry that made moun laugh theyre all like that arent they all who oh you know guys like larry i got to understand him after a while he was a big shot lots of money i bet he ate all his meals at places like the four seasons and lutece i mean in that life he was a suit like all the rest of the suits only deep down inside he was laughing at them the other suits you know he hated that kind of life it wasnt him at all what was him moun looked at him larry was bent i mean seriously bent sexually like what else he said did larry ever tie you up moun popped a bubble are you larrys lawyer or his shrink she gave a delicious little shiver he never did no but i wouldnt have minded you wouldnt wolf said surprised despite himself it was impossible to think of this bizarre creature as being someones daughter she came up close to him and he could smell her scent a combination of neroli and cloves sharp and exotic and without the slightest nuance are you a control freak she asked most men are i know but see theres a pleasure in loss of control its powerful i mean it could kind of control you if you let it and that in itself heightens the pleasure she looked up at him do you like pleasure do you even understand it wolf had the irrational notion that she was about to ask him back into that noisome inner room for a bout of tie up the princess part of him was wondering what it would be like another part was appalled that he was even fantasizing about it you mentioned before that larry came in with a friend moun popped her bubble what you said a friend from out of town that larry was playing the big shot with him he also bent she laughed oh no way man not him he was uptight and not a bit all right how so she cocked her head it made her look like some kind of futuristic fighting cock you know the type a suit a crew a tightass he didnt bother asking her for a better description within the red glow coining from the core of him he saw the face of a handsome young ivyleaguer no doubt yalie blond inquisitive blue eyes pulled from mouns memory like a trout from a lake he said from out of town yeah right howd you know that he kept saying things like back in dc things like that also here she squinted at him the ultimate test of his new yorkerdom whether he could get this he had that martha wouldja look atall them tall buildins look you mean he had an accent moun grinned at him a truly horrifying sight like something youd see in a national geographic special on new guinea cannibals uh huh what kind kinda southern kinda by that i take it you mean not a broad youall but a soft one right dc for sure wolf thought he have a name this friend of larrys sure did moun said enjoying this interview plenty the only interesting thing about him mcgeorge shipley she nodded worked for the government too the federal government uh huh larry asked him a question i couldnt hear what and shipley took out a business card his pen was out of ink so he asked me for mine to write something on the back thats when i saw his name on the card and the seal the card said he worked for the department of defense interesting wolf thought moravia who shuttled back and forth between new york and tokyo palling around with some heavy hitter from defense now what could that be all about nothing in his file mentioned any ties to the feds all of a sudden lawrence moravia began to increase in importance he took a quick stroll around the gallery again said to moun in the most casual way you get a look at what shipley wrote on the back of his card yeah mouns tongue seeming almost a neon pink against her shiny black lips swept briefly up and out want to know what it was for a dizzying moment he thought she was going to ask for his services in that dank back room small thin body pushed sweatily up against his her avid fingers loosening his belt some quid pro quo then she laughed you should see your face wolf laughed with her liking her despite her bizarreness it occurred to him that there was more to her than the rebellious child wanting merely to shock her elders it was a phone number a twoohtwo area code she recited the number as if she had used a mnemonic to memorize it how come you remembered it he said writing the dc number down moun shrugged her thin shoulders every time she moved he could scent the cloves and neroli drifting off her like pollen i remember everything especially about larry he was like that god i dont know why she seemed abruptly sad as if only now the news of his death had reached her what can you tell me about the artist chika he said to change the subject moun put her hand lovingly on one of the sculptures a gesture that in its innocence reminded wolf of the disturbing photos in lawrence moravias inner sanctum you mean whats in the brochure or what i know theyre not the same moun giggled well you know what artists are like everythings a mystery in fact the more mystery the better because they think the bio stuff about them only gets in the way you see they want their art to speak for them what they want most is for the viewer to come to their art without any preconceived notions about what it is they should be seeing i thought what artists wanted most was to sell their art arent most of them starving in some garret somewhere moun giggled again some maybe but not chika i dont think she has to worry about whether or not her art sells why not moun blew another bubble it took a long time to pop you ask an awful lot of questions for a lawyer the estate pays me to ask a lot of questions no ones heard of chika before as always with art moun said you have to find the right people to ask about the artist chika would you say she and larry were good friends they liked each other you could tell that just by looking at them i think they had a history either of them mention something that would give you that impression i overheard them talking about tokyo a lot like theyd been to places together like what places moun shrugged another cascade of scents they spoke of something called forbidden dreams sounds like a club to me maybe a kinky sex place knowing larry i think id like to talk to chika he said slowly reminded again of moravias disturbingly erotic photos she live in manhattan sure moun nodded in fact shes got the secondfloor apartment in a building three blocks from here but she glanced at a desk calendar i can tell you shes out of town and wont be back till tomorrow we never should have tried it so soon yuji shian said i doubt we had a choice but to kill a human being it was an accident an honest mistake yuji looked at his mother minako it was just coming on dawn and an oystergrey light filled the sky over tokyo to their left tsukijis forest of barebulb lights illumined lines of glistening fish as they stood there men in high rubber boots passed by holding hoses methodically spraying the fish to keep them fresh the sharp smells of fish and brine came in waves heady as foaming beer behind them in the last vestiges of the shadows of night hulked the unmarked warehouse where the oracle was stored i am a scientist mother yuji said now i should have known better procedure dictated that i wait for for what clinical trials you know that in this case standard procedure would be useless minako said testing on lower forms of life would tell us nothing yuji turned his head away towards the river steam rose from it and now and again the mournful hoot of a passing boat hung in the air like frost he nodded she was right of course they had had no choice as a scientist he knew this the technology demanded testing but as a human being he was appalled at the outcome yujisan minako said gently let me bring you some tea at one of the many stands selling sushi and soba minako turned back to look at her son he stood there on the fringes of the great fish markets hubbub shoulders hunched against the early morning chill alone in a crowd her heart ached for him all her children were precious to her but yuji was her only son that alone would have made him special to her but his genius in the biosciences made him even more so minako ordered tea and thought of her son and how she had fought to keep him innocent of the dark side of the world now that would have to change that was his karma and hers yuji waited patiently for his mother to return his mind racked with guilt he could not have known of course what the oracle would do to moravia but wasnt that the point he thought of the risk they had all taken and was again swamped with grief he looked out on a sea of flat colourless eyes here and there the soft thud of a tail beating against the wet concrete was enough to confirm the fish were still alive tea minako said handing him a steaming cup all around him he could feel the city awakening moving by increments towards the inchoate roar of rush hour they had deliberately set up the oracle labs at this ancillary warehouse far from shian kogakus shinjuku headquarters so that latenight sessions would go unnoticed in this area where fishermen laboured through the night and dawn does this mean that we will have to begin all over again his mother asked yuji considered this for some time it had been a question that had plagued him ever since she had told him of lawrence moravias death i dont think so he said at last it isnt as if we were on the wrong path but we are missing a vital piece of the puzzle the problem is akin to a generator with one on switch that blasts so much power it lights up the city then blows the generator he turned to her no we wont have to start anew what we have to do is modify the on switch minako nodded i feel at fault yujisan it was i who pushed you into creating the oracle it was i who brought moravia to you who urged you to use him as a guinea pig but mother he consented he knew the risks minako smiled sadly then do not blame yourself yujisan moravias karma was his own doing youre right mother yuji said but still i feel compelled to go to sensoji minako nodded it is only right we will go together they went down to the sumida river caught a water taxi to the asakusa district where the sensoji temple stood it was dedicated to kannon the buddhist goddess of mercy and was the holy place where minako had taken her children on festival days they went down the long lane lined with a profusion of stalls selling anything and everything from rice paper parasols and traditional wooden combs to windup robots and sake they paused at the mammoth incense burner in front of the entrance and cupping their hands drew the aromatic smoke to them covering themselves with it thus ensuring continued good health they climbed the steps went into the temple itself echoes filled the otherwise still air they were surrounded by phalanxes of huge columns and lanterns which hung like pine cones in this stylized forest high above their heads like the distant swirl of clouds the ceiling was decorated with complex dramas out of japanese legend or history depending on your point of view they said a buddhist prayer for the dead lighting sticks of incense chanting as the thick smoke curled like adders tongues in the still cold air of the temple this ritual so familiar it was comforting calmed yuji but glancing over at his mother as they left sensoji he saw that she was still troubled outside the sun was up struggling through the thick industrial haze that blanketed the metropolis asakusa seemed a dream a painting from the brush of a pointillist like seurat minako shivered i feel a change in the air she said in a whisper yuji by now used to his mothers presentiments said it will be a change for the better no minako said we are on a precipice and below us in the darkness is an abyss her clasped hands twisted this way and that and yujisan something is moving in the abyss something even i cannot guess at rain hard as a fighters fists drummed against the roof of his car wolf parked within sight of urban decay was watching steam come cannoning through a hole in the tarmac of avenue c while a slickered con ed crew tried to find some way to stop it he had dialled the main number of the department of defense in dc and had already been bounced more times than a basketball from department to department in a search for the seemingly elusive mcgeorge shipley moravias outoftown buddy no one it seemed wanted to take responsibility for shipleys existence which meant that either he had run afoul of the federal governments vaunted bureaucratic inefficiency or moun had given him the warhol the wrong information with a grunt he checked out of the defenses electronic tangle phoned an acquaintance at the nyc headquarters of the fbi no one at nypd was ever what you might call friendly with a fed but from time to time favours were grudgingly done on either side resulting in a kind of sand castle relationship that might hold up as long as too much pressure wasnt brought to bear wolf hung on the line while fred the fed waited for his computer to come back on line fuckin con ed fred said staring out of his windshield at the great gout of steam rushing from the bowels of lower manhattan wolf could sympathize if only fleetingly with this minion of bureaucracy okay fred said at last im into the defense personnel program whatd you say this guys name was mcgeorge shipley yeah right hold on across the street the foreman of the con ed crew was on the phone in his truck calling for reinforcements wolf guessed then he became aware of a woman she was standing at the kerb rice paper umbrella sitting on her shoulder wolf peered at her face but the curtain of rain made it impossible to make out her features the woman wore black shoes their chrome high heels flaring in the light from the traffic headlights she wore a black micro skirt that showed all of her luscious thighs an oversized black wool and metalliclooking leather bomber jacket covered her from waist to neck she stepped down across the gutter rushing with sludgy water and wolf had an instants flash of her pale face blackeyed extraordinarily beautiful unmistakably oriental japanese then a truck lumbered by black rain sluicing from its mudguards and she was gone he blinked but the sight of the japanese girls thighs was imprinted on his retinas just lying there refusing to go away like a latent print on a murder weapon okay freds reedy smokebroken voice was back on the line sorry bud no mcgeorge shipley anywhere on file you sure wolf closed his eyes but the extraordinarylooking woman refused to disappear instead moved there in the darkness stepping down into the street her thighs stretched taut theres a shipley william h in procurement another shipley lessee donald r in accounting that be it hes got to be there wolf said well he could be there fred told him but i cant see him hows that all thought of the japanese woman was driven from his mind blind files bud all the government directories carry em in case its slipped your attention theres a lot of covert shit happenin out of dc guys into that dont get carried on the directories just anybody even fbi can call up so what youre saying is this shipley doesnt exist or hes a spook thats about the size of it fred the fed said hey now were even bud i gotta go its been real wolf hung up stared for a moment at the thunder of the steam rising up to meet the cold metallic rain his car roof had become a drumhead what the hell was lawrence moravia doing with a defense spook or had moun enjoying a game of bait the square too much to stop slipped him the warhol he pulled out a pad stared at the dc phone number she had recited to him the one the phantom shipley had allegedly given to moravia he took a breath dialled it it rang seven times and he was about to hang up waiting this long perhaps for an answering machines tinny voice when he heard a brief pause the ringing begin again and someone at the other end said shipley here wolf felt his heart give a quick thud mcgeorge shipley yes who is this the light tenor of a young man wolf thought of mouns mental picture of shipley wolf told him you were acquainted with lawrence moravia you dont mind if i verify this with your commander do you shipley said give me your badge and phone number if this is legit ill call you back within ten minutes wolf gave him the information then disconnected waiting to be legitimized as real by a spook some situation he wondered what moravia had really been up to on his shuttle trips to japan if shipley was a defense spook then he dealt in highlevel secrets and those were apt to get you killed wolf realized all at once that he might now be in an entirely different league through the rain he could see two more con ed trucks rumbling up more slickers piling out more disorder as the saw horses were unloaded the traffic starting to build as the hour got later and the disruption more intense the next and final step was to block off avenue c entirely he thought about the call to shipley the slight pause after the seventh ring the phone call undoubtedly being rerouted to wherever shipley was at this moment could be anywhere the phone ringing made him jump he picked up the receiver matheson yes you are shipleys familiar tenor said as if he were an alienist brought in to reassure a patient to answer your question i was acquainted with lawrence moravia was he working for you mr matheson shipley said ignoring wolfs rank i think it would be better if we met face to face take the eleven oclock shuttle tomorrow morning take a cab to h street in chinatown and find a restaurant called phoenix chinatown ill see you at one the saw horses were up all along the width of the tarmac in a sea of headlights and whacking wipers traffic was at a standstill waiting wearily for the cops to set up an alternate route but for the moment there was no exit chief of police jack breathard was a career cop smart in every way it was essential for a career cop to be he was streetwise and publicityminded he managed to keep the commissioner and the mayor in a good light with the tv people who terrified just about everyone else in the department not an easy task considering that under the carefully manufactured public veneer the commish and the mayor would cheerfully duke it out in any back alley the mayor james olivas a secondgeneration puerto rican with everything to prove had been forced by malignant political circumstance to appoint hayes walker johnson a hardnosed black as his commissioner of police the two saw eyetoeye on nothing and away from the public eye of the television cameras their clash of egos was already the stuff of legend breathard could dance through this volatile ethnopolitical minefield better than anyone in the department which meant he knew every way there was to use the enmity of his superiors to his own ends he had for instance made himself indispensable to olivass precarious media image no easy task since the mayor was apt to see him and hayes walker johnson two blacks peas in a pod in the same corner breathards dream of course was to replace first one then the other and this dream had been right on track until the advent of lieutenant wolf matheson breathard had never liked wolf he distrusted the talent which he told himself he saw as a shortcut to the hard work and perseverance he recognized as the hallmark of all the best police work this myopic view was no doubt reinforced by his envy of the attention wolf received every time he brought in a collar the way breathard saw it that was media awareness that should have been given to him it was breathard who had cleverly rerouted the commishs request for office space for wolf and his people down a black hole from which it never reappeared and it was he who first heard about the murder of lawrence moravia and diverted the report just long enough for him to be brought up to speed on it before it was sent on to wolf it rankled breathard no end that the commish had had an early morning meet with wolf hed checked the office signout logs the commish not bothering to inform him and had left him in the dark on this moravia thing breathard could see the media attention such a spectacular case would bring the man who took credit for collaring moravias murderer fuck the commish and fuck matheson breathard was determined to be that man and in the process screw matheson breathard was sitting in the dimness of clancys one of those irish pubs downtown where the smell of beer was so strong you could almost quench your thirst just by taking a few deep breaths breathard liked this place since few of his brethren ever stepped inside except to shake down a selection of the more notorious potatoheads who frequented the joint and at this hour he just about had the bar to himself the big black man was nursing a beer when the front door opened and squire richards came in he squinted into the dimness then headed over to breathards table buy you a beer blood why not squire richards said as he shook rain off his shoulders shrugged out of his coat and dropped onto a rickety chair breathard signalled the waitress a heavy heifer with dyed hair and false eyelashes who looked like she had timewarped in from the s and a couple of minutes later two beers hit the scarred plywood table what you got for me breathard said automatically falling into street argot it was something of a relief the strain of catering to a spic and an oreo more white than black was beginning to tell on him squire richards took a mighty gulp of his beer wish i could feel a hundred per cent okay bout what im doin what you mean whatchew doin breathard said if we bloods dont hang together whos gonna take care of us whitey he done gone from this burg olivas he busy coverin his ass lookin out for the greasers got him into office and then theres mr muthafucka hayes walker johnson mr myshitdontstinklikeyouothaniggas mr myjobmakesmeasgoodasanyyouwhiteyssopleaseletmeinibeagoodlittlenigga huh this last an explosive outburst breathard thrust his head out like a great snapping turtle said so now what you got to tell me blood your boss wolf matheson be the only otha muthafucka who can stop me from moving up from getting rid of johnson and olivas and i want his ass right heah on a platta that clear squire richards nodded dont have much hard yet but as far as the moravia case goes there sure is some weird shit coming down like for instance bobby connor acting funny course he was there when junior ruiz bought it but theres something aint natural about him now like he saw something he shouldnt interesting breathard said stroking his bristly black moustache you passed me the written report of the killing of that girl arquillo and ruiz nuthin extrordinary there just my point squire richards said burying his face in his beer and then theres the lieutenant hisself i mean he be a strange dude sure nuf but hes gotten major weird since junior be offed hes talking to nobody hes out doin shit on his own aint be logging hisself in nobody know where to find the dude these days he becomin very uncool all of a sudden more interesting still breathard considered this while he downed his beer i sure do want to catch that muthafucka with his hand where it dont belong bring him down hard once an for all dont have to consider his bad self no more he winked at squire richards maybe i put a tail oh him i catch myself one white fish squire richards was shocked don care what you do longs you don make me part of it you don know this dudes bad you put someone on him you betta make damn sure he knows what hes about or hes liable find hisself eatin outta the wrong side his head breathard stroked his moustache grinned don you worry none blood i won do nuthinll jeopardize your position with matheson he laughed you far too valuable a muthafucka tlose three washington tokyo the new yorkwashington shuttle deposited wolf at national airport fifteen minutes late it was a short but uncomfortable ride reminding him of being wedged inside a cattle car he deplaned stretched his muscles as he strode through the terminal and slipping on his leather flight jacket went out into a misty rain to hail a cab there was already a queue and wolf joined it he used the large areas of glass to give him reflections of the immediate environment but he saw no one suspicious still as he got to the head of the line he made frantic motions as if he had forgotten something in the terminal turned and hurried back inside he waited five minutes before he reappeared outside the queue had disappeared and he grabbed the first cab in line from the dispatcher chinatown in washington was smaller than the one in new york just as dismal though somehow less filthy on the other hand h street seemed to contain almost as many stirfry joints as hong kong phoenix chinatown seemed no different from the restaurants on either side of it except for the pair of peeling plaster foo dogs flanking its otherwise unprepossessing entrance inside it was pleasantly dim the walls and atmosphere mahogany with the sticky residue of heated rice vinegar chilli oil and soy sauce it was just before one and the place was crowded enough wolf found an open table slipped onto a vinyl banquette that once must have been red a hyperactive waiter dropped a slippery menu on the table splashed hot tea into a cafeteriastyle glass dropped a metal carafe beside it at one oclock wolf being hungry ordered hot and sour soup at five after it was served along with a bowl of dried noodles and a small plate of pickled cabbage he had just finished the soup good had tried some noodles not when a tall slim oriental rose from a table across the restaurant and approached him mr matheson mr shipley apologizes for the delay the oriental seemed to have more on his mind but seemed rooted to the spot silent wolf extended a hand poured tea into a second glass the oriental nodded slid onto the banquette opposite wolf youre not chinese wolf said no im japanese he said but i like chinese food i also seem to have developed a taste for cheeseburgers he reached a hand across jason yoshida wolf eyed him how long have you been watching me mr yoshida not watching you precisely watching everything around you i wasnt followed here wolf said if thats your concern its always my concern yoshida said as he downed the tea shall we go mr shipley is waiting he waved a hand as wolf reached for his wallet already taken care of mr matheson its all part of the service instead of heading for the front door yoshida led wolf back through the restaurant down a narrow corridor past a public phone and the rest rooms and out into a back alley they turned left then left again there was a black taurus with government plates parked at a no parking sign yoshida unlocked it and they got in yoshida made a couple of turns and they were on h street heading west you work for shipley wolf asked something like that yoshida said in a tone of voice that exhibited his distaste for further conversation he made a right onto massachusetts avenue took it all the way to dupont circle then swung onto connecticut avenue heading northwest into rock creek park at the northern edge of the park yoshida made a right onto tilden street then a left onto linnean avenue the millwood estate belonged to marjorie merriweather post yoshida said suddenly becoming loquacious as they swung through high black iron gates but it was originally part of a twothousandacre plot of land owned by isaac pierce near the beginning of the eighteenth century he nodded to an ancient black man in a uniform wolf could not identify perhaps that of a private security firm they went up a long twisting drive towards the ridge of a low hill upon its summit crouched a large redbrick georgian mansion yoshida was thoughtful enough to tell him it was built in they pulled up but yoshida did not turn off the engine nor make any attempt to get out behind the main residence is a path that will descend over a slight knoll he said take it and at the fork bear left past the miniature russian dacha the next structure you come to will be a log cabin wolf waited for him to continue and when he did not said is that all yoshida turned to him and for a split instant wolf felt something in the core of him stir uneasily mr shipley is waiting he said just as if wolf had not been made to wait for the spook just like something out of a fairy tale there was indeed a miniature dacha and just down the path an honesttogod log cabin wolf opened the door felt immediately that change in temperature and humidity that presaged entrance into a hermetically sealed environment he could immediately see why the interior of the log cabin had been transformed into a museum housing mrs posts impressive collection of american indian artefacts including buckskins beaded moccasins painted war drums weavings a wealth of the stolen history of the great american plains wolf was so thunderstruck by the displays that he almost failed to see the young man come up to him he matched the mental image he had pulled from mouns memory his blond hair cut short his long pleasant face dominated by porcelainblue eyes that compensated somewhat for his underdeveloped chin he was in dc mufti darkblue suit starched white shirt regimental striped tie and so could walk unnoticed down any corridor in any federal building in the district he stuck out his hand mr matheson his smile was so healthy it might have cured the common cold his grip firm and dry was meant to be reassuring mr shipley i presume shipley grinned and he suddenly seemed as guileless as a boy i apologize for the shift in venue but it was a necessary precaution wolf had to remind himself that all spooks were paranoid your mr yoshida seemed concerned i had been followed to chinatown who would do that will you step this way shipley said as he guided wolf to the left up a flight of wood and metal steps to a small balcony from which one could see closeup a pair of magnificently woven tlingit blankets one also had a commanding view of the entire interior from this eyrie wolf put his hands on the polished wood rail said the first question i want to ask is if moravia was an agent working for defense why werent feds crawling all over his murder site mucking up my investigation we could have made a good b movie out of that conflict shipley gave off a tiny laugh like a puff of breath on a winters day i like you mr matheson theres nothing between your ears but brains thats what id been told but its always helpful to get firsthand confirmation wolf squinted hard youd been told i was smart by whom shipley took a deep breath stared out and down at the exhibits painstakingly maintained beneath glass look at this place mr matheson its a kind of shrine dont you think what i think is that it doesnt tell the whole story shipley nodded too little too late eh he nodded i can sympathize i doubt that you can wolf said shipley absorbed the rebuke but there were some who grew to love these indians your father for one now wolf knew why the spook had brought him here to a museum housing artefacts from members of the nation it told him with more immediate impact than words or a dossier with his name on it that these people whoever they may be knew who he was what he was as well as what might be important to him or at least they thought they did theres no need for you to see our file on you is there shipley said conversationally no he nodded apparently satisfied with how the interview had gone so far lawrence moravia was working for us mr matheson though on a strictly unofficial basis put a fine line on that would you shipley turned to him his blue eyes seeming unnaturally bright in the log cabins overhead lights wolf suspected him of wearing contact lenses moravias name appears on no departmental books ledgers files or microfiches he was paid in cash from what is known inhouse as appropriated field funds do you copy that in other words untraceable coin lifted from opposition units shipleys smile was almost a smirk head of the class mr matheson by the way did you learn your tradecraft overseas in nam you had a spotter at the airport right shipley said but as you have noted no one followed you to chinatown even us you did very well mr yoshida neednt have been concerned wolf let out a breath he realized he had been holding for some time he was in a very different arena than nypd homicide and he found himself wondering how long these spooks were going to allow him to remain in it in that regard he had a surprise coming to answer your question shipley said we did not send people in precisely because we did not want to how did you put it muck up your investigation well this must be a first the feds not wanting their piece of the action i mean moravia was your pigeon unofficially yes shipley stepped closer to wolf lowered his voice accordingly and unofficially is the operative word here since moravia was an eyesonly agent on special assignment he is officially considered a civilian can you imagine the questions we would have to endure if we sent our people in to handle the investigation of his murder no no that wouldnt work at all he moved slightly along the rail as if to keep a better eye on who was coming in downstairs wolf followed him now you answer one for me shipley said how did you get my private number wolf told him about his visit to urban decay how moun had remembered him coming there as moravias guest shipley nodded his face becoming mournful theres a damn good reason why were officially forbidden to make use of civilians this is an example you lie down with civilians you tend to be lax in your tradecraft wolf leaned in what was moravia working on shipley shook his head national security you know i cant tell you anything about that then youre deliberately tying my hands on this investigation its already got enough bizarre aspects to it for me to be certain that he wasnt iced by a business rival personal enemy or some burglar caught in the attempt surely you can tell me something a direction to head in you can see the pity of it mr matheson shipley sighed his face taking on an even more mournful cast its really too bad because you would work come again oh come on mr matheson youre everything we require a civilian with smarts a cop a detective with an unparalleled reputation for running down murder perps with your own semiautonomous unit and the full backing of the nypd but the fact is after what youve just told me i wouldnt use another civilian if my life depended on it wolf had a feeling that his time on the moravia case was just about to run out and he found that he very badly did not want that to happen im hardly a civilian he pointed out as far as my department is concerned in the most elemental sense were both cops arent we shipley stared hard at him those eyes like bright blue chips betraying for an instant the spooks need as shrill as a cicadas buzz for wolfs help then the porcelain quality returned like an opaque curtain shutting him off from all but the fastidious facade still like the afterscent of an overripe fruit he could smell shipleys need surely there was a way to capitalize on that wolf said you and i belong to a kind of fraternity were outsiders always in danger walking a tightrope between the shadow and the light living inbetween days shipley gave him that wide megawatt smile i see what youre doing mr matheson lieutenant shipley nodded thats right i forgot but it makes no difference lieutenant matheson your attempt to link us together just wont work you might be a cop yes but youre sworn to uphold the law isnt that more or less how your oath goes i am bound by no such oath i am sworn to uphold the sovereignty of the united states of america whatever that takes is that how your oath goes mr shipley ha ha yes sir the oath we swear in private goes very much like that he shook his head but like i said it sure is a shame we couldnt work together shipley turned to go but wolf said without me youll have no handle at all on the moravia hit what will you do then shipley shrugged ill just have to limp along as best i can adios lieutenant this will be the last time we see one another wolf waited until he was at the head of the stairs before he said tell me just one thing shipley what year was moravia born shipley turned regarded wolf with a curious eye nineteen fortyfour i believe november twentythird youre sure of that he could sense shipley becoming more curious than ever if you have a point youd better make it now i do have a point wolf said walking towards shipley and its this if lawrence moravia was fortyeight how come the cme of new york city swears his organs are those of a man thirty years old for a long time shipley said nothing all around them the spirits of the american plains preserved under glass darkened the air with the power of their worldsong at last shipley stirred as if coming out of a deep sleep he lifted his arm in invitation lieutenant i believe youd better come with me nishitsu was feeling refreshed ready for business he was not normally one to gloat over his own cleverness the world being too full of dangerous pitfalls for the unwary but in this case he allowed himself to feel very pleased by his recruitment of evan everyone at forbidden dreams loved her and more importantly trusted her perhaps that was because she was the only one of them who had never stepped outside its walls in that regard alone evan was a special creature but she had so much more to offer him she exuded the guilelessness of a child she looked like a child for that matter but her mind was razor sharp fuelled by the wisdom of age he thought of these things as he crossed the small garden a touch of snow built in its corners like spider webs he looked upward at the towering spires of tokyo the toshin kuro kosai the black blade society had come so far so fast and soon it would all be over the fruition of their decades of scheming but now they were all walking a knifeedged tightrope the infiltration of moravia was proof of that as was the existence of a potential traitor in the precise centre of the garden he paused recalling the moment when the reverend mother had opened her eyes pale as diamonds and seemingly as faceted and said to him someone will move against us will or has already planning doing it is all the same now because the thought and deed are moving in concert he always listened to the reverend mother because this was her gift and she was almost never wrong she saw what she saw in what kind of shimmering darkling future piercing her mind like a black blade he could not begin to imagine but he had listened to her dire warning his blood running cold and then he had acted and surely evan would find the traitor he moved on a bit chilled without his overcoat and pulling aside another sliding door removed his shoes kneeling he entered the room in the traditional fashion on his hands and knees he saw minako shian first she was the mother of yuji shian chairman of shian kogaku japans foremost keiretsu multiindustrial conglomerate and a man who above all others nishitsu needed minako was a magnificent creature as desirable now as any woman nishitsu had met half her age her eyes were luminous her long glossy hair black as a ravens wing coiffed in complex swirls above her sculpted face all the power one traditionally felt in a womans body was in her face and the force of it was akin to putting ones hand near the open door of a furnace behind him he could feel the presence of another woman would have done so had she been at the other more public end of forbidden dreams he did not look directly at this woman known as the reverend mother had every reason to feel good about not having to do so since often that was like peering too long into the sun i am sorry about your friend moraviasan nishitsu said not meaning a word of it moravia had got just what he deserved minako nodded i suppose it was careless on my part not to have seen through him in that we can all share the blame the reverend mother said in a tone not unlike the reverberation of a distant avalanche and in a very clear way it was fortuitous nishitsu said the innocence as it were allowed us to deal with him totally without suspicion and that freedom made him careless we know who his masters are the reverend mother said and we will deal with them accordingly today however we have more pressing matters to attend to right here in our own back yard nishitsu nodded your son yujisan minakosan we understand have understood all along your desire to keep your son apart from us from what we do up until now we have indulged this desire this is unfortunately no longer possible the reverend mother said what has happened minako asked nishitsu rose walked on stockinged feet to the rear of the room and there stood looking out at the garden bathed in light filtered by delicate bamboo and urban monolith he was a man both of high energy and great stillness and it was said that this garden had been built to his specifications that he drew his seemingly inexhaustible strength from its many elements boulder bamboo gravel water maple stone azalea perhaps minako thought this was because he had had the gardens architect put to death so that he could not recreate this space this shrine for anyone else buried there in the garden and bound by its perimeter the architects spirit continued to nourish nishitsu like the rice and fish he daily ate what has happened nishitsu said is that we are faced with an enemy or enemies from within he watched minako carefully with his opal eye to divine any quickening of pulse or breath any sheen of sweat or small galvanic response occurring subcutaneously there was none minako said can this new development in some way be traced back to moravia a good question and i can see how it would be of interest to you nishitsu through with his visual survey of her turned back to contemplate the garden for the moment i have no adequate answer i only know that we have now been put on notice we no longer have the luxury of time accordingly the final stages of your plan have been set in motion ah that remains unfinished is to bring your son and those who follow him into line we will need you for this minakosan i understand minako said do you nishitsu whirled on her i dont know were it my son we were speaking about i think i would need to clarify the conflict between giri and ninjo just like in the yakuza movies eh minako said with intended irony she knew what he meant giri was that sense of ultimate obligation to family or group without which life itself had no meaning ninjo was that sense of decency against which giri almost always pushed it was this very sense of conflict that gave such situations special poignancy so that they could be remembered for centuries recounted over and over the listeners weeping openly at the suffering and the nobility of the heroine it might be so with her and yuji she felt giri towards the black blade society had in fact over the decades sacrificed much for them but now with her son yuji nishitsu was calling into question her loyalty because of her sense of ninjo towards the son she had until now kept sacrosanct from her life within the black blade society i do not deny the conflict minako said but it is internal and need not concern you i am toshin kuro kosai my sacrifices for the cause are well documented eh nishitsusan that they are nishitsu said nodding slowly however we are aware of the special regard you place on your son he is after all the only one of your four children unaware of the toshin kuro kosai and your involvement in it you yourself have put him in a sacrosanct place beyond our reach he came back across the room sat opposite her on the tatami now all that must change we are asking you to make the ultimate sacrifice asking me minako smiled letting the silence gather at her feet before she said i was called to make the ultimate sacrifice as a small girl when i agreed to the summoning from then on it was understood that whatever the toshin kuro kosai asked of me i would do nothing has changed nishitsu nodded it was important for us to speak of this openly i understand minako said then you will present your son yuji shian to us two weeks from today minako said nothing and the silence built again though this time it was not of her making at length the reverend mother stirred tell me minakosan how will you accomplish your sons conversion to a philosophy he now finds abhorrent i have no choice minako said i will have to use his best friend shoto wakare at millwoods main residence wolf saw jason yoshida behind the wheel of a darkblue lincoln town car with government plates what had become of the black taurus he wondered yoshida opened the nearside rear door for them and they got in shipley immediately pressed a button and the privacy screen blotted out the back of yoshidas head they began to move but the town cars windows had been blackened so effectively that wolf had difficulty seeing through them soon he gave up trying what do you know of japan lieutenant im an expert in aikido wolf said of course you are but thats something cultural spiritual i was speaking of the current political climate only what i read in the papers thats not enough lieutenant not nearly enough shipley reached over pressed another button and a portion of the burlwood fascia flipped down to expose a safe he opened it with a couple of deft twists extracted a greycoloured file it was bound with a wide royalblue ribbon that was stamped in gold with the seal of the president of the united states just below it in bold red capitals was stencilled eyes only shipley unbound this file as reverently as a priest handles a communion grail here he said placing the flat of his hand on the cover sheet is everything you need to know about the japan of today about its future and ours and about the death of lawrence moravia shipley drew out a photo a publicity still from the polished look of it of a menacinglooking individual with a determined jaw and one cloudy eye this is naoharu nishitsu as you must know from reading the papers he is the boss of the liberal democratic party to all intents and purposes japans one true political party the ldp is wealthy beyond our wildest dreams they are funded by annual contributions of enormous size from the countrys leading industrialists what has been kept a deliberate secret is that nishitsu runs the ldps powerful and dangerous ultraconservative wing recently we received an intelligence report that indicated many demonstrations and violent clashes attributed to a number of japans fanatical rightwing nationalist splinter groups are really conceived funded and condoned by this faction this means two things one that these groups previously thought unconnected underfunded and of no real consequence are in fact just the opposite and two that nishitsu is a major player in these escalating terrorist tactics subsequently this report was confirmed by another source wolf sawthat shipley was watching him carefully he supposed for any sign of a lapse in attention this is serious business lieutenant i cannot emphasize that enough in for instance the mayor of nagasaki was assassinated for daring to hint that the emperor of japan could in part be held responsible for world war two just eight months ago the prime minister was severely wounded just after he had called for a further opening of japan to american business interests the fanatics call these murderous attacks acts of justice nishitsu privately calls them heavens punishment the fact that these outright murders are being paid for by legitimate corporate japan is well we would have considered it absolutely unthinkable until our recent intelligence proved otherwise if you have the hard intelligence wolf said why not bring the evidence to the japanese government two problems there shipley said the japanese government currently has no idea of the extent of our intelligence network over there we have no intention of tipping them off to it also nishitsus people have so deeply infiltrated all levels of japanese government that we can no longer be certain who to trust over there this sounds like heavy weather it gets worse believe me over the prior eighteen months a number of prominent liberal members of the ldp have died a car crash here an apparent heart attack there others have been dogged by scandal and resigned in disgrace we did some further digging and now strongly suspect nishitsu of clearing out the liberals from the top of the ldp hierarchy so that now in each ensuing election the traditionalist the ultraconservative even most alarmingly of all the radical ldp candidates are being elected to office if the trend cannot be reversed and soon the entire tenor of japans political outlook will move further to the right than it was on the eve of pearl harbor shipley replaced nishitsus photo brought out a second one this also a publicity still but he did not yet give it to wolf this situation would be worthy of our most immediate attention even if that were all there was to it unfortunately for all of us it isnt hold it right there wolf said i might have rubbed elbows with some spooks in nam but that was a long time ago and the jargons changed just what does most immediate attention connote it is lieutenant just one small step below covert war status wolf turned away for a moment looking blindly out of the blackened windows recalling one by one the contents of the log cabin at hillwood the buckskins war bows weavings tomahawks he needed time to digest not only what shipley was telling him but the consequences of it at last he turned back i want to get this straight by covert war are you speaking of a status similar to the cold war relationship we had with the ussr yes i am christ wolf thought what the hell am i getting myself into he wondered whether he should tell shipley to stop the car right there and let him out never see him again but he knew he never would there was a familiar fire inside him now that would take him through to the end of this rapidly expanding investigation shall i continue wolf nodded it happens that there is more to nishitsu than even his terrorist funding shipley said most recently intelligence supplied by lawrence moravia by the way confirmed that nishitsu was also the leader of the toshin kuro kosai an organization known as the black blade society it is so clandestine that even most japanese have never heard of it its a cabal of and from now on i must say that we are dealing with speculation only influential people from all walks of japanese life business political bureaucratic yakuza whose purpose was and always had been to conquer the world but in their own way and in their own time it is said that in the toshin kuro kosai had argued against an aggressive imperialist japanese policy had argued some years later against attacking pearl harbor they it is further said knew enough not to underestimate the military strength and resolve of the united states but they were not as strong then as they are now and they were overruled by the allpowerful militaryindustrial complexes of the day known as zalbatsu that ultimately led their country to defeat in the war in the pacific accordingly the black blade society pulled in its horns went deep underground until after the postsurrender war crimes trials during the american occupation of their country had run their course then they emerged slowly in ones and twos stronger more influential than ever before we know that japans highspeed economic growth in the decades after the war was directed by members of the black blade society within the powerful ministry of international trade and industry and the heads of the new emerging industrial keiretsu their new name for the old zaibatsu think of it lieutenant this cabal conceived and executed economic policy for the entire country that would be dynamic not static for decades to come shipleys obvious admiration had been coerced out of him and that made his fear of these people all the more concrete can you imagine formulating such complex concepts in that would work well into the twentyfirst century our best minds still cant fathom it all look what the black blade society has fashioned japan into today an economic and technological colossus of previously unimaginable clout this is what we are up against lieutenant and now we have intelligence absolutely reliable independently corroborated that the black blade society is finally on the verge of gaining enough power to fulfil their dream the economic domination of the world now shipley handed over the second photo this is yuji shian the one man with influence enough to stop nishitsus rise to power it revealed a man with a thin unlined face his hair a glossy black worn unconventionally long so that it swung against his shoulders his eyes seemed as soft as a favourite uncles but in their depths wolf could see burning the fevered light of a strange unreadable emotion not rage not obsession but something just as hot naoharu nishitsu and yuji shian the one represents its entrenched radicals dreaming the traditional japanese dream of global domination the other the emergence of japans globally responsible new order the influencepeddling scandals of the last several years that have rocked the entire politicaleconomic infrastructure of japan have been a personal affront to shian and his has been the lone voice that time and again was raised in outrage against the traditional trading of confidential information and money thats a tacit part of almost every business and political arrangement in japan there is a whole new territory that nishitsu must conquer the powerful technocrats whose inventions will ensure the future economic security of japan in the twentyfirst century because of shians unparalleled stature among them his influence is of incalculable worth to nishitsu up until now shian has remained unmoved by nishitsus overtures but nishitsus power and influence are growing exponentially though shian is still scheduled to come here within the next six months on a lecture tour to try and persuade americans to see the new japan as it really is we can no longer rely on him shipley put the photo of yuji shian away it was moravias assignment to gather enough hard evidence against nishitsu to stop the toshin kuro kosais growing dominance in japan to bring nishitsu down once nishitsu is gone we can take our time in helping the new order in japan to dismantle the black blade society but someone got in moravias way shipley nodded grimfaced he pulled out a third photo this one grainy a blackandwhite with no depth of field surely a surveillance snap of a hatchetfaced japanese with short saltandpepper hair beetling brows eyes that even caught in shadow by the voyeurs lens seemed like holes punched in the fabric of the universe the man youre looking at is mizusumashi kafu the waterspider thats what his first name means but hes known as suma hes deceptively small for an assassin but dont let his size fool you shipley grunted waterspider jesus think of parents who would name him that the face in the photo had death written like a tattoo across it wolf thought he said you think suma iced moravia could be shipley said sliding the photo back into the dossier hes toshin kuro kosai and hes here in the us can you be more specific if i could i would shipley said a bit stiffly at that moment the lincoln lurched to the left rocking on its heavyduty shocks and shipleys file shifted on his lap another surveillance photo came into view and wolf catching the wedge of an image asked to see it shipley complied it was another grainy snap with a long lens of suma the black blade societys assassin and now wolf could get a sense of how small the man was he was crossing the street a street wolf could see by a sign in the background somewhere in tokyo however he seemed not to be alone because his face was turned slightly off true front as if he were in the midst of a conversation with the person next to him wolf looked again and a third time just to be sure but he was sure mentally he removed suma from the picture added a ricepaper umbrella despite the graininess despite the angle and not being able to see all of the person walking next to suma he recognized the face he was looking at the exquisite japanese woman he had seen last evening when he was parked outside the art gallery urban decay anything special i should know about this photo wolf asked standard surveillance photo suma in tokyo fall of last year shipley said thats about it wolf wondered whether he should tell shipley about the girl decided not to he knew nothing about her and it was a sure bet that either shipley knew the same nothing or he wasnt telling wolf everything he knew spooks were like that they couldnt help themselves either way it paid to keep this to himself at least for the time being he handed back the photo said casually is suma the black blade societys only assassin hardly shipley said rebinding the file putting it carefully away in the safe we have no clear estimate of how many they could have and so cannot trace all their movements but its a certainty that one of them murdered lawrence moravia he rubbed his forehead in that regard remember i told you we knew that nishitsu was getting rid of his opposition inside the ldp well we now have evidence slim but accurate that he has begun the same process here what wolf sat up as if he had been hit by a bolt of lightning over the past six months two legislators have died both under mysterious circumstances hitandrun car a malfunctioning elevator and both were liberal in their stance on japanese economic restrictions yuji shians people so to speak now the hardliners are gaining power and we believe it is all part of the toshin kuro kosais plan i dont follow you how clever nishitsu and his black blade society are just imagine lieutenant the ohsodelicate economic detente the two nations have now will be ruptured perhaps irretrievably for some time there has been a solid base in the us congress to take a hard line with japan now between the radical shift in japanese policy and the consolidation of power of our hardline legislators the consequences will be dire major trade barriers will form blocking japanese imports of cars electronics home computers and then the retribution will come the flow of vital computer technology will dry up the armed forces the pentagon cia dea defense our nations entire security network depends on japanese computer chips what will happen to us when we can no longer get them when japan sells them to the western european nations even the former eastern bloc countries but not to us he leaned close enough for wolf to suspect he was wearing coloured contact lenses we do not believe that america would long remain competitive on a worldwide basis without the help of the cutting edge japanese technocrats and falling from competition we would surely experience a debilitating and humbling economic decline so rapid that only nishitsus people already being salted among the ceos of the worlds largest multinational conglomerates could save us but at what price they would own us lock stock and computer chip we would be under their economic thumb for ever the town car slid to a halt and the door opened wolf climbed out after shipley to find himself back at the terminal of national airport yoshida stared at him for a moment before looking away the sky had lightened a little but the air was heavy with the incipience of a storm youve come this far on your own lieutenant shipley said so its only fair to warn you if youre going after the black blade society youll be going after everything he guided wolf away from the kerb and its crowd of people take it from me i know these people think very clearly if you take one more step in this investigation they will not allow you to back out theyll come after you as they did with moravia but you have an advantage as you said youre not a civilian what is it youre not telling me shipley i beg your pardon back there at millwood you didnt want any part of me because you thought id be a security risk then i mentioned the cmes report on moravia and you couldnt wait to brief me why wolf could tell that shipley did not want to go on i promise you i wont leave until you tell me what it is shipley nodded a brief painful acquiescence a rumour he said it is said among those who know toshin kuro kosai members that there is something subtly different about them no one knows precisely what it is but they do not seem at odds with the ravages of time wolf not certain he had heard correctly said can you translate that the stories circulating much like those of vampires and werewolves indicate that those within the black blade society age at a slower rate than you or i thats nonsense wolf said but the vipers were again uncoiling in his gut there are people all over the world who dont look their age were both sceptics lieutenant shipley said imagine then my interest when you told me of the cmes report on moravia he looked quickly around saw yoshida standing watch turned back to wolf i have no choice now but to ask you to work with me we need your help lieutenant desperately if there is even a shred of truth to the rumours of their longevity he paused as if the notion had robbed him of breath the consequences of their rise to power would be multiplied a hundred a thousandfold they must be stopped lieutenant and you must stop them wait a minute wolf said this sounds as if im going into a final mission maybe you are shipley said his breath coming in hard little bursts by taking down two of our senators nishitsu and his crowd have crossed the line his eyes sharp pebbles were now glossed over by the reflection from their coloured lenses i know what youre thinking lieutenant and youve made the correct deduction weve gone to covert war status with japan four tokyo new york city shoto wakare received his encoded instructions while he was in the shower he emerged beads of chill water on his superbly toned hairless flesh to see the seven sheets lying in the receiving bin of his portable fax machine padding across the room he stared down at the series of numbers which would mean nothing to anybody without the electronic decoding device with which yoshida had provided him his morning routine never varied he arose at four slipped into workout clothes drove his body as hard as he could for exactly two hours by that time his flesh was shiny with sweat and his muscles were pumped up to a point where he felt justified in spending fifteen minutes admiring their definition in just the way he went once a week to a museum to admire modern japanese works of art in a warm shower he shaved arms underarms legs then with a violent twist turned the water cold cleansing himself in the icy stream until his teeth chattered and the skin beneath his fingernails was blue always then he stood naked and dripping in front of yet another fulllength mirror staring at his penis which the intense cold had made small he bent his knees and beat upon the flexed muscles of his thighs until the skin turned red and he was vibrating from the pain the first thing he saw upon emerging from the bathroom was a framed photo of yukio mishima the samuraipoet who had committed harakiri in in order to dramatize to an uncomprehending nation a death of uniqueness the dissolution of traditional japanese values in the noisome cauldron of the ethos of the west in the photo mishima naked in the position of crucifixion phalluslike arrows sticking out of him had studiously aped the famous painting of the death of st sebastian to whose life he was so strongly drawn and no wonder sebastian had been a member of the roman praetorian guard while secretly a christian when his secret was revealed to the emperor diocletian ordered his archers to execute the soldiersaint the secret mystic existing within the warriors body whose fate was to become a martyr seemed to wakare to be the ultimate symbol of mishimas brief tortured life now as wakare naked and powerful bent to his task of deciphering his latest instructions he had cause to think of mishima and st sebastian wakare too worshipped the human body the eroticism of the male form was not lost on him as it was on so many more ordinary men with a pang as sharp as any pain wakare placed his palm across the array of number series on the seven pages that had been sent him they were oblivious unmoved by his passion but he involved in such dispassionate work as this could feel the blood surge in his veins as he thought about his friend yuji shian who he was terrified to approach on such a matter yuji who was such a master of the postmodern world yet was possessed of the special fire yukio mishima marked and made immortal in the poetry of his fiction wakare blinked took his hand away saw the stain of his sweat like stigmata upon the stark mathematics of the encoded message a stigmata he was terrified yuji would see appear on his face should he tell him of his desire yet it wasnt only men that wakare longed for sex in any form fascinated him he adored for example the japanese female impersonators who were intelligent sensitive perfect they were not the mincing highcamp performers of execrable standards with which leering westerners were familiar no as mishima understood these japanese were artists of the highest rank only a man freed from the impurities of the female personality could accurately portray a woman with such exquisite perfection creating an ideal that was far beyond life itself to create if the truth be known wakare despised life as he suspected mishima had done because it was so imperfect he lived for the imminence of the ideal in his body as in almost all other things he was to be disappointed the chaos of the universe worked continually against perfection eating away at all creation which he was certain must begin in some unseen and unknowable state of lawlessness wakare longed to be witness to that blinding instant of perfection the one moment of the paradigm before the inexorable trine of chaos time random chance entropy commenced their revolution of destruction and as he grew slowly older he suspected with more and more certainty that that moment would be up to him alone and that it would involve his death because as mishima had realized death was its own purification being at once the final release from the tyranny of the group that bound all japanese and the ultimate indemnity of the debt one owed to the group it took him five minutes to decode his instructions fortyfive minutes to encode the weekly intelligence digest on the latest movements of black blade society operatives worldwide their postings by country city and corporation he looked at the list very impressive even to him scary even he supposed to the opposition very good he sent the encoded fax then took the sheets into the bathroom set fire to them and when he felt the flames on his fingertips dropped the ashes into the toilet flushing them away he met minako in a theatre where a choir of young women dressed as samuraiintraining sang with an angelic fervour and danced with a ethereal grace that brought tears to the eyes of the audience almost all men when the show was over wakare and minako strolled through the neon bustle of the ginza the two of them dwarfed by the enormous signs and billboards the even more stupendous buildings thank you for meeting me i have nowhere else to turn minako said as my son yujis closest friend you hold a special place in his world which is why i must speak candidly with you it is true that yujisan and i are close wakare said carefully but our relationship is a precarious one at best its a wonder to me we are still friends a testament to the two of you minako said wakare smiled so like a woman he thought to believe our bond is a matter simply of our maleness to minako he said perhaps but then we too have a special friendship eh i could not imagine taking any other woman to the show we have just seen he smiled he seemed to be enjoying the sunshine even winters wan rays being out of his office for the day wakare was viceminister of the industrial policy bureau of miti miti was japans allpowerful ministry of international trade and industry it would be impossible to overvalue mitis influence on all phases of life in japan it was this ministry for instance which dictated industrial policy for the entire country during japans period of highspeed growth from the midfifties all the way into the s by giving incentives to companies willing to invest in the new emerging industries of electronics and computers miti was able fluidly to guide japan to the astounding economic dominance it currently enjoyed the fact that i am head of the chosaka the research section of the bureau and could make or break any one of yujis lab discoveries is enough to make our friendship potentially dangerous wakare said then there is the matter of my being toshin kuro kosai that is a bond between us minako acknowledged certainly it was why you were chosen to head up the chosaka but it was you personally who got me the job minakosan for that i owe a debt i can never adequately repay wakare said but since we are speaking candidly excuse me if i say that i have wondered whether any personal motives were at play in my appointment after all i could be of immense help to yuji do you believe me that devious he shrugged it hardly matters your son is incorruptible he would no more accept a favour from me than he would shove someone off a bridge to him both actions constitute an act of lawlessness i truly hope you are wrong minako sighed you cannot understand the pain i feel in asking you to help me but i have no choice we must somehow get yuji to agree to join forces with nishitsu and his liberal democrats of course i will do whatever you ask of me minakosan but you know you are asking the impossible perhaps she said then inclined her head but perhaps not her lips curled into a tiny smile this is what i will propose i want you to enter into a kind of conspiracy with my son i what i dont follow you wakare seemed startled i mean to say thats not dont know whether im cut out for conspiracies you will like this one minako said confidently i guarantee it i want you to approach yuji do it in a neutral setting outside the scope of business go out to dinner and a show perhaps when he is at his most relaxed i want you to confess wakare felt his heart lurch again confess what that you are a member of the black blade society what forgive me minakosan but that will surely mean the end of my friendship with yuji if you believe that youve seriously underestimated my son minako said consider shotosan he knows of your fondness for yukio mishima and all he stood for and i think he respects you for it yuji knows your heart is pure that is what is important to him but telling him i am toshin kuro kosai will intrigue him minako finished for him you must understand yuji is in many ways a naif in his mind the black blade society is a purely political organization whose membership is unknown he has no sense at all that only those gifted with the sight are members and hopefully hell never learn that but even as a purely political organization yuji would find the black blade societys virulently reactionary posture abhorrent not to say dangerous to everything yuji believes in im counting on that minako said she smiled imagine how intrigued he will be once you reveal your plot to replace nishitsu with yourself id be mad to say such a thing to anyone but yuji yes minako said but telling him is like telling a dead man she waited while several punks ran by black boots clattering coloured mohawk haircuts bobbing and telling him you want to bring him into the toshin kuro kosai will make sense to him the two of you together will have enough power to effect changes in the society hell see that right away wakare considered this but to do that i will have to reveal nishitsusans involvement in the black blade society again i urge you to have faith in your friend yuji he is a powerful man with a powerful mind the very fact of nishitsus involvement will act as a magnet for him minako stopped looked at wakare trust me well get yuji and nishitsu together yuji will believe he is working on your behalf to destroy nishitsu and nishitsu will be content with yujis presence for the time being wakare said dubiously minako nodded events are moving very fast now thats all the time we will need there was a crew busily stripping off bloody plaster respackling and painting his office when wolf returned from dc it was just after seven and he was scheduled to pick amanda up at ten for the party her sister stevie was throwing at a downtown club he was about to phone her to cancel when he thought better of it he was tired but too wound up to sleep and maybe amanda was right a little r and r in the midst of the bedlam coming down sounded pretty good to him he checked in with squire richards who brought him up to date on calls but the only one he was looking for from harrison the cme hadnt materialized he put in a call was told harrison was currently not in the building though he was expected to return wolf went back down the dropclothed corridor to the shower hed had installed in the publicsized mens toilet they were painting here too christ the entire place was crawling with them hayes walker johnson flexing the mighty muscles of his authority the lone painter here was a japanese as compact and burly as a miniature sumo working high up on a spackleencrusted ladder he wore torn overalls hooked over bare shoulders adamant with dense muscle though his steely hair and the lines in his face indicated that he was decades older than his fellow workers the lines of his body seemed ageless he nodded to wolf went back to his work on the muddy plaster of the ceiling wolfs shower was punctuated by the soft booms and slaps occasioned by chunks of rotting plaster crashing to the dropcloth spread over the blackandwhite tiled floor drying off and dressing in new clothes pulled from his locker he stared up at the painter thought ill never look at a japanese the same way again have you been with the department long he called out the painter stopped his work with the plaster looked down at wolf not long he said then is there a problem how long wolf asked him he put down his tool came down the ladder maybe you think of me as a potential security risk he said as he wiped his hands on his overalls is it because im japanese he turned away began to clean up well i get that all the time that doesnt make it right but i guess its a fact of life ill have to live with if i want to stay in america wolf thinking of his mother of the wind river shoshone his own childhood was abruptly ashamed his talk with shipley had made him paranoid hed forgotten how proximity with a spook could do that to you it had also he thought now scared the hell out of him was it any wonder he was seeing spooks in every dark corner hed have to watch that forget it he said i was just curious and it had nothing to do with you being japanese the painter turned back ran his hands down the legs of his overalls again he made a motion more than a nod of his head perhaps a modernday formal bow okay if i get back to work sure wolf said throwing his damp towel into the wire basket against the wall dont let me get in the way he went back down the hall still slightly disturbed by his newly acquired prejudice found squire richards looking for him just got a message lieutenant he said trotting up tonys found the black firebird tony three times was waiting for them on a pier at west rd street the oily dark hudson slapped at the rotting timbers and the smell of sulphur was intense wolf looked out at the water saw yellowish snowflakes disappearing into it as if into a vat of acid behind them burned out tenements abandoned to the wrecking ball of some contractor now in chapter were rilled to overflowing with families filthy and destitute who had abandoned all hope of looking for the american dream it was another of the crack cities that had grown up like cankers throughout the city and as if to underscore the insufficiency of these brownstone husks the side streets debouching onto the piers that a century before had helped make new york the premier seaport on the east coast were clogged with makeshift shanties of cardboard and pressed tin fires burning before their cavelike entrances gave the whole the aspect of a medieval village tony three times led them out onto the pier where the black firebird hulked like some prehistoric monster its shell throwing back in distortion the night lights of the city the interior was scorched and some of the paintwork on the hood and the roof was scarred by heat blackened with soot looks to me like someone started the fire after the car was dumped here lieutenant tony three times said training his flashlight on the car fuckin kids high on junk torching it squire richards said flicking on his own flashlight maybe wolf said ducking into the interior but if it was kids he thought why did they torch something as valuable as a set of wheels more kicks to be had driving it down the sawmill river parkway at one hundred miles per he sniffed thought immediately of bobby connors story of a blue fireball the heat coming off arquillos stonedead face the flicker of a phantom flame along his cheekbone he sniffed again found no traces of lighter fluid or gasoline the first signs of arson he took out a steel stylus from his leather aviators jacket pocket poked around the blackened rubble of the front seat and dashboard the glove compartment had been melted shut by the fire so he asked tony three times who made a speciality of getting into locked things to pop it inside he found burned crisps of paper black flakes of the interior material he poked the stylus in deeper until he encountered the back wall nothing in the right corner nothing along the rear perimeter but the tip of the stylus punctured something wedged into the left corner he drew it out brought it into the snowy night tony three times shone his flashlight onto it what the hell is that squire richards said a piece of trapunto wolf said turning the square of woven fabric around one side singed yes but the rest of it though stinking of smoke whole and recognizable as material used by the japanese artist chika yuji shian signed off on a memo that would create shian kogaku telephone cards these plastic wafers would be distributed to the companys best accounts political and bureaucratic allies giving them prepaid time from any public phone a hologram of the shian kogaku logo filled the centre of the cards and when the telephone time was used up would turn them into valuable collectors items great marketing idea yuji thought another example of the reality of our advertising tag line shian kogaku we are always with you yuji took in succession calls from singapore taipei silicone valley and lastly hong kong when he was finished he pushed back his chair laced his fingers behind his neck stared out at the gleaming towers of tokyo although yuji was so high up he could still see the summer sun bloated and reddened by pollution the streets surrounding the hammacho station were plunged into shadow so deep he knew it must seem like evening to the hordes of people rushing by so far below him yuji grunted he wondered what it was like to be down there in the artificial twilight running running always running he wondered what it was like to live in one room with three roommates to eat soba buckwheat noodles from sidewalk stalls at every meal because that was all you could afford and some nights going without food at all it had taken him many years to understand this as the basis for his friendship with shoto wakare though it seems like so long ago that destitute wretch might have been another me living another life i have not forgotten what it is like to be poor in tokyo wakare had once told him the two of them on an allnight drunk it would be shameful to allow myself to forget such an important lesson having nothing prepares you for nothing save having nothing again having nothing had never been yuji shians problem he had been born into a family with a thriving mercantile business generations old that had been passed down on his mother minakos side from daughter to daughter traditionally these matriarchal firms were run from behind the scenes by the women while the men they had chosen in marriage fronted them even to the point of taking their family name as their own yujis father had been something different a banker by profession he had agreed to marry minako and take the shian name but he had quickly grown discontented with the restrictions inherent in a midsized mercantile firm accordingly he proposed moving shian kogaku from osaka to tokyo buying a nearly bankrupt commercial bank as their core kobun or company turning it around and using its newfound strength to buy other kobun to build shian kogaku into a keiretsu of the first rank minako as ambitious as her new husband had agreed but it was only afterwards when the deed was done and all her assets had been ploughed into the bank to help it turn around that yujis father told her that she could no longer run shian kogaku even behind the scenes if even a hint that she was involved should get out to his business contacts he told her the company would be dead no one would want to do business with a company run by a woman no one would take such a venture seriously minako had come from a long line of businesswomen accustomed to skilfully handling their own affairs without male interference perhaps there were some who might have said this will kill her but it did not kill minako as had always been the case in her life men even the ones closest to her had underestimated her the exquisite exterior hid a tough shrewd interior one that was resilient and held its own secrets i understand minako dutifully said when her husband had told her of his decision and without a word of protest had given up all involvement in her own company this was my punishment for being a woman minako had once told yuji but years later it occurred to yuji that she had not taken her punishment lying down from that day on her relationship with her husband had changed drastically and when at length he died of a heart attack having seen his dream for shian kogaku come true yuji was unsure what had killed him overwork or his wifes coldness in truth minako shed no tears for him and as for him several years before his premature death he said to yuji during a drunken bout if you trust a woman you will eventually be disembowelled yuji shivered thinking of how this poison had affected his own life he had married a woman as weak as his mother was strong this irony was hardly lost on him but he felt unable to change course had he even fallen in love with her who could tell yuji was consumed by his work he delighted in the knowledge that he had turned his love of biogenetics into a fullblown business venture that added to what his father had given his life to build shian kogaku now boasted successful kobun in computer hardware advanced laser technology and the budding biosciences yujis wife was beautiful delicate and fragile a porcelain doll whom he could admire as all his associates admired her in a way she was another symbol of his burgeoning success having come from a prominent samurai family whose lineage could be traced back to edo the capital in the s yuji had had only one child a son and quite naturally yuji drove him in his studies as he had been driven by his father the boy grew strong and handsome and if he was not quite first in his class yuji had high hopes that he would be first before he graduated but last year yuji and his wife were suddenly called to the school his son attended sallowfaced school officials conducted them to the critical ward of the nearby hospital where yujis son lay in an irreversible coma he had tried to commit suicide by hanging himself from a beam in his room it took him three weeks to die it took yujis wife three months heartbreak can do that to you he had read he had never believed it however until he saw it happening to his wife she stepped in front of a subway train at the height of rush hour when pressed city officials politely said they had adequate safeguards against such an occurrence a tragic accident the police called it but he knew better she walked off that platform as surely as he was sitting here watching the industrial haze strangle tokyo all his influence and he could do nothing to save her at that point yuji suspected his wife had been particularly determined watching her being buried it occurred to him that he had never before been aware that she could be so in control of her life for the first time she reminded him of his mother and he hated her for secretly harbouring this hideous strength in her bosom like a poisonous viper in the weeks and months that followed he found himself gripped by an odd manic mood he could not dispel he hit all the night spots drank gambled fornicated and wherever he was seen there were always two nubile women on his arm his halfsister hana could see what he did not that this mania was merely a manifestation of the guilt and selfloathing he felt but could not face for his role in his sons death she told him this later when she saw the mania burning itself out and she felt confident about reaching into the psychic fire without getting burned herself hana had saved him from himself hana and his work on the oracle hana he had said one sorrowful night what did you think of my wife hanas eyes moved slowly to settle on his face from the first day of your marriage your wife had her life and you had yours she had said in that direct way of hers that he found almost painful were we really estranged from the very beginning that was the way you wanted it no he said slowly i didnt i couldnt you seem to forget that you always get what you want yujisan he had thought a moment feeling her hand warm and pulsing in his she was beautiful though wasnt she beauty hana had said is like a curtain or a frieze a facade that only hints at the life behind the surface you understand about that i wish you could tell me what its like to absorb life in that way i think its impossible to communicate in any language she said but that really doesnt matter since you already possess the ability my curse why do you call your sight a curse isnt it he said i did not see my sons death nor my wifes i can neither see the future nor predict it i can on occasion see possibilities many paths branching from the single moment of the present cant you understand how something like that could drive you insane if you could look at your life from death to birth it might drive you insane too she said but suppose that you were misunderstanding this ability what do you mean imagine that the present was not after all a single moment as you have defined it but instead a multiplicity of choices like an explosion at each fraction of a second in that event seeing the many paths created by such explosions would have a kind of logic and once you began to learn the vernacular of that logic they might even start to have meaning for you i dont understand not yet perhaps what would he do without her yuji rubbed his eyes looked at the time then grabbing his coat he left the building he ducked into his waiting bmw said to his driver hanas it was dark by the time wolf arrived at the graffitiblanketed redbrick tenement on east sixth street just off avenue c the snow had changed to sleet then back again to snow downstairs was a clothing store called la mort cest moi very pleasant wolf peered through the steel gates every item in the window was black and looked as if it was made to fit frankensteins monster perhaps it was closed because no one wanted to wear that stuff any more but he doubted it he went around the corner and put his foot to the accelerator swung around west on east fifth then north to the corner of east sixth he pulled over killed the engine and the lights he got out and went cautiously down the block lights were on in the apartment moun had said belonged to chika but wolf could not see through the opaque shades keeping to the shadows he headed for the tenement doorway he popped the lock went inside the tenement hallway was lit by a flyspecked fifteenwatt bulb the feeble light exaggerating shadows obscuring corners hid more than it revealed the stink of urine and excrement was nauseating a huge old german shepherd with the worst case of mange wolf had ever seen sat curled at the foot of the stairs licking the bare pink patches on its flanks its head came up yellow eyes luminous as it stared at him wolf saw its nostrils flare as it scented him then its head lowered the tongue came out and it went back to work the rhythmic lapping sound was grating he stepped over the dog went up the filthy stairs the bannister was greasy and at the first landing he was certain the dark brown stains on the wall were dried blood he wondered briefly whose head had been busted here and by whom oddly for a bottom of the barrel tenement there were only two doors on this floor for it appeared oversized front and rear apartments he checked out the one filthy window that led onto an iron fire escape he ran his hand along the rough plastered walls feeling places where doors to the other apartments had once been despite the stink and slime downstairs someone had been doing a lot of renovating up here he stood for a moment listening to the ambient sounds of the old building it was important to get a sense of the natural sounds of the environment so that when some new noise wasintroduced you could pick it up immediately he went to the front door of chikas apartment put his ear to the door but could hear nothing once he would have just gone up to the door and knocked using the same cover hed put on moun but not after washington seeing chika in the company of suma the waterspider and certainly not after finding a piece of her trapunto in the black firebird if she had driven the getaway car for suma or even worse for him if she had been the one to off junior ruiz and arquillo he would not want to approach her frontally shed already know who he was and he reminded himself if she had been responsible for the double homicide he would not be able to read her aura he moved away from the door there was no way in here he put his ear to the door of the rear apartment heard skinny puppy grinding out a gutwrenching monotone song on the tenants stereo no entry here either he thought abruptly he twitched knelt and his piece came out aimed down the black stairwell he heard something soft sounds on the stairs ascending he tried to find an aura failed suma crouched down waiting he thought of sumas face the waterspiders eyes like pits into infinity he blinked concentrated on the black hole leading down to the first floor his finger taut on the trigger waiting for suma cmon you sonuvabitch he thought come up here and take a bullet through the heart in a moment the old shepherd padded laboriously into view one of its rear legs must have been broken at one time because the dog was limping badly the shepherd stared at him then began to lick the muzzle of his service revolver he let out a longheld breath his mouth jerked in the semblance of a smile then he bolstered his gun got back to work he prised open the window that led out onto the fire escape climbed out into the dank night he stood for a moment on the fire escape listening to the city pulse on around him it was like a leviathan whose heart throbbed on despite its grubby decaying flesh there was life wolf thought even in the moment of dying the greasy snow had collected on the iron runners of the fire escape and he had to make his way carefully it had turned colder and his exhalations emerged as puffs of steam wolf turned his attention to the pair of double windows of chikas apartment what he had thought from the street were shades he saw now was a form of pigment smeared on the glass of the new panes from the inside swirls of iridescent black paint turned the glass translucent light streamed through it but it was impossible to make out details of what or who was inside wolf crouched down testing one window after another the first three were locked but the last one was open a crack he lifted the window an inch at a time it made no noise then he ducked into a horizontal position slipped inside the apartment he was in a dark room at first he heard nothing then slowly as if his ears had to adjust to a different environment he heard the heavy thrumming as of an engine or a compressor slowly and carefully he made his way through the room he was aware of shapes as of massive furniture covered by dropcloths used when painting or leaving a place vacant for a long time cautiously he lifted a corner up saw jagged pieces of burned metal covered with trapunto sculptures being born careful he thought be patient he crept towards a door beyond was the living room he could see no one in there so he went through the door the walls of the living room were bare except for one painting in an ornate gilt frame it was large and set into the bottom of the frame was a plaque with its title the salon in the rue des moulins wolf stared at the painting powerful and erotic of the whores of paris in their shabbiness in the informality the naturalness of their nakedness in their acceptance of fornication resided their humanity he had never before seen whores depicted as human beings never before considered that motherhood and scandalous sex could coexist in one person and he found himself drawn to the moral paradox the painting presented at length the signature in the corner of the painting drew his eye henri de toulouselautrec christ he thought could this be the original he peered more closely but he was no art expert what would it be worth if it was the original millions hundreds of millions more like it he left the living room not because he wanted to but because he had to in the kitchen he found the source of the thrumming an enormous generator behind a door with no lock or knob he found a professionally equipped darkroom a battery of nikon leica and hasselblad cameras lenses tripods and spotlights a small refrigerator held boxes of film on top of it stacks of round plastic containers housed filters of every variety wolf thought of the photos in moravias cubicle could chika have been the photographer could she have been the model could she have been both he went back across the living room on the outside of his soles the newly laid wooden floor was so shiny he could see his imperfect reflection in its surface another door this one half opened wolf stood so that his shadow would not cross the threshold in this way he could see a good wedge of the room beyond there was a distinct scent emanating from the room it seemed vaguely familiar but wolf could not remember where he had smelted it abruptly there was movement and he had to fight the instinct to move in response he felt a prickling along his spine as he watched the silhouette of the exquisite japanese woman he had seen across the avenue from urban decay who had shown up with suma in the defense department surveillance photo this was chika the artist who in some way had insinuated herself into lawrence moravias life was she an innocent who happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time or was she the assassin the black blade society had sent to take care of moravia he continued to watch transfixed she was staring at something on the side of the room that wolf could not see she turned her body and the silhouette resolved into threedimensional flesh warm lamplight flowed slowly sinuously over chikas flank throwing her high hard breasts into prominence she stretched her legs as if readying herself for a strenuous exercise she was naked the light was strange as if it had been combined with mist or syrup as if wolf could actually see it moving coiling and dripping in attenuated tears she ran a hand over her breast down her rib cage over her flat belly the hand lowered further disappeared into a triangular forest of shadow he could smell that scent foreign and yet peculiarly familiar he drank it in trying to recall where he had first smelled it her lips parted as she altered her stance subtly it was now more erotic as if she were opening herself in some unfathomable way then with her other hand she pressed a spot low on her spine and her hips canted forward her hand moving moving she made a tiny moan wolf could feel the feral beating of his heart as heavy as the thrumming of the engine somewhere in the apartment he knew he should turn around and as bobby would say get outta there but he could not move his felt as if his feet were nailed to the floor as if his lungs were breathing liquid oxygen there was sex here to be sure powerful and magnetic but he knew there was something more an aspect hidden as significant as it was seductive there was a sense about this of a performance disturbing in the manner of the photos of female bondage of her sculptures but for whom and why those thighs luscious meat moved beneath taut skin the colour and intensity of bronze the long developed muscles began to bunch and knot and abruptly there was a line of tension that marred the side of her neck curiously this marring like a scar became an added excitement as if wolf were seeing a secret part of her inaccessible to the outside world those thighs were trembling now chika almost rocking in the last throes of her selfinduced ecstasy he could hear the soft uhuhuh as the primitive sounds were pushed up through her diaphragm out of her mouth her eyelids fluttered but her gaze never wavered wolf rapt as he was still longed to see what she saw to know what she was thinking to understand the nature of her performance if it was a performance at all what would the answers tell him and then as abruptly as a sharks dorsal fin rising from water he entertained the mad notion that suma was actually in the room with chika that together they had lured him here in order to set him up for a kill here in this strange apartment with this eerie japanese woman to whom he was curiously and powerfully drawn and of whom he was inexplicably afraid he abruptly felt more naked than she so exposed that he shivered he should have been able to feel sumas or anyone elses aura but he encountered only impenetrable blackness abruptly overcome by the cloying fetor of the chaos that was destroying his understanding of the world he retreated out onto the snowcovered fire escape ducked back inside the secondfloor hallway he put his hand on the sweaty bannister or perhaps it was his hand that was sweating he shivered the cold seemed to pierce to the core of him all of a sudden still he could not leave he stared at the secondfloor apartment his instinct told him that he had managed to avoid a cleverly set trap that he now had a unique chance to trap the wouldbe trappers wait he thought be patient see who comes out within twenty minutes the lights were extinguished in the secondfloor apartment and several moments later chika emerged from the tenement no one was with her and somehow now he was certain she had been alone up there it was as if with her on the street he encountered no trouble scanning the apartment and feeling its lack of human aura she was dressed much as she had been yesterday high heels black micro skirt oversized bomber jacket her black leather bag was thrown over one shoulder she searched in it for a moment before heading east away from where wolf was hidden in the shadows of a doorway her heels made dull sounds against the slushcovered pavement he started after her the snow was coming down harder again the sky had a fragile powdery look like old gums into which the rotting teeth of the citys pestinfested tenements were loosely set around the corner two blocks south he saw her strid ing down the avenue she passed through steam venting from the sewers disappeared reappeared in silhouette he did not have to keep her in sight the sound of her chrome heels striking the pavement was enough to lead him on at east second street she turned back west he was struck by how she walked with complete confidence as if she had no fear of anything or anyone around her he dropped back suddenly aware that he was closing the distance between them when he got her in sight again he saw that she had been stopped by a pair of slum kids they wore baseball jackets hightopped sneakers black jeans the uniform of the streets the sides of their heads were shaved but elsewhere there were great bristly thickets of hair shiny with gel one carried a pigsticker a crude knife with a footlong blade the other held a hockey stick with razor blades affixed with black electricians tape to its curved blade the kid with the doctored stick was tapping it impatiently on the pavement while his buddy swung the pigsticker through the snowy night in one arc parallel to her breasts a second parallel to her groin the kids laughed wildly wolf wondered what combination of drugs they were on the kids were close to chika now and wolf knew he had to make a decision he did not want to show himself but he could not let the punks hurt her he was working on a cover story she might believe about why he was where he was at this time of the night when she took the decision out of his hands chika withdrew her left hand from her pocketbook and wolf could see the glint of a gun it was made of blued steel the reliable workmanlike model of a professional it was clear by how she stood legs spread how she aimed the pistol first at the head of one punk then the other that she knew precisely what she was doing she said something to the kids that must have unnerved them even more than the weapon because the kid with the pigsticker let it drop as the two of them turned and ran she stayed in her marksmans position until she was certain the punks would not return then she replaced the gun in her pocketbook but did not withdraw her hand wolf guessed that she had had hold of the pistol from the moment she had left the tenement on east sixth street he followed saw her turn north when she got to second avenue she stopped in front of the facade of a funeral parlour it had some unreadable name being square in the middle of the ukrainian district light streamed through the thick yellow pebbled glass on either side of the wooden front doors the sidewalk was jammed with street people shuffling muttering or just staring into space as they waited in some kind of line wolf watched the head of the line as it wound up at the front doors to the funeral parlour where people were being served food by a corpulent sweating funeral director for a moment wolf watched his face as expressions flitted over the flat planes distaste pity relief satisfaction it was strange thinking of this man tending the dead by day then feeding the living by night but there was a cruel symmetry that seemed to fit this graniteedged city a kind of rough justice wolf pulled back into the shadows of a doorway just before chika looked quickly around cursing as he stumbled over a man wrapped in newspapers the stench of sterno was overpowering git outta my house the newspaperwrapped man growled thickly find yer own place tflop wolf glanced back down the avenue in time to see a hearse without a rear licence plate pull up in front of the funeral parlour it was new metallic charcoal and chrome shining like a cue ball in the lurid yellow light the newspaperwrapped man began batting ineffectually at wolfs shins chika stepped smartly off the kerb and to wolfs amazement opened the back of the hearse with a practised twist of her wrist and climbed in the hearse took off son of a bitch wolf said stepping out into the street as the hearse disappeared into the truck traffic rumbling uptown five new york city tokyo wolf and amanda arrived at la mentira a rock club between avenues b and a just after eleven on their way downtown they had to detour off park avenue south because an enormous granite tower had collapsed inwards the structure ironically the home office of a giant insurance company was surrounded and supported by a complex spiderweb of wooden scaffolding crawling up its bottom half the naked light bulbs draped in tiers threw an eerie blue light upon the disaster but the new aluminium street lights were nowhere in evidence having been uprooted by looters to be sold on the flourishing black market for scrap metal it seemed to wolf that there was little sense of the modern world here the cracks and fissures the canted outer walls gave the building an entirely new aspect it was as if he were looking at the decaying remnants of the hanging gardens of babylon they say theres a hole under there as big as the holland tunnel wolf said nodding in the buildings direction you can bet traffic will be screwed up around here for at least a year and forget about using the lex subway in our lifetime the only ones not suffering are the street people theyve got miles of new warrens to explore and settle into he looked over at amanda scrunched into the far corner of the seat but she said nothing downtown the street along which la mentira was set was ankle deep in litter blowing here and there in tiny windlashed spirals the ancient tenements that long ago had forgotten their first tony owners had that carapace of black grit peculiar to new york that even steam cleaning would not penetrate young people as thin and bent as whippets clattered down the filthy disintegrating sidewalk in their black boots black jeans or tights black chromestudded leather jackets thick chains and spiked spurs jingling rhythmically all of them boys and girls alike had multiple earrings many had nose studs or rings a city sanitation truck so covered with graffiti wolf could not tell what colour it had originally been painted rumbled down the street although there were plenty of dented garbage cans filled to overflowing the truck passed them all by two thin black urchins with reeboks on their feet and walkman earphones around their heads sat in the enormous hopper at the back picking through unmashed trash they could not have been more than eight or nine years old at the end of the block the urchins leapt out and clutching their loot ran screaming around the corner onto avenue b he parked the car illegally and they got out arching above their heads he could see la mentiras mudspattered black and yellow awning with its rather too explicit painting of a bigbreasted egyptian queen holding a skull in one hand a shape that looked suspiciously like a male member in the other seeing several japanese in the throng filing in amanda said i hear a lot of stories on campus about the japanese she had been utterly silent on the way downtown but when he had commented on it she had merely turned her head looked out of the window he had never quite got used to this closed side of her perhaps the detective in him was disturbed by her refusal to talk about these odd black moods conjured up malevolent conspiracies whole other lives as explanation in any case he was happy she was talking again what kinds of stories oh you know so many people these days even in academia seem prejudiced against them so theres always some juicy bit of catty gossip about the japanese professors they dont mingle too well and many of my colleagues think of them as having a superior attitude and what do you think wolf asked amanda sighed i havent been able to make friends with any of them but on the other hand it seems to me theyre appalled at what they see in new york i think many of them believe in a kind of purity of breeding you know japan for the japanese and come to think of america as a secondclass nation because of what they see as the mongrelization of our blood she shrugged for all i really know of them they may see a posting to america the way i would view a job in africa its great for the resume but i wouldnt want to live there she took his arm as they squeezed through the entrance so they wouldnt be separated by the crush of people tor years my ivorytower colleagues liked to use this bigotry against the japanese to show off how americas melting pot was what made us great but lately though they wont admit it even to one another they look around them at whats happening to the city the increasing polarization of economic classes the inflammatory hatred the escalation of race bias in short the fracturing of our republic and they are secretly ashamed they no longer know how to respond to the japanese criticism of us and they hate the japanese all the more for it wolf was intrigued he wondered how shipley the spook would respond to amandas thesis or for that matter how amanda would react to shipleys alltoopossible doomsday scenario of americas near future one things for sure though the japanese are different from us in many ways amanda continued looking this way and that for her sister stevie their idea of sex for instance is not ours did you get this hot off the campus grapevine she laughed not in the least there was a film did you see it in the realm of the senses where a couple try to strangle each other just as they come i think they were trying to elicit the best orgasm ever its considered a classic of its genre in japan wolf was thinking of the laser disc in lawrence moravias apartment in the realm of the senses and that led inexorably to a mental image of chikas strong thighs scissoring as she stepped down into the street the rain beating against her bomber jacket beading over her ricepaper umbrella chika thighs bent hips canted forward hot breath rushing out of her open mouth as her fingers disappeared between her legs chika naked and wet coming with a soft perfumed cry wolf what you had the oddest look on your face these people watching how these socalled patrons of the arts dressed was a show in itself gowns by mizrahi and ferre weird spangled bustiertype items by lacroix and leather sweep dresses by montana nothing less bizarre than what the trade on the street was clad in just more expensive amanda with wolf in tow cleaved through sweating clumps of these people who like victorian vampires ventured out only at night la mentira was made up of three cavernous rooms the first a kind of newwave lounge with uncomfortablelooking banquettes that snaked across a floor paved in thick translucent glass tiles under the tiles coloured lights turned everyones legs sickly shades of red blue and violet along one wall was a kitschy tigerstriped bar with a copper top and on the wall behind it kewpie dolls from the forties and fifties lined up where bottles of liquor would normally be the second room the largest of the three was normally where the dancing took place tonight the polished hardwood floor contained the paintings and sculptures of the artists being promoted by the party the place was jampacked with people and music was pouring out of every speaker of which there were ten times too many how stevie found them in the madhouse wolf never knew but she appeared out of the throngs of people to kiss her sister on both cheeks squeeze wolfs hand stevie powers was a psychotherapist and also a member of the board of the most prestigious arts and science councils of the city one group or another was always sponsoring society bashes such as this one it was wolf supposed stevies way of contributing to society she and her husband morton danaher had a fivebedroom coop on fifth avenue as well as a house in east hampton god knows how much money they had they were like a golden couple perfect together stevie looked nothing like her older sister she was darkhaired darkeyed her figure voluptuous where amandas was slimmer she had delicate longfingered hands artists hands which always seemed in motion her lush body moved in quick bursts with the kind of precision reserved for actors or surgeons it must have been her husband who had moved her into the elite circles of new york society because amanda knew none of the old monied family scions with whom stevie hung out god im so happy you made it panda stevie said everyone whos anyone is here tonight there are so many people i want you to meet wolf supposed that she did not mean to be deliberately rude to him but he was also aware that she was though never less than polite always cool to him perhaps she disapproved of what he did for a living who knew with siblings amanda kissed him quickly on the cheek as stevie began to pull her into the fray she gave him a sorrowful look but he knew better she adored meeting stevies list of the rich and famous he drifted on his own into the main room looked at the artwork most of it was abstract to the extreme he wondered whatever happened to expressionism it seemed to him that too much of what was considered modern by the art world was devoid of either sense or feeling he did not believe that space necessarily needed to be filled having been exposed to japanese culture in the form of the martial arts he could appreciate what was essentially negative space emptiness that formed the context for a single concise image for instance meaning could manifest itself in many strange and unexpected forms as he moved around the ellipse of artwork he came to the end of the paintings the beginning of the sculptures metal armatures upon which had been affixed globs of cooled bronze the colour of honey african hardwoods as vividly striped as a zebras skin plaster lacquered shades of brown they were all mute impassive their lifelessness awkward and coarse even in death wolf thought objects such as a pharaohs mummy could be eloquent all except the last sculpture which rose above his head he stopped in front of it and perhaps because he was already familiar with the disturbing style he found the confluence of the black twisted metal the bright tribal trapunto fabrics had a voice all its own he was looking at another example of chikas artwork and now he turned moving methodically through the crowd searching for her he made a full circuit of the main room without spotting her so he headed towards the smallest of the rooms a dizzying mirrorlined restaurant with fake furcovered chairs and postage stampsized tables that seemed to lurch with every crash of bass percussion and drums of the wildly amplified music of redbox and the pet shop boys his mind was filled with chika what was it about her she was beautiful yes and exotic but he had come in contact with other beautiful women without experiencing this feeling of what dйja vu could that be it but surely he had never seen her before and yet staring into those huge black eyes he heard the worldsong of white bow felt again the elation and terror he thought only his grandfather could elicit from him he felt the triphammer beat of his heart the surge in his pulse and for just an instant the impossible happened he forgot about suma and lawrence moravia he scanned each table as he moved through the aisles dense with people he quartered the room from front to back turning back every fifteen seconds or so to monitor who was coming into the restaurant in the rear he paused eyeing the entrance one more time before pushing his way through the swinging doors into the kitchen area it was a madhouse in there as well cooks assistants waiters busboys the air was humid with food and steam wolf took a tour around the islands of stainless steel sinks counters laden with chopped vegetables slabs of raw meat the huge stoves singing with bubbling vats of soup deep fryers for french fries and onion rings at the back out of sight of the main part of the kitchen was an alcove against which was set the thick metal door to the meat locker wolf glanced over there and stood rooted to the spot at the scene in front of him squire richards his black skin turned blue by the bright fluorescent bars overhead had hold of a thin handsome man in shirtsleeves and tie his fists clutching the mans shirtfront as he bent him up against the door to the meat locker youre late with the payment dickie squire richards growled ill take your money now or ill take my shiv to that gorgeous face of yours and what would you be without that youd have to sell this club when all your fag friends abandoned you okay okay the handsome man said in a highpitched squeal more appropriate to a terrified woman ill give you your damned money just dont cut me wolf waited until squire richards dropped the club owner and the money had changed hands mr sansone take your money and get out of here wolf said both men turned transfixed with shock and fear wolf went over took the money from squire richards slapped it into sansones hand my sincere apologies for this misunderstanding he said i promise you this will not reoccur he gave him his card if you ever have any problems please call me my direct number is on the card you can reach me day or night sansone still slightly stunned nodded pocketed the money and the card then he gave wolf a tentative smile and taking a handkerchief to wipe the sweat off his face hurried out to the party wolf turned to squire richards just what the hell did you think you were doing the black detective said nothing he seemed to be biting his lip what is the matter with you you know i wont tolerate corrupt cops on my staff im not corrupt richards said stolidly you think not internal affairs will not i assure you take that point of view is that what yo gonna do with me turn me over to ia it was said as an accusation the tone not lost on wolf squire im asking you for an explanation richards turned away went over to a sink got himself a glass of water wolf stood next to him as patient as amanda was with him waiting finishing his water richards put his glass down looked nervously at the kitchen staff who busy as they were seemed to be watching them out of the corners of their eyes assured that at least no one could hear them he said at last i needed the money and left it at that as if that was all wolf needed to know and richards looked at him werent no big thing man these sleazeballs are used to doling out the bread health inspector liquor licence board mafia deliver their fish evry day for a price payoffs all of em thats how these bastards stay in business you know that i was just getting a piece of mine this guys rich bread i ask for he wont even miss wolf stood very close to richards think some of that belongs to you do you needed the bread man i tol you squire i will turn you over to ia unless youre clean with me i needed money to bail my brother outta the loan sharks he got hisself into richards said his voice rising okay got it bossman now get outta my face he reached out shoved wolf back into the door against which he had held dick sansone then turned began to make his way through the kitchen wolf went after him spun him around youre a good cop squire but youve got to learn the limits of your badge youve got power but you cant just use it indiscriminately whenever it suits you i said why i did it thats not

made up bout me from the beginning now what am i goin do about my brother they break his legs sure as shit he dont have the bread wolf felt the eyes of the kitchen staff on him and knew he had to defuse the situation now well talk about this first thing in the office tomorrow like fuck we will squire richards said sending a long looping right fist at wolfs ear wolf ducked spun used an irimi to pull the extended richards around the way his haymaker had taken him rolled him over and down put a knee on his neck looking down at squires face black with rage and humiliation aware of the spectacle they had put on for the civilians he felt another spurt of hatred for the life he lived the stink of corruption was so foul it had infected this essentially honest cop giving him false sanction to procure money any way he could to bail his brother out of hock and possible serious harm with shysters wolf let go of richards said get up squire and go home hana had about her the stillness of the blue heron the heron was a very special creature inasmuch as it was a solitary bird quietly stalking its prey which it speared with its long curved serrated beak and when the heron took off it flew with its head majestically back on its shoulders not extended out like its remote cousins the ibis and the crane yuji thought the blue heron was the most beautiful of all these exquisite birds because it could in those enchanted moments during sunrise and sunset merge with the sky the colour of its plumage exactly matching that of the firmament so that when it rose from the water it appeared to vanish like a sorcerer into thin air hana had a house in a suburb of tokyo only six miles from the centre of the city but in all other ways a million miles distant this was where yujis halfsister preferred to spend her time she was younger than he by thirteen years a product of his mother minakos second marriage her house was ferroconcrete on the outside black granite and black and white tiles on the inside the rather stark skeleton then made a dramatic backdrop for her richly coloured patterned and textured collection of mai ogi stage fans used by dancers these were without exception intricately painted etched and lacquered since the mai ogi were often the only props allowed on stage they took the place of a samurai sword a pine forest the moon in autumn a staircase to the attic a stormroiled sea or a simple teacup but there was nothing simple about these fans their labyrinthine symbology tumbling out upon the hardedged surfaces of hanas house hana yuji said now taking her hand in his its always so good to see you beneath the surface hana was in all ways unlike her mother minako had about her that traditional air of fragility so many women of her generation sought to cultivate it came as a shock to yuji when he had discovered that she was utterly selfsufficient hana so pleased to be with him followed him with her luminous eyes wherever he went in the room her eyes held her emotions like an amphitheatre holds sound amplification and nuance generated together when i am here with you it seems as if all my anxieties are far away hana was like a great psychic engine at times yuji was certain that he could hear the thrumming of her heart the singing of her blood and that he could converse with these things as if they were true voices inside her at other times she could be as impassive and impervious to exploration as a stone wall when she was six hana had had a rare type of brain fever so resistant to treatment that it had been given her name to this day experts differed on what the effects of the fever had been on her some said it was only her speech centre that had been affected others insisted that her memory and even other more esoteric functions had been impaired the doctors could not even agree on whether these facilities had been crippled or altered in some way impossible to calculate in any case hana had not spoken a word until she was twelve finally minako had had enough hana had spent years being probed by batteries of sophisticated tests all to no avail she had taken hana away from the stainlesssteel medical centres that had virtually been her home bringing her here to this sanctuary hana had inherited all her mothers ephemeral beauty porcelain skin heartshaped face deeply etched sensual lips but she had added strengths an enviable mastery of language and art a more profound impression of the mysterious than even yujis mother had her father was long gone driven out by minako at the first hint that he was after her money he either did not want to see his daughter or was prevented from doing so by minako who yuji had observed was fiercely protective of her younger daughter in truth he suspected that he was the only one who finally understood hana minako tried to understand her daughter but she was doomed to see her as a cripple because she had spent too many years judging her progress against that of other children yuji saw his halfsister as merely different and so besides loving her he was intrigued by her hana for her part felt his interest and returned it they were like a battery anode and cathode creating a current of unknown origin and energy yuji was duty bound to love his halfsister but he liked her as well she was quickwitted and often very funny although it was rare that he saw her laugh she was always clever even when her unhappiness turned her cleverness into barbs too bitter for most people to bear her frequent depressions abrupt and severe concerned yuji principally because he could not understand what triggered them he was often afraid they were a symptom of the baffling changes caused by her fever as beyond her control as her monthly periods being with hana often brought to mind a haiku by his favourite poet taniguchi buson morning hazelas in a painting of a dreamt men go their ways when he left her it was with the understanding that there was more to the world than the empirical methodology he had learned at school that there existed other universal constants science could not even guess at and he was hard put to say which was the right path through the haze which was the painting of the real world and which was the dream what anxieties are eating at you now hana asked yuji sighed relaxing into the peace and depth of her extraordinary aura the oracle he said outside the windows of the living room was a forest of green moso bamboo hana had planted in a stone courtyard whose walls reflected light in seemingly endless ways some of the bamboo were vertical others set at angles so that a complex pattern was always forming at times the courtyard only twelve feet square could seem as immense as a hillside in nara yuji loved to stare out these windows for they seemed to foster in him the ability to dream i am beginning to regret we ever began this project yuji said watching him carefully hana said who told you about moravias death yuji shrugged what difference does it make i know the oracle is responsible thats the only thing that matters i never thought id be capable of creating something that would be responsible for the death of a human being yujisan youre talking as if the oracle murdered moravia isnt that just what happened oh no no and seeing the anguish on his face she reached out closed his hand in hers come here she drew him down to sit beside her moravia was a test case we all believed the oracle but the errors here prove that even the oracle is fallible yuji grunted you must not give up because of one mistake hana said the oracle is so important can you understand that i believe there must be more out there in the universe sometimes i feel as if my body is a cage i am forced to inhabit like an animal in the zoo that by its very flesh and blood i am made an inferior being hana was still but in the silence she projected yuji could read portents like shadows thrown upon a wall what metamorphoses were occurring within her he wanted to ask her who was she what was she becoming what was her psychic presence doing to the oracle he was about to do so overcoming his embarrassment and his fear when she said death in a wholly different tone of voice he shivered as the word reverberated through him he knew she received wavefronts she refused to call them visions because she said they were not visual at all but rather visceral they seemed to come not from a source outside but from some place deep inside herself a space created or at least accessed by the fever there is an infinite hole inside me she had said to him long ago from its depths images emerge not visions i dont see anything at all but i know they are there and what they are as if while asleep i had been taught an ancient language hana what have you seen he asked now her luminous eyes were as dull as dust and he knew that she could not see him she said i see you and naoharu nishitsu locked in a monumental struggle while a great black bird hovers over your heads you mean death with a capital d he tried to laugh but the sound got caught in his throat this sounds like a scene from an ingmar bergman film no no you dont understand not death hana suddenly gripped him her eyes luminous again focused on him her mouth was trembling there is someone else someone unknown someone who would kill you both wolf sitting in silence in lawrence moravias apartment was thinking of that cubicle and its strange contents behind the wardrobe after the incident with squire at la mentira he had found the forced gaiety of the party cloying he had found amanda had made his apologies stevie had offered to drive her home and amanda seeing the look on his face had not protested had kissed him hard on the lips before being whirled away by her sister wolf sitting on moravias curved couch thinking of moun saying to him larry was bent i mean seriously bent thinking in the realm of the senses thinking chika with moravia a week ago chika with suma last fall moravia killed yesterday one of his men down for the count thinking of everything shipley the spook had made him privy to thinking he could still get no fix on sumas aura or chikas could get no fix on moravias murderer either was chika a member of the black blade society more to the point was she one of their assassins either way he felt certain that she was the nexus point despite himself he felt again a stirring in his loins the image of her shuddering in ecstasy fired against his retinas he remembered her scent and then it hit him this was the scent he had picked up in the secret cubicle in moravias apartment chika had been there scents did not last that long even in a small windowless room which meant that chika had been in moravias apartment only hours before wolf was why and just as importantly how had she gained entrance the place had been under a homicide division seal since the time the police had been summoned to the murder scene by three am the intermittent snow had become a cold hard sleet littering the teeming sidewalks and the steaming grates with a treacherously slick veneer wolf was fed up with work he longed to see amandas face to feel her body close against his warming his flesh and his bones which over the course of this day and a half had come to seem as if they would never feel warm again wolf left moravias apartment took off in the unmarked car for amandas apartment in morningside heights here most of the street people were from the caribbean islands or africa and the park was filled with their makeshift hovels the pathways smeared with the bloody excrement of their primitive necromantic rites amanda abided these dangers for the same reason all new yorkers did economics she simply could not afford to live in a better section of the city plus she was quick to remind wolf there was all that space of the oversized twobedroom apartment which was perfectly safe once you were inside thanks to the police deadbolt wolf had affixed to the front door and the padlocked steel gates across all the windows why was it wolf had wondered more than once that her talent for teaching also made her a superb rationalizer the sleet turned fluorescent by the neon of the manhattan night hit the windscreen like the flailings of a madman the wipers proved of little help wolf dialled amandas number was she home yet from the party he didnt think hed wake her up she had no classes today its me he said into the phone when he heard her voice im on my way uptown the apartments a mess amanda said lets go somewhere else how about my place as long as its not here he pulled up in front of her building fifteen minutes later the sleet increasing in ferocity had slowed him down some he eyeballed the three or four figures slumped beneath the sagging canopy shreds of cardboard pulled up against the cold and wet as far as he could tell all of them were asleep the sleet hammered against the car the noise reverberating in his ears in a moment he caught movement in the building lobby amanda wrapped in her heavy raincoat dashed out making her way around or over the street peopler opening her stride as she sought to avoid the water rushing along the gutter as she did so something buzzed in wolfs mind something not right and the hair at the back of his neck stirred in anticipation or in foreboding that stride was it amandas it seemed familiar yet subtly out of place in this context he looked at her face but the harsh shadows flung down from the sodium street lights made her features indecipherable wolf rubbed his eyes thinking ive been working too hard im a bit loopy he leaned over to open the door for amanda found himself abruptly looking up into the face of the beautiful japanese woman the artist chika her look was full of contempt as in an almost lazy manner she brought her right hand up in it was the blued steel pistol wolf had seen her produce that night against the street punks her lips red turned black in the narrowspectrum light opened and she seemed to be saying something but perhaps because of the closed window and the noise of the sleet he could not hear what she was saying then an explosion bloomed from the muzzle of the pistol noise rocketed through the interior of the car like a crack of thunder no wolf said as the glass pane shattered inwards he felt an impact slamming him into the door on his side of the car there was the taste of iron and blood in his mouth then the pain began wolf awoke with a start he sat up hard looked around bewildered for an instant he was in his own bedroom his heart pounded in his chest and he could still feel the pain the dream pain where the bullet had entered his body stupidly he rubbed the spot to make sure he was whole and unharmed he turned on the ceiling light stared at the reflection of the rain on the skylight rolling off its copper shade it seemed suspended in time and he felt no small kinship suspended as he was between his father and his grandfather and always his mother inbetween he could see his mothers face in his mind as clearly as if she were sitting beside him her expressive black eyes hooded by the characteristic thick folds of the upper lids her prominent cheekbones strong almost savage sculpted nose and jaw and wide mouth the thick dark hair shot with silver she wore to the tops of her buttocks studded with tiny coraleyed sleeping beauty turquoise and lapis beads made for her by white bow every line in her face added to the strength of her presence she was a holy person in her own right a dream collector as she was known and many people came to her for guidance when they were sad or afraid or psychically vulnerable and yet her strength must have lain in her passivity because in the male arena of her family she had allowed the skein to be played out without interference he lay back down closed his eyes he dreamt again in his dream he awoke sat up and went to the american armoire across the room he pushed aside his hanging clothes behind which he took out a bow it was made of caribou horn and had belonged to his grandfather he had made this caribou horn bow when he was a very young man not more than fourteen or fifteen it was a very difficult task most of the nations bows were made of stout wood staves wrapped with dried animal sinew glued with a substance called asphaltum these wooden bows were relatively easy to manufacture but the horn bows were where real power resided and so were prized within the nation above all others gripping the pale caribou bow in his dream looking upwards as it arched over his head feeling its toughness its pure tensile strength wolf felt the song of his life with his grandfather gathering around him like the swell of a choir wolf opened his eyes he looked at his watch it was just after midnight above him the rain had changed to sleet clattering wildly against the skylights sixtyyearold glass panes a wan blue light dribbled through leaking like noxious radiation from a wornout factory he put his head in his hands his pulse rate was still accelerated and he thought jesus then he thought of amanda was she all right why wouldnt she be all right he asked himself and yet an irrational fear was growing inside him fuelled perhaps by the first dream he threw on some clothes went hurriedly out the door it was only when he was in the car heading uptown that it occurred to him that he should have called amanda from home he wasnt thinking clearly it was as if he were still somehow enmeshed within his dream water streamed wildly from the windshield and it seemed as if all the lights were running against him he decided to ignore them he had to detour off amsterdam avenue because from rd to th the street was a gaping hole where last week macadam rotting water pipes sewage and enormous bundles of electrical cables collapsed into the subway tunnels victim so the city engineers said of age constant vibration and a volume of traffic unforeseen by the city fathers of seventy years ago someone had spraypainted along one plastic tarped edge of the disaster die yuppie scum on broadway clots of sleepless senegalese milled beneath awnings of darkened stores undeterred from selling their casbahlike array of goods to the pedestrians hurrying by hunched over against the chilly downpour wolf dialled amandas number its me he said into the phone when she answered are you okay sure she said why there was so much static on the line it was impossible to say whether he had woken her up or what kind of mood she was in im on my way uptown oh god i just got home and the place is a mess can we go somewhere else wolfs mouth was dry he wanted to swallow but couldnt he seemed to be reliving his dream how he stopped hearing something then the line broke up crackling in his ear what did you say amanda wolf was abruptly gripping the receiver so hard his muscles knotted had he heard a laugh amanda the line was dead he hung up pressed the redial key busy signal jesus what had he heard just before the line broke up his dream on top of his briefing with shipley had made him paranoid he began to wonder was it someone elses voice on the other end of the line with all the interference could he be sure it was amanda he had been talking to think very clearly shipley had warned him if you take one more step in this investigation they will not allow you to back out theyll come after you as they did with moravia dear god he jammed the accelerator to the floor and the car leaped forward he spun the wheel dodging traffic the sleet pelted down with a furious almost malevolent purpose he hunched forward his wipers on high peering through the clouded windshield he screeched to a stop outside amandas building in morningside heights bolted out of the car freezing water lapped over his ankles sopping his feet as he stepped through the gutter a young woman with twins sat in the vestibule huddling them against the cold and wet they were asleep but she was not and she watched wolf with old disinterested eyes as he dashed in picked the lock on the inner door sprinted through the dimlylit lobby amandas apartment was on the fourth floor like most such old buildings the elevator here was old and slow wolf took the stairs three at a time he felt as if he were losing his grip on reality even as he raced upwards he was seeing again the scenes of blood and pain from his dream these images seemed more and more real to him until they had gained the power of a film montage or a piece of art until what he saw with his eyes was overlaid with what he had seen in his mind he felt a pain and began to unconsciously massage the spot where in his dream he had been shot he drew his service revolver the door to amandas apartment was slightly ajar wolf felt a coldness seeping through him his gun at the ready he pushed the door inwards with his fingertips and as it gaped open rolled into the long hallway in a tuck he came to rest with his back against one plaster and lath wall he saw the dead bolt leaning against the wall near the open door amanda wolf i left the door open for you im almost ready wolf came out of his crouch he was sweating get a grip on yourself he thought this is not your dream he bolstered his gun said where are you why did you hang up on me we got disconnected its those damn car phones i could hardly hear a word you said didnt you hear me say goodbye no the hallway was dark but in the living room lamplight warmed the apartment she didnt ask why he hadnt buzzed from downstairs wolf leaped across an ottoman crossing the living room with lightning speed threw open the door to amandas bedroom and let out an involuntary snarl of pain shock rage blood was sprayed all over the walls and floor it was pooled on the bed where amanda lay naked and spreadeagled she stared sightlessly up at the ceiling there was a blackred line across her throat from which a combination of blood and air escaped in a profusion of bubbles wolf put a hand over her heart two fingers against her carotid artery they were useless gestures so much blood all over but necessary because this was amanda not some unknown victim one more new case he had been called to investigate we got disconnected its those damn car phones i could hardly hear a word you said didnt you hear me say goodbye wolf jumped as he heard her voice absurdly he could not stop himself from looking at her still blank face then he saw the cassette player tucked neatly into the sheets beside her head blood had leaked into the mechanism we got disconnected its those damn car phones i could hardly hear a word you said didnt you hear me say goodbye with a curse wolf reached over switched it off he looked up saw the open window the steel gates had been unlocked and now swung uneasily in the wind beyond was the fire escape sleet sluiced down bouncing off the sill just a spattering covered the floor which meant that the window had been opened only moments ago wolf snatched at his gun vaulted over the bed went out onto the fire escape a wall of water smashed against him almost bringing him to his knees his first instinct was to peer downwards but nothing moved on the fire escape below him or on the street he raised one hand to shield his eyes looked upwards a shadow movement wolf sprang upwards taking the rungs two at a time up and up he went above him he could see the shadow pour itself over the side of the building onto the roof suma chika there was no time for coherent thought the sight of amandas pale corpse her blood her life soaked into the room all around her was like a knife twisting between his ribs grief transmuted into rage fuelled by a sense of frustration that he with all his skills all his honed instincts had not been able to protect her over the parapet onto the slick tarred surface of the roof he could see the buildings water tower the rectangular bulge of the top of the elevator shaft the various vents for furnace and compressors fans a skylight similar to the one in his own apartment auxiliary electrical shed a locked and alarmed access from the building itself he could feel no aura but somewhere in this urban jungle he knew was amandas killer the sleet continued to crash down with such fury he could scarcely breathe he crept forward then stopped considering he went back to the edge of the parapet began a coordinated search along the perimeter of the roof he wanted to do this for two reasons the first was to try to flush out the killer who would expect him to approach in line with the top of the fire escape the way they had both come the second was to get a full sense of the confined topography of the roof scape when wolf flushed his quarry it would be helpful to have an image in his mind of the various structures potential hiding places from all angles and thus be able to cut off his quarrys escape he was threequarters of the way around the roof when he caught a change in shape in the auxiliary electrical shed it was so slight that he almost missed it he looked away for a moment to stabilize his vision then back there it was got you he thought but who was it suma or chika he headed towards the shape only to see it detach itself from the shed come hurtling towards him so fast that it was inside his range before he had a chance to aim he pulled the trigger even as he felt the shape slam into him wolf went down on one knee lashed out with the barrel of his gun something went into his diaphragm just below the sternum and he flew backwards fetching up against the crumbling brick and concrete wall of the parapet the shape was immediately upon him and wolf rolled into a defensive ball tumbling along the perimeter of the roof the shape followed him wolf was up already pointing his gun at where he thought the shape would be only to find empty roof then a blow struck him from behind and he groaned as he was slammed against the top of the parapet the taste of iron and blood was in his mouth he felt himself being lifted and he struggled he was so close to the edge and the pavement loomed in lethal attraction six storeys below him he got a lock thought he had the leverage then to his astonishment found it reversed the leverage somehow working against him and he felt himself being forced over the parapet he could see the street glistening evilly below him and he began to pant in effort and fear he struck out once twice with blows that would knock a normal man to his knees nothing worked wolf was thrown into the night over the parapet he went the street rushing up to meet him with a desperate effort he reached out was brought up short as his hand clamped wet iron he grunted as he felt the full weight of his body hanging from his left arm socket let his gun go in order to get the fingers of his right hand against metal held on hard the pressure easing somewhat he was hanging head first from the top platform of the fire escape his breath was like fire in his lungs unconsciousness lapping at the edges of his vision he shook his head hard to clear it and became aware of the black shape making its way over the parapet coming after him with a superhuman effort he swung upwards once twice his fingertips slipping on the iceslick iron then he made firm contact and he was crouched gasping and dizzy on the fire escape his hands were bloody but he could not think of that now the shape was upon him cutting his legs out from under him as he attempted to rise wolf fell hard onto the iron bars of this prison eyrie ignored the ache in his arms and shoulders he lashed out with a kite felt the blow intercepted then made the supreme effort surprising his adversary grabbing the shadows left wrist with his right hand as it lunged in on him for the kill pulling it hard towards him and down past him then as the shadows own momentum magnified by wolfs use of force worked against it wolf used his other hand to jam the others elbow upwards slamming the upper torso to the ironbarred floor of the platform then he was up and running leaping for the ladder upwards hauling himself back over the low wall of the roof parapet he stumbled to the wet tar of the rooftop but now a peculiar lassitude was stealing through him making him want to sit down and close his eyes shock he fought it endorphins pumped through his system numbing the pain but also interfering with thought and coordination hed be better off with the pain wolf focused his mind he felt something inside his mind turned to find the shape waiting for him it took him in its arms threw him down to the tarred roofbed it crouched close to him the sleet beat at his eyes and he strained to make out the nature of the shape was it large or small suma or chika he could not tell the air seemed filled with unnatural shadows there was a blackness that impossibly seemed to hurl the sleet away from him then the street lights winked out and finally all air he had the eerie sensation of being suspended in time and space the nature of chaos was upon him blotting out all vestiges of the worldsong he had learned from white bow he almost gave up then the shock reasserting itself swirling through his system turning his thoughts woolly threatening to shut down all coordination and motor function but then superimposed on the night the horrific sleet beating against him the creeping numbness chilling him to the marrow was the image of amandas inert blank face the smell of her blood rising up to engulf him the last pink bubbles of her life leaking out her rent neck and it was too much to bear there was too much still left undone to allow the systems to shut down so he fought as he had always fought against family and adversity and the enemy seen and unseen alike wolf gritted his teeth reached up out through the unnatural darkness struggling in the airless space in which he was bound until he had grabbed hold of the shape he pulled it violently while he threw his head forward butting his forehead hard against the face of the shape there were sounds but perhaps only of the downpour drumming against tar and brick and concrete and metal wolf pulled again but that was a mistake to repeat a move any move against the enemy and he felft a searing pain down his thigh saw a black boot sontinued to grind down trying to find the bone to break it he screamed slammed his elbow twice into flesh used first the heel then the edge of his hand in kites meant to maim the shape grunted heavily the boot came mercifully away and the shape retreated he went right after the shape lunging in a killing rage the pain of amandas death beating at him like dark wings he saw an opening and took it but as he closed with his quarry he began to slow the world became indistinct as if he was underwater breath laboured in his lungs his pulse decelerated sharply the blackness a viscid living thing pressed in on him as if it had shape form and an insupportable weight then the fire started it was terrifying and yet there was about it some preternatural familiarity as if he had glimpsed an old long forgotten acquaintance through the interstices in a fence blue fire began to consume him and thinking of arquillos face he threw his arms across his own in that moment he found himself lifted hurled high into the night as the shape used his own momentum against him to draw him up and over into the air light flooded his blurred vision then was extinguished sleet stung him then ceased wind rushed in his ears then only silence burst of sound and motion he hit the skylight with his left shoulder and hip breaking through the grimed panes of glass in a shattering instant his left leg scored by a long jagged shard held like an arrow in the bow of the frame then he was plummeting through darkness and light his life falling away from him angry spirits hissing in his ears amanda whispering we got disconnected its those damn car phones i could hardly hear a word you said didnt you hear me say goodbye wolf whispering her name tears whipped from the corners of his eyes as he hurtled downwards consciousness and unconsciousness blending memory snatched from him thought dissolved into emotion until pain blotted out everything even his own scream wolf elk basin lightning ridge wolfs fathers name was peter matheson like his son he had belonged to an elite male club the texas rangers he had revelled in its elite status and had gone into a deep depression when in it had been ignominiously folded into the highway patrol turning out like trained dogs in full regalia for state holidays bastardized into a basically political animal but was this the only reason that had caused him to leave his wife and wolf peter matheson as macho and prideful as a matador had been steeped in konjo a japanese word wolf had learned many years later from his aikido sensei which meant a distinctly masochistic obsession for physical acts that involve an enormous degree of hardship and pain konjo his sensei had stated flatly was impossible to attain without suppressing ones innermost emotions and so without at first having realized it he had discovered something basic about his fathers personality peter matheson had been a texas ranger for twelve years he had tried to fight against the encroachment of time and the modern age on this last elite band of lawmen he often recounted their proud birth a century before as guardians of the republic of texass frontier during the statewide revolution in the course of their heroic history they had fought fierce battles with the comanches had served with distinction and valour in the mexican and civil wars peter matheson had of course never done any of those things although he had spent time bringing to justice mexican banditos and outlaws of every imaginable variety he had joined the rangers because they were unique in the annals of american lawmen never required to wear a uniform or salute an officer never having to drill or answer to a higher authority at least thats what they had been in their heyday and wolfs father had spent more than a decade trying singlehandedly to bring them back to their glory years as such he was looked upon by many as a hero a larger than life figure respected for his valour and his personal philosophy that wolf would later identify as konjo his dedication to getting the job done no matter the suffering and torment inflicted on himself to those who did not know him well it seemed more than a little curious that peter matheson had married an american indian but wolfs mother open hand was in all ways an exemplar of her wind river shoshone forebears and peter was drawn to distinction in every aspect of his life she far more than her husband had been pragmatic enough to have resigned herself to the advent of the modern world the inevitability of taming the wild ranges for the hordes of immigrants teeming westwards from the northeastern states and perhaps after all this was the answer to why she had married him a white man a texas ranger she could feel the power of the new world and she did not want to be left behind to falter turned drunkard bitter and old before her time in the mean reservations once he overheard her tell white bow that she could see the future the advent of the modern world in her husbands piercing blue eyes feel it emanating from the bearing of his sharp handsome countenance for his part white bow had his own opinion as to peter mathesons demeanour wolf remembered one evening asking his father if it was true as he had heard at school that in texas the rangers had written the law no peter matheson tall and lanky wind and sunburned powerful in body as well as spirit had said looking sternly down at his son we were the law this arrogant response so perfectly exemplified an aspect of peter matheson that wolf could never forget it it was also the reason why white bow could not abide the man man is not the law the law is of the world wolfs grandfather had said to him shortly thereafter and the voices of the world spirits which must be heeded even though their words are often difficult to discern the wisdom of these words was never more apparent than when peter matheson came home one day whitefaced short of breath he waved away his wifes concerned queries but finally collapsed at the dinner table instead of calling a doctor open hand had summoned her father white bow took one look at peter matheson and bade his daughter to spread out one of her handwoven blankets when she had done so he produced bits of woven material dyed to the colours of the four cardinal directions these he placed on the appropriate corners of the blanket then crushed fresh sage between his thumb and forefinger so that the pieces fell onto the centre of the blanket and the oil perfumed the room white bow who it was said by many possessed more power than even black elk and fools crow was the high shaman of the wind river shoshone but unlike other tribal shaman his philosophy was not limited to his particular tribe but was rather a synthesis of myth philosophy and ethics drawn as well from many of the other indian tribes in his time he had been exceedingly well travelled and it was said had been welcome even in the communities of the nation who were normally the enemy of the wind river shoshone and their cousins the fierce and violent comanche of west texas wolf and open hand settled the unconscious peter matheson on the blanket kneeling beside him white bow produced two hawk feathers he placed one over the patients throat the other over his lower belly then he began to move them over the entire torso all the while he chanted in a voice so low wolf could not hear his words abruptly one feather paused over peter mathesons abdomen the second one joined it they crossed at the tips there is poison in his stomach white bow said hurry now he is dying with liquid indigo he drew a circle at the spot where the feathers had crossed then he placed a smooth stone within the circle he began a chant that filled the room with the movement of its melody and words soon the stone began to emit heat glowing red just as if it were the coal of a fire now white bow bade them draw peters head back open his mouth fully he held the tongue in place with a strip of dried buffalo tongue then he produced a long hollow quill wrapped in the centre with sinew dyed deep blue he placed one end of the quill in peters mouth began to push it carefully down his oesophagus then he put his lips to the other end and sucked he did this until the quill was filled then he removed it allowed the contents to dribble into a plate his daughter had provided he repeated the process seven times until sniffing the contents of the quill he was satisfied he took up his feathers bowed his head chanting another song then he put them away along with the quill lastly he removed the smooth stone now returned to its cool original state from peter mathesons abdomen within the blue circle was a mark like a bruise that peter would carry for the rest of his life white bow sat back he appeared tired he sleeps now he told them the poison is gone white mans poison that contaminated his food the kind i have heard was used many times against the nation he made no more comment than that but many years later wolf would suspect the irony of the incident had not been lost on him when he awakens he will be well again open hand bowed her head in gratitude then white bow turned to wolf and said softly the spirits of the world came when they were summoned here is the law now you have seen it with your own eyes so many aspects of his grandfather were opaque then wolf had finally come to the conclusion that this impression was a deliberate part of the old mans persona at first he believed his grandfather was merely being wilful but later he found himself wondering whether the old man had had deeper less selfish motives for presenting the enigmas of himself to wolf one day the old man said to him you are going to stay with me for some time now your mother has given her consent he never spoke of wolfs father an unbeliever in his ways who for him did not exist we are going to go away but before we do i will tell you a story once there was a young boy he had no friends but the rivers and the mountains the trees and the sky still he was a lonely boy and longed for companionship one day as the boy was picking nuts and berries in the bushes by the edge of the plain where he lived he heard a cry he rushed toward the sound to find a hawk lying in the dust its wing was broken the boy crouched beside the bird tried to touch it but the hawk almost bit his finger off then the boy spoke to the bird and at last the hawk consented to be lifted out of the broiling sun beneath the shelter of a tree the boy ministered to the bird giving it first water and then some berries which the hawk preferring meat did not like but ate anyway then the boy set about putting a splint on the hawks broken wing in time the hawk recovered and soon because his sense of adventure was greater than his companions had led the boy away from the plains of his youth through a valley so dry its floor was compacted salt up into umber foothills and then along the steeply rising spine of a mountain this was the mountain that the boy had seen every day of his life when it was clear enough the mountain that formed the backdrop to his young life the mountain he sometimes dreamed about but never dared think he would reach now he was there nearing the summit and he felt a sense of great elation as if somehow coming here had been the hawks gift to him for saving its life at the summit of the mountain the boy saw a tree gnarled twisted by wind and lashing rain old and sturdy he went up to the tree and put his arms around it as if embracing a longlost ancestor as for the hawk it flew off the boys shoulder and onto the very topmost branch of the tree it craned its neck this way and that searching all it saw around it then it gave one piercing cry as if in farewell and launched itself into the clear blue sky the boy delirious with joy at being atop his mountain pushed himself away from the tree and shading his eyes watched the flight of the hawk the boy had superior vision and he watched as the bird spiralled higher and higher not drifting away in any horizontal plane but rising vertically as if through a tunnel invisible to anyone but the hawk itself above the crown of the tree the boy continued to watch as the hawk dwindled in his vision still rising so that the boy was certain that at any moment the bird would pierce the floor of heaven then it was gone and in that moment he saw floating down three feathers hawk feathers which he plucked out of the sky and placed in his thick black hair and years later when he had made his home in the foothills of the mountain when he had wed and had sired children he told his family of the hawk and used the sacred feathers in ceremonies consecrating heaven and earth and the implicit connection between them white bow stared at wolf with his black crows eyes that fierce independent look that was nevertheless without the peacocks pride he so despised we will go now are you ready ready for what wolf did not know but he was frightened of the old mans witchy aura of his enigmatic statements of the overriding sense that something what what was expected of him the old man would not tell him and wolf could not work it out by himself on the other hand it never occurred to him not to go whatever his grandfather demanded of him he did without thought or question this blind obedience he had learned like the language of her people in his mothers lap perhaps had ingested along with her breast milk a loyalty that as he progressed from toddler to child increasingly infuriated his father who demanded of his only son a fealty second to none in deep snow they left elk basin by horse his grandfathers favourite means of travel the wind river shoshones he had once told wolf had been among the first of the tribes to understand the nature of the horse and to use him it was very cold wolf wrapped in skins and blankets woven by his mother white bow would allow no modern dress when his grandson was with him but the old man seemingly impervious in only a beaded shirt and breeches of soft deerskin he had tanned himself and which wolf had seen him wear in summer on his feet were buckskin moccasins with stiff rawhide soles the tops beautifully decorated with beads of coloured glass and enamelled metal wrapped in blue twilight they camped in the desolate wilderness of the playa the salt flats where the wind was merciless its cry echoing for miles in every direction white bow chose a spot in the lee of a snaking bank of the icebound sevier river they were near the end of it so that wolf could see the salty lake into which it flowed you are lucky he said to wolf as they set up the tepee painted with curious symbols that appeared to wolf like war shields when i was your age i was stricken with a great sickness and then white bow had described how he had been afflicted by epilepsy the attacks were very bad i was incapacitated for days afterward i slept as the dead sleep and gradually into my sleep crept the spirits of the creatures around me the bison the wolf the bear and the hawk it took me some time to understand that these were the spirits of slain animals and that their message to me was that i was special and had been chosen to be shaman how is such a thing possible i said to the spirits i am ill and they replied as shaman you must heal illness before that can be done you must understand the nature of illness and then white bow said i awoke from my sleep and knew that i must learn to heal my own illness for only in so doing would i learn to heal others wolf was just wondering how in the world his grandfather had managed to do that when the old man reached out a bow from a long mottled cowhide sheath it was made of some kind of horn or bone it had a magnificent double arch to it the sinew wrapping it had first been dyed a rich burnished blue by immersion in liquid rendered from the indigo plant the ends just above the nocks where it was strung were decorated with hawk feathers and from a rawhide strip there dangled from the lower end what wolf could only imagine was the yellowed talon from that same bird this bow is made from caribou antlers the old man said settling himself comfortably there is power in such a weapon as i have no doubt you have been told but i will now tell you a secret the power comes from here he struck his chest just over his heart and not from the antlers themselves as many believe instead the antlers serve as a kind of storehouse of this power do you understand wolf nodded his head terrified to admit he did not understand what power power wasnt tangible and that being the case he could not see how any tangible object could hold such an ephemeral thing his grandfather smiled at him just as if he knew what was turning over in his mind but that was impossible wasnt it objects of veneration such as horn bows are most useful the old man went on because they also serve as mystic markers talismans from which one comes to recognize ones own power seeing the look on his grandsons face he bent forward think of a mirror wolf how could you recognize yourself without having looked into one by a photograph but how would you know that was you no the reflection is your guidepost your marker hours later after all the chores had been seen to after they had eaten a meal of dried beef jerky and roasted corn had relieved themselves into a nearby depression and were ready for bed white bow returned to the subject the bow he said is how i healed myself in the firelight his lined face was as dark and tough as the hides he painstakingly cured in the making of it i found myself i discovered my power and healed myself the caribou came to me in a dream and the next morning i set off after him it took me more than a week of tracking but once i found his spoor i knew he would not get away in fact in hindsight i see that he did not want to get away on the contrary his spirit had called me to him i came upon him in a forest glade i was far to the north by then there are few caribou where we come from he was an enormous beast even by the standard of his kin his antlers huge curving arcs like the arms of a white crescent moon he turned his great head saw me and shook his antlers i could see that he was ready to shed them it is so obvious now that the creature was sent to me so that i could take his antlers and make my white bow the old man was sitting crosslegged smoking a long bone pipe wolf lying next to him bundled in his buckskins and blankets liked the aromatic scent of the tobacco the way the blue smoke wreathed his grandfathers head as if it were a mountain seen through clouds he was growing drowsy the old mans words in the singsong language of the wind river shoshone acting as a kind of lullaby now it happens that my father was a great bowmaker and he had instructed me in his art from the time before i could speak in sentences i knew that cutting the antlers was not nearly so critical as boiling them to rid them of their inner core which would grow brittle and cause the bow to break under the stress of being drawn i also knew that only such sustained heat would cause the antlers themselves to be moulded into the proper shape to make a bow the reason there are so few bowmakers who can make a horn bow is simple boiling the antlers in water deprives the horn of the natural glue and gelatin that makes it pliable my father put a combination of herbs into his water to keep these elements within the horn i however had none nor did i know what they were i was alone with no one to help me and yet i made this bow he waited until wolfs eyes opened and the boy said but how did you do it heat white bow said then acknowledging that same look on his grandsons face he held out his hand wolfs hand disappeared within the old mans fist as he was pulled to his feet white bow took him outside it had cleared and the sky was a frosty black the full moon was so sharp wolf imagined he could cut himself on it all around them a thick crust of ice had formed over the playa here the old man said as he knelt on the bank of the river this is how and making a fist he thrust his left arm elbow deep into the ice that had formed over the water wolf still with his hand buried in his grandfathers hugehorny palm felt a curious sensation as if he were somehow hooked into a current he jerked his hand away as if burned but even so disengaged felt something else so terrifying that even in a dream he could not remember what it was that was when he saw the water running from the spot where white bow held his arm in the frozen river a moment later water gushed like a swollen spring river and not long after steam rose hissing from that hot black hole in the ice and so when he slept which he did a great deal on that thursday afternoon he dreamt of a time long ago when white bows worldsong was everything the floor of the great basin the playa was as hard and flat as concrete it was like the city to which years later wolf would flee on the furthest edge of the playa so distant they were almost colourless were the sierra nevada mountains it was dangerous here it was dangerous in the city somewhere in wolfs unconscious there must be a connection we and by we i mean the nation are not native to this country no one is white bow said to the young wolf they were seated in the tepee they had pitched on the great salt flats in the pale moonlight the playa was preserved with an iridescent rind of ice and hoarfrost our own family as i trace it back with the help of the spirits came from asia trekking for months across the ice steppes of siberia they were undaunted by the tongue of almost solid ice that is now the bering straits when the two continents of asia and the americas were one when there were only pockets of lakes where now there is frigid water they moved through alaska and then south ever south what drew them i wonder perhaps it was the neverending ice in truth though even the spirits have no single answer so perhaps i will never know until i cross over into the other side and i will know everything as he spoke white bows fingers worked on wrapping wet sinew around an obsidian arrowhead chipped by his hand to a wicked point he was affixing it to a polished shaft of wild currant his favourite wood for this purpose because it was flexible and so strong that if even a bison rolled over on it it would slide deeper into the animals flesh rather than break off surely in those days white bow continued we were chinese perhaps we were not so very different from those immigrants who would become the modernday japanese at this point white bow raised the unfinished shaft of the arrow measured it against wolfs right arm from the elbow to the end of his middle finger white bow marked this dimension on the shaft with a bit of charcoal then with a length of jute he measured the distance from wolfs right wrist to the first knuckle of that same middle finger wolf watched as his grandfather added this measurement to the first which would constitute the length of the arrow this was how the great arrowsmiths custommanufactured weapons for the men of prestige of the nation wolf surprised saw that white bow was making this arrow for him wolf loved to watch his grandfathers hands so large so capable and unlike the whole man himself unintimidating there was nothing enigmatic about those hands they were simply instruments of invention and healing it was cold and getting colder each day they remained upon the vast plain of icy salt wolf felt the chill insinuating itself through his bones he moved more slowly and with more difficulty as if he were required to unfold like some twodimensional construction for his part white bow seemed to be completely unaffected by the cold in fact some days he went out without a shirt on at all on those occasions wolf would watch to see what effects the frigid temperature would have on his bare skin none it appeared and at those times he would recall how the old man had thrust his fist into the ice and had turned it to water and thence to steam one night he said grandfather where does so much heat come from white bow nodded as if he had been expecting this question the healing power of the shaman is connected with that of fire fire wolf is the eye of the sun brought down to this world a very long time ago by one of the spirits fire is energy fire is power it has many manifestations and it is the duty of the shaman to decide which manifestation fits the moment he cocked his head peering down the length of the shaft of wild currant the broader end was where he would put the nock in which the bowstring would sit because the arrow must fly in the same direction in which the limb that became the shaft grew on its tree this after all is the most difficult decision a shaman must make when to use the fire and in which way and it is this inner fire that makes one impervious to the deepest cold that comes not only in the dead of winter but on the very point of death several nights later after white bow had finished three arrows of remarkable workmanship the young wolf had a dream in it he was visited by a bear so immense he blotted out the sun his fur so black it appeared as if the sky had turned from day to night this immense black bear taught wolf his language then spoke to him earnestly for a long time and beckoning led him outside the tepee onfo the playa but when wolf awoke he had lost the knowledge of the bear language and so could not remember what the creature had told him he related this dream to his grandfather and the old man had smiled it is time white bow said nodding he took up his bow and trio of new arrows and led wolf outside where a low red sun had turned the salt flats to stained glass can you recall the direction in which the bear was leading you wolf pointed west and they set out into the light of the dying sun ahead in the hazy distance lay the sierra madre at this time of day enrobed in regal purple the lowest arc of the solar disc touched them and the sun seemed to flatten like a vessel being born in a potters hands blue shadows strode behind them lengthening with every step they took the air was exceedingly dry it sought out every opening in wolfs clothing with the precision of a surgeons scalpel white bow in summer weight doeskins seemed oblivious and wolf thought with no little terror of his mastery over fire after several miles a dark lump appeared in their field of vision even at this distance wolf sensed that it was a human being he was correct of course a young man perhaps three or four years older than wolf lay on his side in the rimey crust of the playa wolf squatted down felt the side of his neck where his father had taught him the carotid artery pulsed he glanced up at white bow he is alive grandfather but just barely he ran his hands carefully over the boys body then turned him over there is no blood no wound not even a bruise what is the matter with him impossibly tall terrifying in his imposing presence white bow held out his hand said this stone is for you use it wolf reached upwards for the small speckled stone as smooth as his mothers breast it was warm and warmed wolf from the instant he took possession of it giving his grandfather one more brief glance he placed the stone in three spots on the boys body his lower belly his heart his forehead he touched the stone with the tip of his middle finger each time in the first two instances he felt nothing amiss but when the stone came in contact with the boys head wolf started he shivered and closed his eyes what has the stone told you white bow asked at first wolf said nothing so filled with dread was he then he swallowed something thick that seemed stuck in his throat said the boy suffers from no physical illness someone has stolen his soul yes white bow nodded as if he had somehow already known this is why the spirit of the black bear came to you in your dream this boy is protected by the black bear and its spirit sought out a shaman but i am no shaman grandfather take the stone from the boys forehead the old man said he took up one of the arrows he had made for wolf thrust the great bow with its deadly missile into wolfs hands this is what has happened he said a man has died a cowardly creature who lacking the courage to walk the path of the dead alone has stolen the boys soul to accompany him on his journey he stared down at wolf when you touched the healing stone the third time you could feel the interruption of the worldsong yes wolf whispered trembling dreading what he knew must come next we must return that which was wrongfully stolen white bow said we must walk the path of the dead it was dark now but that did not seem to matter to white bow he took wolf south until they came to the bank of the sevier rivers are gateways he said to his grandson he sat himself down crosslegged on the riverbank and produced his pipe he filled it with some dark substance that did not smell anything like the tobacco he smoked he lit it sucked at the pipe several times passed it to wolf wolf took the smoke into his lungs it was highly aromatic surprisingly light and did not make him cough or choke as his one stab at tobacco had the two passed the pipe back and forth until its burning contents were used up now we go wolf rose with his grandfather and together they slid into the river it was so cold that wolf felt immediately numb and it was so deep he could not feel the bottom with the tips of his moccasins he needed to get air into his lungs but his grandfather was holding him keeping him beneath the water he struggled briefly panicking but his perception of reality was already shifting the darkness of the river had metamorphosed into a deeper darkness the chill fading from his flesh and bones also he seemed able to breathe but far from reassuring him all of this merely increased his panic he felt a tug on his arm saw his grandfather gesturing ahead lay a series of stones glowing faintly a bone white the pathway of the dead only steps ahead of them was an old man beside him was the boy they had found on the playa the boy suddenly aware of them turned his head in their direction but the old man his grip firm did not so intent was he on his dread journey quickly now white bow whispered to wolf before they get too far along and it is too late use the bow i am afraid the young wolf said it takes a shaman to do this i am no shaman use the bow his grandfather said urgently loose the arrow with trembling hands wolf nocked the arrow to the bowstring put the bow up sweat was rolling down his face and his fear had turned his stomach inside out he imagined himself weeping as he drew the bow into its magnificent arc it was very difficult the bow being strung for his grandfathers prodigious strength but he thought of the poor boy lying on the playa suspended between life and death and gritting his teeth swallowing his nausea he drew the bow to the full extent of its arc aimed down the shaft let the arrow fly straight into the old mans back there was a sharp unearthly scream the boy vanished then water was rushing into his mouth his eyes were burning and he was vomiting up salt in the centre of the tepee wolf opened his eyes he was dry and all about him everything was as it had been when he and white bow had left it before they had gone in response to the summons of the spirit of the black bear except all his senses seemed to be heightened the new acuity imprinting itself on him with every move he took he recalled the pipe his grandfather had given him and for some time then he was convinced the journey had simply been some kind of peyoteinduced hallucination then he felt the rime of salt on his skin a residue surely of his dunking in the saltchoked sevier he was paralysed with terror then it was all true he had plunged through the portal of the river into the land of the dead halfdazed he got up then searched inside and outside but there was no sign that white bow had ever been there in the middle of the playa in winter wolf was totally on his own except for the two remaining arrows white bow had fashioned for him three hours later with the light failing and the chill creeping through the tepee peter matheson found wolf having threatened white bow with bodily harm if he did not divulge the location of his son he should not go peter heard the old man say to open hand as he mounted his horse it has begun and what wolf must do he must do alone peter had spat on the ground and pulling on the reins had dug his spurs into the flanks of his horse wheeling him and had taken off for the salt wastes of the playa where the senile creature had left his son to die wolf should have been delighted to see his father appearing out of the indigo dusk but in fact he contemplated hiding in truth if he could have found someplace on that plain to secrete himself he would have done so but the only place he could think of was the land of the dead and without his grandfather he knew he could not get there somehow in retrospect the place no longer frightened him so not nearly as much as the cold grey light in his fathers eyes in his tone when striding into the tepee he had barked at his son gather up your belongings were going home mounted behind his father his arms around his chest he felt with each precise arc of the powerful horses hooves a lessening of the sharpness of sight sound smell that had attended his awakening as the steed raced across the playa it broke up the frozen bed of salt which flew around them like shards from a broken mirror its magic betrayed as silver paint on glass he had taken with him only the arrows white bow had made for him believing that everything he had brought with him had been the property of a child certainly of no interest now to him but when he returned home he found that they were incomplete the feather fletching having been pulled out during his journey home or never having been anchored in by white bow in the first place everything was different in those first weeks not the least of which was the relationship between his parents where before their differences over her father had remained in the background now peter voiced his protestations more vociferously once even suggesting that since it was clear the old man was senile they ought to commit him to a home before he hurt someone open hand the dream collector for her people repository of their hopes fears and despair so patient and understanding seemed to have run out of both virtues she would not no doubt could not explain her father to her husband but she had lost her equilibrium where before she was able to observe this ethnological chasm with an almost scientific detachment and even think of herself as the bridge between the two there was now a personal aspect that cut her to the bone she had undoubtedly seen the chasm as a metaphor for the twilight of one culture and the ascendancy of another this comfortable rationalization giving her a false sense of security but there could be no security with peter matheson he was a true pioneer restless as the wind long on courage but short on responsibility the trouble with civilization he had once told wolf is that it can find no place for heroes for heroes are by definition feral and their very wildness threatens to rend the fabric of civilization wolf was later to realize that his father was talking about himself and he would recall the conversation in toto many times simply because of its rarity peter matheson almost never spoke about himself wolf recognized in his father a fire not white bows shaman fire but significant in its own right because of the ferocity with which it drove him white bow had already taught wolf of the continuous interaction between the mind body and spirit and here he could see it for himself in his own father because it was clear to him that peter matheson acted and reacted from the spirit part of him he found so vital the heroes of long ago should have protected the nation wolf said thoughtfully the indians had their heroes its true peter said but we were too strong too numerous no wolf said i meant heroes like you or your father you should have understood and stopped the killing of the tribes peter looked at his son nodded perhaps it might have been so he said but our civilization came upon us too quickly and was too far advanced he looked far out on the horizon where the mountains seemed to rise high enough to touch the sky and wolf was reminded of white bows story of the hawk or too backward backward peter had nodded despite what youre taught at school the coming of civilization is not all good lost in the maze of laws and statutes of society we end up losing our sense of the land we see it only for what it can give us not for what it is he grunted the american indian culture was lost that way joining a list of many others around the world but laws are what make society wolf said at least thats what were taught in school well youll have to make up your own mind about that son but dad what do you believe how do i answer that peter matheson had watched his horse cropping at grass the sunlight spinning off its glossy coat as the muscles beneath its skin rippled a hero carries the law on his hip and though he will invariably pave the way for civilization it will cast him aside as quickly and as roughly as it can because he casts a dangerous shadow and of course more than anything else that was what peter matheson longed to do a year after he rode across the playa to rescue his son peter matheson was gone open hand never spoke of where he had gone but wolf knew because he received one letter from his father reading it over and over until it fell apart in his hands he was at last forced to tuck the pieces carefully beneath his pillow but open hand spoke of her husband whenever wolf required it of her if there was rancour in her heart he never saw it or more importantly felt it he could not doubt that she had loved him but he also suspected that a component of that love was contained in his restless spirit and she saw his moving on as being as inevitable as the coming of winter after autumn as she had often told him in other contexts when other bleak winters had caused food to be in short supply spring will always come and so it did after that lonely winter of his departure wolf missed him fiercely but he did not miss the tension in the household white bow ancient and creaking like the wooden wagons of yesteryear moved into the room that had been peter mathesons sanctuary he made no more arrows and in fact had never fletched wolfs pair though wolf had given them back to him for this purpose often wolf asked open hand about her father for or so it seemed to him white bow had grown insular following his return from the playa to which he had brought wolf it was clear to wolf that whatever the old man had intended had not come to pass not fully anyway but he had had no success in interesting his grandfather in returning to the salt flat which would be possible now that peter matheson was gone open hand never answered a question about her father directly and to wolfs latest query she replied among all things that fly the mind is the swiftest wolf pondering this seeming riddle remembered his descent with white bow into the land of the dead surely having shed the coil of their mortal bodies they had flown to this otherwise inaccessible place as mystics define flight i think i understand but why wont grandpa take me back now thinking back on it you are certain your father interfered with the process forming between you and white bow open hand said but white bow does not see the world like other people he steps back and sees possibilities all the possibilities in every situation he is like a weaver who is able to trace the serpentine progress of each strand of wool even after the whole is completed wolf looked up at her are you saying that grandpa believes the way it turned out is how it is meant to be his mother enigmatic in her beauty and her acceptance took his hand in hers gather the patience to discover on your own what is meant to be she said as grave and potent as any man and of course that was white bows great lesson brought home to him by disappointment and loss it took wolf seven years of growing to marshal the courage necessary to follow his father and when he had found him he didnt recognize him he felt disoriented at this peter matheson had been in australia mining opals during that time his eyesight had turned bad obliging him to wear glasses working fourteen hours a day hoarding his lode against the thieves who appeared in all shapes and guises had turned his hair grey wolf found him in lightning ridge a raw and rough miners town in a depression surrounded by long low hills dotted with buddah belah and leopardwood trees aptly named it produced the worlds best black opals wolf had arrived in this remote part of new south wales by truck travelling almost four hundred miles northwest of sydney the last several over a bitumen road black as pitch he was greeted by the raucous cry of a kookaburra scavenging for food months later he would come upon a burrow filled with beautiful pure white kookaburra eggs resting in what had been a termite nest australia he would find was filled with such startling bits of savage beauty the town itself was nothing extraordinary a pair of selfservice stores a butchers shop a bakery one hotel the lightning ridge diggers rest a couple of motels the offices of the local paper the lightning ridge flash three churches a primary school and of course the local firearms clubs peter matheson was sharing his ramshackle house with a pretty feline blackhaired girl with long tanned legs who could not yet have been twenty wolf hello dad he stuck out his hand as he would to a longlost friend by god its good to see you wolf was paralysed while vagrant emotions he could barely comprehend rose and fell within him love fear anger and above all a boys need to be acknowledged by his father peter matheson was a man who had never shirked hard work or danger but he had found the australian outback a different animal altogether he had survived a scorpion bite which had put him into a convulsive fever until an aborigine happening upon him had applied a herb poultice that had taken down the swelling and the fever he had watched poisonous spiders mate the mother spinning out her egg sacs then get eaten by her ravenous young he had endured the ravages of broiling sun and flash floods he had even killed a desperate miner who had tried to steal his cache of opals but that at least was not a new experience for him although peter matheson was a tough man he had had to prove himself all over again to the roughandtumble australians they liked his texas drawl and his hardedged cowboy manners they had an instant respect for a real man who could hold his own in a brawl drink a gallon of beer without vomiting and fornicate all night they were also fascinated by his seemingly inexhaustible tales of american indians the truth was that peter matheson was never at peace unless he was among his men friends he needed the community of tough male spirits like his own as others need food and water he cared for his wife loved his only child but in his own way in their place growing old has different connotations for you and me peter matheson told his son you cant understand that now but all too soon you will its a sad day in a mans life when he falls down and cant get up quite as fast when the pain doesnt go away as quickly and the ache settles in for good is that why you have her wolf said hooking his thumb towards the tightmuscled girl peter matheson smiled at his sons shrewdness partly he admitted but its also partly because she knows in a week or a month ill be gone it wont matter to her shes young too busy with her own life to fixate on anyone elses he glanced over at his son hows your mom busy with her own life wolf had said making his father laugh later in the chittering australian darkness wolf had said youre not coming home are you his father twirling a toothpick whittled from the bone of some small animal said that why you came all this way spent all your mothers money to ask me that i spent my own money wolf said i worked hard to buy this trip peter stuck the toothpick in his mouth stood up come on he said i want to showyou something they went out of the house without telling the girl where they were going they climbed into a small beatup truck and peter swung through the darkness driving up into the ridges my mines pretty near lunatic hill he said i bought it from the aboriginal girl in my house she inherited it from a man named the major who blew his brains out one night while drunk they got out and peter switched on his lanternlike portable light the sky was very dark with just a scattering of firstmagnitude stars peering through a veil of clouds peter swung the beam downwards you see herewhere the ridge has cracked this fault is called a slide if you dont see slides you wont find opals beside the slide they entered a mine ive named this nowhere peter said the gravelly clay went rapidly downwards they walked ahead until they came to what appeared to be a vertical hole in the rock peter led the way down the shaft to the level below ahead the mine opened up into a large space a chamberedout section known locally as a ballroom as wolf was later to learn this far underground peter extinguished his light set a candle to burning to their left wolf could see a series of striations this top part is sandstone peter said you see how at the bottom it is cut off by this hard stuff compressed quartzite the shincracker we call it here its wellnamed his finger traced a path below that is what we call the level claylike earth where we find the nobbies of opal he dug in his pocket produced a roughshaped item which he handed to wolf roll it between your fingers as wolf did so he saw in the candlelight stupendous flashes of peacock green bright orange fiery red you see how closely the flashes of colour are grouped this is called a floral harlequin and its very rare its why i lit the candle the colours are purer in this light now youre seeing it as i did down here when i puddled it out peter was watching his sons face this is what i do how i make money he took the opal back its exciting dangerous work were thought of as a breed apart i answer to no one and you carry the law on your hip wolf said glancing at the colt revolver bolstered on his fathers belt peter put his hand on wolfs shoulder squeezed hard i want you to understand this son i never ran away from anything in my life but sure as im standing here with you civilization would have destroyed me in this wilderness im not required to give myself away wolf stayed with his father for six months out of deference to his son peter was set to dismiss the aboriginal girl almost immediately but wolf objected so she stayed it was this girl in fact with a name he could never quite pronounce who showed him the feral beauty of the kookaburra eggs hidden away in the abandoned termite nest father and son set about finding black opals peter taught wolf how to operate the new pneumatic spade that allowed them to prospect as much of the ridge in a month as had been previously gone over in a year still it was backbreaking work and as peter had said often dangerous not only from natural occurrences but from manmade ones as well but the mathesons survived them all wolf emerging with broader shoulders bulging biceps and a thin white scar along his left collarbone where a wouldbe thief had cut him before hed smashed the heel of his hand into the mans sternum fracturing it hed found a scorpion in his boot one day and had set about feeding it fascinated by the way it made its kill the lightning flick of its segmented tail the plunge of the poisoned barb the thing became a kind of bizarre pet seeming to recognize wolf although peter told him no such thing was possible in a creature whose brain was so primitive but after that theyd had no more problems with thieves the village was filled with peters buddies hardworking harddrinking aussies although there was a scattering of europeans as well they were basically an honest lusty lot with names such as vertical paddy buckjump willie and murdering jack full of laughter and life there was indeed a camaraderie here that would have been difficult to maintain in other more civilized settings wolf fell in with them naturally liking them for their directness they were close to the earth primitive in a way he could not yet fully fathom but because he wanted to and that showed they took to him as swiftly as he did to them theyre great people peter had told his son as long as you dont judge them on the criminal past theyre still so sensitive about theyll be straight with you one night they took him got him drunk shoved him in a room with a young woman ravenhaired lighteyed she was already naked her breasts shivered when he looked at them she was so young her beauty possessing an aching quality that would disappear within a year in this harsh world while they made love the men outside raised their voices in one hearty folk song after another so that wolf and the girl should not worry about their intimate sounds being overheard through the thin walls the girl with the unpronounceable name was still awake when he stumbled home perhaps she had been waiting for him because she seemed to know what had happened and that he would be hungry she fixed him something to eat and they went outside into the starstrewn night wolf sat on the steps eating silently while the girl sat beside him smoking in that still contemplative manner that reminded him of white bow she told him that she was a kulin one of the most ancient of the aboriginal tribes had been born in the southeast among her people but had soon grown restless she liked the wind in her face the sun in her eyes but there was nothing for her to do in lightning ridge except sell her body now of course she had money and didnt have to do anything she didnt want to it was a unique feeling he felt very close to her this being from an alien culture on the other side of the world a primitive really in the same way his grandfather was except she was not in any way intimidating he liked her responded to her understood finally why he had never been offended by her presence in his fathers house they talked until the starlight dimmed and pearl light began to stream across the ridgetops that was when she drew her legs beneath her told him about sunsets it seemed her people believed that sunset was the time of death because the kulin rode the oblique rays of the setting sun into the heavens where the dead dwelt she had actually seen this occur once she said her grandmother who was very old had died at sunset and she had seen her grandmothers spirit rise from the dead husk to walk upon the thick rays of the sun until she was above the birds the mountaintops even the wind now she said she could feel her grandmother in the sunlight that fell upon her the wind that caressed her enchanted wolf fell asleep beside her sprawled across the front steps of his fathers house surely wolf would have stayed longer but he was abruptly called home this calling was in a metaphorical sense in the same way his mother had described flight to him he awoke one morning from a dream in it a hawk was circling so high in the sky it was a mere speck gradually it descended through the layers of atmosphere until it was below the crests of purple mountains and then below that into a vast red valley along which ran a fault a shifting of the rock floor down down down it went into the twilight of the earth where wolf laboured in stone dust and seeping silt alerted by the dry crack of beating wings he looked up into the face of the hawk and knew he said goodbye to his father on the slope of lightning ridge the sun brighter in the australian winter than it ever was at home fell upon him like a mantle his father took his hand as he had when wolf had first appeared then pulled him to him embracing him it was great of you to come peter told his son more than i had hoped i understand why you wont come back wolf said peter let go of him i know you do the last sight wolf had of him was returning to the makeshift village his buddies converging around him the beer coming out as he was driven away wolf thought he heard a ghost of a song spring up white bow was dying and this was what had called wolf home for his last days his grandfather had been moved to his own tepee which had been tended daily in his absence a hole had been cut in the tepee directly over where white bow lay on his palette of doeskin and bear fur nearby a fire was burning into which were periodically thrown bunches of dried sweet sage these preparations wolf knew were to aid his grandfather in his ascent up to heaven it was summer in elk basin but white bow was covered to his neck in furs he shivered often as with the ague although he was not ill in any manner a white doctor could determine i have been fortunate white bow said to wolf one day while the boy sat at his side most people move outside themselves only once in their lives at the very end my flights occurred every day whenever i wished them wolf said you wanted me to fly too didnt you grandfather he had been pondering this question all during his interminable trip home for the longest time white bow did not reply his eyes were closed and his face waxylooking had taken on the appearance of a death mask wolf was becoming alarmed when the old mans lips moved it is true he said that i wished for you to follow the path i made for myself it took me some time to see how selfish this wish was for once i had listened to my heart and not the worldsong i had wanted something too badly but i think i wanted it too wolf said remember how id ask you to bring me back to that spot on the playa white bows lips formed the ghost of a smile i remember every time but i think you wanted only to please me his head turned towards wolf let me feel your hand wolf slipped his hand into his grandfathers noting how cool and dry it was i feel your strength wolf and i know your path lies in a different direction which one i dont know but even as he said it wolf had the impression that he knew very well he the master weaver who could follow each thread even after the whole was complete do you remember our journey into the land of the dead white bow said yes each journey each flight begins with a crossing of a bridge it may not be a real bridge like the river the river yes white bow said i want you to do something for me build me a bridge take two lengths of sturdy hemp and using sinew affix to them at intervals seven of the arrows i made for myself as one would attach rungs i will get some help no white bows grip on his hand was strong and steady this you must do yourself only your hands may touch the ladderbridge when you are done hang it from the hole above me now go he released wolfs hand do as i have bade you three hours later it was done the day was ending the sun as swollen as a pregnant woman wallowed near the summits of the mountains on the horizon all day a breeze had swept through the tepee keeping wolf cool but now as he finished hanging the ladder the air was still the heat of the day radiating from the hardpacked ground holding back the coming chill of night wolf white bow said at the dawn of time there was no need of shamans or ladderbridges every person possessed the power to project himself upward to heaven but like waters effect upon rock time has changed humans most have lost the power now it is for shamans alone to walk the narrow defile between heaven and earth between time and space but now these bridges are dangerous because heaven and earth time and space are no longer contiguous they are separated by a fearsome void created by degeneration where even the most powerful shaman may be lost the old man stared up through the hole in the tepee at the sky burnished by the first few fires of sunset i took you across such a ladderbridge you were able to make the journey not because of me but because of what dwells within you this is why i chose you to construct this ladder learn what is inside you wolf you will have to use it one day open hand was with white bow when he died all around his tent members not only of the wind river shoshone but of a host of other tribes of the nation sat intent on the passing of the old man wolf squatting just outside the entrance flap looked back once to see the plain filled with people silent expectant the only movement coming from the horses grazing the dogs wandering past cooking fires searching for scraps once a baby squalled and that was all wolf must have fallen asleep because the next thing he knew his mother was kneeling beside him her arms curled around him protectively her lips brushed his cheek her eyes were red her face streaked with tears wolf sighed put his arms around her in turn hes gone she said softly but for the first and only time in her life she was wrong book ii life during wartime as a member of an escorted tour you dont even have to know the matter horn isnt a tuba temple fielding six washington east hampton tokyo what i find more contemptible than anything said brig gen hampton conrad is hypocrisy conrad looked as if he had stepped off a recruiting poster for the armed services he was squarejawed craggyfaced and bigboned his sandygrey hair was cut in regulation fashion his grey eyes carried just enough blue flash in them to make him appear both attractive and dangerous but he did not think the way a straightforward military man would which was why he was a brigadier and why he was retired ten years prior to what might be considered normal for a man of his rank but there was nothing normal about ham conrad he had been brought up in hartford connecticut one of seven sons of thornburg conrad iii the man who had put hartford on the map as the insurance capital of the country ham had been given that sobriquet by his older brothers because of his huge hands which when ham balled them into fists could inflict serious damage on those boys even several years his senior who riled him thornburg conrad iii had done everything he could to ensure that his progeny would be successful in whatever endeavour they chose to that end ham had gone to west point graduating in the top one per cent of his class his brothers had sneered at him from their elevated positions as students in the most prestigious east coast high schools colleges and universities thornburg had kept silent believing that dealing with this spirited animosity could only improve ham he certainly never allowed his own feelings to show he was proud of ham there was a vision ham was following that it was thornburgs vision only made the elder conrad prouder still ham had excelled in tactical warfare and immediately upon graduation he had been assigned to the us military assistance command vietnam which was then in march under the command of general william westmoreland macv was the hub of strategic military planning for the entire vietnam campaign ham had spent a sometimes successful often frustrating four years in and around saigon during his tour he was promoted three times though he never personally engaged the enemy he was responsible for thousands of their deaths after his return thornburg had insisted he take a full immersion course in japanese six months later thornburg had used his influence in washingtons potent oldboy network to gain ham a significant position in japan with the far east military intelligence group there ham flourished as his father had foreseen he would using his keen mind and its tactical bent to attune military and government personnel to the nuances and often baffling idiosyncrasies of the culture in fact as time progressed it became clear to ham that this expertise had been honed to such a level that his position in the military was fast becoming a hindrance being army he stood out in any crowd could not in japan go where he might want to because of the japanese antipathy towards american military personnel in addition he was so good with people so kind considerate so impeccable with advice that his reputation grew far beyond the boundaries of the military he had been trained well by his father he was not a man who long tolerated roadblocks to the furtherance of his career he spent many long months deciding what to do it was on a rare holiday in hawaii that his father flew into waikiki amid the sundrenched beachscape festooned with clattering palm trees and bronzed bodies clad in fluorescent bikinis thornburg conrad iii and ham devised their plan to reinvent the world as they knew it he would require he said hams help on the japanese end and because as always he wished to remain in the background he wanted ham effectively to run the daytoday mapping of the idea by the time he returned to tokyo ten days later it had become a fullblown plan with every major development laid out every eventuality covered with the military precision that was typical of hams genius hams superiors loved it the relevant government personnel back in washington loved it even more but then these were the same men in the oldboy network with whom thornburg had gone to school and whom he had spent some forty years cultivating they liked ham and more they respected him he reminded them of his father whom they liked and respected and with whom they had exchanged many favours and consummated many mutually profitable deals these men listened to ham digesting the conrads plan with the avidity of a snake gobbling a rat to a man they agreed that ham was the right man in the right place at the right time they lifted their voices in chorus and in due course orders were cut returning him to washington where in a ceremony of no little pomp he was retired from the army he would never forget that day medals hung from the breast of his dress uniform presented to him by his superiors though he had never once personally engaged the enemy in war which made him a little sad but though he had retired from the army he was hardly retired he had in effect exchanged one set of masters for another but he was also several giant steps closer to the top of the pyramid of influence and power several steps closer to the goal his father had set for him when he had been a young man without influence you will never be happy thornburg conrad iii had said to him when he had been twelve next year you will be a man at least you would be in most primitive cultures and you will be in my eyes thornburg had put a hand atop his sons head in a gesture that thinking back on it ham judged to be a kind of sanctification as if the old man were a bishop instead of a billionaire be certain you make me proud be certain you further the eminence of the name of conrad and like a knight templar ham had set out to do just that thus the conrads father and son had decided to join forces for ham nothing could have been more perfect together they formulated a plan that was brilliant the key to dismantling modernday japan was deceptively simple because it was going to be provided by that arrogant japanese naoharu nishitsu when yuji shian was provided with enough evidence against nishitsu he would begin a public purging that would culminate in a kind of bloodless coup brought about by the finelyhoned japanese sense of honour sweeping all the ageing rightwing billionaires tied to nishitsu not only from their corporate suites but from their positions of influence and as it had done in eastern europe and russia the wind of change would create a whole new order one more suited to the west especially the united states made up of consumers not savers young men not tied to the war in the pacific but wanting to live in the present willing to listen to reason to see that the american way always had been and still was the successful way to conduct international business hypocrisy is the bane of civilization ham said now as he wrapped his lips around what he judged to be the best hamburger in the greater dc area outside everyone on the street was black inside the burger joint the patrons and the counterman were black and so was the cook this was a ghetto section of washington that not even many police patrol cars ventured into at night ham did not mind the ghetto at all washington like most large cities in the usa was made up of the haves and the havenots only more so what had appealed most to ham about thornburgs plan was that it had the potential to change the face of the world it was his fervent hope that it might even eventually help the havenots ham despised the haves with their correct manners their narrow minds and their obsession with protocol as if the world at large cared one fig for protocol or manners or debate in fact he found here in the world at large a kind of simmering rage that was a relief from the upscale lilywhite posturing of the monied georgetown capitol hill chevy chase set he had come to loathe at least rage was a pure emotion untainted by duplicity hence his diatribe hypocrisy is the symptom of all selfsatisfied cultures he continued its a warning sign like bad breath or bleeding gums thats best heeded quickly he bared his steellike teeth pushed them through the red meat grinding it to pulp speaking of which jason yoshida said sucking a bit of melted cheese off his forefinger audrey simmons is coming in at the glass of vanilla coke disappeared in hams fist as he put it to his mouth and drank deeply he smacked his lips in satisfaction senator simmons wife yup jason yoshida said he whacked off an enormous bite of cheeseburger thrusting most of it into his cheek as he said i believe she wants to thank you in person for helping her son rich mens children ham said wiping his mouth with a succession of paper napkins are more often products of their parents fortunes than they are of their parents themselves he polished off his vanilla coke pointed to a gigantic sticky bun to be brought over the wages of parenthoodbyproxy eh yosh yoshida deep in his cheeseburger grunted as a spurt of ketchup spattered the nearby chrome sugar dispenser and ham turned to the rapt counterman said i sure hope youve got a gallon of your strong coffee son because thats just what i need about now much to hams surprise and relief audrey simmons was not the hypocrite her powerful husband was her problem however had not been a surprise her son tony had been in deep with the wrong crowd taking drugs going awol from summer school and generally being a pain in the ass as senator simmons had said when he had phoned ham tony seems to be his own self again she said oh im so grateful she smiled and i know leland will be too never mind that ham said i did what i did for tony but what exactly did you do he got up stared out the window watching a black gardener tend the rose bushes outside his office he wondered if the gardener ate his breakfast at the burger joint in the ghetto ham had just returned from he did not have an office overlooking the white house which was the goal of most people in washington yet his was most definitely an office of power hampton conrad had made it so it was a standard governmentissue room with high ceilings exposed wiring and ugly wooden furniture that seemed to date from before the second world war there was a framed photo of the current president on one wall a reproduction of a striking portrait of teddy roosevelt on another the cream paint was peeling in one corner all in all ham would have to say that he liked his other office on k street much better even though he hardly used it it was a spacious suite he had picked out himself in the same building as washingtons most prestigious law firm the only other tenant on his floor was a powerful lobby for certain japanese interests the irony of the location tickled him the k street offices went by the name of lenfant lenfant using the name of brosian lenfant the wellknown and respected former senator from louisiana who was too rich to have been affected by his brief term in office before he suffered a debilitating heart attack now he lent his name and once a week his body to the firm owned and operated by ham conrad jason yoshida who had become an american citizen with hams assistance and was now a gs a rather high government service rating nominally worked for the department of defense in fact he operated mostly out of the k street offices which he ran with impressive efficiency ham turned away from the window you know mrs simmons sometimes all children need to see the error of their ways is to be given parameters parameters he turned to look at the senators wife she was blonde with that peculiar brittle beauty endemic to washington women but she seemed to know damned little about raising a child she wore a sleek chic designer suit that he judged must have set the senator back two thousand dollars he said hoping she would understand if a child senses that he has no limits that he will be allowed to do whatever he wishes he will push to see if its true he does this mrs simmons not simply because he is wilful but because he senses that what he needs are limits rock solid boundaries that define his world the difference between yes you can and no you cant because with these limits comes a profound sense of security that all children need audrey simmons rose well all i can say is youve worked wonders on tony she extended one cool expertly manicured hand my husband will be in touch to ham waved away her words you can tell the senator for me that ill call him if and when theres a need he smiled seeing her to the door and mrs simmons dont hesitate to call me if tony gives you any further trouble audrey simmons turned abruptly so that ham who had been following her was momentarily pressed against her front could i call you anyway audrey simmons asked her head tilted up at that angle women used to connote surrender my husband isnt the only one who could show you his appreciation ham wondered just how bored audrey simmons must be to want to indulge herself like a slut his father was a hypocrite and his mother was a whore he thought feeling sorry for tony what a family he clamped her firmly by the arm steered her out the door murmuring a cordial but distancing goodbye jason yoshida slipped in a moment later was that community service or business he asked when he had shut the door behind him you know youre damn cynical for a japanese i may be japanese but im all american now ham lifted a hand pardon me he shrugged sitting back down behind his desk in any case youre a cynical bastard its this town yoshida said deadpan theres something in the air or in the water ham grunted the thing is simmons kid is basically a good egg hell be a far better human being than his parents are thats for sure but we can count on his old man if we need him and we will need him ham said the senate international trade committee bill will be coming onto the floor of the senate any day now the draconian restrictions it will impose on foreign imports will trigger trade sanctions from japan effectively the bill that american labour unions have been lobbying for for so long will cut us off economically from japan what do you think will happen when all of the governments top secret defence computers break down and the chips manufactured only in japan are unavailable it wont come to that yoshida said were seeing to it yes we are ham laced his hands behind his head stared out the window at the black man and his roses ham envied him his intimacy with nature but perhaps not quickly enough this string of deaths of key senators has thornburg very worried the coroner claims they were of either accidental or natural causes so were getting no help from the police yoshida said of course not but the police dont see things in the right perspective all the senators who have turned up dead were against this bill and who are their replacements men who im told are responsive to the labour unions and will vote for it yoshida waited patiently for ham to finish then said on another front ive reassigned shipley back to his old job at defense but i think we ought to consider a promotion he did extremely well with rushing wolf matheson into the hole left by moravias death ham was watching a shadow fall across the rose bushes deepening the woody stems to black sure why not ill think of a suitable reward ham swivelled around looked sharply at yoshida recognizing a tone of voice whats bothering you im not sure yoshida admitted but im starting to have grave misgivings at first i was sure your father had everything planned down to the last nut and bolt first these senators start to go down then lawrence moravia gets iced and your father pushes us to get matheson into the breach we dont even know if moravia was made to talk before he was hit you know that doesnt matter ham said we used shipley as a cutout moravia never met us or any of your contacts hed have no idea we were involved at all yoshida made no comment to this with the singlemindedness that was typical of him pushed on with his own line of thinking we put shipley in place he does a number to recruit matheson just as your father ordered and again as your father ordered we go to great lengths to keep an eye on matheson while hes finding his way down the same rabbit hole moravia disappeared into the only thing we come up with is a dizzy japanese artist hes asking about because maybe hes got the hots for her then someone puts him through the skylight of a new york city apartment building look yosh this was essentially my fathers plan and as far as i can see its still on course ham said as if he hadnt heard a word yoshida had said hadnt agreed with it more likely were on course in the japanese phase because were on top of things and have our own connections in japan yoshida pointed out you know maybe just maybe the old man is slipping at his age youve got to admit its more than possible matheson is a case in point why is your father so adamant we use him to replace moravia when i have the perfect agent already in place in tokyo besides matheson gives me the willies hes a loner and an amateur to boot who knows whether hell follow discipline you cant tell me you do yoshida shook his head hes the one destabilizing element in all this why bring such a dangerous man into the equation in the first place ham grunted weve been all through this mathesons a detective by trade the shit moravia stepped into is his milieu i think my father believes we made a mistake with moravia hes convinced matheson is the only one smart enough to infiltrate forbidden dreams and naoharu nishitsus world and from what ive read of his background im still inclined to agree with the old man but your objection is noted yosh thats not an objection yoshida said waiting to go on until ham had raised his eyes like bad breath or bleeding gums its a warning sign thats best heeded quickly before the entire plan is put into jeopardy much to wolfs surprise it had been amandas sister stevie powers who was waiting for him in his hospital room after he had been brought down from recovery it had been stevie who had the neurospecialist flown in from walter reed in washington to make certain there would be no lasting damage from the operation to close the long deep gashes down his left leg and arm miraculously his plunge had been intercepted by an oldfashioned fourposter bed so piled with eiderdowns and quilts that it had absorbed the impetus of the fall youre spending so much time here he had said while he was still in the hospital what about your patients stevie had tried to smile i took some time off the cut of her karl lagerfeld suit perfectly accentuated the curves of her figure the truth is in my current state i couldnt face their broken psyches of course morton disapproved he thinks the best thing for me right now is to get back into my work but hes wrong and just when he was sure she was playing psychiatrist pulling him outside himself she disarmed him with her soft smile and said anyway i like being here with you closer to amanda than anywhere else but in a peculiar way her unexpected kindness had a downside during those days in the hospital each seeming to contain a weekful of hours he was never so acutely aware of being alone and while bobby connor and his other cop buddies made their courtesy calls he was aware that squire richards had not or would not come having asked after him he had watched bobbys face turn solemn everyone knows about your beef with him it wasnt a beef wolf had said annoyed we had a disagreement lets talk about something else bobby had said like the cme says hell have something for you maybe after the weekend okay lets have it wolf had said whats the story going around bobby looked singularly uncomfortable lieutenant people are saying you got into it with squire real heavy something in bobbys voice made wolf say and and you want him off the werewolves because hes black thats ridiculous i know it is bobby said but i dont think breathard does that stupid sonuvabitch but of course breathard wasnt stupid at all on the contrary he was very clever you gotta understand lieutenant there were a lot of witnesses and breathards spoke to em all let him speak to squire this was between him and me bobby got up off the chair looked out the sooty window squire hasnt once opened his mouth about this except to say hes got no intention of leaving the werewolves you mean hes letting this idiotic race bias story feed on itself guess he is he turned back to wolf the fact is hes taken a couple of days personal leave breathard okayed it wolf closed his eyes squire was no doubt scouring his neighbourhood for cash to pay off his brothers loan sharks he now regretted not going after squire that night at la mentira giving him the money he needed bobby wolf had said wearily let me know when he surfaces if he calls in tell him i want to talk to him about just tell him i want to talk to him when squire came to see him hed see that the man got his money of course that was strictly against regs as were squires actions right down the line this was just what he had talked to amanda about time and again but isnt that what mens clubs were all about either bending existing laws or making up their own either way there was an inherent contempt at work for the guidelines of the world at large often so subtly that many members were unaware of its corrosive existence of course there must be others for whom this contempt offered the ultimate lure three days later when he was released from the hospital stevie invited him to her house in east hampton for a fourday weekend please say youll come she had said im in desperate need of the rest but i cant bear to be alone she smiled thinly like other highpressure professions at some time or other all good analysts risk burning out the large rambling house hunkered by the edge of georgica pond was dark even at noon but unquiet the creaks and groans of aged wood and copper plumbing were joined by the scrape and waft of thick branches from the gnarled overgrown hemlocks that guarded it giving the clapboard the patina of weathered copper for some reason there was often less wind on the water than there was around the house itself nestled as it was amid the grove of shaggy shapeless hemlocks an enormous sculpted privet hedge ran down the east side of the property rhododendron and smaller more delicate azalea were sheared into intermediate borders on estates on either side of the property hidden but not ignored by stevie and her husband lived the bluebloods into whose lifestyle they had decided to climb through the windows he had seen sunlight streaking the georgica pond the name a deliberate understatement typical of the local gentry it being more the size of a lake like pigment upon a painters brush there was a sense about the light of incipience of colour that was not yet vivid of an idea not yet formed wolf had made up a story and now believed it that there was a mystery in the pond that confluence of natural forces life hidden away but nevertheless teeming beneath the water under the rocks within the canopy of pin oaks that modern man could never completely understand like the minds that conceived and executed the fetishes that festooned stevie and mortons living and dining rooms these were handwrought figures animal human supernatural creatures that stevie had collected during her peripatetic teens from every conceivable country on earth mexico honduras tibet guatemala peru haiti madagascar sri lanka thailand bhutan zanzibar wolf found the animistic atmosphere intriguing as if these dolls set up psychic eddies in the rooms through the halls along the staircase as if they had the power to bring white bows worldsong to life or at least further into the light wolf slept and when he awoke his eyes were blurred and his throat was thick with the memory of being thrown through the skylight the great bang and plummeting through an icefield of glass but he had dreamed and not about the pitched battle up on the rooftop not about his fall what dead and undead fire in the ice in the he wiped sweat from his forehead as he struggled to remember it was already dark he had slept the morning away he discovered stevie in an overstuffed chair in the living room catching up on what appeared to be a file on one of her patients but she closed it as soon as she saw him standing in the hallway the wind soughed restlessly through the hemlocks and the branches skittered against the house like sounds from the unconscious somewhere the sun must be out perhaps on the water how do you feel okay he flexed his left hand several times its still stiff after i sleep but otherwise he shrugged ive begun to miss my workouts a good sign she said ill miss you when you go back to work he came into the living room what does morton think of my being here mortons in washington stevie said as she busily fluffed the throw pillows on the couch when morton is in washington hes oblivious to anything else she put a fist into the centre of a pillow which had the disturbing effect of pulling her white mantailored shirt tight across her breasts up here in the country she seemed to have shed the impeccable society image preferring jeans and simple shirts or shaker sweaters it was almost as if she had left that other blueblood stevie powers behind in the park avenue coop and hes in washington quite a bit she looked away said im getting cabin fever i can see the sun on the pond lets take a walk they donned jackets went down to the water where the sunlight glanced dully off the still thick water it was warm for the beginning of march and they left their jackets open so the fronts flapped against their thighs as they walked they moved in silence around the edge of the water wolf skipping stones when he found them halfembedded in the damp soil his slight limp was almost gone and so it seemed to stevie he grew stronger every time he exercised the leg his powers of recovery were truly remarkable the pond was like a solid thing a presence at rest hibernating dreaming of the spring when it would stir to life stevie put her hands in her pockets hunched her shoulders although there was no wind standing close beside her wolf could tell that she was still thinking of his crack about morton being in washington so much wolf i even let amanda buy into the fiction about morton and me she said all at once stupid huh what did i accomplish i cut myself off from the one person i could talk to about it she glanced at him a moment then took a deep breath let it out in a rush well to be brutally honest morton has found himself a piedaterre in washington im afraid theres someone down there much younger than i am with whom hes infatuated an ambassadorial attache from france i believe she frowned thoughtfully staring at the imprints her boots had made in the dark leafstrewn earth funny i cant imagine saying that to anyone else i know id be mortified morton and i have a teflon reputation as having a stellar marriage its good for both our careers its very difficult to admit to let alone to say but i suppose youth is something with which i just cannot compete later over a delicious andalusian stew she had prepared she said in a way youre like one of these fetishes that festoon the house alien and fascinating he took one up the bright colours and blunt imagery filling his hand like a fountain of light is that how you think of these fetishes as alien arent they stevie said wolf shrugged in a way they are closer to what the world is all about than we can ever be she tucked her chin into her hands tell me more about that so thats why you insisted i come up here with you he said so you can dissect my psyche she knew at once that he was more than half serious she laughed oh my god no oh dont think that but she could not meet his gaze instead stared into her plate as if it contained entrails from which like a roman she could divine the future would you think ill of me she said raising her head so her dark eyes met his if i confessed that i brought you here out of a profound sense of guilt no wolf said i would think you were doing what was natural he smiled to help allay her obvious distress amanda always said abruptly he choked and appalled looked away he gritted his teeth willing the tears not to fall from the corners of his eyes ah christ amanda he thought stevie got up began to clear the dishes you know she said despite what you saw it wasnt always easy having a sister amanda and i would have our fights especially about morton well perhaps she was right there she set out a lemon meringue pie even though she knew neither of them had any intention of eating it the sense of normalcy serving dessert brought was what was needed we were both very competitive i bet you didnt know that about her perhaps because teaching made her so happy when we were younger we wanted to win at everything and sometimes hurting each other well we could hurt each other deeply she set out cups cream and sugar poured the coffee she sat down so abruptly the coffee rattled out of the cups onto the table she put her hands over her face oh damn i promised myself i wouldnt do this dredging up the past airing old regrets railing against an unfair fate especially to you who almost died trying to protect her she pulled distractedly at her french braid drawing it over one shoulder but it is so damned unfair we both had so much more to say to her didnt we stevie was weeping openly now her shoulders hunched that air of invulnerable competence shattered by her sudden defencelessness gradually he saw he had been led beyond the careful facade into the real stevie powers with her failed marriage her incomplete relationship with her sister her doubts about herself as a person after a long silence she said its been so good for me being able to take care of you knowing that i was being useful to someone to you the light limned her so that he could not distinguish her features and for an instant her profile appeared disturbingly like someone elses a residue loitered in his mind like the aftertaste of a dream his grandfathers eyes chikas eyes her strong thighs hips jerking forward a shudder and a tiny moan you know wolf i used to think that amanda needed me and i thought that was a good feeling but now too late i know the simple and obvious truth i needed her as much as she needed me he tried to free himself of the disturbing image of chika will you sleep tonight she shook her head no but it will be better because youre here i can feel you in the house and thats something i can hold onto i think youre damn lucky that jason yoshida is committed to you thornburg conrad iii said that man would be dangerous without proper supervision should be locked up anyway my experience with the japanese confirms to me that they simply cannot be trusted yosh is different ham conrad said generally he shared his fathers distrust of the japanese whose idea of a good bargain was to go off and do exactly as they pleased but yosh had proved his loyalty over and over he goes to great pains to tell me hes only half japanese and all american the two conrads were on the deck outside the captains cabin of influence ii thornburgs magnificent foot teakdecked schooner which was currently moored at his favourite spot well off the sea lanes in chesapeake bay it was a mild day the sun picking up the vigour of reflection off the water gave a strong hint of the spring to come on the table between them was a lunch of major proportions remnants of the dozen maryland crab cakes ham had just consumed remained on the checked tablecloth along with small plastic cups of tartar sauce ketchup mustard mounds of potato salad and pickles the japanese thornburg said with more care are damned difficult to judge he looked particularly dapper in his traditional blue and white yachting outfit with his impressive height lankiness and powerfully rugged face he appeared not unlike gary cooper off the range ive had my time with them just as youve had yours dont get cocky and think youre the only firstclass brain around who can sniff out what theyre up to i cant caution you enough about them ham waited he had become adept at that while his brothers had become increasingly impatient when dealing with their father having a minimum of contact with him they saw him now as a cantankerous uncaring relic who had lived past his time but ham saw his father as the masterpiece he was logical brilliant calculating the quintessential tactician on the cutthroat battlefield of corporate life though he had his own code of morality in those things ham could only wish to be more like him all you need do is take our friends yuji shian and naoharu nishitsu as an example thornburg continued at last what it took was the notion of putting one and one together and making zero to get the ball rolling on our little scheme little scheme indeed ham thought our little scheme is going to bring the modern economic colossus of japan to its knees and with it sweep away such dangerous wealthy radicals as naoharu nishitsu yes sir he had called his father sir ever since he was sent off to prep school at the age of nine when addressing him it never occurred to ham to call him anything else thornburg watching his son plough through the food went on as far as i was concerned the mushrooming prominence of the black blade society combined with the mindbogglingly large infusions of money flowing from the mainstream of japanese society into nishitsus hands over the last several years make an immediate termination imperative you agreed with me and so did the president and the military and they liked even more my proposal to finesse these groups out of existence to in effect get them to destroy one another well sir as we both know no plan survives contact with the enemy the up side is that my contingency plan brought jason yoshida into the centre of things dont be cute with me son someone found out we were using moravia to infiltrate forbidden dreams that damned club of the ultraconservatives in tokyo we know that forbidden dreams is also the nexus point for the toshin kuro kosai the black blade society moravia had been compiling the hard evidence against nishitsu well need for yuji shian to take action he was also providing us with the specifics on the latest postings of black blade society members to the headquarters of multinational corporations all around the globe they are on the march that is for certain and theres no doubt we have to quash them before their members become too wellentrenched thats where moravia came in and they iced him but we still need the evidence definitively linking nishitsu with the ultraconservatives the radical terrorists and the black blade society we also must have more intelligence on the toshin kuro kosais plans thornburgs lips twitched as if in some longatrophied response to the sight of food then they went ahead and tried to do the same thing with the one man who could follow moravia down into the snakepit of forbidden dreams matheson yes wolf matheson shipley our man in defense did a fine job recruiting him ham finished what was left of his turkey and gorgonzola sandwich and started preparing another id like to talk to you about him now that the enemy has gotten to him too perhaps we should think about using someone else to that dog just wont hunt thornburg snapped let me tell you something about our friend wolf matheson theres no better detective mind on the face of the earth believe me the man combines an unerring intuition with an unquenchable curiosity and the persistence of a bulldog thats a formidable combination yoshidas man is already on site ham countered and i am constrained to point out sir that all mathesons given us so far is some bullshit fantasy on the new york cmes part that the inside of moravia appeared younger than the outside which even if it were true is irrelevant to our purposes son you dont know wolf matheson the way i do youd have to have seen him in action like i did to appreciate all his qualities ive picked him for sound reasons rest assured now what else have you got for me ham dropped the subject but that did not stop him from considering what to do about it the more he thought about what yosh had said the more he was inclined to his point of view matheson was a very dangerous character more than that he was unpredictable his father obviously could not see that but ham and yosh could oh i almost forgot he said digging into his pocket chief breathard finally managed to get a decent surveillance photo of this offthewall japanese artist matheson seemed so keen on investigating just before he was put through the skylight he handed a small five by seven envelope over to his father i dont think its going to amount to much yosh thinks you show this to anybody son ham shook his head you can see that breathards seal hasnt been tampered with thornburg was peering at the envelope whose flap had been sealed as per hams instructions with plastic fibrelaced tape stamped with the nypd chief logo he grunted used a table knife to saw through the tape inside was a single grainy blackandwhite photo thornburg stared at the young womans face in the photo for some time without comment then he put it carefully away good god son he said as he watched ham tear into a roast beef swiss cheese and coleslaw sandwich you have the appetite of the entire seventh fleet ham grinned as he chomped off half a crisp garlic pickle its the sea air sir it really gets my juices flowing damn lie thornburg said with a wry twist of his thin lips you always ate like a trencherman hyperactive child your mother said poppycock i told her the boy eats like a man he grunted women think they know everything about everything especially when it comes to raising children rubbish i say he squinted into the sunlight coming off chesapeake bay jerked a thumb towards the rear of the schooner where a sleek young blonde carelessly sunbathed in the nude despite a latent chill why i married that one he said couldnt give a fig for children she was built for one thing which any redblooded man can see and she does it damn well he grunted again pushing around his crumbled crabcake with a crooked forefinger he sucked up some juice along with a dollop of ketchup before he said food i have no appetite for it at all these days these days thornburg conrad iii was pushing eighty but as he liked to say still as virile as he ever was the truth was he looked nowhere near his age but if id a mind to i imagine i could still sire a child with that one he said and laughed at the look on his sons face you were always so proper ham your mind solely on the job at hand the perfect soldier its good i can still shock you reminds me that time hasnt altogether run away from me thornburg had moved to an immense forested estate in rural virginia three years ago just before he had met and married tiffany body as ham chose secretly to call her hi my names tiff whats yours ham could imagine her saying in her high braindead voice her name was really tiffany conrad now which as far as ham was concerned was joke enough what he hated most thornburg had once confessed to ham when he had been drunk on glenlivet the only spirits he drank was that he could no longer stand erect still he had said in the furry voice the liquor gave him im erect where it matters most so who gives a fig if im bent a little into the wind ive ridden out enough storms in my day he was dead on about that ham thought thornburg had outmuscled outgunned and outfoxed every one of his foes whatever it takes to win he had once told his son when he was so drunk he couldnt see straight you do it period because nothing else matters women those fickle creatures come and go and children damn their souls betray you by growing up and doing whatever the hell pleases them ham recalled the brisk autumn morning when his father had taken him to a meeting in the pentagon he had just returned from nam and newly decorated had supposed his father had wanted to show him off ironically the meeting had been held in the same room ham had been ushered into when years later he had proposed the conrads plan to bring down japan inc he had been impressed and he had to admit somewhat perplexed by the degree of respect and influence his father wielded in the military sector only the most senior officers of each branch were in attendance it had been his experience that civilians that is anyone outside the armed forces were viewed with a considerable degree of suspicion not to say contempt the military was a kind of sacred club and like the masons its business was strictly speaking its own ham vividly recalled the highranking rear admiral hostile to thornburgs proposal to set up a central clearing house to approve advanced weapons systems for each branch of the military his fathers vested interest in this was that he had brought together four small but farsighted weapons manufacturing firms in a firsttime conglomerate especially to create new forms of weapons systems for the military the rear admiral apparently seeing his power eroded by such a centralized scheme had argued that such a proposal would take the competitive edge away from the established bidding procedure now in effect ham had watched mesmerized like everyone else in the room as his father had proceeded to pull out facts and figures covering the last decade illustrating time after time the inefficiency of the current procedure he exposed the waste in design flaws manufacturing overages and falsified tests resulting from the mad scramble to get lowest bids in under the artificial deadline set by the military itself then he showed how his system would correct the flaws avoid the waste of the old procedure this clever and calculated oration would no doubt have persuaded his august audience but thornburg was not yet finished at this point he introduced his son gave pertinent background on hams posting to vietnam then asked ham to give his impressions of the weapons materiel available to macv in the southeast asian theatre of operations hams subsequent eyewitness account of the numerous disasters encountered by the military command in nam under actual battle conditions had been devastating yes ham thought now as he watched his father suck up more ketchup he never let anything or anyone stand in his way and because he is as remorseless as ruthless as a shark its a damn good thing hes got me near him now what he halfjokingly calls proper is really my morality thornburg took up a cigar from a chasedsilver humidor rolled it between his fingers sniffed it deeply then reluctantly put it back most people consider me amoral he said using that uncanny trick of his to seemingly read other peoples minds but what do they know of it you know most peoples opinions are based on ignorance he stared hard at his son truth is and youre the only one id tell i have my own code of morality i dare say the difference is its based on a whole other set of parameters i chose a damn dangerous sea to swim in i needed guts and guile just to survive by god to prosper i needed more i understand sir of course you do thornburg nodded you were always a quick study and you were born with the good sense never to be led around by the nose ham knew the old man was speaking of his brother jay whose promising law practice had gone down in flames because of the affair he had been having with his senior partners wife men who think with their balls are not men at all thornburg declared theyre accidents waiting to happen jay could use both our help now sir ignoring his son thornburg hitched around in his seat he stared at tiffany body who was sitting up lacquering her naked torso with yet another layer of lotion ah you see god still loves me he said i get a hardon just watching her massage her breasts look at those nipples magnificent the old man rubbed his lean jaw ah the firmness what i wouldnt give for that kind of youth what are you complaining about ham said you look young enough not to be her father thornburg turned back to ham youve still got a lot to learn about life son i know people from every layer of society high and low i have an unfair advantage over you ham was paying full attention now the image of tiffany bodys perfect breasts evaporated like mist in sunlight thornburg laced his fingers together pleased that he did not have to tell his son when to pay attention the moravia hit convinces me that the black blade society is on a deadline that means we are too he lifted a remarkably straight finger timing son is often everything the most meticulously detailed plan can come to disaster because of inappropriate timing fording the stream at the right time can make the difference between getting your ankles wet and walking around with soaked balls thornburg conrad iii looked out along the bay at the sunsparked waves the lone brave sailboat scudding along with the wind they could not feel alee much as i admire sailors i prefer a boat you can drive takes you where you want to go when you want to go theres a life lesson in that thornburg was keen on life lessons and he did not consider any of his sons too old to keep learning them huh an inanimate object a thing like this boat that you can master and turn to your whim makes a welcome change from age which in the end betrays you just as foully as women and children he stared down at the food on the table as if it were an object whose purpose he could no longer quite comprehend advancing age creates opportunities for people like my young wife he made a face theres a paradox there somewhere the older you get the more you want and damn it son i want more than i can currently get at that moment a chime sounded on his wrisrwatch damn he said pill time he got up excuse me a moment son ham watched his father disappear down the companionway midships a soft breeze ruffled his hair and then it was calm again alone on deck with only the heavenly vision of tiffany body to keep him company he fell into a reverie he remembered his thirteenth birthday when thornburg surprising him had descended on the prep school magically whisking ham off to africa for a weeks safari in those days a safari meant hunting game not photographing it and he would never forget the sight of a male lion its ruff seeming as large as a masai war shield bounding out of the brush at dusk directly into thornburgs face he had stood rooted to the spot as had the native bearers there had been no time for even the guide to react thornburg had stood his ground raised his rifle to his hip and had let off a string of six rapidfire shots though the first couple hit it the lion kept on and thornburg kept coolly firing he could still hear the crash of the huge lion as the last of the rigby bullets from his fathers mauser paddlebolt rifle flung it sideways into the brush the odour of it was rank pungent biting it saturated the air until it was the only smell and ham could see his fathers nostrils dilate as he filled himself with that bitter scent standing over the carcass moments later thornburg had said to his son what a great pity this beast deserves more of my respect than your mother does when he left ham thornburg went belowdecks to his stateroom closed the door for a long moment he leaned against it eyes closed heart palpitating painfully then he gathered himself went to the rear bulkhead panelled in teak pressed a hidden button two panels slid open to reveal a communications complex separate from the schooners main communications centre in the captains cabin below this was a teakfaced drawer with a steel combination lock thornburg opened it removed a disposable syringe the point of which he pressed into a phial of clear fluid he inverted the syringe squirted a few drops to get rid of any air then rolling up his trouser leg and finding a vein in his thigh plunged the needle in thornburg repaired to the bed sat rocking rhythmically to the slowed beat of his heart for a long time his mind was emptied of all thought and emotion then slowly they seeped back and he was himself again his first thought was of wolf matheson and the electrifying news he had provided to shipley something had happened to moravia the ageing process had been reversed it was so ironic that moravia had been killed when he had and so unfair of course thornburg had planned to have him killed just after the meeting that he never made how else would he get matheson involved without revealing himself but the enemy had somehow penetrated moravia and had taken him out prematurely had they managed to get anything out of him before they killed him thornburg thought not there was no sign that moravia had been tortured instead he had been altered and this was the oracles doing of that thornburg had no doubt but the situation was so maddening like being close to some alien artefact and yet not being able to understand its purpose he needed to know more nishitsu and the black blade society were desperate to get their hands on the oracle why again he did not know was only certain that it was the last key they needed to attain their goal just as he was certain he must take possession of the oracle before the toshin kuro kosai did that was why it was imperative that matheson be given full rein if anyone could gain access to the oracle it was wolf matheson he turned to a small safe opened it inside were some papers he sorted through he extracted a snapshot taken by an amateur he held that up next to the surveillance photo one of breathards men had taken of the japanese woman who called herself an artist true the woman in the snapshot was younger perhaps no more than a girl but there could be no doubt that the photos were of the same woman thornburg felt his heart race in quick elation matheson was already scenting his way in and just as quickly damped it had all been going so well so smoothly he thought then moravia was murdered moravia was part of the plan that he and ham had devised sure but moravia was also reporting directly to thornburg on this one matter the oracle and thornburg had no illusions moravia had been killed because of what he found out at his last visit to forbidden dreams not his intelligence on the toshin kuro kosai postings but revelations about the oracle he had sent thornburg a private fax coded before they got to him have encountered oracle face to face debriefing imperative whatever moravia had discovered was of such importance that he had requested a personal meeting with thornburg strictly against the rules that the elder conrad had set up for their sub rosa relationship what was yuji shian up to thornburg had to find out because the oracle was yuji shians project shian was much more than the head of japans leading multiindustrial conglomerate he was also a brilliant scientist a technocrat of the first rank thornburg had contacts inside miti an extension of his oldboy network in washington men he had known and had worked with for decades men who owed him favours from the old days of the american occupation men he had saved from the war tribunals and from what these contacts had gathered yuji shian was at work on a project so farreaching it could literally ensure japans future in a world where economic dominance was paramount that moravia had actually encountered the oracle was mindboggling previously thornburg had believed shian to be years away from project completion have encountered oracle just before he was killed moravia had provided him with two vital facts the oracle was as went the rumours passed on to thornburg some new form of artificial intelligence and it was alive and running now he knew of one sector of its power it could make the old young again late at night the lamps were lit the oil burner humming in the basement like a gigantic beast wolf had just come from the shower and naked to the waist was towelling his hair dry when stevie came into the room to see how he was she had been quiet after dinner and there had been little communication between them wolf feeling once again suspended between the memories of elk basin and chikas east sixth street apartment knew he had disconnected himself from the time line that as his grandfather would have said he was soaring stevie stood in the open doorway lit from behind like a bronze statue these same living room lamps illuminated the fetishes in small groups bright bits of primitive colour and power filling the background she had on the jeans she had worn at dinner but had changed into a shortsleeve sweater with a deeplyscooped neck about amanda he threw the towel aside stevie this isnt a confessional you dont have to do this she shook her head began to blink rapidly and he knew she was holding back tears there was she was so overcome with emotion that she had to begin all over again the emotional strain of being a buffer between morton and amanda was very difficult they despised each other it was a nightmare planning any kind of function and when we all had to be together they both made my life hell bitching and complaining to me about the other she twisted her braid around and around her forefinger what was i to do it took all i had to keep things on an even keel but i might have perhaps during those times i was often short with amanda she abruptly wrapped her arms around her slender waist im sick to my stomach she whispered her face was white wolf sat her down on the bed pushed her head between her legs breathe he ordered slowly and deeply thats right he watched as slowly the colour returned to her face he searched her dark eyes her sensual lips and thought of the small peach orchard behind his house in elk basin he had tended as a boy she smiled put a hand to his cheek my god you look so young she said into the silence like a football hero or an olympic athlete a person who for a moment looks as if he has stepped out of time amanda used to tell me how young i looked amanda was obsessed by age she always was stevies eyes glittered in the halflight her long french braid lay sensuously across her shoulder and being with you only made matters worse she swore to me you never aged he gave a little laugh but it was cut short when she took his hand and put it between her breasts my heart is beating so fast her voluptuous lips looked inviting she put her head down for a moment you see i was taught not to confide in men that men with their roving eyes were only interested in one thing but what happens when a women is interested in that one thing she did not move and he did not take his hand from where she had placed it she opened her lips sleep well wolf he pulled her to him his lips coming down over hers feeling her tongue snake into his mouth exploring hotly her heavy breasts pressed against him and she moaned into him as he pushed up her sweater undressed her until she was naked from the waist up there was no time for anything now except for the rushing of the blood the rising tide of lust that had been growing between them ever since they arrived here wolf unbuttoned her jeans pushed down his undershorts she gasped as he backed her against the roughhewn wood wall of the bedroom pushed her arms over her head while he kissed her lips cheeks eyes ears and throat her hips were already jerking upwards against his when he impaled her and she gasped again deeper longer ending in an ecstatic groan he thrust hard upwards all the way into her and her bare feet left the floor one long leg twining over his hip her eyes closed her mouth open responding in kind to his rhythmic grunts of pleasure stevie felt a rush through her body she could smell him the scented soap she had placed in the guest bathroom the tickling dry talcum but oh yes beneath that like a living thing his smell deep and rich and erotic rising so that she began to feel its presence enveloping her it built the pleasure so quickly in her that she shuddered her hips spasming hard against him her head falling onto his shoulder her teeth taking an involuntary bite into the meat of his muscle all this multiplying her ecstasy tenfold but amazingly it did not stop there in a moment she realized dimly that her pleasure was merely a plateau from which she was climbing higher shivering and gasping as if she would never come down his head lowered like a bulls and he gathered one large nipple then the other into his mouth so that sharp bolts of ecstasy leapt through her like a fire and with a deepfelt cry she was spasming again unable to control herself clinging to him lovingly desperately adoringly while her eyelids flickered as if she were dreaming she could no longer breathe was no longer aware of her surroundings filled with a delight so intense it made her vertiginous she felt only his organ inside her his hot body pressed against hers his lips on her flesh his muscles between her teeth if this were all she felt it would have been more than she could have wished for but she felt more she felt dancing through her a mysterious darkness from the core of him something alive and powerful that pierced her mind her soul as his organ was piercing her body not in pain but in pleasure she reached blindly down cupping him squeezing rhythmically until he arched up one last time dragging her deliciously with him uttering a sound she had never heard before and as she spasmed uncontrollably a third time she knew she was drowning in bliss shian kogaku we are always with you mouthed david bowies painted slightly androgynous face the mobile thirteenfoot by tenfoot video screen rumbled slowly through the trafficchoked streets of the shinjuku section of tokyo its sixminute music video cleverly displaying all the beneficial products manufactured by shian kogakus various kobun repeating on an endless loop yuji shian and hiroto his brotherinlaw had met on their way to work hiroto was altogether nondescript a bentshouldered middleaged man neither handsome nor ugly in the same cheap rumpled suit he had been wearing for the past three days he was a vicepresident of shian kogaku and a brilliant computer scientist in his own right how is my sister yuji asked as they entered the fortystorey white granite and steel building owned by shian kogaku kazuki is the same always angry hiroto said sadly its the illness that is eating her from the inside she is no longer the same person i married fifteen years ago yuji felt the coruscating colours unnaturally bright then the quick shift in perspective he could see with uncanny clarity the circuitry of a project he was working on how it should be from beginning to end the whole schematic laid out before him like topography viewed from the air then the vision faded the colours around him regained their normal intensity he put his hand against the polished granite wall of the elevator bank he had never cared for his gift of sight how ill its onset had made him when he had been a teenager and he still dreaded the disorientation that always accompanied it yujisan yes he blinked saw hiroto already in the elevator turned to face him eyes curious searching he walked on stiff legs into the elevator the beaten bronze doors closed and they were alone on their way up i need to talk to you about the oracle hiroto said specifically your notion to allow your halfsister hana access to it hana is difficult to ignore youre telling me she has been making my research team crazy with her questions about the guts of the thing theres a rumour going around that you brought her in to make modifications in the project not for the first time yuji found himself wondering whether hiroto resented hana because she was a female or because she was not a highlytrained scientist with multiple degrees from tokyo university hiroto like most of his ilk was snobbish in the extreme where you graduated from was often a more telling criterion than how your mind worked if you wanted to be on his research team its nothing yuji lied you were concerned when my mother was making suggestions thats right and i still dont like the path she suggested we take using human dna inside the thing who knows how its circuits will distort the basic molecules the changes the concept of the oracle is so new yuji said we must be open to change he knew how to handle his brotherinlaw so conservative in every way including his work he was often a good counterweight to yujis unfettered genius but occasionally as now he could prove difficult lets allow the oracle to think its way through the dna and see what happens it will make certain basic decisions hiroto corrected no one yet knows whether that is the same as thinking oh but i do yuji thought as they came to a stop the doors opened and they emerged onto the highest of the three executive floors i still have grave misgivings about the project hiroto said following yuji down the hall through several office anterooms into yujis office proper i argued against prematurely using a human subjectin tandem with the oracle but i was overruled he shook his head i must confess i am dismayed by how fast we are plunging into the unknown frankly i find myself increasingly frightened by your friend the oracle frightened hiroto nodded the oracle was not built to change but that is precisely what it seems to be doing the question i must ask myself is is there an essential design flaw in the oracle that we were not aware of or and here yujisan is why i am fearful has the oracle somehow altered the basic schematic we gave it with an effort yuji kept his face calm you understand what i mean yujisan there is already some evidence that it is growing that in some sense we may not yet be able to comprehend it is alive hiroto strode back and forth before yujis desk the scientist side of me insists that this is impossible or more accurately beyond our current technology but the intuitive side of me suspects otherwise that because of the radical technology you gave us for its neurologies and because now we are no longer dealing solely with mathematics with digital technology with the zero and the one we have bred the chaos of an anomaly our imaging technology is so new we know virtually nothing about its ultimate capabilities which leads me to believe that while we built the oracle we no longer understand it that perhaps we never did it is wholly outside our ken that as we currently view the world it can neither be controlled nor understood and now to add hanas strange mind to this already unknowable mix is in my opinion suicidal after all when you come down to it we know less about her brain than we do about the oracle itself yuji was thinking of his conversations with the oracle of course he felt differently about the oracle than hiroto did but perhaps that was in part because hiroto had built the biocomputer it had been yujis idea his creation but it was hiroto and his team who had fabricated the reality from the godstuff of yujis thoughts yuji might be a brilliant biogeneticist but it was hiroto who was the nuts and bolts engineer i would never dare say this to hiroto yuji thought but because i know that we have together created something more than a mere machine i have a rapport with the oracle that he will never possess to hiroto the thing is just a monstrously complex tinker toy nothing more than a research project further he designed it to accomplish certain functions now that it is doing other things and doing them in ways that completely mystify him hiroto has become edgy understandable he has lost face it is almost as if the oracle is running him not the other way around that was an amusing thought yet yuji did not laugh i understand your concern yuji said comfortingly the same thoughts have crossed my mind as well he came around his desk let me reassure you hirotosan we will proceed with all due caution but proceed we must youre right about one thing the project has taken on a life of its own and if we stop it now we would be nothing more than murderers seven tokyo east hampton washington new york night in the suburbs of tokyo minako shian lay in bed waiting as always for a sleep that often did not come her mind busily scheming would not let her rest she had been living on a high wire ever since her breasts had begun to bud and her menses had begun to flow this was her karma and she was willing to accept her role in the history of her people but there were so many strands to hold in her hands so many skeins to manipulate simultaneously this was the ecstasy and the horror of her advanced powers minako lived in a villa outside tokyo designed for her by one of japans leading young architects in its soaring spaces and sharp juxtapositions of dark and light spans its use of weighty materials such as stone with floating ones such as rice paper and the astonishing vistas afforded in the areolae between rooms the building seemed to be a series of scenes that like a film created a montage a whole that was far more than each individual section the villa was set within a cleverly structured garden that in its utter starkness and simplicity neatly counterbalanced the intricate almost baroque postmodernism of the architecture however postmodernism was perhaps too harsh a definition for the villa for the architects style contained within it hints of buddhism shintoism and edoperiod architecture which placed the villa in an historical context so that each space continually tugged at the viewers memories the granite and lacewood entry dominated by an old merchants chest where shoes were stored was one of many spaces which served to connect the visitor from the outside world with the inner heart of the villa like the concentric circles of the emperors palace in tokyo these rooms revealed the nature of the architecture a fragment at a time to allow for the interaction of structure and human mind in so doing echoes were set reverberating that like scents provoked powerful and unique reactions that varied with each individual these rooms were like an array of cabins upon a vast ship outside the darkling garden took on the appearance of the ocean mysterious and dangerous glittering just beyond reach just like the future which for the first time seemed tantalizingly beyond her sight not so the past and for the moment she contented herself with remembering the summoning of her makura na hiruma had occurred on the anniversary of the death of her grandmother the homely compact woman who had founded shian kogaku as the premier manufacturer of tabi these were traditional japanese socks with a single separation between the big toe and the other four kabuto minakos grandmother had played a large role in minakos long and agonizing birth minako had been told the story by her mother and so the debt must be paid it happened that kabuto had died on minakos birthday and so minakos memories of this day were always cast in the shadow of her grandmothers grave an austere site in a shinto cemetery outside osaka when she was a small child her mother took her but as soon as she was old enough to find her own way she was encouraged to attend to her filial duties in private on her eleventh birthday she arrived at kabutos grave it had been raining all night and the shinto cemetery was shrouded in a mist thick with the brittle scents of medicinal herbs which grew wild in spiky clumps between the plots by this time kabuto had been dead for precisely eight years and minakos memory of her was as indistinct as the nearby grave markers shrouded in mist she went through the shinto rituals by rote her mind disengaged her thoughts elsewhere when she was finished she rose brushed the mat of dead leaves and grasses off her knees and turned to go something stopped her and she turned slowly back to the grave and there sitting curled atop the marker was a red fox hello granddaughter the fox said opening its mouth as if in a yawn do you not recognize me it is i kabuto minako started shook her head pinched herself rubbed her eyes she looked again her grandmother or the fox was still there the fox smiled at minako minako looked wildly around to see if anyone else saw the apparition but she was alone in this particular part of the cemetery grandmother minako finally whispered you are a fox so i am kabuto responded at this moment minako gaped could you be kabuto again but i am kabuto child i mean the kabuto i knew that shrewish body the fox seemed to sneer why would i want that back i waited almost three hundred years to get rid of it thats far too long as it is dont you agree minako did not know what to say so she merely nodded the fox that was her grandmother jumped down from its perch sat in front of her scratching its nose with a delicate forepaw anyway foxes are incapable of lying you see kabuto said i suppose thats why i chose this form i was sick of lying deceit obfuscation the fox canted its head thats why ive come today to warn you yes i suppose warn is the correct term warn me of what of what your life will become unless you are less ambitious than i was i want to save you from going to your deathbed with your spirit withered from decades of lying deceit and obfuscation i dont do any of those things minako had told her grandmother but you will because that is the way of the world the fox said our world i dont understand of course you do you foolish girl her grandmother snapped it is only that conventions have kept your overmind from engaging my overmind the fox then made a sound that caused minako to start it was the same sound her grandmother used to make by striking her tongue against the roof of her mouth when she was impatient with slowwitted responses to her queries at that moment minako was certain that the fox was indeed her grandmother your mother i see has been remiss in teaching you the covenants of power well i cant say im surprised she was always too timid for her own good afraid of me and of her own gift the fox lifted the same forepaw it had used to scratch its nose never mind i knew the rite of the summoning would be left to me the moment i squeezed you out of your mothers womb the foxs eyes were bright even in the dull leaden sunlight filtering through the heavy mist you didnt want to come you know and your mother lacked the stamina and the fortitude to coerce you into coming and afterwards it occurred to her that having you had been a mistake good thing i was around minako had screwed up her face you mean mother didnt want me she doesnt love me has she ever held you kissed you even taken you in her arms no of course not if it werent for me i have no doubt she would have deposited you on a neighbours doorstep minakos heart had constricted and she had burst out crying why are you telling me this grandmother its too terrible i dont want to hear any more it was time for you to hear the truth child the fox licked its lips now i want you to look at me no dont blink or youre cheating thinking about how i am talking through the fox take hold of the pain you are feeling it burns doesnt it yes keep looking at me minakosan now let the pain flow through you and when you feel something else something more minako wiped the tears from her eyes theres a darkness i dont look down the fox snapped dont look anywhere but at me thats better the pain is fading isnt it it is being replaced by the darkness dont worry in a moment you will be able to see everything and to minakos astonishment her grandmother was right not only could she see the darkness curling and undulating at her feet but as it spread outwards she could see through the mist as clearly as if it did not exist the surrounding graves then the outlying reaches of the cemetery and beyond to the rolling hills miles and miles away what what is happening to me you are coming of age the fox said with a smile though how a fox could smile minako could not imagine you now see that the world as you had perceived it is not the end but the beginning a mere isthmus in the vast sea of worlds open to your budding perceptions how far will i be able to see minako asked peering into the distance that depends the fox said in everyone with makura na hiruma the darkness at noon it is different but i know more than most and what i know is that your power is enormous in a few years it will eclipse even mine which was strong indeed that is as it should be since your destiny is special even among us you will soon be thrust into the maelstrom of an internecine war between factions of the toshin kuro kosai we are riddled by suspicion who within the black blade society believes in the old ways the old destiny for japan who has secretly made a pact to see japan adapt to events in the modern world people within our ranks die suddenly mysteriously or disappear never to be heard from again what has happened to them who has murdered the ones whose bodies we find we are turning on each other like mad dogs even i do not know the wars outcome no one does but it must end before one of us takes it into his head to move our power more fully into the world at large heretofore we have used our power only to indirectly influence events but it now appears likely that the time is coming when one of us will not be satisfied to sit in the shadows and pull the strings the world will not long survive once we begin to move out into the light and use makura na hiruma in a more direct fashion can you imagine an emperor a prime minister or a president with the power she shuddered you must guard against that eventuality child remember that contrary to popular belief there is such a thing as having too much power history has shown us that moral corruption begins at the highest level and slowly seeps downwards the temptation to run amok would be overwhelming even for us who are more than mortal it is axiomatic that the more in control we believe we are the less of it we actually possess be careful child and be diligent i have seen that through you will rise the one child the individual destined to end this war because of this you will develop enemies powerful enemies who will do their best to destroy you by any means you are frightening me grandmother good fear is the best goad to caution guile and obfuscation keep to the shadows child until it is your time how will i know the one child grandmother i dont know that is a future even we cannot see or guess at at your birth i was given a hint of your fate but it was not until now at the summoning when i can see the nature of your overmind that i know the one child will come through you minako spread her arms luxuriating in the feel of the darkness rolling over her like the coils of a gigantic serpent the power of life infused her with its heady scent and such power she thought to give birth to the one child she centred her thoughts in her lower belly she was still very young but the glorious new sensation of her makura na hiruma made it possible to imagine what it must be like to carry another life inside her the fox seemed to grow in size contrary to what you may think now the scope of your power will be a burden soon enough the barriers of time will no longer exist for you then the future will make itself manifest how wonderful minako had cried clapping her hands foolish foolish girl the fox said sternly seeing the future is a terrible fate indeed take it from one who knows think of what it must be like to be able to read peoples minds you think it might be fun isnt that so to know what people around you are going to do before they do it you think what an advantage perhaps so but then think of the sheer cacophony of voices you must hear day in day out without surcease how long could you bear such an intolerable strain the fox circled minako dragging its hindpaws as if drawing a figure in the earth it is the same with seeing the future the weight of events multiplies exponentially until it becomes too much to sustain some of us go mad and others minako asked there must be a way out the fox smiled that impossible smile again and minako knew her grandmother was pleased with her yes the fox said there are two ways out one is to use the path your mother the dullwitted beast has chosen close yourself off from makura na hiruma the other involves a lifetime of lies deceit and obfuscation these are my only choices the fox nodded yes i want to see minako said as far as i can kabuto licked her fur contentedly then you are destined for great things child she lifted her great triangular head fixed her granddaughter with her obsidian eyes terrible things as well because even with the strength of your power there will be blank spots futures you will be unable to see perhaps other terrifying futures you will see but which you may be unable to prevent never mind you cannot understand these things now and having chosen you can no longer deviate from the path once makura na hiruma has been invoked it can never be returned to the prison in which it has been held i understand grandmother minako said gravely for the first time there was a note of surprise in her voice why child i believe you do how many days in her already long life had she regretted her decision that morning in the cemetery not as many as the number of days she had revelled in her power and how often had she suspected her grandmother of tricking her into invoking her own makura na hiruma for the first time but strangely that had only made her cherish kabuto even more minako lay in the dark listening to the soft stirring outside of the trees and the nocturnal creatures her mind drifted again she saw yuji and for the first time since he was a small boy and she had made her decision to keep him separate from the toshin kuro kosai she feared for him then she felt his mind and that of the oracle and was reassured for just a moment she allowed herself to feel the elation attendant to its creation true it was still imperfect its potential still partially unknown even to her but she trusted her children yuji and hana to solve the last remaining hurdle that would make the beast fully operational and why not feel elation in a sense though yuji and hiroto had built it from the ground up it had been she who had convinced yuji of the need for it cajoled him into working on it urged him on when setbacks threatened to end the project and now that it was up and running what would happen abruptly minako sat up in bed holding her stomach for a moment she was afraid she would vomit up dinner sudden irrational fear gripped her the future was closed to her and she had been warned her sight saw futures not all of them became the future that would occur but this blankness the cessation of her sight disturbed her could this be the one miscalculation that could spell doom for them all it seemed to her now that there was always so much weight upon her shoulders but ever since she had made the conscious decision to rebel against the wretched excesses of power dreamed up by the reverend mother she truly lived every day on a knifeedge each day it seemed that the reverend mother devised new atrocities to perpetrate she was no longer satisfied to root out those who opposed her rule but was intent on finding new ways to increase her already prodigious makura na hiruma it seemed clear enough to minako who had already lived long enough to understand these things that the reverend mothers makura na hiruma had driven her over the edge she was quite mad and it had become minakos duty to stop her any way she could for that she required a weapon of such potency that the reverend mother would be incinerated whether or not she had time to invoke the awesome power of her makura na hiruma the revelation had come to her two years ago in a blinding flash of light that had sent her to her knees and had caused her to wonder whether its origin might be divine that was when she had thought of the man without a face wolf matheson the day had already turned murky and thick lit now and then by lurid flashes of lightning that broke against the tops of the thick hemlocks a moment later it began to rain fat drops that splattered against the walkways and windowpanes with the noise of hail it was saturday and stevie having received a call from her husband had left just after dawn to drive into the city to take care of some of his business she had promised she would be back for dinner wolf had thought he would sleep most of the day but he was already restless anxious to return to his office and the investigation that had dire global implications he rummaged around in the hall closet found a slicker belonging no doubt to morton the absent philanderer and went down to georgica pond in this weather it was possible to look out across the water and not see any other house far out he saw a wooden pole on which he could just make out the straw of an ospreys nest a handsome avian form dark with rain approached it the adult osprey carefully deposited a beakful of twigs onto the nest then set about repairing winters damage wolf hunkered down beneath a pepperidge tree stared sightlessly at the grey water what would he do when he found chika in truth he did not know and he was aware that part of him did not want to track her down what if she were responsible for the murders arquillo junior ruiz moravia and amanda far simpler if he knew conclusively that suma was responsible for the deaths but he could not be certain of that and in fact he had evidence though circumstantial that pointed to chika the square of her trapunto singed but not blackened he had discovered in the glove compartment of the black firebird was damning on the other hand it could also be a plant or was that wishful thinking anything was possible and it was always dangerous to jump to conclusions wolf had become used to dealing with grey areas which police work most often was but this situation was different it had been made that way by chika or more accurately his feelings about her his attraction was like a pulse a living thing existing deep inside him separate and undeniable but it was better to think of his attraction to a murder suspect a possible member of the enemy the black blade society than to dwell for too long on the implications of the fire that had exploded within arquillo turning his face to burning jelly he was out there a long time absorbing the sights sounds smells of the earth pepperidge trees terns and water until his fingertips were blue and he felt a pain in his sewnup leg he sighed then rose and reluctantly turned back to the house when he heard the car pulling into the driveway he went on stiff legs to the front window to peer out it was near dark by then and the house lights had automatically come on he leaned over flicked on the outside lights circles of illumination broke through the thick gloom along the cracked blacktop driveway the mossy flagstone path to the front door the converted nineteenthcentury brass coach lamps on either side of the door he was expecting stevies jeep cherokee but instead he saw a shiny new black corvette coasting to a stop in the parking area in front of the garage he saw someone emerge from the corvette a woman wolf went to the front door opened it to the whisper of a night wind its chill mitigated by springs ascension he went out on the concrete stoop let the screen door bang shut behind him the rain had passed but the intolerable wetness still clung to everything moths fluttered in the lamplight and a sprinkling of first magnitude stars was just becoming visible above the black treetops as wolf followed the womans progress up the worn path he experienced a sense of dйjа vu so acute he felt momentarily dizzy he saw a face dominated by enormous eyes of a glossy chocolate over high cheekbones a poutylipped sensual mouth and a small but solid chin her thick hair was worn straight back from her wide forehead hanging heavily like a plume or a mane at the nape of her neck she wore a very short black wool shirt over black stretch pants that showed her legs to maximum advantage a pumpkincoloured chenille sweater that draped over her strong shoulders and breasts magnificent light dazzled from enormous black opal earrings black ankle boots enclosed her small feet and she still had on thin blackandwhite leather racing gloves she walked with a sureness that was almost aggressive and at last dream fantasy and reality met in a terrifying swirl of emotion dismay stupefaction guilt and desire swept him up in an intolerable chaos for coming up the steps was a small exquisite japanese woman who he knew to be sumas associate the photographer marksman and perhaps murderer of four people the artist chika what i like best about clubs thornburg conrad iii said is that you can control who comes in and who goes out he grunted as he lit a cigar time was when the whole world was like that but that was a lifetime ago and i suppose i ought to curb these feelings i have that it was a far better world back then poppycock really cynosure of the ancient and abouttobedeleted he puffed aggressively im up on every advance in the fields of medical electronic computer and biotechnological research just so you dont think im slipping into the twilight world of the elderly the thought never crossed my mind stevie powers said thornburgs lips curled up in his signature chilly smile lady you sure know how to dress thank you she said stevie crossed one stockinged leg over the other shifted in her chair when she had left wolf she had not driven into the city but only ten minutes west to east hampton airport where thornburgs private jet was waiting for her thornburg watched the end of his cigar glow cherry red with his inhalation especially since i sent for you without any advance warning its been my experience that women who know how to dress well and quickly are to be treasured he raised his gaze just in time to see the hint of a smile register on stevies face no doubt you disagree with me there isnt a woman on earth worth her salt who would agree he laughed but it was impossible to tell whether he had made a joke or was merely gloating at his superior position in the world magnolia terrace the club that thornburg had invited stevie to was not strictly speaking in washington but rather in the virginia countryside it was known for its magnificent golf course where in the past more than one major pga tournament had been played but it was also worldrenowned for its riding academy which turned out some of the finest american polo players in the world of course the club was restricted which meant that people with money but no lineage could not become members no matter how much influence they possessed thornburg and stevie were lunching on the wide screened veranda of the clubhouse a sprawling thirtythousandsquarefoot building of traditional clapboard siding fourteen gables distinguished it from all the neighbouring mansions inside the rooms were spacious and airy oil portraits of the countrys founding fathers hung on the walls of virtually every room often at night orchestras occupied the vast flagstone patio beyond the veranda for the numerous blacktie dinnerdances magnolia terrace put on for charity the mammoth clubhouse was just one of seventeen buildings on the acres the club owned there were stables paddocks sumptuous guest cottages owned by a clique of the most senior members riding ovals polo fields and of course the famed golf course but then again i like it when people disagree with me thornburg went on nothing better than a verbal battle to sharpen up the old grey cells he rolled his cigar along the edge of a clamshell expertly ridding it of just the right amount of ash did you enjoy lunch good those ipswich clams were right off the boat theyre flown down here every morning in our own plane he broke off to greet senator dowd head of the armed services oversight committee dowd was an old friend of his as were almost all of the senior members of congress when the senator had drifted away thornburg said to stevie i imagine youre wondering when were going to get around to the pith im used to you just so your psychiatric training no doubt analytic training yes yes youve told me thats how you people refer to it he waved away her words as if they were a bothering gnat patience damn fine virtue if you ask me learning to ford the stream at the right moment thornburg shook his head ive tried to teach my boys that lesson but i fear theyve each learned it somewhat imperfectly he grunted i used to believe my first wife was the bane of my existence but lately i find myself of the opinion that stigma must be borne by my offspring he leaned back in his leather chair except for my son ham who has turned out to be one fine specimen hero in nam firstclass brain and the damned good sense to be loyal to family father couldnt ask for much more from his son im happy to learn that you have such positive feelings about even one of your children i wonder if youve told him any of this certainly not thornburg rolled off the ash of his cigar bad for the character praise even if its deserved he could sense her bringing out her notebook sharpening her pencil he liked her because she was almost too smart for her own good but he did not want her turning her intelligence on him he sat forward suddenly and she tensed lets get down to business shall we i want your report on wolf mathesons emotional state stevie recrossed her legs said i want to be absolutely clear why im doing this thornburg stared at the end of his cigar im glad to know youre being so prudent his eyes flicked to stevies he blew out a cloud of fragrant smoke its more than prudence she said im concerned youve asked me to invade another mans privacy i wont i cant do that easily or without sufficient cause i understand ive been vague with you up until now that was deliberate for your own good as well as to comply with the dictates of national security he drew on his cigar blew out the smoke lawrence moravia was a spy working for the us government stevie he was following up on a lead they had that someone was passing proprietary american industrial intelligence to the japanese and not just the japanese but this very dangerous organization ive told you about the black blade society he made a disagreeable sound in the back of his throat all right now that youve pried that confession out of me i hope youre satisfied im certainly more at ease stevie said but i still find one thing curious if you have such high personal regard for wolf why not approach him yourself why use me as an intermediary thats simple enough its the most basic tradecraft my dear matheson is what we would call a cutout hes deliberately shielded from me and vice versa for security reasons he saw the look on her face put in a more elementary way if he should be captured he will have no information that could lead the black blade society back to me stevie digested this sobering news for some time and thornburg worried that he had given her more than she could handle he did not want her getting cold feet at this stage towards that end he said stevie let me reassure you that the job we have given matheson is something he wants very badly to do i know she said thornburg put his lips around the cigar now that you do id appreciate your report i need him for this investigation stevie i cant afford to lose him now she relaxed in her chair as she settled into her role as analyst a word of caution what i do is not an exact science thornburg nodded indulgently what is even science has proven to be inexact proceed his fall seems not to have injured his psyche at all stevie began if anything he appears stronger to me more resolved than he did before and physically the fall through the skylight could have been boneshattering he was exceedingly fortunate the wounds he received were deep enough but through your efforts weve been assured that there is no nerve damage as for the healing process he exhibits a remarkable ability to recover ten days after the operation he seems to have little or no residual impairment thornburg looked at the glowing end of his cigar can i assume youve taken him through all his physical paces stevie sat still for a long moment beyond the screens she could see a handsome blueeyed blond leading a horse across a golf cart track she dropped her gaze to her hands he walks bends lifts seemingly without pain if he feels discomfort he has not told me his powers of recovery are astonishing thornburg grunted he lit a match got his cigar going again in no time flat your husbands something of a genius which is why ive gotten him work all over washington but his brilliance hasnt stopped him from being a shit has it the world is a shitty place stevie said i try my best to make it a little bit less shitty and if i helped only one person id feel a measure of satisfaction its the same with matheson thornburg let out a soft hiss of smoke while eyeing her you believe me dont you you dont think ive roped you into some dirty business spying on a cop i didnt care for that reference he nodded i profoundly apologize i had no intention of offending you now he knew he had gone too far but it was essential that he get a sense of her own current emotional state its only that i know how attractive matheson is how much youve enjoyed taking care of him how little you see of morton the most dangerous aspect of wolf matheson was how he engendered loyalty in others being emotionally involved with him would make things awkward for you to say the least he will be going overseas soon and he may have a companion a female companion it would not do for you to interfere in any way stevie stared at him but said nothing as i have said i have only the greatest respect for matheson which is why i want him in the fray but its your fray isnt it stevie said she was sharp yes but i can guarantee you hes better off in this situation than the one hes leaving behind i give you my word in the long run youll be helping him im not in the business of secondguessing friends i assure you stevie said smiling she leaned over squeezed his hand i know how much youve helped me and morton im grateful for that help i like you stevie really i do thornburg said and thats a good deal more than i can say about most people including my children youre smart and you care about people those are gifts to cherish in this modern world the same can be said for ham and though i ride him a bit its for his own good im grateful for him we understand one another then sure we do thornburg said he took a puff on his cigar and almost choked ive got to laugh he thought the president thinks ham is working for him those ossified generals in the pentagon think hams working for them but hes not hes working for me but then in a sense theyre all working for me and that includes this pedigreed shrink who thinks shes got everyones number im smarter than all of em put together and that includes wolf matheson you look like im going to eat you alive said the woman wolf knew as chika bonewhite moths fluttered about her head and silver light from the moon fell across one cheek the redgreenblue fire from the opal earrings spattered like rain on his doorstep wolf said nothing translucent images of sex and death rudely intruded as he watched her until it seemed as if like a goddess she existed within a kind of aureole he saw her crossing the gutter in the rain climbing into the back of the hearse standing spreadlegged in the cold detritusstrewn street of alphabet city staring down a couple of armed punks standing spreadlegged in the heated atmosphere of her own apartment her fingers busy between her thighs and he saw amanda dead in a pool of her own blood while a tape in a cassette recorder beside her head replayed her own words back at him the sound of his pulse rushed like a hurricane in his inner ears he was aware of the wetness of his palms at last he managed to say ive walked around your disturbing sculptures seen your even more disturbing photographs of women in bondage ive watched you pull a gun on street punks climb into a hearse in the middle of the night i think i have the right to be wary i have a permit for the gun ive no doubt you do you seemed quite professional with it she licked her lips may i come in im not carrying she held out her arms do you want to frisk me yes he did but he did not make a move his hammering heart seemed to be threatening to choke him how did you find me why did you want to he wondered why she hadnt said to him why were you following me but perhaps she already knew with an inward shock wolf realized that she terrified him or perhaps what he feared was his sense of how powerfully this dangerous woman drew him i want you to know the truth about me we have more in common than you know there was a ringing in wolfs ears he felt a thick trickle of sweat begin a long lazy journey down his spine you havent told me how you found me its not something i can tell you in a sentence she said wont you give me a chance to explain or have you tried and convicted me already come in he said at last it was impossible not to watch her buttocks as she walked ahead of him into stevies house she sat on one end of a chintz floral sofa while wolf took the chair opposite he stared at her could not help himself felt more and more helpless as he sat magnetized galvanized by her his mouth was dry and he could feel a pulse ticking in his temple do you think i could get a cup of tea she said between the major construction in the city and the traffic on the lie ive been on the road a long time they went into the kitchen and wolf put up some water he searched the cupboards for tea will earl grey do earl grey will be fine she said standing he watched her sip her tea dark and strong as liquid brass absorbed in the ritual of it tell me about suma he said who you know the waterspider suma is toshin kuro kosai black blade society i dont expect you to know who they moravia and the black blade society youre the link between the two she looked up he had her attention now why would you think that because he said as he leaned forward put his hands on the back of a chair ive seen a photo of you and suma chatting together as you crossed a street in tokyo i havent seen suma in seven months wrong that photo was taken in the fall of last year not more than five months ago she turned her back on him stared out the kitchen window into the blackness of the restless hemlocks i see ive handled this all wrong so far i dont see anything here i can trust she turned back stared at him no i see that you cant youre too busy preparing yourself to crucify me they stood across the kitchen from one another the innocent table between them its difficult to lay aside the evidence i have purely on the basis of you lying to me he said you think im kidding heres what i know and how it adds up to you being a multiple murderer i know moravia was employed to infiltrate your black blade society not my black blade society i know that suma is one of the societys premier assassins and that hes been spotted here ive seen you and suma chatting as easily as a photo you saw a surveillance photo you didnt as easily as two killers talking over old times ive found a piece of your trapunto in a burned out firebird that was used as the getaway vehicle in a multiple homicide where one of my men was killed and another man i was pursuing had his face turned to bloody jelly this is what i know about you is it chika did not even blink no no theres more why leave it out dont you want to tell me how you came in through my studio window an ice storm seemed to be churning his stomach to pulp you knew she put her hand between her thighs yes then for christs sake why did you put on that show she came around the table stood so close to him he inhaled the scent of her remembered from moravias secret cubicle her apartment i did it she said very deliberately because it was what you wanted me to do i was there to try to uncover your connection with suma and not she said taking his hand in hers pressing it against her mons for this no he took his hand away as if she might burn him in the same way arquillo had been burned savaged beyond recognition now whos lying chika said she looked to be no more than twenty but her poise and determination would indicate someone at least a decade older he walked all the way around her now is the time to explain yourself if you are ready to listen when he made no comment she went on first ive been very cleverly set up anyone could have ripped a square of trapunto from one of my sculptures if i had killed your man or even driven the getaway car do you think id be stupid enough to leave a clue like that everyone makes mistakes wolf pointed out even presumably you the ghost of a smile drifted across her face second about that photo its true it must have been taken last fall i had a meeting with suma in october then you are black blade society yes chika said almost fiercely and no either youre in or youre out he said which is it i envy you chika said sitting down your life is so black and white here on one side is what you fight for there on the other is what you must fight against he sat down next to her it isnt like that at all her head came up then why are you so ready to condemn me i am both toshin kuro kosai and not toshin kuro kosai to suma i am to you i am not youre working both sides first you must begin to understand that the toshin kuro kosai is a society of people who have powers beyond the ordinary wolf thought of arquillos face of bobbys description of the blue fireball blooming in the shadows of the barrio alley and the vipers were again uncoiling in his belly for an instant he heard white bows worldsong swell around him then it was gone what kinds of powers wolf asked hoarsely it varies from individual to individual chika said in most lifespans are attenuated and most have a kind of sight perhaps they can see the future or read the emotions in others but this sight is often unreliable the futures seen may not come to pass and at other times the sight does not work at all wolf looked at her feeling chilled through his bones thats not all of it no chika said but theres no point now in tell me she hesitated a moment then nodded in some the sight manifests itself in a more protean way when it is like a shadow a living presence that can be sensed even perhaps seen by some in the corners of their vision and in this highly charged state the power can do many things it can for instance project itself like an unseen fist causing inanimate objects to move it can cause pain and even death in others it can create an absence of air or light can it generate fire the words were squeezed out of him among many other things yes wolf felt a great darkness take hold of him spin him around the vipers in his stomach were loosed at last and it was with a great effort he prevented himself from vomiting the toshin kuro kosai the black blade society see themselves as the traditional guardians of japan chika continued their duty is sacred and their duty as they see it is to make japan the preeminent economy in the world you see their members are part of every level of japanese society and they all work in concert japans economic miracle following world war ii was largely their doing but the socalled economic miracle is only the first step in what the toshin kuro kosai see as japanese total domination of the worlds economy i know most of this chika smiled gradually there emerged from their ranks individuals who did not agree with the toshin kuro kosais vision of the future of japan and they set out to stop them without the black blade society knowing youre painting a picture of a war a war yes she nodded but a very special one because it was being fought underground in the shadows without conventional weapons by people with extraordinary skills what kinds of skills chika said you almost became the latest casualty of this war he took a deep breath that was the night my friend amanda was killed i went after her killer you have it wrong chika said amanda was your girlfriend what better lure to get you to the right place at the right time in the ensuing silence wolf heard the antique ormolu clock on the living room mantel strike the hour the sound was unnaturally loud hanging in the air for what seemed an eternity what are you saying he managed at last to get out i am saying it was you who was meant to die that night amanda had her role to play in it but thats all think about it for a moment everything was premeditated youre wrong i called her that night i did it because i had a nightmare about her in fact it seemed so real it something in her expression caused him to stop when i spoke with her there was something wrong i dont think it was really her im certain it wasnt she said softly it was toshin kuro kosai i was warned they would come after me as they came after moravia wolf said i heard it but maybe i didnt believe it would happen not that way the toshin kuro kosai are cruel it is a way of life with them chika said so is deceit it seems he looked at her trying to feel her with his mind but there was nothing this could all be deceit it could chika acknowledged words are too often lies you know that as well as i do she was so still and so perfect in her stillness i will venture this however what the black blade society fears now is that you and i will combine forces that is why they have gone to extreme lengths to make you distrust me if what youre saying is true then i would have to have been under their surveillance thats right its crazy he said im a trained cop i would have known if i was under surveillance why you werent expecting it rich lamplight seemed to catch fire in her eyes and he could see just how deep their shade of black was remember these people are different very different theyve also tried to kill me wolf pointed out are they also schizophrenic hardly but i dont yet know what it is theyre up to wolf moved around the room abruptly uncomfortable with excess adrenaline he felt a desperate urge to touch the sink refrigerator stove solid objects dense and substantial that would remain immutable even if what she was telling him was true and now im simply meant to trust you is that it she shrugged all i can say for now is that if you discover who i am slowly and on your own you will know its the truth that may be but for right now im afraid i cant afford to trust you then i will have to earn your trust how do you propose to do that i can think of only one way she said ill show you how lawrence moravia was murdered and why the oracle stood or sat knelt or crouched who really knew in the centre of a small laboratory in one securitycoded section of the shian kogaku labs it didnt look like much a sleek matteblack cube with an ovoid front into which was set an opalescent screen to which was affixed by a wire a special light pen in fact on first glance the oracle appeared more like a musical instrument than an advanced scientific experiment from the first yuji believed that hiroto had seriously underestimated their creation he insisted on communicating with the oracle as any scientist would talk to any conventional computer mathematically in the language of ones and zeros he was unimpressed by the speech mode that yuji had installed in the system arguing that by all previous examples speech modes were so unwieldy for the computer brain they slowed down processing to an unacceptable level yuji did not use the advancedstyle screen hiroto had built into the centre of the oracle preferring instead to hold spoken dialogues with it to hirotos amazement the speech mode slowed the oracle down less the more it was used until it was fully as efficient as streaming data through the screen or any of the side ports even so in retrospect yuji could not see how they could have suspected then what monumental internal changes must be occurring within the oracles neurologicwavefront brain yuji faced the black cube and turning it on addressed it oracle just a moment yuji was silent stunned yes what just happened my consciousness was being filled with the thoughts memories feelings of hanasan you must be mistaken yuji said you have no consciousness i think therefore i am yuji stared at the cube he did not know whether to laugh or cry i must be losing my mind he thought or i am dreaming either way this cant be happening he took a deep breath said no matter what may have just occurred one thing i can assure you you cannot have downloaded hanas thoughts feelings her very existence into ram memory are you the sole arbiter of life does the earth spin on your definition the marionette lives because of who manipulates it but who manipulates the manipulator you sound like a zen koan i am a zen koan among many other things i am what you made me but even you do not yet know what that is or what it will become do you certainly not i am not god what can you know of god this concept was not in your programming you are mistaken inside me in the neurologics there are strands of dna filaments of texts that will take many lifetimes to study but i have already begun to decipher them it is there i learned of god you are using the dna filaments to add to your programming is this not what you meant for me to do is it not how the heuristics you gave me function dear god yuji thought i infused the neurologies with my own dna he closed his eyes pressed his hands to his face he felt as cold as if he had sunk into a vat of ice water when he looked up his face was bleak i had thought for you to analyse my dna determine how to replicate the differences you found there it was hardly my intention that you use the dna your dna is now wrapped around my heuristic circuits like sinew around bone i cannot detach it even if i wanted to yuji could feel a vein pulsing slowly in his temple i dont understand what do you mean by the phrase even if i wanted to i do not want to the dna encoding is now vital to my functioning at peak performance i do not wish to return to the level of an ape but you are a careful you do not know what i am the oracle was right about that yuji thought no one could know not even his prescient mother what the oracle was becoming he was aware of the humming emanating from the oracle and could not help but think of it now as a kind of alien heartbeat you do not know what i am yujisan he stopped dumbfounded this was the first time the oracle had ever addressed him without first having been spoken to im listening when will hanasan connect with me again this was interesting didnt you tell me she was inside you yes but only in a manner of speaking i have within me a skeleton a shadow that is fleshed out only when we are in direct communication hana will be with you when you make the dive in two days time yuji staring into the impenetrable face of the oracle recalled how he and hiroto had built a more perfect beast hiroto with his team of computer engineers cyberneticists and physicists had constructed the oracle at least its shell and its rational network of abstracts that is its mode of data storage collation and delivery but it was yuji who had truly given birth to it by providing the neurologies aspects of the human brains neural pathways that could be linked with the more mechanical part of the oracle this had been made possible because hiroto had discarded silicon or arsenic or any exotic metal alloy as a conductor for the memory circuits that even the most postmodern conventional chips required these amazing light wafer chips as hiroto called them had none of the speed or capacity problems inherent in metal alloy chips hirotos breakthrough came with a form of barium titanate crystals his team had created in the lab it had been known for some time that a number of these new mancombined crystal substances could not only refract light in previously unimaginable ways but could also change beams of light sent through them light of course was the ultimate way to go for computers because of its incredible speed nothing can match it or can come close to a computer that works at the speed of light but hirotos imagination had gone further he had envisioned a computer made up not only of light wafer chips but gates of barium titanate prisms which would capture and direct not merely data at the speed of light but entire images imagine it he had said to yuji a computer that could see store images and spew them out whole fantastic all conventional computers even the advanced socalled neural network systems were based on the theory of conducting electrical impulses along a discrete pathway sealed against leakage that might spill over and affect an adjacent pathway but yuji knew that the human brain did not work in discrete pathways but rather set up a rhythmic pulse akin to the oceans surf that rippled through entire sections of the brain firing off simultaneous synaptic activity with that principle in mind yuji set out to virtually reinvent the computer what he discovered was that in the beginning his models massed pulsing dissolved almost immediately after being fired the light of genius burning so brightly for seconds at a time would die in ignominious darkness he was stumped on how to proceed until hana provided the next breakthrough she reminded yuji of the reverberations that ensued in the aftermath of a dream or even a memory that kept these pulses alive even after the initial firing using her theory as a starting point yuji began radical alterations of the basic chip boards in order to allow these neural reverberations to continue the result was the oracle or to be quite honest about it an oracle in its infancy and again he seemed to have come up against a stone wall that was when he had allowed hana to convince him to come into direct communication with the oracle had it been a stroke of genius or of madness looking at the beast now yuji could not in truth be sure it wasnt long after he and chika had agreed to their uneasy alliance that wolf heard the crunch of car tyres in the driveway and knew stevie was back he opened the door for her and she kissed him on the cheek sorry i was longer than i thought how are you feeling fine she seemed wary and now you have a friend here by the look of the corvette outside it cant be one of your police buddies it isnt it was then that she looked over his shoulder and saw chika standing there he could feel the tension come into her frame as she took in every square inch of the japanese woman im sure you have an explanation for this i didnt think i needed one she flashed him a quick glance of course you dont she brushed past him slung her bags beneath the old oak hatrack beside the door stevie she stopped at his touch allowed herself to be turned around but when she faced him now her expression was as hard as ice why should you think you owe me an explanation just because ive taken care of you because youre living in my house because weve shared my god wolf weve shared such intimate things doesnt that mean anything to you sure it does stevie why are you angry im not angry just disappointed she gestured with her head who is she wolf i dont know but im hoping shell lead me to whoever killed amanda i havent told you everything thats happened ive got to do this stevie stevie knew instinctively that this woman was the one thornburg had warned her about the woman wolf would go off with he had asked her to encourage this but now she found that she could not she would not now that she was about to lose him she realized how precious he was to her already an ache was forming in her stomach at the thought that he would leave her her vocal cords seemed paralysed and she had to bite her lip in order to keep herself from bursting into tears at that moment she almost told him about thornburg but in the end she could not bear the look of hatred on his face at her betrayal of him but a strange commingling of guilt and love drove her to do just the opposite of what thornburg had asked of her and what if shes not who she says she is have you given any thought to that she asked of course i have he was so dear to her that she could barely look at him now for fear that he would see the betrayal in her eyes no you havent had time its a calculated risk i admit now we get down to it risk youre addicted to it stevie shook her head wrapped her arms around herself god this cant be happening wolf its time you stopped playing copsandrobbers and joined the real world this is the real no no the real world like amanda and i used to go together every month to get our hair coloured our air coloured wolf because time is passing and we have some grey hairs now thats the real world not this chasing dangerous shadows in the dead of night getting shot at getting my sister killed immediately stevie put her hand over her mouth oh my god i didnt mean that youre the analyst stevie you know you did he shook his head deep down somewhere you must blame me for amandas death this is my game now remember ive seen it happen before its only human nature you think if only amanda hadnt been seeing wolf shed never have got caught up in this deadly game shed be alive now he shook his head dont bother denying it oh wolf im so sorry i have to go please dont she gripped him suddenly i want you here i she paused it was clear she was struggling with her feelings im afraid for you ill be okay how can you say that she took another glance at chika you could be dead inside an hour stevie i could have been killed going through the skylight or been drowned in the pond as far as this womans concerned theres just no way to know i have no other choice dont please be in such a hurry to meet your own death its time he kissed her tenderly i can never adequately repay you for your help yes you can stay as far away from that woman as possible shes poison wolf shell kill you i know it goodbye stevie oh christ no she clenched her fists as wolf gestured to chika and they went out the door into the mist of false dawn eight washington tokyo new york city if ham conrad had one weakness it was his love of women although he had been married for many years had three children one of whom was already in college he had had a succession of mistresses who had kept him more or less on an even keel during the rockier moments of his home life he had married a suitable woman for him a deb whose coming out party had been the talk of the eastern seaboard the former margaret billings of the billings steelworks of pittsburgh was blonde blueeyed and valedictorian of her graduating class at vassar she was in short everything he had required her to be but as it turned out thornburg his father liked margaret a whole lot better than ham ever did that was important to him which was why he had never divorced her as for margaret she adored her children and her relatively new social life in washington which she said she found liberating after being incarcerated in the prison of tokyo and so he doubted that she had ever seriously contemplated divorce but margaret disliked sex at least the kind of spontaneous sex he relished he remembered with a dull kind of nausea her calling him at the office to make appointments for couplings when she was ready for her three pregnancies dear god he thought how could one derive any pleasure with such regimentation talk about being incarcerated in prison but if it was true that his marriage was a prison it was also true that he had found the key he remembered his first mistress a beautiful tiny japanese woman quiescent pliable who seemed to live for pleasure that was an exciting thought because in those days he had had little sexual experience except for the whores of saigon and his wife two extremes he could very well live without his liaisons as he thought of them typically lasted between six months and a year he was most comfortable within that time frame which allowed for the beginning the middle and the end to develop in neat discernible stages three weeks ago he had just broken off his last liaison with a licentious horsewoman from virginia with whom he had had a truly exhilarating eight months but as always the relationship began to deteriorate as she became increasingly sensitive to the amount of time he could spend with her the holidays when he left her alone the growing certainty that he would never leave what she called quite misguidedly ham thought the haven of his family and so ham was as he would say to jason yoshida on the prowl he had just come from a rendezvous with yoshida at the occidental grill one of hams favourite meeting spots there were times he had learned in war when it was effective to do ones planning in public venues where security could take care of itself besides the grill with its oldfashioned wooden bar and its walls crammed with photos of noted washingtonians past and present gave him a concrete sense of american history because it was here in that the russians repeatedly met with an abctv correspondent named john scali whom they had chosen to be intermediary between them and the kennedy administration to help defuse the cuban missile crisis scali was subsequently made ambassador to the un ham had been discussing with yosh the continued effectiveness of wolf matheson who thornburg was still insisting was the best man to infiltrate forbidden dreams privately ham was beginning to disagree but he was unprepared to face down the old man on this subject despite yoshs vehement arguments to do just that on the other hand experience had taught ham that yosh was rarely wrong about people if wolf matheson gave him the willies there must be a damn good reason for it ham did not care for the feeling of being caught between his fathers will and his advisors instinct shaking off these disturbing thoughts he had emerged from the pleasing dimness and comfortable hum of the grill and was at the top of the willard hotels plaza staircase when he saw a woman so striking she drove all other thoughts from his head she was standing with one foot on the first step her right hand along the polished brass railing she was talking to harris patterson one of the junior partners of halburton mackinney and roberts he knew in passing ham used doug halburton an old friend of his fathers for his legal work the lawyer showed her a document she glanced at it rather offhandedly he thought nodded signed it then began to ascend towards him now he could get a better look at her face framed as it was by hair that was so dark it was almost blueblack her eyes stopped just short of being the colour of emeralds she had a full face but not a round one her lips were a little too wide and her nose a little too long but all in all her features fit her lent her a character that he liked she did not have a soft look on the contrary something about her face made it appear as if she could take on anything thrown in her path but she did not have that formidable and to his way of thinking unfortunate tanklike mien that many women competing in the male arena seemed compelled to evoke it was the kind of face ham decided that made you want to get to know her that made you think there must be more to her than a pair of long shapely legs and a lithe fit torso excuse me he said when she reached the top of the stairs this isnt the hayadams is it she laughed and he liked her face even more are you serious or is that a line she had the kind of imperfect accent still with traces of slurred words and dropped vowels that marked her as coming from an english workingclass background ham found it charming you tell me she pursed her lips contemplatively beneath her overcoat she was wearing a suit of deep blue linen a simple choker of pink pearls and a pair of large gold earrings there were no rings on her strong sunbrowned fingers since you asked id say it was a line you dont look lost that may not be entirely true ham said washington often makes me dizzy and one hotel looks much like the next i seriously doubt that even an outoftowner like me could mistake the willard for the hayadams really when was the last time you were at the hayadams gee i think its been years want to take a look at the lobby or a room your choice sorry some of us have to work she said what do you do im on a research trip for my firm extant export were based in london but weve got offices in toronto brussels and washington as well im often here but never when the weathers been so beastly well thats washington for you the only consolation is summers even worse so i understand she stuck out her hand marion st james actually its marion starr st james but i hardly ever introduce myself that way ham took her hand as he told her his name i was kidding about the hayadams but how about taking a tour of the city with me i can get into some forbidden places like the emergency conference room at the pentagon id like to but im afraid i cant marion said my firm has me on rather a tight leash then dinner tonight oh i i have an idea how we can beat this beastly weather have dinner with me on my boat the chesapeake is often kind to its travellers even at this time of the year what do you do mr conrad my friends call me ham im an advisor to the department of defense im not yet your friend mr conrad despite the fact that youve been shamelessly ignoring the speed limit you know us brits cool and aloof you dont strike me as a typical brit im not marion said what time should i meet you what ham liked most about marion was her directness this he felt was a peculiarly american trait since in his experience europeans for some reason liked to beat around the bush interminably before they got to the heart of the matter for ham who had spent so much time among the japanese whose main avocation in life appeared to be procrastination obfuscation and adhering to the ancient confucian tenet of never saying no such forthrightness was refreshing indeed the haze across the bay that night was thick enough that even pinpoint lights on shore seemed as large as balloons marion was dressed in trousers of a deep yellow wool a stylish tomatocoloured waistlength windbreaker with a gold woven crest over the left breast and so it seemed to ham nothing underneath these hot colours were in marked contrast with the cool ones ham had seen her in earlier they brought out the extraordinary colour of her eyes and lent her a wholly different more informal look i brought hot chocolate and franks marion said as she swung aboard she laughed at his look of astonishment dont tell me she said dropping her oversized bag onto the deck with this accent you expected my favourite foods to be lets see she ran her tongue around her lips iced vodka and smoked sturgeon jesus ham said still in something of a daze thats exactly what i loaded into the fridge you learn something new every minute eh mr conrad she said as she broke out the packets of hot chocolate from harrods what would you like it seemed she had taken over the boat there was no problem with that she stood in the classic seamans stance her feet slightly further apart than would be normal on dry land her hips fluid to take up the roll of the swells ill have whatever youre in the mood for then hot chocolate it is have you any milk in the fridge ham continued to watch her i see youre no stranger to boats right my fathers a shipbuilder firstrate teak sloops he used to take me sailing every chance he could she made the hot chocolates with deft economical movements that done they moved up to the captains cabin and she watched him as he drove the boat through the channel towards the deep water you really are a military man arent you the bearing is unmistakable you mean i look like ive got a steel rod up my ass he grunted judging by my approach i suppose you think everything about me is bullshit marion smiled too early to tell mr conrad and thats another thing he said sipping his chocolate when are you going to call me ham when were friends ham eyed her do you always go aboard strangers boats certainly she said without hesitation enemies as well poor enemies now youre being insincere you dont know me well enough to mean that ham looked dejected i think youve just sunk my last ploy good she dipped her finger into her cup sucked off the chocolate perhaps now ill start getting to know the real hampton conrad ham considered how to handle this extraordinary woman she had a body and a face that would normally have occupied him intensely for the requisite six months but curiously enough he found himself being captivated by her mind this was something entirely new for him though his wife had been brilliant at school her kind of intelligence did not translate well into the world at large and as far as any of hams mistresses were concerned he was too busy burying himself in their nubile flesh to ever consider that they might have something else to offer him inexplicably an unpleasant memory surfaced years ago he had caught his mother in bed with thornburgs twentyeightyearold administrative assistant actually they werent in bed at all but performing some quite amazing sexual acrobatics in the sunken roman bath my god ham thought now it was decidedly odd seeing ones mother stark naked in the middle of a bizarre sex act with a stranger he drove me to this she told him weeping your fathers got no heart no soul no sense that anyone exists but him what else was i to do of course she had begged him not to tell his father and ham forgetting for a moment what his father had said about her while he was mourning the death of the noblehearted lion acquiesced but a week later at school when he beat a fellow classmate into unconsciousness for no good reason at all he realized just how much anger he had been repressing immediately he had been dismissed from the headmasters office he had phoned his father when one long drunken night years later he had told jason yoshida this story yoshida had commented its easy to forgive a sin when its outside the family impossible otherwise now that were out in the deep water marion said maybe youll tell me how long your tour was the way she said it ham knew she meant vietnam too long he slowed to one third keeping an eye on the lights of the naval air station on his right ahead was point lookout and tangier island his fathers favourite trysting place with tiffany body how did you guess i was in nam she shrugged in the way men often do with the coolness of authority your body told me the marines have a phrase for people like you locked and cocked youre a real weapon and youre familiar with weapons ooh its too soon for you to be jealous jealous hell thatll be the day but to his dismay he found that he was to cover his discomfort he said to answer your question i dont think you can measure that tour in any conventional manner i was there in any way you care to look at it thats all that needs to be said i understand and ham believed she did how he could not say perhaps she had lost someone there shaking off memories he said for a brit you sure have a lot of american interests in many ways englands a sad place now she said the cities i mean the economy the way of life has slipped badly also i have no use for formality my fathers the same way i suppose she gave a little laugh anyway i think my mother and sister are formal enough for the entire family very stiff upper her eyes followed him in the low glow of the cabin the red and green running lights played off the blackness of her hair my family aside i admire your american savagery and bullheadedness teddy roosevelts my historical idol and the way you stormed into vietnam like cowboys with your pistols blazing was quite astonishing it was the staying there that got you into trouble your warriors pride stupid but then pride always breeds stupidity or is it the other way round never mind in the end it doesnt matter does it i grew up in ireland so in a very real way i felt close to the war even though i was very young then well i imagine that had something to do with it dont you the youth part when youre young you can stand so close to death and never even think to flinch marion came off the berth stood close to him as he cut the engines dropped anchor she had a clean citrus smell he liked that as he liked so much about her but i imagine that like all military men you feel that women should be seen and not give their opinions he turned to her if you thought i was that sort i dont think you would have agreed to have dinner with me on the contrary a woman like me cant resist trying to correct the worlds wrongs that was the moment he drew her to him and with a thrill like an electric current running through him crushed her lips against his darkness enfolded them the gentle rocking of the boat the wet cool sea breeze that found them in the forward section of the cabin worked as counterpoint to the urgency and heat of their desire the ghost of a sheen burnished the tops of her naked thighs he could see them curving the outside of her knees braced against the crescent bulkheads she held out her arms and ham could see the definition in her shoulders and biceps he slid his hands around her arms squeezing and felt none of the softness in the triceps women were prone to come closer she whispered drawing him inward im so hot she lifted her pelvis towards him as he pressed against her his lips came down over hers and his hands cupped her hardnippled breasts he knelt down and she moaned as she felt him against the wetness of her core her hips jerked upward in tiny ragged movements as she dug her fingernails into his hair the spicy taste of her the sound of her in heat made ham so hard he could scarcely breathe he stood put his hands under her and pulled her onto him marion groaned from deep down inside her and fought to get closer her arms came around him and he lifted her up jammed her back against the bulkhead and putting his mouth against the side of her neck rammed into her with a kind of berserk fury dimly he felt her fingers moving downward behind him then all at once a strange kind of ecstasy overtook him and grunting he pushed into her with all his remaining strength his eyes opened wide as a moment later marion gripped him with a manic desperation and climbing up him shuddered in wave after wave of pleasure he drifted abruptly into his mind floated the scene of his mother in the act with his fathers assistant he watched again her being penetrated as every piece of female dirt he later saw in saigon was penetrated for one moments pleasure the image of her face was warped by lust the odour of her in heat that same odour mingled with those of mud and blood he would catch as he walked the detestable streets of saigon seeping again through his mind like a miasma an entire way of life was obliterated in the space of a heartbeat in the moment when he put down the phone after telling his father what he had seen he had known that when he returned home for easter his mother would no longer be there he wondered now whether tiffany body his fathers current wife was a natural outgrowth of that one moment encysted in time that he was doomed to replay over and over again in the theatre of his mind ham she whispered hoarsely while he was still deep inside her do you ever dream of sin sin he said dreamily that depends on your definition sin is all the things you want to do but are too scared to try she licked at his sweaty shoulder i dream of sin all the time you must have some imagination why is it everything i want is sinful is it yes she began to move against him and much to his surprise he felt himself getting hard again there is someone else someone unknown someone who would kill you both that is what hana said to me wakaresan yuji said shoto wakare grunted what interests me just as much is that she said that she saw you and nishitsu locked in a monumental struggle wakare did not want to get into a discussion that could lead yuji to think about sources outside their small circle in japan too hanas divination of the future troubled him jason yoshida might want to destroy nishitsu which was why wakare had signed on to yoshidas team in the first place but it was wakares duty unspoken to anyone including yoshida to keep his friend yuji out of the line of fire those were her words yuji said now they were in the plush back seat of yujis dark blue bmw having just finished a long day at their respective offices as they passed through the blazing neon heart of the ginza yuji was pleased to see the conglomerates latest billboard a hologram of the logo fully twelve storeys high that changed from green and blue to gold and crimson along with the tag line shian kogaku we are always with you do you think shes right wakare asked looking at the hologram which dominated the eventladen immediate skyline i never wanted to be in a battle least of all with nishitsu yuji admitted with his candidates winning elections all over the country he isnt giving you much choice those dangerous radicals arent nishitsus candidates yuji said how they ever got the backing exactly wakare said if theyre from fringe groups how did they get into power yuji turned to his friend you sound as if you know were here wakare said leading yuji out of the dark blue bmw they were in that part of shinjuku known as kabukicho the older district crammed with pachinko parlours restaurants topless bars movie houses and theatres wakare led the way past a buzzing neonlit facade enka was a mizushobai a brothel its name derived from the sentimental drinking songs japanese men sang when drunk at such establishments enka had that sex and liquorsodden atmosphere endemic to all such twilight establishments but that was where the resemblance ended behind the seedy exterior was revealed the soul of an extraordinary mizushobai the courtesans all wore the kind of thick theatrical makeup that made them seem like actresses adding to the effect was the fact that each was made up to look like a famous japanese film or pop music star this was hardly surprising since these women were as much entertainers as anything else but these girls were something of a throwback to the courtesans of the yoshiwara tokyos original pleasure quarter they prided themselves on being not only artistes but works of art here the illusion of romance was everything since it was a foregone conclusion that sex in some form or other would occur during the night an emphasis was put on the courtship between customer and courtesan the teasing verbal doubleentendres the tiny movements of mouth tongue hand and eye that titillated the mind as well as the body they were shown into a sixtatami room where two women knelt tending the glowing coals of a hibachi on a low table plates and foods were arrayed wakare sat down and yuji followed suit the courtesans appeared so exquisite they might have been cherry blossoms in that single afternoon in april when their colour and form are perfect they knelt very close yet the two men spent their time talking to one another while the courtesans silently flirted with them with their eyes and the tilt of their heads the courtesans heated sake serving the rice liquor in tiny cups on black lacquered trays on which were arranged like paintings plates of bits of food fried tofu seaweed marinated in rice vinegar flying fish roe grilled baby salmon fins sweet egg custard the foods had been chosen not only for their complementary tastes but for their harmonious textures and colours after the dinner yuji dismissed the courtesans who demurely withdrew into another room behind shoji sliding ricepaper screens the night is young yet yujisan wakare said these two girls are the best in the house i requested their services myself as you say the night is young yuji lifted his sake cup to his lips threw his head back downing what was left i am curious as to your theory concerning nishitsu and the radicals and so wakare outlined nishitsus clandestine funding of the radical rightwing splinter groups just as minako had instructed him leading yuji slowly through the maze of entanglements until he arrived at the black blade society yuji said nothing through all of wakares recounting his face reflected nothing of the impact of the portentous words but when wakare was at last finished he said i assume you have the evidence to back up all your claims of nishitsus personal involvement in the radical splintergroups enough you had better yuji warned what you have outlined here is nothing less than extortion murder terrorism and treason wakare took a deep breath i ought to know he said i too am a member of the black blade society the breath whistled through yujis teeth the two men watched each other from what might have been opposite sides of a chasm at last yuji said why are you telling me this now wakaresan wakare hurriedly poured more sake for them both yujisan you know my feelings towards yukio mishima and all he stood for so you can readily understand my membership in toshin kuro kosai but lately i have been having more and more misgivings about the course the leadership is taking i find in my heart more disagreement with their goals now but the society is not one in which the opinions of the individual are tolerated he downed his sake poured a refill no i found myself faced with two difficult and admittedly dangerous choices one was to resign which i should point out has never been done and would not be easily countenanced the second was to work silently clandestinely from within to change the objectives of toshin kuro kosai and this is where you come in to effect changes successfully i need allies and who better than you who nishitsu has been wooing for years to help me help you how by joining the society wakare said by pretending to help nishitsu while you and i and others like us work from within to depose him and establish control of the black blade society now i fully appreciate what you meant when you said your choices would be dangerous wakare leaned forward will you do it my friend without you i dont think ill have a chance of succeeding and if i bring you in my own influence within the society will be that much stronger i dont know yuji said this is not my kind of game there youre wrong my friend wakare said pouring more sake for them both when you created the oracle you made it your game it was only at my mothers instigation that i began work on the oracle yuji said by way of correcting his friend i had known that she had been working for years on a method to alter living dna strands and over the past several years as my r d section has developed biotechnology breakthroughs and combined them with refined techniques developed at other labs it seemed at last possible for me to help her the oracle is the result yujisan wakare said earnestly i dont think you fully realize the danger the oracle has put you in yuji stared at him blankly and wakare already in the water up to his thighs thought he might as well plunge into the deep end you see the black blade society would have a distinct interest in this aspect of the oracle its members have altered dna that causes their lifespans to be rather longer than what we think of as normal but for some reason no one as yet understands there are no babies being born with the altered dna that means that a society that had always thought of itself as immortal has been faced with its own death your oracle could change all that it could alter the dna of babies the toshin kuro kosai selects to bring up in its own way once again perpetuating itself having said this wakare prayed that yuji would not link this with what little he knew of his mothers own work on dna taken up he supposed when she had relinquished all control direct and otherwise of shian kogaku he neednt have been concerned the bombshell he had placed in yujis lap was more than enough to occupy him for the moment so this is why nishitsu has been after me one of the reasons wakare said without you and the new breed of technocrats who follow your lead the toshin kuro kosais progress to power in japan will be slowed considerably and now of course time is as crucial to them as it is to the rest of the world yuji sipped thoughtfully at his sake when he had emptied his cup he held it out and wakare replenished it tell me he said at last how old are you wakaresan seventythree yuji sucked in his breath you cannot be any older than i am no more than fifty surely but i am wakare smiled this is our way yujisan yuji nodded still lost in thought i must ask you one more question wakaresan how did nishitsu and the black blade society find out about the oracle this was the moment wakare had been dreading the one he and minako had discussed at length he knew if he gave the wrong answer yuji would jump the wrong way and minako would be punished severely for failing to bring her son into the society as nishitsu had ordered her to do yujisan listen to me even though i am one of the toshin kuro kosai inner circle i am not privy to all their workings but believe me when i tell you that they have infiltrated every level of japanese society from their information on the oracle it seems clear to me they must have someone inside your r d unit this is another compelling reason for joining me once you are inside you will in time be able to monitor their infiltration of shian kogaku all this is as you say yuji said tensely but i cannot allow them access to the oracle of course not but again if you are ostensibly one of them you have a better chance of filtering what you do give them yuji thought about this for some time life is so complex he said when all i wish for is simplicity he summoned one of the exquisitely painted girls and she came with more sake and a knowing smile all of this was consumed without a word being spoken but wakare had that premonition one often gets in the utter stillness just before a summer storm when yuji spoke again his tone was fatalistic you give me little choice he said a toast wakare held up his sake cup he felt very close to yuji and knew in his heart that he had agreed to do minakos bidding not only out of giri but also out of the slender hope that this conspiracy would bring yuji closer to him to the future of the black blade society then he said yuji warily touched his cup to wakares to change he said wolfs eyes were burning he pressed into them with the pads of his thumbs christ he thought what mad universe have i become involved in chika drove very fast changing lanes in a way that made you believe she knew what every driver around her was thinking the sky was leaden with the aftermath of night but soon the clouds began to shred in the new light of morning sunlight flooded the countryside turning shadows from blue to gold the trees from black to green he could feel the enormous power in the car knew that chika had had something done to the engine more horsepower supercharged something major anyway listen wolf i know you dont trust me chika said but id like to give our alliance every chance to work so if you dont mind id like to give you some background from my point of view go ahead you hate us for taking over your country but the fact is that just the opposite is true she said america is responsible for the new japan americans created us encouraged us funded us you made us what we are wolf and now you cant bear to admit the mistake you made because all the while we were rebuilding ourselves you were stagnating if our success has been daunting you are envious and yet curiously unwilling to challenge us instead you publicly scold us chastise us for our success because of the mistaken impression its at your expense how unfair we did nothing to force your people to buy our cars electronics and computers americans are not stupid they chose our products in the most highly competitive market in the world because they were more innovative and more reliable than yours she took the vette around a sixteenwheeler as if the truck was standing still you invented the transistor she went on you ignored us when we offered you the market in portable personal radios and cassette players so we took our own advice and made billions you invented the microchip yet we have maximized the technology so well youre now forced to come to us to buy them your computer companies are so inefficiently run we are virtually forced to acquire them so that we can teach you directly how to market effectively as well as manufacture efficiently and for all this you hate and fear us for good reason many people think listen to me wolf because for america the future could be worse than the immediate past chika said neatly manoeuvring the corvette around another thundering trailer truck at high speed perhaps you think im merely arrogant do you want just one example you invented robotics we have lionized its inventor joseph engelberger have you ever heard of him has one in a thousand americans yet we have sculpted that technology in manufacturing to increase efficiency productivity and to end up with a virtually defectfree product what have americans done with their robots put them in disneyland you might as well throw them in the garbage heap soon youll have to come to us for those as well and then you will resent us even more we dont take well to banding together wolf said were a nation of entrepreneurs who are used to forging their own individual road to success not following an overall plan laid down by others yes and in this postmodern era this quaint nineteenthcentury trait makes you greedy as well as slothful you eagerly take our money then chastise us again for making you rich your new breed of entrepreneur wishes only to acquire so he can dismantle while we seek to acquire have bought radio city music hall and rockefeller center now your children and your childrens children are assured of enjoying these landmarks no one likes foreigners owning his treasured possessions chika smiled we japanese dont like it that an american currently holds the heavyweight sumo title dawn was granite grey in the city sanitation men were busy hosing down the sidewalks pushing stumbling herds of the homeless out of their makeshift shelters scattering them wet and miserable into the early morning shadows that still clung to the tenements of the sidestreets she parked outside the chief medical examiners blue brick building and together they went up the stairs wolf had called vernon harrison at home and the cme was waiting for them a giant paperboard cup of coffee in hand id offer you some of this he said but i dont hate you that much he took a sip grimaced they told me it would take years to get used to the stuff and they were right theres a joke this stuffs made in the cold room downstairs out of formaldehyde and blood but at least its aged he laughed though it was obvious hed told the story so many times it had become rote wolf introduced chika as a friend of moravias and left it at that in truth he didnt know what else to say harrison took them down to the cold room along the banks of refrigerated units pulled on a handle and the gleaming stainless steel unlatched so the slab and its mortal contents were revealed hes no good to me now harrison said sorrowfully he was getting so ripe i finally had to pump him full of embalming chemicals its a good thing hes got no family theyd be hitting the roof by now i heard youd made some toxicological progress wolf said some harrison sipped his coffee i confess i still dont know what happened to this guy but we finally tracked down the source of our anomalous chem readings this ol boys endocrine levels have been shot to shit i mean i bet theyre better than mine were when i was twentyfive ive never encountered anything like it that what killed him lnein mein hen i dont yet know exactly what killed him but ill tell you this flat out if he hadnt been murdered he would have been dead inside six weeks what from cancers harrison said so many being born i cant even count the ways and let me tell you none of them are natural you mean artificially induced wolf said what from insulinlike growth factor chika said the two men turned to look at her come again wolf said i believe the lady is speaking of a naturally occurring growth hormone in humans harrison said its manufactured in the pituitary gland ive heard of studies using a recombinant form to slow ageing in older people you know reduce body fat by replacing it with muscle mass present in younger people however chika said i believe this is the first time youve seen the effects of geneinduced antiageing now harrison was goggling do you mean to tell me this mans dna was somehow altered but thats impossible doctor thirteen days ago lawrence moravia was a normal fortyeightyearold male now you tell me what is he today harrison grunted at the moment there are only two things about him i can say with any certainty hes dead and hes no longer normal what about his rouged cheeks wolf said is there significance in that chika nodded yukio mishima once wrote that men must be the colour of cherry blossoms even in death i think he meant that though death robs men of life it should not be allowed to take their colour their machismo as well applying rouge is part of the ritual of death so moravias death was premeditated absolutely she said outside on the steps he said all right youve shown me how moravia was killed but why was he killed this was a test he knew the answer of course because shipley had told him moravia was a spy and had been found out but he wanted to hear chikas version of it lawrence became an experiment he was hooked up to a well just call it a biocomputer called the oracle the oracle said it had the ability to restructure human dna in a living body moravia was going to be the living proof wolf watched her for some time who was lying to him chika or shipley perhaps they both were what happened i dont know there is some kind of flaw in the oracles methodology the antiageing process triggered multicell carcinomas moravia was murdered to keep the secret why not just burn the body he said that would have forestalled any full autopsy you must understand the toshin kuro kosai chika said it is as i told you before burning is not an honourable way to die then moravia meant something to the black blade society yes he was close to some in the inner circle close enough to be a spy wolf wondered to chika he said okay youve told me that suma was sent to kill me and i have enough hard evidence to believe that why were you sent here to protect you chika said and also to bring you back to japan we need you there wolf to stop the inexorable march of the toshin kuro kosai you see up until now there was a kind of check on them they have known for decades that they were dying out no babies were being born with the sight the altered dna and for decades they have had a programme in place to find a way to artificially induce this change in babies to create more of their own exactly chika said and now in the oracle we believe they have found that way and yet it was not enough though yuji was closer to the oracle than hiroto could ever be he was still maddeningly far from being in true sync with it and this chasm frustrated him lets take it from the top one more time yuji had said out loud though there had been no one else in the room the top of what the oracle had said in a pleasant synthesized voice that hiroto claimed was female but which yuji was sure was male what you said before yuji had said patiently repeat it please the danger is in life the oracle had said not in death what does that mean the meaning is in what i have said youre making no sense my syntax is faultless yuji had stared at the black cube for some time he blew air out his nostrils in an attempt to vent some of his emotion then he had crossed to the steel alloy door unlocked it let hana into the room im doing this against my better judgement yuji had said its only because youve badgered me until i cant think straight and because im getting nowhere with it i understand hana had said in that tone of voice that so reminded him of his mother hana had stood in front of the oracle for a long time before she said i was expecting something altogether different she had begun to laugh i think i was expecting robbie the robot from forbidden planet the oracle isnt a robot yuji had said at least not in any conventional sense its more quite a bit more yes yuji had watched her are you disappointed in how it looks no she stepped forward put her hand along the side of the black cube i can feel the warmth like human heat she had turned to him how do you currently communicate with it hiroto writes using the light pen i speak with it then she had surprised him by saying is there no other way i dont understand you both speech and the keyboard are inadequate for my purposes then i guess were stuck he had said with a profound sense of relief hana had walked around the cube he saw her staring at a jumble of equipment and his heart skipped a beat she went over to the nest of minuscule optical fibres connected to advanced gallium arsenide computer chips on a circuit board the size of the end of her thumb the fibres looped around one another and now hana was looking at what was attached to their other ends five pressuresensitive adhesive pads yuji held his breath as her forefinger stretched out to touch the pads one at a time what is this device yuji cold as ice had not answered contained in her question was the signal that she already knew instead he had said it doesnt work she turned around youve tried it yuji said nothing her eyes were locked on his i want you to plug me in pardon me yuji had said i dont think i understood you but when she repeated what she had said he knew he had made no mistake thats not possible of course its possible now youre sounding like hiroto she could be so maddeningly selfassured okay i admit its possible theoretically anyway but its far too dangerous didnt you imply that you had tried it she nodded at his silence i see your fear is filling up this space id have to be crazy to do what you ask nevertheless hana had said youll do it thats why i came here its why you allowed me to come isnt it be honest with yourself its got to a point where hiroto doesnt know whats going on inside the thing and you dont understand what its saying you hook me up and ill know it all or youll be dead yuji said we have no idea what hooking you into the oracle will do to your system with impeccable logic hana had said ill remind you that you have no idea of what my system is like all the more reason for caution the oracle wont allow anything bad to happen to me yuji had stared at her now youre talking nonsense nonsense speak to me tell me that you do not often think of the oracle as something living i dont know what to think but i know whats in your mind hana had said yuji thought of hanas enigmatic wavefronts had the oracle spoken to her in ways unfathomable to him that was madness that would mean she was right that he did think of the oracle as being a sentient being and yet she seemed so certain so unafraid she had said to him this is why i am here yujisan my wavefronts allow me to see beyond the time space continuum to strike it as you would a stage set to recognize it for what it really is a comfortable scrim upon which human beings map out events that are otherwise inexplicable because beyond it is the new order of the universe where time gravity space are all different aspects of one overriding principle of existence she watched with a certain satisfaction the dawning of perception on yujis face when it was fullblown she said now you understand why i must be connected to the oracle how i know it will not allow me to be harmed by the intensely powerful lapid circuits this is what the fever has done to me how my own neural pathways work this is how i think the oracle and i are somehow related as if it is my halfbrother yuji had put his hands to his temples there was a throbbing there he could no longer control for so long he had wanted to know the secret of how hana had been changed but now he knew he felt like turning and running as far from her as possible with a shaking hand he steadied himself took several deep breaths i dont want to do this hana had come over to him looked at him sadly poor yuji your second sight has split you in two and now the factions make war one upon the other im afraid of the chaos inside me she had placed her hand along the side of his face is that how you view your gift the chaos is all around you yuji listen dont you hear the inchoate roar of the universe i hear nothing but silence yes listen to the silence his eyes were pleading hana you must give up this mad idea forbid me to come in contact with the oracle when he had said nothing she led him towards the oracle your duty is clear she had said as it was from the first come on now do what you know you must it had taken him just over an hour to make the preparations and when he was done he had sat her in a chair next to the black cube he put his hands in his lap they were trembling then he felt hanas strong capable fingers twining with his dont be afraid of yourself yuji myself im afraid of that damn thing no you are afraid of that part of yourself youve put into it yuji took a deep breath looked from hanas pale intelligent face to the black intelligent facade of the oracle now he understood that both were profound mysteries to him and in a moment they would be linked in a previously unimaginable symbiosis this was what hana wanted most and what he wanted most as well let it be donethen with his eyes on hanas he had reached over flicked on the switch our best bet is to get to tokyo as quickly as possible chika said but with suma looking for you we cant do it any normal way ive got a friend who can help us that means abandoning my job just walking out you still dont understand chika said you dont have a choice suma has seen to that wolf thought of shipley then and his decision to take on the job the spook had offered him this was the direction he had to go in okay but ive got to stop at the office first its important only for a minute chika warned we have no time to spare they took second avenue all the way downtown to chrystie street heading east on canal to allen turning west of east broadway wolf had told chika that he needed to pick up his service revolver that was the truth as far as it went but he also wanted to see squire richards clear up the mess they had both made before breathard could use it as a sledgehammer against him tell me something wolf said how does the black blade society mean to use the oracle if its antiageing methodology is flawed they are so close all theyre lacking is one small catalyst and with that theyre down to two possibilities youre right then he said theres very little time he made a mental note to tell shipley about this ominous development when he had the time and the privacy the old theatre on the edge of chinatown was steeped in blue shadow inside wolf noticed that the painters had finished their work and were gone christ lieutenant am i glad to see you ive been trying to phone you in east hampton bobby looking older wiser sadder following his encounter with the blue fireball in the barrio alley rushed up to wolf upon his arrival he also seemed somewhat nervous i was on my way into the city whats up wolf at his desk was unlocking his lower drawer to take out his service revolver leather waist holster and extra ammunition its squire bobby said a little breathlessly he was found dead this morning in front of his house on tremont shot twice in the back of the head jesus wolf stood up stared at bobby could squire have been stupid enough to pledge the money his brother owed could the loan sharks have caught up with him he glanced at chika suma or no suma id better get over there right away wolf chika said softly urgently we dont have time for this bobby looking from chika to wolf licked his lips anyway i dont think that would be such a good idea lieutenant what are you talking about bobby shifted from one foot to the other well see we have one lead lieutenant he said i just got off the horn with rothstein in ballistics tests confirm the slugs that killed squire came from your gun wolf could hear chika let out a little breath behind him oh christ he said but bobby you just saw me unlock my drawer and take out my gun right lieutenant which means i didnt have it all weekend bobby shook his head all it means is that you didnt have it two minutes ago bobby this is a bullshit rap ive been framed lieutenant i believe you all the werewolves do but you gotta understand that ever since junior was offed everybodys jumpy moods the shits throughout the whole department and you know breathard gunning for us from the getgo hes using your beef with squire for everything its worth now rallying the black dudes from every precinct to work on the commish were off squires homicide maybe conflict of interest breathard says also and here bobby took a deep breath theres an apb out for you wanted for questioning wolf we really dont have time for this chika said this whole setup is beginning to stink lets get out of here now no no i cant walk out now wolf said ive got to fight this through if i can get to the commish i can show breathard up for the liar and racist he is if you stay i guarantee you suma will see you never get the chance chika said bobby licked his lips again he didnt know who to look at first shes right lieutenant you gotta get outta here until we can get some real facts on who iced squire rothstein cued me a team from internal affairs is on their way over here to impound your gun and bring you down to one police plaza no choice chika said wolf looked down at his gun nodded bobby id start by talking to squires brother he said shoving the gun ammo paraphernalia into the pockets of his leather flight jacket thats what the beef was about squire was shaking down la mentiras owner to get bread his brother owed to the sharks will do lieutenant bobby held out his hand and wolf took it id watch my back bobby said looks like breathards determined to have your ass one way or another once again in the corvette wolf and chika took the narrow crooked streets among the oldest in the city winding canyons adjacent to the stone heartland of financial america they emerged on the east side of the tip of manhattan in that nomansland beneath the fdr drive here the blacktop and ancient cobblestones had been layered with massed drifts of corrugated iron beaten tin thick cardboard even ragged slabs of discarded wallboard an entire city within a city had sprung up here during the last number of years where the burgeoning rabble of new york hunted and haunted the adjacent streets breathards putting me in a vice and squeezing as hard as he can wolf said and damn it i cant do anything about it cooking fires were already apparent the stench of the detritus was appalling the outpouring of humanity deprived of modern sanitation there was a parking lot of chromeplated shopping carts here and there wolf could see a con ed manhole opened wires snaking over the cobbles in spiderweb array these wretched people stole everything else why not electricity as well business was also conducted here though in wolfs experience it was inevitably of an illicit nature he remembered coming down here with bobby connor one summer night early in their tour together before the werewolves had been born their eyes had watered so fiercely they were obliged to break out the gas masks in order not to gag they had come in response to one of wolfs snitches who had informed them that a perp wanted for the brutal rapemurder of an elderly couple was hiding out there that would have been the only reason to come here because the city of the hopeless was otherwise shunned by police and city officials alike who finding the area ungovernable and lacking the funds necessary to patrol it preferred to allow it to be a kind of quasimunicipality all its own with its own government and laws but instead of the perp wolf and bobby had come upon two brothers the principals in the transaction slashing wildly at each other with gravity knives they were surrounded by a widening circle of street people urging one or the other brother on touts circulating among the crowd were doing heavy business taking bets from the onlookers wolf and bobby separated each taking one of the brothers wolf managed to get the knife away from his man but the other one broke away from bobby slashed through the front of his gas mask bobby momentarily blind groped for his man who turned and lunged at his brother with manic fury he plunged his blade into his brothers stomach in almost the same instant wolf shot him in the chest staring down at the two dead brothers through the plastic lenses of his gas mask hearing the crowd moan and bobby retching overcome by the faecal filth of the city of the hopeless wolf had almost turned in his badge what could be worse than this he had thought but that had only been the beginning of his plunge into the foul cauldron of new yorks postmodern underbelly which had now led him back to the city of the damned they emerged from the black corvette which was getting plenty of attention from the ragged noisome populace an enormous battered chrome beatbox hanging by wires outside the entryway to a shanty was spewing out metallic bassheavy hiphop music interspersed with raw and offensive rap lyrics no one appeared to mind the noise this early it was merely another urban sound along with horns honking and sirens blaring flies buzzed in the encroaching sunlight and the stench of garbage and unwashed humans made a noxious miasma that hovered over the place like a new strain of metropolitan smog chika turned and said maybe youd better stay near the car how fit are you fit enough she gave him a quick look went towards the entryway to the shanty the music was now so loud that wolfs eardrums hurt parker chika was obliged to shout in order to be heard two men emerged from the shanty they were big hispanic with tattooed arms like tree trunks they were dressed in sweatstained singlets and jeans they carried cheap european handguns and long wicked carving knives at their waists they were holding baseball bats into which razor blades had been sunk oh its you said the broader of the two he had two teardrops tattooed beneath one eye a sign that he had served two years in prison i need to see him the teardrop man grinned as he approached her the other man stayed where he was near the entrance to the shanty you need to but who the hell is this yo bringin roun here he poked wolf in the chest you should know better than bring him turf side he got that smell i dont want to know better wolf said nothing as he eyed the man circling him i remember this cop stink here the teardrop man said with a sneer the baseball bat swung up millimetres from wolfs face and the teardrop man growled big shot cop huh you think you in the nyc of wide streets and fast spenders yo you not on yo home turf now maricone take a close look at whats gonna rip yo nose off he waggled the bat menacingly get that out of my face wolf said the teardrop man laughed and spat on wolfs shoes now for sure you gonna lose that nose wolf was aware of chika standing loose and quiescent the other hispanic bodyguard with his hand on the filthy tapewrapped butt of his gun he took what appeared to be a hesitant step backwards the teardrop man followed him thrusting his baseball bat towards the front of wolfs face he was grinning already a bit loopy with the foretaste of bloody victory wolf reached out and in a blur grasped the teardrop mans right arm just behind the elbow pulling it sharply forward into his own backward momentum as the teardrop man came towards him momentarily offbalance wolf chopped down once with the edge of his hand in a vicious kite at the juncture of the teardrop mans collarbone he heard the snap of the bone breaking even as he was smashing the heel of his hand into the teardrop mans sternum wolf let go and the hispanic collapsed moaning he toppled all the way over as he grabbed at his shoulder the other hispanic had his gun drawn but there was movement from inside the shanty and in a moment a thin white man with a long ratty beard appeared in the entryway parker wolf stared at him clean him up shave him put him in a brooks brothers suit and he would look right at home a half a mile away on wall street we need to talk parker chika said parker was staring fixedly at wolf he had glanced once at the man writhing on the ground paco he said to the hispanic clean up this mess hes a friend chika said parker wrinkled his nose cop smell stinks he drawled in an exaggerated southern accent cop in another life wolf said hes a friend chika repeated parker stood beneath the chrome beatbox as if it were some form of modern talisman to ward off evil he was wearing a pair of blackandpurple striped cyclists skintight mylar shorts and a dayglo lime green cutoff shirt that had surf voodoo stencilled across front and back privacy parker said lets go inside parker might be thin but wolf could see the wiry musculature moving as he reached into a garbage can fire removing a smouldering stick using its end to light a cigarette on the way into his house it was close inside smelling of smoke and cabbage and human habitation there were photos on the wall colour glossies ripped from the magazines of the rich shots of exotic motor cars yachts private jets glittering stuccoed mansions in palm beach and magnificent white cedar estates in east hampton all were darkened by the soot of the reality of this place there was old sisal on the concrete mismatched lamps on crates an alcove for a minuscule kitchen had been hammered out of a sheet of corrugated tin and on the other side an old colourless blanket covered a doorway to other rooms parker went to an ancient wheezing refrigerator took out three beers handed one each to chika and wolf then folded himself into an upholstered easy chair a soft cloud of dust rose and as if exhausted by that modest flight settled back almost immediately wolf and chika sat on simple cane chairs broken and repaired many times chika said we need to get out of here city state country that made parker grin you mean this piece of shit cop is on the run now that makes my day suma is here chika said simply hes going to try to stop us parker thought about that for some time suma will come after anyone who helps you he said at last if we get lost fast enough we wont give him the time chika said its us he wants parker grinned he had some metal teeth youre some piece of work i can see why you scare a lot of guys shitless he flicked what was left of his cigarette into an empty contadina stewed tomato can ill see what i can do he got up pushed through the old blanket into another room chika went over to the shantys door took a look outside she hadnt touched her beer what would you have done if i hadnt broken that ratmans collarbone wolf asked her i didnt need to do a thing chika said did you see that particular future perhaps i have more faith in you than you do in me through the doorway they could see life in the city of the damned grind on around them life here was like life in any third world country he supposed only who would have thought it would come here wolf aware of her vigilance said you looking for something in particular no chika shook her head but she continued to scan the immediate environment wolf watching a naked child defecate on a pile of garbage recalled reading a city health services report quickly suppressed by the mayors office that found the number of colonies of pathogenic microorganisms like diplococcus staph amoeba and salmonella per cubic metre here to be completely off the measurement scale you know i cant leave yet that would be very foolish she said suma will eat you for breakfast do what i tell you and i think i can keep you alive you dont understand im responsible for squires death you dont know that he was one of my men he was in trouble so much trouble that his pride wouldnt let him come to me for help so much trouble his pride led him down a dark dangerous path and i was part of that path he looked at her or cant you understand pride my aikido sensei didnt pride is a confucian sin chika said a dark and dangerous sin ten minutes later parker reappeared from the depths of the shanty he was carrying a professional polaroid camera he took their pictures head shots then disappeared silent and secretive behind his colourless rug when he reappeared it was with a pair of british passports handing them over to chika he said theyll pass muster dont you worry he rolled a toothpick around his mouth as he spoke his breath stank of catfood thanks chika said putting them away in an inside pocket parker was staring hard at wolf relax chika said i told you hes okay parker grumbled but his face softened as he heard a little cry and bending slightly he scooped up a fiveyearold girl who had hurtled towards him cathy he murmured scrunching her face into the crook of his neck then to her cries of please daddy he hung her by her ankles her giggles emanated from a mouth hidden by her long blonde hair parker shook her a little and she screeched in delighted mockfright why do you endure this hell wolf asked indicating the forest of stinking shanties because life is always preferable to death parker said he shook cathy a bit more as one would a shaker whose salt crystals have stuck together i see by the look on your face you dont believe me but i suppose you would have to be in my shoes in order to fully understand he pulled cathy right side up held her in his elbow as he pushed her hair back off her forehead her face was beet red she was a pretty girl and like many children her age she exuded a sense of life that was irresistible she stuck her tongue out at wolf and parker laughed seven years ago i was a hot investment broker in a hot field leveraged buyouts he said but then the proverbial shit hit the fax the bottom dropped out of the market and all of a sudden wall street was awash in jobs youd go in in the morning and your buddies who just months before had been so busy at wild trading theyd often stay at the office all night were doing the times crossword puzzle it was incredible for hours at a time the phones didnt ring the silence was eerie parker shifted the squirming cathy from one arm to another then of course we all became expendable bottom lines had to be slashed whole departments were disbanded within a day and there were no jobs to be found anywhere my overhead was wicked i sold my bmw my rolex watch then was forced to sell my coop at battery park city for a pathetically small amount the only good thing about being broke was i was no longer required to pay my exwife alimony but she sent her lawyers nosing around just to make sure i was really destitute when i asked her for a loan she laughed in my face for a while i took on odd jobs you know washing dishes waiting tables late night stuff that no one else wanted but after id been mugged a second time id had enough of being a citizen of new york city of being on the right side of the law waiting in the emergency room of a city hospital bleeding and in pain watching orderlies rushing gurneys past me filled with victims of gunshot wounds i wondered whether i was in hell this was not the new york city i had ever dreamed about when i was a kid growing up in chicago i realized id have to cross over the line i had been taught never to cross i came here because it was my only chance to survive and if there is one lesson i learned here its that deprivation toughens you human beings can survive just about anything if they set their mind to it thats something i never would have believed five years ago he looked down at the child he held and now i have cathy her mother died of a heroin overdose and her father was knifed to death for stealing a can of baked beans from a neighbours shanty he made an inarticulate sound you know its funny all the time i was married all the time i worked on the street handling clients accounts totalling millions of dollars i had no sense of what it really meant to be responsible bringing up cathy has taught me that so i often think its all been for the best he gave a selfdeprecating laugh of course thats how i have to think or else id go nuts no doubt about it but belief is a funny thing so fragile in some circumstances so absolutely unshakable in others he kissed cathy on the top of her head as he hugged her to him i suppose youll laugh but i read jung now books ive stolen from the public library which is okay since no one goes there nowadays anyway and think about how in the midst of this colossal social upheaval everything remains essentially the same theres a peculiar kind of comfort in that that im anxious to teach cathy he shrugged and who knows cop maybe its your life not mine thats the hell wolf listened to this astonishing history with an acute kind of attention he could see now that his father oddly like parker had been far too absorbed in the trappings of his profession for peter matheson being someone was allimportant it was why he had joined the texas rangers why he had tried to change them back into the heroes of yesteryear why he had felt compelled to leave his wife and son the mediocrity of his life for primitive australia where he had another chance to again be somebody become the hero he had dreamed of being and failed daddy shhh cathy parker said gently but firmly but i no more hanging now honey the girl was squirming in his arms and he put her down she immediately burst out crying and he picked her up again cathy what is it wolf could see that she was trembling her face had gone pale and she had begun to wail she was clearly terrified parker was turning her over trying to peer into her pinched face she feels hot he said but shes as dry as a bone and shes shaking like a leaf parker put her down wolf could hear the sudden terror in chikas voice but parker was too preoccupied with his daughters increasing distress to listen parker chika said urgently as she tried to prise his arms open without hurting the child put her down now shes sick parker insisted im not going to you dont understand whats happening the terrible danger in that instant the child started to glow her eyes opened wide the irises dilated and she began to moan in terror the first of the blue flames flickered at her fingertips then it snaked up along her arms cathy screamed as with a violent whoosh she burst into flames christ almighty parker shouted but still his disbelieving mind wouldnt let her go it was a moment akin to the aftermath of being shot the body goes down you feel nothing but your mind seems frozen in the last instant of normality before the unthinkable ripped asunder time and space making reality unreal suma had found them wolf could already smell the putrid scent of burning hair and flesh cathys face was distorted by fear and something else a horror he could hot name he had to do something to help the child he bent picked up the tattered remnant of a blanket but when he rose he found that he could not move he could scarcely breathe it was if a fist had clamped around his heart weakening his pulse as if he were on his deathbed his mind jumped back to the night on amandas rooftop his encounter with the shadowed force his inability to move or breathe the two moments seemed identical to him and cold sweat broke out at his hairline and he had to force himself back from the brink of terror as he felt again the sensation of helplessness as he was launched through the air crashing down into the skylight splintering consciousness he blinked the pain in his chest was a hard cold stone he could not abate with an unnatural calm chika said to parker tut cathy down let her go its the only chance to save her parker weeping uncontrollably at last did as she said his shirt had been burned off his chest and here and there smoke drifted from him his hands and forearms were black with human charcoal he did not care he was staring at his daughter who lay on the cobbles writhing and screaming as the flames continued to consume her now wolf felt a ripple something akin to the heat distortion one sees rising off a road in summer something cool was in the air and an instants remembered darkness like a momentary rift in the air between him and chika it seemed to him as if something unseen was breathing at his side the pain abated freeing him there was a vague sense of familiarity and he turned it might have been a trick of the muted dusty light but for an instant he could have sworn he saw chikas eyes change colour brightening until tiny crescents of luminous green rimmed her irises then he blinked stared into her dark depthless eyes and heard parker gasp he turned to see the flames dying on cathys stomach parker was kneeling beside her rocking and crooning wordlessly wolf tore out of the shanty his service revolver drawn wolf the terror in chikas voice made him shiver but he would not stop could not the image of the little girl bursting into flame her flesh crisping blood running like jelly would not let him rest darkness like the ripple of an eel in coral at the periphery of his vision and he veered to the right pushing aside wideeyed people running parallel to the elevated highway weaving in and out of the shanties past oily fires in wire mesh garbage cans leaping over cables snaked into open manhole covers tapping into the citys electricity and water supplies veering around yelloweyed dogs as feral as wolves he emerged from the city of the damned to find himself on cobbles stained and pitted by two hundred years of use he was in a district of old warehouses waiting like old pensioners for the wrecking ball to come calling reduce them again to the dust from whence they came a door small scarred creaking swung back and forth its broken padlock banging like a tympani in the wind wolf approached it cautiously side on using whenever he could the massive iron supports of the highway overhead took stock his left leg ached a little but he was not out of breath so far so good he reached the door pulled it open stepped quickly out of the shadowy winter light into red semidarkness the smells of nesting rats rotting sawdust the faint reek of fish old dried seeming to have emerged like a ghost from another era assaulted him he knew he had to be extremely careful now there was a power in here he was certain could kill him just as he was certain the force that had gripped him twice could have killed him why hadnt it he shuddered when he thought of cathy bursting into flame chika had said the power when it is manifested is like a shadow a living presence that can be sensed even perhaps seen by some in the corners of their vision and in this highlycharged state the power can do many things it can for instance project itself like an unseen fist causing inanimate objects to move it can cause pain and even death in others he shivered inwardly at a recognition that had about it the substance of deja vu wasnt this animate shadow what he had felt back there at parkers up on the rooftop something cool in the air an instants darkness like a momentary rift in the air and something unseen breathing at his side he stayed in the heaviest shadow until his eyes adjusted gradually his surroundings appeared he was in what appeared to be a front office small shabby in extreme disrepair he went through a glassfronted door at the back found himself facing the warehouse proper a massive space filthy with soot beyond which were apparently small storerooms for perishables windows so high up they appeared tiny allowed individual shafts of light to break through the walls and lower he could see bare bulbs shedding a ruddy light like pools of blood to his left a steel skeleton set of stairs ran steeply up to a narrow girdered catwalk that ran the length of the main room wolf went up this figuring to get a better view of anyone afoot down below he took the narrow stairs three at a time feeling a slight pulling along the length of the wound in his left leg but no pain at all in fact it felt good to stretch the muscles with such strenuous exercise he felt a sudden surge of adrenaline as he reached the top he had made more noise than he had cared to going up so he paused took off his shoes stuffed them in his jacket pockets he moved quickly and silently wondering with a tiny prickle of his scalp whether these people suma and his ilk could feel his presence even in utter darkness and silence in the middle of the catwalk he lay down presenting less of a target swept the warehouse with his eyes saw movement at the far end and was up racing along the catwalk to the end down a second flight of steep stairs this gave out onto a warren of small caged rooms filled though the main part of the warehouse had the appearance of being abandoned with metal boxes heavysided crates and sacks of cement wolf could see something moving furtively in the third caged room then as he took a step forward disappear into the shadows he opened the wire door noting in the red light a padlock that had been jemmied open a very narrow aisle down the centre of each cage led to the door to the following room wolf pushed forward his torso pressed sideways to present his right side first gun at the ready on either side the contents of the cages as dense and looming as the sheer rock face of an alp rose high over his head through a small gap as he passed into the second cage he could see electrical cables exposed like the veins in an emaciated wrist pulled through the wire walls of the cages bare light bulbs burned like miniature suns too old or remote to matter any longer the third cage presented itself and wolf went through the wire door he took one step at a time on the rough filthy concrete floor he looked up and like a diver at the bottom of a treacherous trench saw above him the beckoning warmth of distant sunlight he was halfway along the narrow aisle when an enormous pyramid of pvc pipes began to sigh and stir great creakings and groanings filled the air as if from long slumbering spirits wrathful at being awakened he tried to hurry on but the pipes moving like the hair of medusa flailed malignantly across his path like mythical serpents called up from the earth they loomed white and sightless over him he turned seeking to retreat but he was already hemmed in another phalanx of pipes herding him against the opposing pile of sacks of concrete now he was bent painfully backwards the pipes curling and slithering jammed against his chest and he twisted threw some of the sacks of concrete aside to make a niche for himself in the confined space he was aware of the labouring of his breath the accelerated beat of his heart the heat coming off him in waves the eerily questing pipes found him in his tiny niche battering him and he cast around for anything he could use as a wedge to impede even temporarily their movement but there was nothing a pipe appeared through the others darting violently its end slamming into his shoulder and he squirmed backwards thrashing heavy sacks this way and that this slowed the pipes momentarily but in the end what good would it do hed come up against the wall of the cage be crushed against that he couldnt even use his gun in these confined quarters in fact he was forced to slide the weapon into its holster at the small of his back use both hands to prise the sacks away from him moving further and further backwards while the pipes snaked and twined around him at last he had reached the cage wall the wire was far too thick for him even to contemplate getting through it he turned back the second vanguard of pipes was upon him pinning him to the steel mesh like the fingers of an ogres hand then they stopped he reached up tried to shove the top ones out of the way but he could not budge them that was when he felt the heat at first a soft glow taking the chill out of the air then a fire as fierce and unrelenting as an open oven he could smell smoke and saw to his horror that the pipe nearest his head was beginning to smoulder good god he thought suma is projecting his sight hell do to me what he did to cathy and arquillo he heard the first crackle of flame and then with a whoosh the flames shot through the pipe beside his right foot one after another the pipes began to catch until a circle roughly the size of his torso was burning medusas hair on fire and at its centre the ghost of an undulation like the wake of a giant eel suma summoning his psychic energy wolf could no longer doubt anything chika had said regarding the black blade society not that this knowledge would do him any good in a moment he would be nothing more than roasted meat unable to move wolf concentrated suma might be masked from him the majority of the time but apparently when he was projecting his sight wolf could pick him up he could feel the undulations emanating outward the psychic equivalent of the movement of a feeding fish and at the core of him he travelled those ripples inward until he arrived at the point where suma must be standing on the other side of the mares nest of pipes secreted in a crevice pouring out his poison the fire was crackling and roiling generating a heavy oily stench that clogged wolfs nose coated his throat at this rate there was a good chance he would asphyxiate before he burned to death he fixed his concentration feeling in the velvet darkness of the red light for substance until he was certain he knew just where suma was he snaked his hand behind him drew his gun but try as he might he could find no way to fire without fear of a ricochet taking his own head off he was certain he had suma pinpointed but without a weapon he was helpless he breathed tidally the sweat running freely on him as the flames writhed ever closer the air scorched the inside of his mouth and his eyes were tearing badly the buildup of carbon dioxide as the fire fed on oxygen was nearing the upper edge of his tolerance an abrupt inhalation of smoke set off a spasm of coughing he holstered his gun and his hand brushed against something he twisted his head saw the electrical cables affixed to the wire mesh he turned his shoulders took hold of the cables with both hands wrenched with all his might until he pulled them free of the wall then he doubled them fed them into the flames almost instantly the insulation melted and in a welter of sparks the cables were severed exposing the live wires within wolf bent to his task shoving the cables live end first through the interstices between the pipes he was pressed back against the cage wall as he did this in order to avoid the encroaching fire but he could already feel his hands too close and turned to pull his jacket sleeves down between his skin and the fire concentrate feel the ripples of movement the projection of force follow it backwards feed the cable in close now very close dropping into the darkness like a parachutist the darkness curling and bending breathing like a monstrous beast snuffling as if becoming abruptly aware of him no not him but the crackling energy carried in the maimed cable and now thrust it there in the centre where the darkness pooled like ink in a well sparks flashing behind the stacks of flaming pvc a screaming in his mind a primitive flash of rage a hot jolt as if he himself had touched the electricity then he had disengaged his mind saw the flames dying down and then the heavy rain falling released by the intense heat activating the automatic sprinkler system running along the ceiling of the warehouse wolf reached out swung a pipe movable now that the psychic energy was gone away from him then another and another the water in his eyes drenching him stifling the thick smoke running in ashy streams along the concrete floor at last he climbed through a space he had made in the ruined pyramid of pipes made his way to the opposite side he had expected to find sumas body lying on the floor but there was nothing no not nothing after all he bent down picked up what appeared to be some kind of miniature blade he wiped the black ash off its flank turned it over gleaming in his palm water spinning off it then he put it into his pocket slipped his shoes on and made his way back to the open door outside he took several deep breaths coughed again clearing his lungs he felt lightheaded and bent over breathe he ordered himself breathe oh but christ that had been close he stood up went over to sit on one of the massive iron tieups spaced along the rotting timbers of the docks he licked his lips a drop of sweat dissolving on his tongue the young wolf tastes the salt of his own sweat he is not asleep although his mind wiping itself clean protecting itself will be convinced that it slept through this he is looking through the flap of white bows tepee he sees the profile of his grandfathers face and above it the ladder he has made from hemp sinew and white bows handmade arrows he sees his mother on her haunches at white bows side her hand is on his arm and it seems clear that she is speaking to him though it is possible that she is reciting a prayer or incantation perhaps she is holding the sum of his dreams in her lap behind him he can hear the slight stirring of the assembled massed on the plain the sun has almost set not even a whisper of wind stirs the dry grasses above the sky is a shade of blue so pellucid it brings tears to the eyes then one last shaft of bloodred sunlight enters the tepee and for a moment white bows skin is as dark and ruddy as it ever was in his youth as wolf watches the sun is submerged by the mountaintops and the light turns from bloodred to opalescent as it slips away the waxy pallor returns to white bows face wolf begins to tremble and in his mind he hears a reverberation the sound one hears when the arrow is loosed and the tension comes off the bowstring now this is the strange part the moment which wolfs mind will be unwilling to remember the instant brought abruptly to the surface by his brush with a form of death familiar to his unconscious time seems to stand still the birds have ceased to sing the crickets to chirp the flies to buzz the darkness to fall in this moment nothing moves and yet wolfs spirit is drawn out of his body as if by an undertow he flies in the manner described to him by his mother in the metaphysical world of his shaman grandfather inside the tepee he sees his mother caught between breaths her heart stilled and waiting again in this magical interstice to pump once again in this incorporeal state he sees his grandfather for what he really is a skeleton topped by a grinning skull everything else is gone and wolf knows he is dead he is so terrified that for a moment he believes that he himself will die and he tries to turn away to run from the interior but he cannot like a fly caught in a spiderweb he is stranded here on the shore of a strange and alien land then he hears in his mind his grandfathers voice bidding him to act he takes up his grandfathers magnificent bow and placing one last arrow to it raises it towards the hole in the tepee he draws the bow back to its limit and at that moment sees white bow strong and robust climbing the ladderbridge he has made for him his grandfather does not look at him he is intent on his climb which is dangerous because of the sharpness of the arrowheads at the top of the ladder he raises his right arm hand outwards and wolf looses the arrow up up up it shoots and as it reaches white bow he reaches out grabs the shaft and is pulled upwards with it wolf moves so that he is directly beneath the hole into the indigo sky his grandfather soars like the hawk of his story rising higher and higher until he disappears into the vault of heaven at that instant the great bow vanishes and wolf hears in his mind his grandfathers voice strait is the bridge and narrow is the path that leads to life and few are those that travel it wolf he blinked looked up into chikas concerned face are you all right he wondered why she was asking him that until he realized he was shaking and crying he thought of white bow a man who had so much wanted his grandson to follow the metaphysical path he had taken who had looked into his grandsons eyes and had seen the spark of the power that resided in him you were able to make the journey not because of me but because of what dwells within you white bow had told him learn what is inside you wolf you will have to use it one day so he had known what was to come had seen this future and wolf had known this but that knowledge was too much for his young mind to hold too frightening to contemplate so it had turned itself off convincing him that he had fallen asleep at the moment of his grandfathers death that was stupid to go after suma like that chika said on your own without me he might have killed you wolf stared at her as if he had not heard a word she had said the chills were gone shaken off like the aftermath of a nightmare he rose feeling the blood rushing through him and more so much more i understand he said at last understand what why youre here why the black blade society wants to track me down everything nine washington tokyo whenever thornburg conrad iii went to the green branches clinic on the outskirts of arlington virginia he took his wife tiffany with him green branches was the one place that evoked in thornburg a sense of time and purpose it had become the focus of what remained of his life and it was this awareness of fragments slipping inexorably through his fingers that lent a note of urgency to his visits these occurred three times a week and were a matter of utmost secrecy although had anyone been witness to the trips they would naturally have assumed that thornburg at his advanced age and with his active lifestyle required a good deal of electronic monitoring they would not in one sense be far wrong however what the patient was being monitored for was not arteriosclerosis chronic high blood pressure gout oedema or any of the other myriad ills which routinely plagued the elderly when the researchers ran the ekg or eeg what they were looking for were not signs of advancing age but markers that would indicate just the opposite the fact was that thornburg owned the green branches clinic he had bought it some fifteen years ago when it had been an underfunded cancer research centre struggling along on meagre handouts from the federal government and any other agency it could convince to cough up capital unfortunately its director was not as able a politician as he perhaps needed to be and the clinic fell on hard times when thornburg bought it he personally reviewed the dossiers of every researcher and technician employed there he decided who should stay and who should go then he set about hiring the people most skilled in the biotech sciences such as endocrinology gerontology and genetics to create a full complement of research physicians now green branches had but one aim to extend the lifespan of thornburg conrad iii to that end thornburg spared no expense but he was no patsy for every harebrained scheme for eternal youth he was exceedingly knowledgeable in all the biotech sciences and he carefully weeded the wheat from the chaff the result being that the team he had put together at green branches was on the cutting edge of the dawning field of biolife sciences for a time the team had been extremely excited about their preliminary findings regarding the laboratorysynthesized human growth hormone insulinlike growth factor this recombinant complex protein seemed to restore much of the muscle tone and organ health to elderly people that age had begun to seriously deteriorate initially it appeared that a mere six months treatment with the synthetic hormone could actually turn back the subjects inner clock an astounding twenty years when the side effects began to emerge heart attacks diabetes kidney failure even a bizarre and disfiguring enlargement of the subjects hands and face the green branches team altered the way in which they manufactured the insulinlike growth factor all that did was delay the advent of the side effects now as thornburg entered the cool dim greenglass and marble interior of the clinic he smelled again the odour of death the sweetsickly scent was allpervasive cloying making the air as heavy as that of an industrial city the place stank of the battlefield or the abattoir thornburg saw tiffanys perfect nostrils flare her perfect breasts rise sharply as she inhaled i had a dream about this place last night she said do you know i always dream about it the night before we come what do you think that means im sure i have no idea thornburg said nodding to the uniformed guards who sat behind a high intimidating blackwood podium they knew him by sight not only because he came here often but because he had hired them as he had done with every employee of the clinic what was the dream i was naked tiffany said im always naked when i dream of this place two men in white coats injected me with a serum and pretty soon i had turned into a frog a green frog croaking on a huge lilypad is that it the extreme lefthand elevator doors opened automatically to their presence and thornburg taking tiffanys arm guided her into the elevator the doors closed and without thornburg having to press a button the elevator descended the equivalent of three storeys into the bedrock of virginia no tiffany said you were there too a little pinkskinned bandylegged boy i saw you and my tongue came out you know the long thin kind frogs have and i caught a mosquito and ate it it was full of blood and i knew it had just bitten you that i was swallowing your blood and i wondered whether that made me a carnivore tiffany was a devout vegetarian it wasnt a very pleasant dream but then my dreams of this place never are im sorry thornburg said patting her perfect hand but this will be over before you know it he smiled as a whitesmocked individual came into view ah dr shepherd on time as always dr shepherd laughed she was a willowy woman with too much frosted hair and too little makeup her pale eyes behind her stylish glasses had the factobsessed look of the clinician it appeared she had been born observant now mr conrad you know security alerts us the moment you pull up were always prepared for you and our patient she turned to thornburgs wife and how are we feeling today tiffany fine i guess no abdominal pains chest palpitations constipation youre urinating normally just like always excellent dr shepherd put her arm around tiffany conrad lets just go in here and take a good long look at you okay i wont turn into a frog or anything tiffany said i dreamed i was a frog and swallowed blood human blood i wouldnt worry about any of that dr shepherd said all it means is that youre still adjusting to the diet weve put you on you used to eat quite a bit of meat you know i did but thats impossible i cant stand meat of any kind dr shepherd looked over her shoulder at thornburg as she settled tiffany on a whitepapercoated examining table take off your clothes for me tiffany yes doctor tiffany did as she was told removing one article of clothing at a time folding each one neatly until they made a pile on a side chair then without being prompted she lay down on the table dr shepherd took a pinch of the flesh of her inner thigh between thumb and forefinger rolled it gently back and forth excellent colour tone the lack of fat is impressive she opened a manilabound file began making notes with a ballpoint pen as she continued her thorough examination she drew blood labelled three test tubes sealed them put them in a metal rack did some more work that thornburg was not familiar with when she was done she smiled warmly at tiffany said softly to thornburg may i see you outside dr shepherd led him wordlessly across the corridor pushed open a door into one of three dozen labs within the green branches complex she went over to a bank of sophisticated computers activated a program and thornburg saw a sequence of complex coloured patterns appear on the terminal screen they began to move ever so slowly as if he were looking at the real thing instead of an incredibly complex computergenerated model she turned to him we have been concerned with anaemia because of her low redblood count but i can see shes recovering from that nicely thornburgs business was reading people so he knew that there was more but that dr shepherd was reluctant to go on lets have it all doctor im not here to be coddled or lied to of course not she nodded of late your wifes whitecell count has been somewhat elevated by itself thats not normally a cause for undue concern did all doctors have to qualify every statement they made he wondered in fact were hoping thats evidence only of a mild infection but you dont know for certain dr shepherds head came up no mr conrad we do not you must understand that this is ah virgin territory for all of us and considering the end results of the previous experi thornburg took a step towards her and you must understand that time is of the essence yes i fully understand he snorted derisively spare me the medical palliatives so much poppycock doctor it has long been my desire to discover an elixir that will work on me like the wine in the holy grail and up to now what have we found just like in legend the wine that gives life also takes it dead end he thought of tiffany whose perfect sundarkened skin shimmered beneath a laminate of lotion still i havent given up at my age a man must have his magnificent obsession he looked shrewdly at dr shepherd i may be old but im not demented youd be wise to remember that yes sir she took a deep breath turned back to the computer screen id like to direct your attention to this model thornburg knew more or less what he was looking at in fact he had personally ordered the green branches staff to begin work on rational drug design this meant instead of going through the trial and error of laboratory breeding to create a new drug you first ascertained the molecular structure of the disease or problem within the body you needed to attack then you went to a speciallydesigned computer that recreated this structure complete with all its idiosyncrasies so that you could design a specific inhibitor which would bind with the problem molecule rendering it harmless in this instance the green branches researchers needed to create a substance that would have a specific effect on the human body in a sense they were lucky in having access to insulinlike growth factor since even the most powerful electron microscope was unable to see small enough to reveal molecular structure the researchers had discovered a method to grow the hormone in crystalline form by bombarding it with concentrated xrays they were able to manufacture a diffracted image of the molecular structure which was fed into the computer what they found astounded them the hormone appeared to contain spaces at set intervals that the scientists were convinced had once contained another as yet unknown element in other words they believed that the insulinlike growth factor taken from a selection of human beings was incomplete somehow over the passage of time the hormone had changed just as man himself had their task was to find the missing piece here is a representation of the enzyme package we felt had the most potential and which we have been using on your wife dr shepherds fingers flew over the keypad and thornburg saw a yellow lozenge seem to dock in one of the spaces in the purple red and cyan network of the insulinlike growth factor hormone you see a perfect fit dr shepherd said and the enzyme package took to the hormone as if magnetized she stood up and in a sense its working we know its working and so do you because youve seen the very dramatic changes in your wife she jammed her hands in her pockets and sighed unfortunately we believe weve come back to the same problem that has been plaguing us from the first enzyme package that gave us hope this drug like all the rest has a halflife that is its efficacy is breaking down at a constant rate and as it does so we believe it may be causing irreversible side effects the elevated white count dr shepherd looked at him levelly well have to monitor tiffany daily so i think it best if she stayed with us now thornburg watched the computer model of their newest and best failure revolve slowly on the screen as if it were alive water water everywhere he thought and not a drop to drink damn getting old he turned away so that she would not see the incipient tears standing in the corners of his eyes damn time he thought damn everything when he turned back to dr shepherd he said dont you physicians know how to talk in absolutes only when it comes to death dr shepherd said in the vast grey area between life and death we have only our humancreated tests to go by like sailing fullout in the fog isnt it a bit she admitted but if you repeat that ill deny i ever said it for sure id be drummed out of the ama as a heretic she gave him a bitter smile were doing the best we can mr conrad i mean that no bullshit yes i know he said wearily he liked her she was smart and a straightshooter i want to go back to her now surely just as soon as we get xrays and some blood from you thornburg nodded you know dr shepherd said squeezing his arm you have regained the muscle tone of a wellconditioned fortyfiveyearold man and no side effects nothing save the benign polyps weve taken from your colon dr shepherd admitted of course were using a further derivative of the serum your wife is taking but i am thinking that perhaps the difference in your blood has had an effect you mean that shes a and im opositive no your blood contains some subtle variations i can only attribute to your japanese ancestry doctor my greatgrandmother may and i say may advisedly have had some japanese blood in her lets not jump to conclusions and for christs sake lets not be thinking of writing a paper on the subject its not something id like made public even my children have no idea dr shepherd nodded i understand completely mr conrad later staring at his wife lying naked and serene on the pure white table he thought that she was as perfect as a painting or a dream he had already forgotten just how old she really was and he thanked god for sparing him the horror of remembering would you prefer a boy the young japanese woman said shoto wakare laughed he held her beautiful face in his hands i could make you up like a boy and you would be more exquisite more perfect than any boy you could procure for me he kissed one temple then the other with such tenderness that even her heart beat a little faster besides he wouldnt have your mind the dim room smelled of its eternal habitues beer and cigarette smoke wakare had been coming to this akachochin for many years it lay crouched within the maze of tokyos shitamachi which in other less sprawling cities would be translated as downtown but here meant that area where the geographical stood metaphor for the social the low end of town it was an anonymous place one of ten thousand such latenight bars scattered throughout the metropolis engaged in the demimonde of mizushobai the water trade prostitution it was the japanese way that men required outlets for the animal drives stifled by the layers of custom honour and debt at the akachochin the japanese male could let his hair down get drunk weep laugh raucously fornicate in whatever peculiar manner his passions dictated all without fear of losing face or retribution and emerge refreshed and ready once again to armour himself in societys constraints the young woman whose name was mita though that had been the name given her when she had come to work in the mizushobai held wakare in her arms she stroked his forehead with a tenderness born of practice if it was artifice this question might cause a fierce debate among even the most knowledgeable ethnologists it was of a kind indistinguishable from reality mita had what was known among japanese as yasashisa that is a maternal sweetness most males longed for because such physical affection was not practised this was a highly prized gift of course she and wakare made love but their meetings encompassed much more than that after all he could have gone almost anywhere to get laid what mita provided him was far more complete and satisfying wakare sighed relaxing in her arms he had already consumed six carafes of sake a prodigious amount even for him but his need was great for liberation from his pressurefilled world why is it he said now that there is no justice in the world i wonder whether we have all gone mad i know if i decide its true i will have the true reason why mishima committed hara kiri he saw this day coming and he could not face the shame mishima could not let go of the old ways mita said stroking his brow in slow rhythmic strokes youre wrong wakare said mishima understood that the old ways were already dead what he could not abide was that what he sought to resurrect were nothing more than ghosts mita was used to these philosophical ruminations this is the injustice you mean no no wakare said licking his lips as if he desired nothing more than another six carafes of sake i was speaking of something far more personal i have been called to betray a friend my best friend actually and i must do it giri i owe a debt to the person who asked this favour it is only when life is hard that it becomes meaningful mita said wakare glanced up at her i wonder whether you really believe that she nodded this is my life i must believe it or i have nothing wakare grunted settled back in her lap his eyes closed as she stroked him if only i could work on my friends brotherinlaw instead of him he mused now that would present no problem hiroto is a real bastard greedy venal envious of yujis alltoovisible success he sighed on the other hand hiroto has no honour so corrupting him wouldnt be much fun tell me will there be honour in betraying your friend yuji mita asked wakare said nothing but mita who knew him well could not ignore the ghost of a smile on his lips later after he had exhausted himself upon her and she had lovingly bathed him and sent him stumbling home in a stupor of bliss and alcohol she returned to her room did you hear or see anything useful she asked the japanese woman who stood waiting for her she was very beautiful and seemingly so young that mita youthful as she was could have been her mother many things evan said she passed a thick envelope filled with yen into mitas waiting hand but i think the most useful piece came from your clients smile ham was sitting at a restaurant on columbia road in the adams morgan district he was looking wistfully at the tables outside on the sidewalk section in summer they would be shaded from the strong sun by gailystriped umbrellas and would have about themthat indefinable air of nonchalancecumindifference exhibited by any openair cafe in paris ham was sipping coffee it was nearing lunchtime and the tables were beginning to fill up with fashionable ladies taking a breather from shopping he spied marion starr st james she wore a sausage miniskirt in a rich honey colour a wide black belt and an amber silk blouse on her feet were black highheel ankle boots her coat was slung nonchalantly over one shoulder every head in the restaurant turned the males in appreciation and the females in envy as she passed by ham felt a surge of wild delight that she was here to be with him just before she sat down ham saw a woman he knew but couldnt place sitting at a table at the other end of the cafe she was a pretty blonde slim and stylish and she was watching marion slide into the chair opposite him with the intensity of a mongoose studying a cobra who the hell was she he asked himself then he smelled marions perfume was bathed in her smile and she took up all his attention right on time he said i like that she gave a mock pout you left me so early i rolled over and tore the sheets into ribbons really really i like how you americans say that word she looked at him in that melting way of hers i hugged your pillow and wished it was you when she was like this she made his mouth water what did you think about marion looked up at the waiter gave him her drink order then she looked back at ham i dreamt of you doing all the delicious sinful things to me i lacked the courage to ask you to do last night he laughed you dont seem to me the kind of woman to lack the courage to ask anything its a mask she confessed we all wear masks because like actors under intense scrutiny were all more comfortable moving within a sphere where those around us cant see what or who we really are that sounds vaguely spooky ham said like something mata hari would have said in a way were all spies arent we ham we like nothing better than to hide behind our own masks while we probe each others weaknesses find a way through the other masks around us its human nature its what we both did last night on board your boat no dont deny it youll get this lunch off on the wrong foot she put her forefinger against his lips youre not a man used to telling the truth are you she smiled what was little boy hampton conrad like i wonder maybe i should talk to your parents what are you writing my obit my mothers dead and believe me youd get nothing out of my father marions campari and soda came and she took some of the bright red liquid into her mouth god what got under your skin she pushed the drink away from her maybe we should reconvene this lunch when youre in a better mood ham pressed her glass into her hand dont go sometimes my business gives me a royal headache you mean youre like everyone else ham saw how hard her face got when she was angry he could almost feel her vibrating i took out my business problems on you no she said firmly thats not it at all okay youre right im a very private person i dont like it when someone starts prying into my life oh ham i only wanted her eyes dropped and when she looked at him again he melted the truth is i didnt rip the sheets though i wanted to i was too scared of what of you peering behind my mask and not liking what you saw there dont be idiotic i loved everything i saw last night and felt well its happened before marion said softly i mean in many ways my father was an extraordinary man a true patriot really and let me tell you there arent many of those left but the truth is he was a shit to me and my mother hed come home when he was home drunk as a lord hed try to lay her and of course couldnt he was so full of irish whiskey you could smell him coming a block away hed take it out on her as if she had anything to do with his impotence hed beat her i guess because it made him more of a man in his own eyes and because he was so full of hate he hated the rich the protestants and of course all the english she looked down at her capable hands on the tabletop it took me a long time before i got my head on straight when it came to men i drove a lot of them away just with my tough manner and my hard arguments she shrugged sometimes still i think i need an attitude adjustment you dont need anything ham said take it from me she smiled took a sip of her campari and soda ham said after a long silence my parents never got along either my father treated my mother like another lamp or vase in his house it took me a long time to work this out about them that they often led separate lives its difficult for a child to grow up with the knowledge his parents didnt much like each other didnt you take sides of course i wanted to ham said my mother was always the underdog so it was natural for me to try and help her but then there was my father he was in those days how shall i put it so imposing like moses come down from the mountains the invisible tablets my father carried was the law there was no gainsaying it he looked off into the distance i guess the truth is i needed his approval too much for me to come to my mothers defence in a sense i betrayed her just as my father did but since that betrayal made me more like him i could regret it without ever changing how i acted she leaned over impulsively and kissed him hard on the lips there were no hard edges to her face now darling ham she said youre so unlike the other men in my life she touched him when you kiss me it tastes so sweet ham who was both appalled and filled with relief that he had spilled out what had been inside him for so long stared into her eyes and felt lost in their depths marion pushed her glass away do you think youre in the mood to discuss something scrumptiously sinful depends what it is something i daydreamed about this morning while i was hugging my pillow and thinking sinful thoughts about you she turned as the waiter put menus down im not hungry she said handing him back the menu have a salad at least ham said but when she shook her head he shrugged ordered two bacon cheeseburgers a combo order of fries and onion rings a sixpack of cokes and bring a wine cooler for the cokes he told the waiter i hope you dont expect me to eat any of that marion said if i did i would have ordered more they chatted about nothing in particular until the food came as soon as she saw ham settle into his eat mode she began heres my idea it involves the company i work for extant exports the owners are a pair of shits fat greasy cousins always at each others throats what they pay me is pathetic but they look the other way as far as my expense account is concerned what the hell its a writeoff for them anyway but this morning i got to dreaming about doing something id been thinking about for some time grabbing a piece of the action doesnt sound like these bosses of yours will go for it ham said through a wedge of bacon cheeseburger of course they wont marion said thats why im not going to tell them what were going to expropriate shipments ham almost choked on a piece of toasted bun whats this we bit you and me marion said i figure i need a partner in this and with your military connections im sure wed forget it what do you mean just what i said youre going to steal shipments from your company and you want me to go in with you youre nuts i forgive you for saying that she watched him for a moment you know you look like a little boy when youre eating youre making me hungry help yourself he said i wasnt talking about food marion said but picked up a goldenbrown onion ring between two orangered nails dont you even want to know what extant exports transships not really its dangerous cargo there are losses all the time our prices take them into consideration its not a big deal the losses im sure youre mistaken ham said extants insurers will investigate extants cargo cant be insured and as ham put his burger back on his plate she laughed what an expression ham my god you do look most avid now what exactly are we talking about here wipe your mouth darling marion said all that ketchup makes you look like youre bleeding she nodded as he dabbed at his mouth are you prepared for another peek behind the mask it doesnt seem as if im ever prepared for you ham thought he realized that this was precisely why he found her so utterly alluring she was not like any of his other women she was not like anyone he had ever met before he nodded marion saidextants business is in procuring and transshipping exocets mirages mavericks mxs bonhohm supercannons you name it in hightech weaponry and for a price they can get it coups revolutions guerrilla warfare all around the globe are their meat who wouldnt want to rip them off interested hams mind was busy ticking over the possibilities of this unexpected windfall but he glanced at his watch and knew that jason yoshida would be here any minute when yoshida had contacted him hed said the meet couldnt wait okay he said but lets continue this discussion in a more secure venue ill pick you up after work and youll give me all the details then great marion said getting up she leaned over kissed him hard on the lips wrapped herself in her coat ham was watching yoshida slip between the tables on his way yoshida brushed past marion who was heading towards the entrance yoshida slipped into a seat ordered a vanilla coke great legs yoshida said giving marion a quick glance he seemed agitated and the mood seemed infectious in truth ham was angry at having his teteatte with marion interrupted ham grunted said hunching over as he lowered his voice as long as youre here i want you to deliver further instructions to our friend shoto wakare he paused while the coke was served hes proved very useful to us so far i must say yosh your contacts in tokyo have been invaluable to me youre too kind ham smiled you can get away with more of that irony than most yosh i guess its that deadpan face of yours you could be a standup comedian thanks but ive already found my metier havent you though ham took a long pull at his coffee ogled a couple of svelte blondes as they passed by their winter coats swinging open ive got some potentially bad news yoshida said bad news is just what we dont need ham said we have very little time to stop the black blade society the senate international trade committee bill that will effectively cut us off economically from japan is being introduced this week the latest word is its going to get a helluva bipartisan boost when it comes onto the floor enough to override a presidential veto meanwhile opposition to the bill is eroding because the string of supposedly accidental deaths of key senators is continuing meanwhile speaking of matheson yoshida handed ham a fax my father ham said ignoring the fax for a moment is washington and we both know what makes washington run networks of contacts seniority the illusion of power known collectively as bullshit running the contact networks means being born into the right family going to the right schools seniority means having survived here without having been shit on by anyone of note the illusion of power means the gift of turning a neat phrase in the right ear so it gets quoted the next day in the right newspaper column and believe me yosh my father is the master of all these things youre talking about the dearly departed past yoshida said your father got us hooked into matheson he pointed to the coded fax and matheson has just become a major liability what a japanese woman came to see him and he went off with her and do you know who she is that artist he was panting after wakare has identified her as a member of nishitsus black blade society yoshida shook his head maybe thats infiltration maybe not thing is hes wanted for questioning in the murder of one of his men last week matheson was seen duking it out with this guy now he turns up with two bullets from mathesons gun in the back of his head good god i warned you about this i know yosh but i cant believe matheson would off his own man hes not that stupid dont you see it doesnt matter mathesons become a danger to us because the situation is no longer contained forget about whether matheson is guilty or innocent can you imagine the media attention this is going to cause and if hes gone over to the enemy you sure as hell better think up something convincing for your old man because the minute you tell him whats happened hes going to hit the roof youre right of course youve been right all along ham could see the relief on yoshidas face what about your father yosh asked dont worry ill handle him ham said with a good deal more confidence than he felt in truth he did not know how to broach the subject with his father and decided that for now at least the best course of action was to say nothing he thought about matheson and the japanese woman together the fax disappeared into his clenched fist damn it its obvious now we should have cut matheson loose from the time someone put him through the skylight but now he knows too much if he decides to spill his guts to the media were safe yoshida said he knows only shipley and shipley is an easy man to have disappear ham was shaking his head doesnt matter matheson knows too much about our plan if the japanese government gets wind of it now were finished flushed down the toilet theyll take the president apart piece by piece and let the world condemn us it will be the last major slab of foundation the black blade society needs at home thornburg will lose every ounce of credibility he has even he cant stand up to the president and then there will be nothing left to stop the black blade society ham pushed his coffee cup away the acid was burning his stomach or maybe it was the bad news i dont care if matheson is with the devil himself hes got to surface sometime and when he does i want him put on ice for the duration of our mission i dont care what it takes just do it yosh those are your new orders ten tokyo new york washington minako moved from slumber to wakefulness in the same unconscious process with which others put one foot in front of another there was no period of transition no gentle thoughtless state prior to full consciousness she opened her eyes and knew all was not as it should be she rose pulled on her robe and went through the doorway of the bedroom she listened hearing the eerie breath like a faraway engine of makura na hiruma she tried to steel herself but she was aware that this was one of those times when she profoundly regretted having summoned her sight for she knew how it would end here and her heart was already constricted with grief for she was gripped now by the same agony her grandmother had lived with all her life there were times like this when knowing the future was a kind of hell she could never have imagined that day long ago when she had confronted the fox and had said so unknowingly i want to see as far as i can because there were times as now when one was prohibited from altering what was about to happen all her life she had manipulated people and events and that was all right because the future she saw dictated that this was her karma but her life had also held terrible moments that she had seen at such an early age and which she had kept encysted within her breast like frozen tears until the moment of their occurrence by which time their terrible nature almost seemed like dйjа vu so many times had she involuntarily replayed them in her mind the deaths she had caused in the service of the black blade society the horrible illness of her daughter kazuki brought on by her inability to access her makura na hiruma now her power was quite literally eating her alive the consequences of her liaison with hanas father yujis creation of the being he called the oracle which she had seen would herald the end of the old order the ancient enmities and part and parcel of that her beloved hanas flight from a reality she could no longer contain nor tolerate and last of all the coming of what even she with all her power could not see that future but these events like a string of malevolent pearls she was bound for ever to keep around her neck burned her like a neverending fire a reminder of her impending damnation because her very first look into the future revealed to her that in a very real way she was to be the architect of her own destruction minako saw the shadow now or more accurately recognized it for what it was what it must be and like all such horrors it seemed pulled from her own mind where she had replayed this scene so many times in an agony of frustration and grief so that it was brought home to her in crushing fashion that she would never be used to her sight that no matter how she was gifted she still existed within a framework though she had come to see it as a prison from which there could be no escape it was so difficult she thought loving your children when everything they would do or that would happen to them was thrown into your face at once like a torrent threatening to drown you in a tide of hate fear rage pain love frustration inevitably visits with her children exhausted her utterly especially yuji her restless genius of a son whom she had sworn to protect from her secret life part of minako could stand apart and marvel at the infinitely complex plan that had been formed by no human mind perhaps by no mind at all as humans could conceive of it but another more empathetic part wanted to beat at the bars of her prison to escape the world as she had shaped it to escape her karma to exit even time and space she longed now only to be free as she had come to see kabuto had longed to be free i can see now what happened how i started to turn away from that dark place inside me wolf said they were in chikas vette the windows up and the heat on still he was shivering he had told her about his encounter with suma in the warehouse my grandfather was a shaman and his dream was for me to follow on his own path wolf continued his hands were around a cardboard cup of steaming hot coffee on the floor at his feet was the crumpled paper in which chika had brought him a tripledecker sandwich from a deli all meat she had said you need the protein i always thought my father hated the old man and that i was suspended between them but now i see i didnt give my father enough credit he saw in me what my grandfather had both of them stepped away from exploiting it they both wanted me to find my own destiny and now chika said it has overtaken you he nodded shivering still it will take some getting used to he turned to her what did you call it this dark sight makura na hiruma the darkness at noon its well named wolf closed his eyes i have crossed some black spaces i have flown i understand chika said so gently that he felt tears come to his eyes i want to know more about makura na hiruma he said for one thing our metabolism is different than the norm she inclined her head when was the last time you looked critically at yourself in the mirror do you look as old as your contemporaries i dont know it never occurred to his brow furrowed i merely assumed i was youthfullooking genes genes yes chika said just as i can reach out with my mind and slow anothers heartbeat or raise it until they burst into flame those with makura na hiruma are able to alter their own metabolism to slow down the process of ageing how long wolf was wondering how old white bow had been when he had died chika shrugged so many variables the power is different in each individual so too the metabolic rates but perhaps two hundred fifty years would not be inaccurate as a guideline my god some of us can see the future although that sight can be erratic for instance it appears as if at any given moment there are many futures and a future seen may not in fact come to pass as you yourself know we are gifted empaths if not true telepaths but again that power varies from individual to individual there are very few norms when it comes to the darkness at noon after four centuries of our history we are still very much ignorant of the workings of our sight he handed her his coffee and she took some handed it back he watched the people hurrying by oblivious in their haste of the world around them he was still adjusting to himself in this light seeing himself and suma as cut from the same cloth different from all these others he was just beginning to feel the shaman inside him that dark familiar breathing its hot breath upon the nape of his neck wolf there is something i must tell you makura na hiruma can so easily seduce us into believing that we are more powerful than we are that we are masters of time and space she wrapped her long fingers briefly around his arm this is a dangerous delusion and i can tell you that more than one of us with the gift has succumbed to the temptation to believe that we are gods for better or worse it is makura na hiruma that has shaped us but the darkness at the core of our minds can be an insidious thing a power that is able to deform us without our ever knowing it no mirror can reveal the change because our vision forces us to look beyond the twodimensional mirror but in so doing it is possible to lose a part of ourselves this is the other side of makura na hiruma which feeds on our arrogance our ambition our hubris it is what my mother feared for all her children at length he said youve come for me because of my makura na hiruma she nodded and the black blade society as well you are a threat to them but not apparently to you wolf i told you of the cruelty of the toshin kuro kosai and now you have had a chance to see it for yourself we can no longer stand by and allow the black blade society to keep to the course its leaders have chosen for it then you want my help he said but why didnt you just come out and tell me that in the first place now that you are living life during wartime do you think you would have believed me if i had tried to describe our world to you she had a point he thought still he said were going to need some reinforcements lets cruise i need a phone chika put a hand on his arm what are you going to do weve got to get out of the city now that we have passports you still dont understand wolf said squire richards was one of my men he was murdered and now im being burned for it but suma im responsible for him chika i owe him giri neh she nodded her head fired up the engine hai at th street she pulled the vette over and he slogged across the avenue one out of the six public phones was working the others either vandalized or out of order he dug change out of his pocket put in a quarter dialled shipleys number then fed the machine the amount it asked for shipley answered after eleven rings and wolf wondered where this number was im in new york city he said into the receiver and im in trouble youre one of us now youll get all the support you need shipley said whats the situation ive made contact personal contact with suma whats your status i didnt get him but he didnt get me either wolf took a breath he still stank of fire and the right sleeve of his jacket was singed but it was very damn close either way you look at it he told shipley about the frame but he did not tell him about chika i need to get the commissioner to hear my side of it he concluded but youve got to give me some help im not going to be much use to you as a fugitive i agree but given the volatile situation with breathard i dont want you showing up at one police plaza let me think a minute give me an hour to pull some strings then get over to the commissioners home ill make sure hes there thanks wolf said thinking of the silent corridors of power shipley trod there by the mere sound of his voice to invoke djinns of vigilance and protection he was extremely grateful for the juice mysterious and deadly only a federal spook could provide its not going to work the oracle said shhh hana her beautiful mysterious face rapt had her eyes closed she was hooked by wires and optical cables to the oracle you do not have the right dna pattern the oracle persisted how can you know that this quickly yuji said pacing back and forth in front of his digital readouts as nervously as an expectant father trust me the oracle said yuji wanted to laugh give me a hint he said i have scanned hanasans dna pattern okay yuji said but you cant yet know i am proceeding with all the appropriate tests the oracle said but i know what i know how intuition the oracle said pardon me yuji stopped his pacing stared fixedly at the matteblack object are you having trouble hearing me yuji ran a hand through his hair i hear you just fine but youre not making sense you cannot have intuition i know what i know the oracle repeated all of the dnaaltering procedures are in place save one the dysfunctional growth factor the substance that will keep the genekeys that cause cancers and other lethal disorders from turning on during the process of dnaalteration find it yuji said i have been attempting to do that ever since i received notice of my failure with moravia the oracle said but i am not god i cannot so easily recreate life there must be a way yuji said and hana opened her eyes we are on the right path yujisan i can see a hint of what is required in hana but it is not complete hana is the wrong subject well just have to find the right subject yuji said starting to unhook hana no she said dont yuji looked at her i dont want to leave him just yet i wish you wouldnt personify the oracle like that yuji said why not its appropriate besides i like it its getting to be more and more like you yuji said appalled hes not a thing yujisan hana said and i like his world its not bounded by flesh and blood in his world i can see all the potential that has been missing for me for the oracle there is nothing but the infinity of metaphysics the sciences as we know them are limited by our notions of the temporal but the oracle lives beyond time and space neither exists for him he is free the way humans can never be the way i have always dreamed of being thats enough yuji said shutting down his monitors you belong in the real world i can appreciate what the oracle might mean to no yuji you can never understand what it has meant for me to be trapped in this body when my mind can see beyond but not travel there my makura na hiruma opened a door for me a door to a wondrous universe but this flesh and blood has acted like chains to bind me to the doorframe always looking longingly at what i could not have you cannot understand the agony and frustration i have felt for years no one can no one but me the oracle said and yuji could swear that the metal beast was smiling this is some kind of conspiracy between the two of you yuji said for the first time raising his voice and i wont have it he turned to his halfsister hana i blame you for this each time i hook you into it the oracle absorbs more of your personality dont you see how dangerous this is you spend more and more time in this state if it keeps up im afraid one day you wont want to be unhooked at all that is a distinct possibility hana said his world has far more to offer than yours ours hana yuji said desperately its our world not any more the oracle and hana said together senator rp franken exited his official car and overnight bag in hand hurried across the concrete semicircular drive to union station he was late for his amtrak to new york as he passed beneath the triplearched portico a reproduction of the arch of constantine he cursed his hectic schedule he routinely eschewed the unpleasant cattlecar atmosphere of the air shuttles preferring the kind of space relaxation and pampering possible only in the amtrak club car he was looking forward to stretching out while he sipped a double wild turkey the only liquor he drank he was on his way to new york for an important political fundraising dinner at the waldorfastoria attended by the president lots of schmoozing and pressing of flesh just the kind of activities franken loved best that was how you made contacts and contacts were what allowed you to operate effectively in the snakepit of the nations capital he passed through the cyclopean waiting room modelled after the baths of diocletian as he did so he took in two of the six ionic columns of the portico he loved best they were carved with the figures of classical greek heroes representing the main aspects of railroading fire in the form of its father prometheus mechanics in the form of its first practitioner archimedes franken also loved his constituents back in texas or more accurately he understood that he was wholly beholden to them to this end he was trying his best to stamp out this myopic trade bill that if passed would isolate the united states japan had just rescinded its ban on importing rice and this had a particular bearing on frankens constituents in and around his home town of galveston who were engaged in the business of growing rice the new market of japan would be a bonanza for them and franken knew if he allowed this trade bill to pass hed catch it so bad back home that he might as well forget reelection next year franken strode past the newly renovated inner lobby with its shops and fastfood restaurants took the wide flight of marble stairs down to the tracks three at a time the thought of rp franken former senator having to adjust to life without the myriad senatorial perks the egoinflating press conferences the ammunition to give and take political secrets the constant adrenaline high of being special was too depressing to contemplate for long franken walked along the lower level looking for his track number he found it pushed through a clot of noisy tourists made his way onto the track where the amtrak train was waiting he was about to hop aboard when a young oriental man in a railroad attendants uniform appeared out of the shadows pardon me senator franken he said politely could i have just a minute of your time franken glanced anxiously back down the platform no one else was coming down from the station and even the other attendants had already departed he was between cars and the train was obviously about to depart sorry son franken said turning on his gigawatt smile but im late for my train and but this will only take a minute senator the oriental said its very important excuse me franken said he tried to take a step forward towards the waiting open door but the attendant blocked him you dont understand im late abruptly the attendant was very close to him pressing franken back against the cool metal of the end of the train car franken opened his mouth to scream but the noise caught in his throat like a spider the attendant began to pour the contents of a flask down frankens throat he coughed and gagged on his own tongue as if he were an epileptic as he tasted the wild turkey he tried to raise his arms but they were pinned to his sides spittle appeared at the corner of his mouth the attendant pushed hard against him and franken stumbled backwards into the space between the cars the heels of his freshly polished shoes slipped off the edge of the platform and he felt himself fall only he didnt fall because another furious push from the attendant kept him erect instead he slipped into the well of the tracks slamming and scraping his knees against the concrete of the platform edge pain shot upward through his legs he thought one of his shinbones had broken pinned into the space between the cars he still tried to struggle the attendant poured the remainder of the flask over him and when franken tried to bite his hand he felt a constriction of his heart so powerful he almost swallowed his tongue he shook his head looked blearily up saw the attendant give the allclear signal to the engineer then he heard the car doors slam the train was about to depart franken saw the attendant turn his attention back to him and he began to pray the attendants foot lashed out catching franken in the crotch he tried to vomit couldnt instead he slipped waist deep into the well of the tracks he looked up in disbelief now in this light he thought he knew this man the venue and the uniform had fooled him he was no railroad attendant my god there was a look of utter hatred on the mans face that chilled frankens blood simply because it was so utterly impersonal now the train gave its first lurch and despite the pain in his legs and chest franken began to struggle anew the japanese leaned down and with a casual gesture touched frankens forehead with the tips of his fingers perhaps it was a distortion of the light but it surely seemed to franken as if the mans eyes had changed colour specks of green glowing in the shadows then he was hit with the cold or more accurately he could feel his own warmth being drawn out of him franken knew the japanese was killing him but he had no idea how the train was moving he was losing consciousness it was so cold inside him that even now that his arms were no longer pinned at his side he could do nothing more than raise them as awkwardly as wooden paddles he could see his fingers like white worms wriggling impotently at the ends of his hands they no longer even seemed his he was watching them as if from a great distance the japanese loomed in his vision one more time franken felt a massive pressure and then he was falling into darkness his ears filled with a rumbling that made him think of the black storms of his childhood coming in off the gulf sweeping galveston with torrential rain and boneshaking winds then the first steel wheel sliced through him his body bounced was momentarily pinned by another wheel another then it rose in the air pink and frothy before being slammed to the tracks pierced again and again by the steel arcs shiny as scythes eleven new york washington tokyo hes coming suma said to the bandylegged black man are you ready to die hayes walker johnson said nothing he was spread across the refectory table in his kitchen naked to the waist his groin covered only by the ribbons of his cutup calvin klein boxer shorts he reflected that there was something terribly humiliating about being seen like this by strangers in ones own home he felt sweat sliding like the finger of a lewd lover between his naked buttocks the commishs wrists and ankles were bound to the table legs and in this position he could only wish for a robe to cover himself such a mundane thought was ludicrous or perhaps not considering that just across the slippery tiles his wife sat her back against the builtin refrigerator her head was slightly lifted her mouth open and there was so much blood that it was impossible for even hayes walker johnson to find her beautiful now that seemed an affront to him a more serious threat even than losing his life because it jeopardized that which he had always believed belonged to him alone an idea a memory he had found almost sacred mr kamiwara is a special guest of mine suma said indicating the compact model japanese at his side he likes commissioners hayes walker johnson turned his head what else does mr kamiwara like he asked because he knew from experience that in hostage situations time was the most important factor the more time dragged on the greater the chance of a positive outcome he did not want to think of the other thing that if theyd given him their real names they had every intention of going through with their threat to kill him just about anything you can come up with kamiwara said in a voice filled with menace he touched the hollows of johnsons buttocks but personally i prefer drugs with my sex he prefers drugs with everything suma confided thats how he gets pumped up as long as he gets there kamiwara said turning to suma hes coming suma said i told you johnson wanting to keep his mind off the horror across the kitchen willed his mouth to work do you have a favourite drug i mean suma laughed this is a police commissioner asking kamiwara shrugged said were all friends here so that johnson wanted to kick his face in kamiwara turned back to him and johnson was struck by just how ordinary a face he had aconitine napellus monkshood the compact japanese told him johnson blinked isnt that a poison poison sedative or aphrodisiac kamiwara said his eyes flicked to johnsons groin depends on how much you use and what you mix it with its all a matter of expertise his lips turned up in an awful parody of a smile at that instant kamiwara moved his eyes and only his eyes until they centred on johnson johnson had the peculiar sensation of being dipped whole into ice water being held under the ice the blood freezing in his veins his heartbeat slowing his nerve synapses paralysed frightened he tried to look away and could not something was blocking the action he could think about it but that was where the impulse ended as if it had become an endless reflection trapped in facing mirrors in his mind the unnaturally slow beat of his heart was so heavy it was actually painful and as he looked into kamiwaras eyes he thought he could see a hint of light a pair of wings or crescents like wisps of green fire in the lower reaches of his black irises he seemed in some terrible way to be smiling at him as if at a shared secret as if he could preserve johnson in his own form of eternity do you enjoy this game as much as i do kamiwara said in a voice that seemed to reverberate like shards of glass inside johnson with every agonizing pulse of his heart suma who appeared totally unaware of what was happening stared out into the back yard kamiwara dropped his gaze and johnson was abruptly freed from what seemed to him a devils grip the blood rushing again at a normal rate through his veins brought a flush to his cheeks and shoulders he had been so cold before encased in the strange black ice of little kamiwaras making he seemed scarcely to have taken a breath does mr kamiwara like coke johnson asked in a voice hoarse as if from a chill kamiwara smiled at him making him shiver inside remembering what he had done to him as i said ill try anything johnson turned his head away his gaze falling upon the corpse of his wife appalled he felt the kind of dread fascination with which one approaches a lethal accident the sight of blood and human carnage is horrible because it is an explicit reminder of death but mingled with the horror is an exhilaration that comes from being so close to death and one revels in life in every way one can im still alive he thought ashamed of his exhilaration kamiwara had spread lines of coke on the countertop and when he turned away to snort johnson recommenced his work freeing his right hand he had been able to move his right wrist against the underside of the tabletop where movers had splintered a small section of the underside after catching one of her good dresses on it his wife had nagged him for months to get it fixed now the jagged edge might become his saviour he moved his wrist back and forth sawing through the thin cord that held him youd better come over before all the lines are gone kamiwara said to suma he wiped his nostrils with his thumb licked off the residue of white powder adhering to the pad one thing for sure this is choice quality merch suma aloof continued to look expectantly through the kitchen window kamiwara made a face turned to johnson you ready to party johnson held still said nothing kamiwara stared at him from out of eyes whose pupils were dilated it isnt going to be anything like you imagined he swung back to the countertop coke will not be enough to perpetrate our future crimes he said we will require stronger medicine to prepare us he withdrew a phial of pale orange powder mixed it in a glass with some water and other liquids he had brought with him and which were lined up on the counter johnson felt the cords part and fall away from his right hand keeping his eyes on the two men he slowly inched his fingers towards the drawer just below and arching his back slightly pulled it open he felt the haft of the carving knife cool against his palm and with extreme care drew it out he had it now hanging point down hidden from both men by the table drink me kamiwara said and laughed as he pressed the rim of the glass to johnsons lips when he had taken half kamiwara finished off the remainder now kiss me as kamiwara came towards him johnson spat the liquid into his face and as he sputtered he brought the carving knife up and around stabbing the point of the blade through the back of the japaneses hand pinning it to the wooden top of the table kamiwaras mouth opened wide but before he could utter a sound johnson stuffed his shorts down kamiwaras throat but it was johnson who let go a scream he sat up staring at kamiwaras hand where the carving knife protruded from between the bones sinews and nerves it was impossible he thought but not a drop of blood could be seen oozing from the puncture wound and now kamiwaras head was swivelling around as if it was on ballbearings and those deadfish black eyes were changing colour again just as they had when they froze him the green crescents seemed to light up his face with a kind of demonic energy he vomited up the shorts and now the atmosphere in the room seemed to shift as if it had come alive or johnson had just become aware of another presence lurking in the shadows those eyes loomed as large as suns and he could feel a peculiar kind of radiation from them prickling his skin seeping through the layers of flesh penetrating his brain johnson gasped collapsing onto the table his upper body swaying a searing pain emanated from his very core seemed to be robbing his lungs of oxygen he made a mad lunge for the knife wanting only now to plunge it into kamiwaras heart this what you want kamiwara asked here take it johnson began to shake his eyes almost bugging out the carving knife was levitating moving smoothly upwards of its own accord until its point cleared kamiwaras flesh and it hung in the air suspended good christ kamiwara was laughing johnson squeezed his eyes shut swung his head sharply back and forth in a vain attempt to clear it whatever kamiwara had made him take must have been very potent he tried to breathe could not seem to remember how there were spots before his eyes and his metabolism seemed to have doubled tripled his mouth was opening and closing with an odd horrible sound like that of a fish out of water hallucinations he had swallowed some of dread little kamiwaras poisonous mixture and this must be the result it must it was the only explanation and he could handle that he was stoned and these were hallucinations that johnson tried to scream one last time as the internal oxygen supply gave out his mouth opened wide as he tried to gasp in air but nothing would work it was as if he had stepped out of a capsule into airless interstellar space wolf and chika went up first avenue heading west into the eighties they parked one block south of the commishs brownstone as he had done before with bobby wolf led chika into the basement entrance of the greystone that backed onto johnsons back yard the black iron gate was locked but wolf popped it did the same with the door in the minuscule cement courtyard inside the house was silent he led her down the long hallway and out into the rear garden at the far end of the garden they paused beside the twelvefoot fence beyond which was the commishs back yard wolf pushed the door open chika following close behind and they found themselves in johnsons back yard as they wended their way beneath the honey locusts chika touched wolfs arm said quickly somethings very wrong in there they raced up the back steps burst into the kitchen and heard johnsons stifled gasping wolf saw johnson his face ashen at almost the same moment he took in the entire scene the commissioner spreadeagled naked on the refectory table the dead woman slumped against the refrigerator the japanese who was at this moment willing the blade of a kitchen carving knife out of the back of his hand christ almighty he was staring into the face of the japanese painter whom he talked to felt sorry for in the mens room of his office now wolf understood he saw the bogus painters eyes widen a thin crescent of luminescent green appear in the irises and he thought oh god kamiwara chika said then to wolf get down she shouted leave this to me no he said this bastards been shadowing me hes mine kamiwara whirled disappeared into the bowels of the house wolf sprang into the unlit hallway running full tilt long time no see shitbrain kamiwara said and kicked him on the point of his hip wolf grunted as the pain flared down through his leg he pivoted with the blow as if off balance saw the mad grin come into kamiwaras face and bracing his side against the wall struck sharply upwards with the heel of his hand he caught kamiwara on the point of his ribcage hacked down with a kite kamiwara yelped but gave no sign of being hurt but there was something in his hand and he was throwing it wolf flung himself away the soft whirring sound in his ears as the thin blade spun past his face he could hear kamiwaras mad laugh as he aimed a second blade at wolf who kicked out his angle wrong but the heel of his shoe deflected kamiwaras hand just enough so that the throw was directed upwards wolf twisted slammed an elbow into kamiwaras groin into the soft spot just beneath the ribs then a dark force slammed him back against the wall hard enough to put him out for a minute or so he shook his head looked around kamiwara wasgone chika was about to follow wolf when suma appeared she stood as if rooted to the floor staring at the diminutive japanese slowly she held out her hand the fingers cupped green fire danced in her eyes the japanese did not move the carving knife still hung in the air above the refectory table the room darkened further as if something unnameable barely seen was coiling and uncoiling sinuously like smoke in a moment flames seemed to leap into chikas cupped palm where they hissed as if being doused by water then they were gone johnson lay on the table crumpled like an old overcoat there was no breath left inside him above the corpse the carving knife rose in the air its blade gleaming like punctuation on an invisible page what the hell is kamiwara doing here chika demanded suma inclined his bulletlike head what he does best wreaking havoc on whose orders suma said nothing youve received a new set of instructions havent you she said shrewdly and i dont know what they are then i will tell you he said slowly but surely we are extracting matheson from his shall we say matrix by carving up everyone hes close to thats the way but this is so barbaric so final final yes suma said an apt word his eyes widened and the carving knife trembled in the air as from an unseen wind stop this i can bring him to tokyo far more easily he trusts me perhaps he does suma said but we have no way of being sure none of us can read him as we can read others and that is dangerous besides he must feel when he leaves america that there is nothing left for him here why because we have one piece of work for him a slow smile spread across sumas face it was a womans smile that of a siren filled with guile and untold secrets a final piece of work what is it i have already told you more than you need to know then you never meant to kill him kill matheson no the carving knife was moving as if it was impatient to write in blood the stuff of legends upon the kitchen wall but to destroy everything he holds dear to probe his abilities to get the measure of him now you have the idea thornburg conrad iii met brosnian lenfant once a week their meetings occurred on different days of the week and at different times too the venues constantly shifted brosnian lenfant the former senator from louisiana who for a nice round fee lent his name to lenfant lenfant ham and yoshidas office front on k street was one of thornburgs oldboy network thornburg liked him immensely lenfant had come out of a particularly nasty local political system and was therefore a master of every dirty trick in the book as well as a host the book never heard of he had first come to thornburgs attention when he was district attorney for the state of louisiana and had outmanoeuvred a despicable and powerful man who was then mayor of new orleans but had aspirations for lenfants job lenfant had cleverly boomeranged the mayors smear campaign against him retaining his popularity with the electorate and four years later it was largely due to thornburgs generous campaign contributions that he had first got elected to the senate lenfant was not a man to forget such favours and it was he who had called this meeting not three days after their last regularly scheduled gettogether lenfant was not a tall man his large head was dominated by oversized brown eyes a high forehead broken like an egg at the centre by a widows peak and a smile as wide as the mississippi he had narrow shoulders and these days a slight pot belly he was a dapper man a real southern gentleman which meant that he knew how to play washingtons particular brand of power game he told secrets only to friends or bartered them for favours either way he built up a war chest of the only form of capital worth a damn in this city today he was wearing a dark blue wool suit with a cream waistcoat and maroon tie under a trenchcoat he carried an ostrichskin attache case in one hand the two men met in the lobby of cia headquarters in langley thornburg liked this place with the monument of its pale marble stone wall into which was carved fiftythree stars each one of those stars commemorated an agent felled in the line of duty but in the open book below only twentythree of them were identified by name the remainder had no names at least as far as the public was concerned they resided deep inside the cias master file lodged like stones in the throat of some mythical beast to thornburg this peculiar form of public secrecy was what defined washington here is our power the memorial declaimed to withhold the truth from you for a moment the two men stood before the memorial between the flags of the united states and the cia and when thornburg said impressive brosnian lenfant knew just what he meant the two men presented their ids to the guard at the front desk and lenfant handed over a miniature dagger that was his constant companion since his earliest campaign days in louisiana the two men were escorted to an elevator on the way up thornburg said how well did you know senator franken old rp and i go way back lenfant said but there isnt much left of him from what i heard you heard right thornburg said i also heard he was drunk when he took the walk off the railroad platform bullshit thornburg said emphatically just like the seemingly natural deaths of the other senators who were trying to block this trade bill are bullshit all of them were murdered franken is just the latest in a line and thats real bad news thornburg had chosen a small rarely used conference room he turned on lights and air conditioner to rid the place of its overheated stuffiness the room was spartan dovegrey walls with a scattering of anonymous and not very good paintings of clipper ships dark seas jutting promontories the centre of the room was taken up by a woodlaminate table eight executive swivel chairs along one short wall was a matching credenza which if thornburg knew anything about such places contained an array of sophisticated listening devices on top of the credenza was a cheap coffeemaker and hotplate no doubt for late night or early morning crash sessions as in all such cia thinktanks there was no window no surface that could conceivably engender a vibration that could be picked up by the evereavesdropping opposition the two men settled themselves at the table and lenfant snapped open his attache case bad news or no bad news he said mans got to eat from the case he extracted a thermos filled with strong brandylaced new orleans coffee catfish sandwiches a skein of alligator andouille sausages and some kind of preserved okra relish that was powerful enough to strip paint off a car these comestibles put to shame the slop from any government commissary lenfant said his gigantic smile lighting up the room and ill wager theyre better than the fare of most dc restaurants thornburg asked for coffee politely declined the food he watched lenfant as he plugged in the hot plate began to warm up the sausages all too soon the air was redolent of a stench that thornburg was certain in sufficient concentration could be classified as a chemical weapon he swivelled around in his seat opened the sliding front of the credenza flipped a switch that activated the white noise machine that would ensure absolute security lenfant took his sausages off the hot plate unplugged it and came back to the table something in the food was making thornburgs eyes water he watched in fascination as lenfant ingested his reeking lunch with obvious relish this mississippi mud isnt bad thornburg said as he poured himself some more of the exsenators coffee concoction my mothers recipe lenfant said as he sliced open a sausage with surgical precision the chef at galatoires has been after me for years to lend it to him but i wouldnt think of it my mother worked long and hard and she was justifiably proud of the table she set at the end of the day and the food she put on it i wont be giving her secrets away he loaded up a forkful of food you know that boy jason yoshida is some workaholic too he chewed some swallowed i swear that boy is like my mother was he never sleeps lenfant had the kind of soft singsong louisiana accent no dialect coach could duplicate doesnt he ever think about anything except work best to ask ham that thornburg was watching the exsenators liquid brown eyes as soft as his accent he wondered where this was leading was content to let lenfant get to the point in his own good time the man wouldnt be rushed anyway well hell i know that thornburg but your sons under the impression that im just windowdressing up at lenfant lenfant and thats the way you told me you wanted it i thought it best that our relationship should go unnoticed lenfant grunted as he took a large bite out of his catfish sandwich well ill tell you something ive known many a spy in my day some of whom were totally unaware of my knowledge of them but i swear i never met one who enjoyed espionage as much as you do knowledge is power as they used to say in the oss thornburg said referring to the cias progenitor lenfant nodded now that was a whole other passel of crocs everybody followed orders in those days and mighty happy to do so too lenfant chewed reflectively which brings me to the purpose of this meeting you suggested i go see your son set up the lenfant lenfant cover so i could keep an eye on things so to speak which i have he sipped some coffee just recently though ive gotten a bit curious mainly because yoshidas become somewhat illatease so i did some spadework gave his office the soft toss as we used to call such things in bayou politics lenfant frowned a sure sign of bad news did you know this individual went to new york overnight he flew in requisitioned a government agency car came back early the next morning so lenfant shrugged he seemed to have had enough food for the moment maybe nothing but i wonder if you know your boy matheson is smack in the middle of a frame thornburg said nothing he was trying very hard not to let his thoughts run away from him go on he said mathesons on the run from the chief of police jack breathard who believes or wants others to believe that matheson murdered one squire richards the lone black member of his team lenfants right eyebrow lifted this individual was found shot through the back of the head outside his house on the morning jason yoshida was there police ballistics confirm that mathesons gun was the murder weapon he nodded thats yoshidas work no doubt about it to anyone else thornburg would have said its impossible youve got your facts wrong but he knew lenfant too well and too long the man was meticulous in his research if he told you something you could take it to the bank deposit it and be certain that it would earn top interest i know you didnt authorize the hit in new york lenfant said softly because subsequent to his return i had a little chat with yoshida you know how he is getting anything out of him is a monumental achievement but reading between the lines its clear hes uneasy about some of your sons most recent decisions lenfant leaned forward lowered his voice even though there was no overt need to do so thornburg your entire plan is in grave jeopardy your son has decided on his own that wolf matheson has become a liability ham has built a cage for him that i dont believe hes going to get out of wolf went from room to room his gun at the ready searching every conceivable space for a sign of kamiwara the question he needed to answer was what kind of game the japanese was playing at what point would he cease to play the hitandrun guerrilla and stand his ground where are you kamiwara where are you hiding wolf recalled his many games of hideandseek when he was a boy in elk basin he concentrated using his mind he was at the end of the long central hallway the spine of the building ahead of him was a ninetydegree turn to the left and he knew the commishs formal dining room there was no place else to go except back it was dim here a perfect place for an ambush then he saw the flush opening in the wall it was just large enough for a small man rolled up to hide he put his forefinger through the metal ring of the door aimed his gun whipped open the door a dumbwaiter empty and mocking greeted him he must be directly over the kitchen kamiwara having led him around in a circle he put his head and shoulders into the dark space to take a look around and heard chika talking in japanese with a man he listened and projected his makura na hiruma downwards towards the man who was he he needed just a few more exchanges to get it then he encountered the other mans aura and the sweat broke out on his back jesus christ he thought shes talking to suma and not as if he were an enemy but an ally he closed the dumbwaiter door got his mind back on track find kamiwara he thought thats your first priority youll deal with chika later if there is a later he inched forward until the top edge of his shadow reached the corner even a millimetre more and kamiwara would know he was there if the japanese was waiting for him around the corner wolf stared into the corridor willing himself to be able to sense kamiwara did he hear a movement smell a telltale odour was there anything that would give him a hint nothing he waited nothing then he thought of the creature inside him dark and constant breathing at his side and realized that he would have to create his own opportunity by the judicious application of equal parts psychology and momentum a kind of meshing of the mental and the physical white bows continuum he summoned his dark familiar he was still a little afraid of it but his need of it outweighed his fear he remembered the warehouse and the fact that when suma was manifesting his sight wolf could read it and pinpoint his location he wondered if the reverse were true that kamiwara would find him when he used his makura na hiruma and this worried him so he began to move sprinting around the corner racing down the hallway as he projected his sight outwards christ wolf almost stopped forced himself to keep moving he was listening beyond the sighing of his own body to the breathing of another ive found him wolf thought i can feel his aura even before he has manifested his own sight kamiwara appeared in the dimness looming like nemesis no longer even human but a glyph one of those who stole the souls of the dying like the creature wolf had shot along the path of the dead he caught sight of wolf and startled began to project his makura na hiruma outwards wolf reached out deflected it with his own kamiwara whipped out a small sharp blade and he lunged in very fast low and wolf could feel his scrotum tighten in reflex wolf was aware of his body wanting to tense and he fought the instinct relaxing remembering centring while death flashed in at him quickly more quickly still in the instant before it happened wolfs only conscious thought was not to anticipate the onset of pain he must trust in his body his technique learned at the feet of the spare balding japanese then he was into it and there was no more time for conscious thought with kamiwaras blade only inches from his groin wolf reached around with his right hand grabbed the japaneses right wrist and at the same time went down on one knee he felt the blade scrape his flesh as he worked his aikido irimi feeding off kamiwaras momentum pulled him forward offbalance swinging him around in the tight space so that he bounced off a corner wall kamiwara went down on his shins his shoulder making hard contact with the opposite wall but he had not let go of his blade and he slashed out the edge blurring past wolfs hand hooking the gun out of his grip sending it singing out of reach down the hallway wolf leaned forward bringing his right arm beneath kamiwaras extended right arm the left under it swinging his upper body erect as a foundation for the movements of his arms the lower one slamming inwards so that the edge of his left hand struck kamiwara at the lower end of the arms socket while wolfs right arm swung kamiwaras elbow up and back in a sharp motion that made a loud crack as the bone shattered and the knife clattered free of the useless hand all the opening i need wolf thought as he brought the heel of his hand upwards towards kamiwaras chin kamiwara struck sideways at the protrusion of wolfs wristbone deflecting the blow enough to take most of the strength out of it the japanese was waiting for the move any one of them it didnt much matter to him he knew wolf must make against him now that he was unarmed and when he saw it forming he slammed his heavy left fist into the side of wolfs neck he had been after the nerve ganglia lying side by side with the carotid artery because that would have paralysed wolf immediately but he miscalculated and his blow bounced off wolfs clavicle the force turning wolfs intestines to water wolf aimed a kite at the inside of kamiwaras right wrist got it but didnt get it quite right another blow came in rocking wolf and he had to revise his calculations because time was passing and so was his supply of adrenaline the fatigue to his muscles for so long in tension and so unused to it had to be factored in now because it was building and with each passing moment his chances of survival were lowering significantly and soon they would become nil he had to do something now he tried to manifest his sight felt a negative pull as kamiwara ready for this ploy began to strangle his sight kamiwaras face hanging close in the darkness like a jackolantern on halloween the grinning skull of death loosed to claim another victim gold teeth grinding against enamel with his effort the long yellowed upper canines coming down to clash against the bottom teeth the thick lips pulled back in a rictus the tendons on the neck standing out like cables the two men were as intimate as lovers bound together by an emotion as powerful and primitive as lust wolf went for the cricoid cartilage at kamiwaras throat because crushing it would be fatal and he had to find an end to this before the fatigue overwhelmed him before kamiwara could gain the upper hand with his size and strength kamiwaras teeth snapped shut as wolfs fingertips made contact but he chopped down hard on wolfs forearm and it went numb down to the fingers and then kamiwara had his slablike hands around wolfs throat his spatulate thumbs squeezing inwards then changing the grip so that the nape of wolfs neck was cradled in the crook of his left elbow and wolf felt his blood run cold because be knew that kamiwara meant to break his neck would do so within fifteen seconds unless wolf could find a way to stop him which wasnt damned likely the fatigue was accumulating with appalling rapidity a red sludge lapping at wolfs consciousness draining him of energy the organism knew what was happening that death was imminent and the trigger was pulled for the last great burst of adrenaline but it was no good kamiwaras grip was like steel the entire upper half of his body brought to bear against wolf his massive shoulders and chest bracing his arms as they began to crack apart wolfs cervical vertebrae its so unfair hiroto wailed he was drunk his jacket thrown over a rolled futon his shirt rumpled and pulled open at the collar tie askew i work in anonymity while yuji gets all the credit he has the money the company the fame everything and what do i have a stinking salary a piece of shian kogaku i can only look at because its in my wife name he grabbed the bottle of suntory scotch and emptied what little was left into his glass im a shadow a clever man no one has ever heard of evan listened to this semidrunken diatribe with great interest she had contrived to meet hiroto at the hospital where his wife was currently being treated she had been sitting in the overbright griefdrenched waiting room her shoulders hunched when he had emerged from visiting his wife he could not fail to see her or be moved by her pitiable weeping and now they were at a nearby restaurant very respectable a wooden table between them and not even a flirtatious glance exchanged hiroto was an easy man to decipher but of course she had had wakares unwitting help in this like a rosetta stone wakare had opened up possibilities to her she had not realized were there for one thing she knew instinctively that the toshin kuro kosai was looking for another way to the oracle besides minako it was not that they didnt trust her on the contrary as she had pointed out she had many times over demonstrated her loyalty to the society but in this case there was her son to consider gin the sense of obligation aside the bonds of mother to son were indomitable it would be prudent evan knew without having to have been instructed to engage a backup path to the oracle should the need ever arise wakare had indicated to his favourite prostitute mita that hiroto the venal envious brotherinlaw might provide that backup not that she had found hiroto an easy mark far from it it had been evans experience that the venal and the envious were often the most clever precisely because their obsessions tended to make them paranoid they were in short suspicious of everyone and experience had also taught her that those suspicions so quick to be aroused were often quite difficult to assuage better by far not to incite them in the first place towards that end she now said i apologize for the scene i made in the hospital hirotosan that was unforgivable no no it is i who should apologize he insisted i was intruding but i am so glad you came and sat down beside me evan did not look at him as she said this so there would be no mistaking her honourable intentions i could not stop myself from weeping i have a husband whose kidneys have failed it is inexplicable in someone so young the doctors tell me and oh hirotosan we were so happy like an ideal couple on tv so in love our whole lives ahead of us there was a lone tear standing in the corner of her eye trembling as she shook with tightly held emotion and now he is in that hospital on a dialysis machine each day i go to see him i see life slipping further and further from his grasp what will become of us she bent her head and her shoulders shook as she silently wept hiroto peered at her struggling through his drunken pall he sat up straight pulled distractedly at his tie in a vain effort to set it straight he bowed to her formally i too find myself in a like position really how awful evans head came up and hirotos heart turned over to see her tearstreaked cheeks just as it had when he had first seen her in the waiting room i am saddled with a wife whose illness cannot be diagnosed and who will never recover he paused so taciturn with anyone outside the family but he knew he would go on he was with someone who trod the same desolate path he did someone who could understand the anguish he felt this illness has robbed me of my wife shes not dead yet not clinically anyway but she weeps uncontrollably then rages out of control where is the beautiful woman i married destroyed by something sinister something unseen my god but life is a bitter pill to swallow but we must go on mustnt we evan said wiping her eyes we must be strong why hiroto said mournfully i dont see the meaning of it because evan said leaning forward there is always a chance well meet someone who will understand who will make life bearable again he caught her eye and thought but she cant be talking about us not this beautiful sad creature what could she possibly see in me but then in a flash he saw how fortuitous it was for both of them that they had met two people in similar circumstances who could support each other i do not know what i will do if she dies evan knew that he was speaking of kazuki his wife yujis sister i have the same thoughts about my husband she said softly and yet sometimes i think he is no longer my husband that is the man i fell in love with is that a disloyal thought no hiroto said kindly just realistic oh what i wouldnt give to bring him back he could see that she was on the verge of weeping again and he felt his heart breaking but of course that is a useless wish the doctors have no hope at all and then he saw his salvation staring him in the face for he the shadow who had lived for so long in the black pit of anonymity yuji had devised for him could at last prove his worth if only to this one human being because it was in his power to bring her husband back to her i can do it he said as breathlessly as if he had just run a mile all trace of the alcohol was gone and in its place was a suprareal clarity he found exhilarating do what she seemed confused listen to me evan hiroto said earnestly the doctors dont know everything i am a computerscientist and there is a project i have been working on that could conceivably reverse your husbands condition oh hirotosan she frowned but how its very complicated he said after all she was a woman but it has to do with altering the dna in a living body her face lit up do you really mean this of course but it sounds so she shook her head impossible come on he said impulsively why the hell not he thought this is my project too and look at that face fuck security and fuck yuji ill prove it to you ill take you to see it right now the one chance wolf had was to get the killing pressure off and the only way to do that was with nerves the soft spot between the ribs and the shoulder directly beneath the clavicle housed a major nerve bundle that affected the entire arm and hand the problem was it was heavily armoured being deeply buried beneath layers of kamiwaras rocksolid muscle and what little leverage left wolf was fast disappearing he used his knuckles but he knew almost immediately that it wasnt going to be enough he could feel another crack as kamiwara twisted his neck another inch to the left black spots were exploding in his vision and his chest was on fire labouring to get oxygen his muscles were stretched to their limit and almost folded upon himself he lacked the means to unleash a meaningful upper body strike darkness he needed a weapon a humming as if an insect or animal a stirring a weapon wolf wormed his hand against his side pushed it downwards until his fingers closed around metal the razor sharpness of an edge the slim blade suma had dropped in the warehouse he could feel his neck going he willed his mind to collapse in on itself entering into the red light and then he forgot about keeping it in check strait is the bridge and narrow is the path wolf built his own arrow bridge nothing but floating and a heat he knew he could touch but which would not burn him his mind enclosed the heat in a psychic hand and abruptly startlingly the sensation entered his body rushing through his chest along his outstretched arm into the fingers curled around the metal pressure the blade as hot as a furnace a sun shot from his hand like an arrow from a war bow pressure coming off kamiwaras eyes starting out from his head his mouth working wordlessly the thick tongue seemingly caught in his mouth wolf moved his neck by increments back to centre aware only dimly through the unnatural heat of the intense pain of his tortured muscles and tendons he saw the blade embedded in kamiwaras flesh and he smashed his knuckles again and again against the thoracic nerve bundle feeling kamiwaras right arm as a dead weight and immediately redirecting the heat in his mind into kamiwara the blood pounding through him the hate and the fear coalescing in him the organism reacting to the proximity of its own death wanting needing to strike out wolf began to tremble with the concentration of psychic energy the mysterious engine inside him amplifying the darkness at noon projecting it like a torrent of bubbling lava a school of ravenous sharks let loose to tear and rend at his command he shouted as a hole appeared in kamiwaras chest blue fire dancing the hole blackening widening as the viscera crisped in the blue flame and the chittering darkness and there was the putrefying stench of sin drifting up from inside the japanese wolf began to shiver uncontrollably thinking again of the moving shadow having felt it pass close by him on the roof of amandas apartment in the humid interior of chikas apartment in the city of the damned when cathy had burst into flame and again in the warehouse and he felt the tremor of the shadow that was a part of him like an ancient shamans familiar breathing in the invisible darkness growling like a living being and at length moving through him with the force of a thunderbolt strait is the bridge and narrow is the path that leads to life and few are those that travel it the inner voice ripped apart wolfs consciousness and his eyes flew open he stared at kamiwara or what was left of him the light fading from his uncomprehending eyes as he burned but wolf thought what path have i chosen that leads to destruction and death twelve tokyo new york washington hello hirotosan this is the oracle hiroto said to evan he watched her face as she approached the matteblack cube oracle this is evan hiroto had taken her to the warehouse near the sumida river where the oracle was housed it was a dark night and there were no guards just an elaborate set of coded locks to get through hiroto of course knew all the codes it had been fun showing evan how important he was to be given access to the oracle you should not have brought her here the oracle said i know its a breach of yujis security hiroto said but i have a reason for doing this this woman is special you can help her help her husband actually evan is unmarried the oracle said evan who had been circling the oracle now stood absolutely still what do you mean hiroto said i dont understand there is much you dont understand hirotosan get her out of here now evans head turned and she looked from the oracle to hiroto and back again what is happening here she gave him a quizzical smile it appears that the machine doesnt like me can such a thing be possible i know who you are the oracle said ominously you are a threat i assure you the machine speaks for itself hiroto said currently its not making any sense but hirotosan the oracles synthesized voice stopped him are you aware that this woman is toshin kuro kosai black blade society impossible and anyway how would you know that she is very high up in the hierarchy hirotosan but do not waste your time asking her she will only deny it there is danger here hirotosan you must see it dont pay any attention hiroto said to evan i think there must be a loose connection somewhere if you hook her into me she will be unable to stop me from reading her mind i will gain access to all her secrets all the black blade societys secrets hiroto could see that this suggestion had frightened evan her face had gone pale and she had taken a step back from the machine youre not thinking of hiroto laughed seeking to assuage her fear of course not dont be ridiculous he gestured but perhaps it was a mistake to bring you here we ought to go maybe not just yet she wants to learn about me hirotosan and take that knowledge back to the black blade society you have a duty to protect me of course i do hiroto said but protect you from whom why would the toshin kuro kosai want you because of what i can do or almost do the oracle said and what is that hiroto asked i know all your functions you do not the oracle said i am able to alter the dna in living humans to make their dna so closely resemble that of the members of the black blade society that there is virtually no difference between the two are you telling me that there are experiments going on behind my back yes currently this process is incomplete the one human whose dna i altered is now dead but yuji and hana are working on a way to complete this function when it is complete i will be of paramount importance to the black blade society they could use me to induce the dna change in others to swell their depleted ranks this is why evan is here hiroto turned to her the machines mad obviously evan said give her to me hirotosan the oracle said i will prove to you who she is you will stop this now hiroto ordered sensing that he was losing control of the situation have you seen her husband hirotosan the oracle said in that diabolically clever way it had are you certain of his existence i havent seen him hiroto admitted but i have only to go to the hospital with evan her husband is on the same floor as kazuki have her take you then the oracle said he looked at evan feeling more and more helpless as if he were being stretched between two mysterious forces all you have to do is tell me the truth tears appeared in evans eyes you are cruel hirotosan to subject me to an interrogation she sniffled of course the machine is lying hiroto frowned a machine even one as advanced as the oracle is incapable of lying he took another step towards her perhaps it wouldnt hurt to see your husband firsthand it wouldnt hurt at all the oracle said in its most mischievous voice its too late evan said yes too late the oracle intoned i meant at night visiting hours are over tomorrow by tomorrow she will have someone lying in a bed who will pose as her husband the oracle said like the best detective ill put an end to this evan said firmly ill take you back to the hospital now so you can see the admittance records hiroto turned to her you would do that of course evan said without hesitation dont go anywhere with her hirotosan the oracle warned she is dangerous now why now hiroto asked because she knows there are no records in hospital admittance for her fictitious husband if so its you who have made her dangerous i know hirotosan hiroto held open the door to the laboratory outside the warehouse the one bare bulb over the zinc door cast a harsh glare like that of burning magnesium hiroto said im sorry about all this but you must understand that security is tremendously tight the oracle was right about that i understand evan said as she stepped close to him green crescents glowed in her dark eyes and hiroto clutched at his heart his mouth opened and closed gasping for air which he could no longer inhale his lungs had ceased to function evan stepped back in time to see hirotos eyes open wide he took one lurching step backwards hit the darkness of the warehouse spun sat heavily on the ground the smell of fish from the nearby tsukiji fish market was strong in evans nostrils as she watched hiroto flop this way and that his fingers curling and uncurling like an infants she crouched in the shadows next to him said softly damn that machine it was smarter than you were poor hiroto she spoke more directly to him then using her sight to elicit answers and only when she was certain that he had no more information to give up to her did she squeeze down hard on the overtaxed muscle of his heart hiroto jumped as if jolted by a shot of electricity then his body slumped back all life pumped out of him she bent down extending her neck and head forward opened her mouth closed it so sharply her teeth came together with an audible snap she took out a small piece of cotton wound it around what dropped out of her mouth she put the stained packet away then she reached out slung the corpse over her slim shoulder his weight was no problem for her she took him home in his own car left him in it behind the wheel in his stark ferroconcrete garage with the door down and the engine on she was careful not to touch anything on her way out evan looked dispassionately at the dark sleeping house thought hiroto did not know how yuji and hana plan to modify the oracle pity if he had i could have taken the oracle with me and forget having to rely on minako and yuji but all is not lost i know where they keep it now let yuji and hana complete their modifications then if yuji becomes reluctant to share its secrets with us ill know who to go to to get my answers his halfsister hana breathard what breathards coming wolf took chikas extended hand allowed her to pull him to his feet he almost toppled into her arms he leaned against the bloodspattered wall while she stared down at the crumpled corpse of kamiwara it was then he heard a voice on an electronic bullhorn reverberating through the house this is chief of police jack breathard you are surrounded by a squad in full riot gear resistance is useless and will result in loss of life yours throw down your weapons and come singlefile through the front door or suffer the immediate consequences you have one minute to comply youre all under arrest this includes you matheson they could already hear the tramp of the cops infiltrating the building there seemed to be an army of them he was still staring down at kamiwara this bastard did his best to kill me chika pulled at him weve got to get out of here he would have thrown off her arm but he would have slid down into the abattoir at his feet she peeled him off the wall he was so soaked in blood his torn shirt clung to him as if he had been pulled from a stream christ he thought how did breathard know i was here hes sure hes going to nail my hide to the wall for squires murder if he catches me in the middle of this im as good as signed sealed and delivered into the state pen they broke out of the kitchen went up the rear staircase at the other end of the house the groined rococo ceiling stretched away far above their heads in this situation giving a false sense of space at the secondfloor landing chika pushed him back into the shadows along the wall down below every available light had been turned on by the cops and they could see uniformed men in riot gear armed with pump shotguns taking up positions in a moment he could make out the figure of jack breathard striding into the light he wore a kevlar bulletproof vest underneath his suit jacket in one hand he held a bullhorn in the other a magnum definitely not department issue a real cowboy wolf thought breathard put the bullhorn up to his lips repeated the speech chika and wolf had heard moments before wolf heard a sharp sound below them he grabbed her hand lets go they were midway between the second and third floors when the voice thundered through the bullhorn matheson this is breathard weve found the commish or whats left of him this is your last chance to save yourself give yourself up while you still have friends in the department willing to help you a moments silence while wolf and chika kept climbing then a soft phutt and a metallic canister arced up the front stairwell clinked to the floor began rolling a soft hiss as the cloud began to move upwards towards them teargas wolf said whoosh he shoved her upwards even as he heard the sounds of more teargas explosions time he thought we just need a little time at the top of the fourthfloor landing wolf looked up searching for what he knew must be there he reached up pulled on a chain and a hidden stair unfolded they climbed it and he pulled it back up behind them where are we chika said in the darkness attic wolf said wiping the sweat off his face he pulled her along this way at the near end of the musty attic they came upon a window with an electronic box attached to it burglar alarm wolf put up his hand felt for the wires pulled them loose from where they were stapled around the window frame he removed the cover of the box carefully stripped the insulation off a section of both wires with a pocket knife found the hot one wired it to one of the terminals inside the box as he slid open the window he felt the chill of the day come pouring through they slipped out onto the sloping stone ledge wolf turned carefully shut the window behind them they were at the rear of the brownstone hidden from the cops on perimeter patrol by the wisteria and honey locust branches he stretched upwards felt the parapet of the roof hauled himself up then he reached chika up to him they took to the rooftops slipping over one parapet to another abutting one the buildings here were mostly row brownstones but occasionally there were deep dark alleys to leap as they went from rooftop to rooftop once or twice wolf paused because he thought he heard the thwopthwopthwop of rotors cutting air imagining that it would not be beyond breathards power to bring in police helicopters but the sounds if they were from a department copter never rose in volume and he pushed chika onwards moving them further and further away from the red sector of the commishs brownstone at the end of the block they were obliged to descend wolf chose an inside staircase feeling they would be too exposed on the fire escape that ran down the side of the tenement chika wedged open the door to the roof and they ducked into the inner landing wolf cursed under his breath as they went down the stairs because his legs were now truly a detriment and he knew that chika was moving more slowly than she normally would in order to accommodate his disability flashes of intense pain shot through his neck and his flesh burned where he had been cut in addition he was feeling lightheaded they were nearing the firstfloor landing when they heard the front door burst open the heavy tramp of thicksoled boots wolf halfran halfslid the rest of the way down turning right behind chika towards the rear of the building as the police flooded the vestibule of the tenement they heard an officer shouting clipped orders to his men to fan out as they pulled open the door to the rear entrance headed diagonally across a dingy minuscule back yard piled high with refuse that stank so badly it made him gag they squeezed down an alley between two crumbling brick walls the soles of their shoes crunching on a shingle of discarded syringes they emerged onto a side street looked to the left where a police barricade had already been set up oh my god chika said wolf looked briefly back the way they had come he could see the tiny yard already filling with cops looking like soldiers it would only be moments before they found the mouth of the alley trapped he thought bitterly then he heard the squeal of tyres saw a battered yellow cab swing around the corner a half block to their right back up towards them he brought out the steel blade cocked his arm to throw it when he heard a familiar voice shout dont for christs sake wolf its me bobby wolf saw it was indeed bobby connor driving their old undercover vehicle he stood stock still for the love of god get your ass in here bobby connor yelled the cops were in the alley singlefile the men manning the barricade were already swinging it aside to let a patrol car through its engine revved and he saw the smoke pour from the burning rubber of its tyres and there was no time to think just to move he shoved chika into the back seat followed her in as bobby trod hard on the accelerator and they sped down the street turned into another going the wrong way no traffic just parked cars and at one point a doubleparked van that bobby missed by not much more than a rats whisker then he was swinging hard at the end of the block onto th street heading west towards central park nice timing wolf said but how the hell did you find me and that goes for breathard as well that sonuvabitch breathard is definitely out for your blood bobby said manoeuvring around a lumbering bus spewing a cloud of viscous diesel fumes into the already choking air horns blared briefly and then they accelerated down lite block i got a tip that he had mobilized a riot force and i got curious it seems like breathard got a call that spilled where youd be thats impossible wolf said no one knew someone did and that someone told breathard bobby glanced at wolf in the rearview mirror you know all long distance calls to the department are logged in as a matter of procedure right after breathard got a call from a twoohtwo area code he called out the hounds go south chika said head for central park south wolf saw bobby glance at her in the rearview mirror do as she asks he said twoohtwo he thought washington the only other person who knew where he was going was shipley youre one of us now shipley had said and had then blown the whistle on him why who the hell did shipley take orders from bobby ran a light as he made into the park weaving through the heavy traffic i took this one wolf because its difficult to put an apb on a cab gotcha wolf had turned around was staring through the rear window dont see anything me neither bobby said i think we lost em he ran another light nothing out of the ordinary for a new york city cab the cops were used to it but almost ran down a pair of joggers i went to see squires brother like you said bobby reported took me a while but once he knew it was me he agreed to meet squire wasnt shittin you wolf the brother was into the sharks for twentyfive large i mean thats about as much as he makes in a year anyway the interesting thing is the brother had worked out a schedule of payment and every two weeks he was paying the sharks just like clockwork he slowed until he could get around a hansom cab the hooves of its tired horse clipclopping along the macadam then couple days before you had your beef with squire everything changed bobby went on couple of shark goons went to the brothers local school yard and get this now threatened his daughter shes about eight yeah i know wolf said through the rear window hed been keeping an eye on the traffic flow behind them well this isnt exactly standard operating procedure for sharks intimidating family especially if the marks paying up thats what set squire off according to the brother youve been a busy little boy wolf said approvingly the brother have any idea who took squire down they were almost into the southeast corner of central park now the skyrises on central park south looming dead ahead maybe maybe not bobby said the brother admitted to me he went over to see squire the morning of the murder he wanted to calm him down he was sure he could reason with the sharks thats when he found squire thing is he got to the scene about five minutes before he said he did when breathards internal affairs people spoke to him to me he admitted seeing a car pull away one person inside male he was sure of that and he thinks the driver was oriental he thinks japanese that makes no sense wolf said the sharks would have sent some foreign talent in from chicago or detroit to do their wet work yeah that was my thought bobby said as they swung onto central park south and another thing the brother swears the car had us government licence plates the us government wolf thought spooks again and again the thought who is shipley taking orders from shit why isnt he telling all this to ia wolf you gotta understand the tension thats gripped the department breathards whipped every black into a frenzy the brothers afraid to buck the black tide afraid hell be ostracized by his own face it breathard says youre a rogue cop and there doesnt seem to be anyone around to rebut him bobby shook his head there was a sound creeping into the environment and wolf strained to make out what it was because every new sensory input could be vital now and dared not be ignored he heard it again only one more block to go and then it seemed to die away in the chaotic rush of midtown traffic but wolfs straining ears picked up the sound again a wash against the other urban noises as they passed sixth avenue christ he said to bobby theyve got a chopper up there oh fuck what an idiot bobby said hitting the steering wheel with both hands they got a fix on us through the police id in infraredsensitive paint on the roof of the cab he screeched to a halt turned around said get out now wolf did not argue he and chika piled out of the cab but he turned back when bobby didnt follow come on he shouted he glanced up saw the leading edge of the police copter rising like a bird of prey over the plaza hotel for christs sake bobby you cant stay here theyve got this thing zeroed in dont worry they wont hit me they this is breathard buddy now hes got the backing to do anything he wants no questions asked im not going with you the copter had almost cleared the hotel just get the hell away from the target bobby wolf said i know what im talking about then chika had grabbed hold of him was hauling him along the south side of the street hurrying west in the protection of the highrises on that side of the street wolf looked back saw the yellow cab pull away from the kerb the grey stone wall and lush trees of central park as background the sound of the copter was loud now and people were looking up traffic was lurching to a hornblaring standstill its shadow moved across the tarmac of the street and wolf saw the yellow cab come to an abrupt halt and bobby come sprinting out there was a large gap between the cab and any other vehicle pedestrians had backed away an amplified voice perhaps breathards could just be heard over the raucous clatter of the copter as it canted over nosing in looking for a space to land in that moment just before it touched down wolf saw bobby relief flooded through him as he watched bobby making his way down the block between the stalled cars he was almost abreast of where wolf and chika were pressed in the shadows of a highrise when wolf saw him turn a figure on a huge deep cherryred electraglide harley emerged from the park heading towards him and now wolf could see it was the small japanese suma bobby chika jerked him back into the protection of the overhanging facade an instant before bobby connor spun shuddered heavily and burst into bright blue flame ham conrad was on the tennis court about to begin a match with harris patterson the lawyer who had been with marion starr st james when he had first seen her on the plaza of the willard hotel when he saw someone he knew approaching he groaned hi mrs simmons he said putting on his best smile now he realized that she was the woman who had been staring at him and marion in the outdoor cafe on columbia road wont you call me audrey ham audrey simmons said but oh well im flattered you remembered me she was decked out in a highfashion ellesse tennis outfit that ham estimated must have set senator simmons back she put her racquet over her shoulder ran her long bloodred fingernails through the hair on his forearm the tennis outfit flattered her flatstomached longlegged physique ham could see her nipples through the thin cotton jersey of her top he was very aware that she was not wearing a bra surely she could not be here to play tennis audrey flashed him a smile and took a step closer im glad you like what you see mrs simmons audrey i dont mean to be rude but my playing partner is waiting and yes the handsome but thickheaded harris patterson you know him know him audrey smiled sweetly ive had him good god ham thought just what kind of woman is leland simmons married to audreys bloodred fingernails were plucking at his shirt ham i wonder if you know just how much i want to fuck you audrey really i i dream about taking your cock in my mouth feeling it grow hard as i lick it sighing as it spurts tor crying out loud ham appalled took her by the arm led her off to the fenced side of the court where they would not be overheard but he was unprepared for her reaching out with her free hand caressing him between the thighs her eyes lit up you do care for me audrey stop it he said taking her hand away your husband sent you to me for help with your son i gave you that help and thats the end of it no she said it isnt you and i both know that when the time comes youll call my husband and hell return the quid pro quo thats how everything is done here why should it be any different for me she looked into his eyes saw something there oh i understand now you believe my husband can help you but i cant she smiled there youre wrong she put her forefinger up to her lips taptapped thoughtfully now let me see why are you playing tennis with the bigdicked but boring harris patterson she giggled at his expression but her expression sobered before she continued i wonder whether it has anything to do with the female i saw you with the other day marion starr st james you know marion she arched an eyebrow marion is it i know her only indirectly through harris but she and i have never met she smiled that sweet smile again harris likes to talk afterwards he says it helps him take the pressure off what a blockhead but sometimes a useful blockhead i must admit are you interested audrey im not interested in being extorted by your twisted idea of quid pro quo she pouted dont you like me even a little her fingers touched him again dont lie ham your body wont let you youre quite beautiful he said truthfully her smile broadened but its me that repels you isnt it with my talk of cocksucking and having harris well its not my idea of what a woman should be she slapped him hard across the face she was shaking with rage how dare you judge me by how you think i should act or feel would you judge me the same way if i were a man no youd grin and wink and join in the talk of big cocks and fucking she glared at him youve had marion starr st james you fuck who you want why shouldnt youre married oh please grow up she looked at him slyly and i suppose its perfectly okay for you to cheat on your wife you dont know my wife and you dont know leland simmons he said nothing looked over her shoulder waved at harris patterson mouthing ill just be a minute he returned his attention to her just what is it you want from me nothing now she said i guess i was wrong about you you see i did go to bed with harris but when i found out how boring he was i got out right away the truth is ham i find you interesting even more humane the way you helped my son was wonderful i wish i could be that way with him but i cant theres too much baggage weighing the both of us down sure i was attracted to your body but i saw something else in you that made the fires burn now im not sure what it was i saw audrey i she smiled its okay ham i was never out to extort you i was merely playing a game it was fun for me but i see it wasnt for you so lets forget it she had taken a step away when she turned back to him oh by the way regarding harris and the st james woman he was finalizing a separation agreement extricating her from a rather bizarre business arrangement what do you mean bizarre audreys eyes opened wide i mean very bizarre whos the guy audreys racquet came down poking him gently in the stomach now thats the really juicy part ham she laughed the guy is your father i hear them wolf whispered theyre very close he felt chikas hand wrap around his mouth somewhere not far away a floorboard creaked a voice only halfmuffled by wallboard said wouldja look at all these goddamned clothes fuckin guy wolf and chika were lying face down in the secret windowless cubicle wolf had discovered in lawrence moravias enormous apartment just a thin wall away members of the new york police department were hard at work trying to locate them the moment bobby connor had burst into flame chika had dragged wolf into the service entrance of the building against which they had been pressed not coincidentally it had been moravias building this was why chika had asked bobby to head towards central park south she had led him past a line of trash dumpsters along to the left where without warning they were heading down a narrow gritty concrete stairway there was a smell of a place always damp and from somewhere close they could hear the drip of a leaky faucet the stairway gave out on an oilstained tarmac apron at the far end of which he could see the door to an oversized service elevator what light there was came from a brace of bare twentywatt bulbs set in cheap white porcelain fixtures but as they came up to the door he could see there was no button to push only the firemans lock switch dictated by city law chika drew an oddlooking key out of her pocket fitted it into the lock and turned it to the right the door opened and they stepped into the elevator cab again inside there were no buttons just the firemans lock chika used her key this time turning it to the left the elevator began to ascend so this is how you got into moravias apartment chika nodded only he and i knew how to use this system since he was the developer it wasnt difficult for him to have it built why not wolf thought when you have a secret life you need a way in and out of it the elevator came to a stop the door opened and they stepped out they were in pitchdarkness but there wasnt much to see in any case by the light of the cab wolf could make out featureless walls could sense an acute lack of space hands and knees chika had said dropping down wolf followed suit and they moved off to their right abruptly he could sense the corridor was at an end he could feel chika reach up heard the scrape of metal on metal and a door swung down chika was reaching up again and it seemed as if she was lifting something out of the way wolf got a sharp clean whiff of what incongruously smelled like hay then chika had disappeared a moment later lights came on illuminating the square hatchway through which she had climbed she reached down helped him up and he found himself in moravias secret chamber there was the hibachi the gloves the rolledup carpet the antique mirror the array of chikas erotic photographs he saw that she had moved the reed mat which was just over two inches thick beneath it was the trap door into the service corridor as he watched she leaned over pulled the door up latched it slid the tatami back into place flush with the floor kamiwaras dead chika said and you used your makura na hiruma to kill him how does it feel i wonder if ive made a mistake in letting the genie out of the bottle wolf admitted he was grateful that she hadnt said i told you so when they walked into the trap at johnsons brownstone maybe its good you feel that way chika said the darkness at noon certainly has its negative side but itll take time for you to see the sight in its proper perspective chikas eyes glittered the worlds changed for you now wolf and theres no going back he thought of her standing amid the blood and bodies in johnsons kitchen chatting away with suma what had they been plotting what kind of perverted game was she playing with him saving him helping him then delivering him to the enemy he wanted to ask her about her relationship with the enemy he had so many questions for her but she was right the world had changed and there was no sense in confronting her until he had an idea of its new shape and the identities of its new players he was in a grey area who was good and who evil he could not say the only thing that was clear to him at this moment was that chika wanted him in tokyo once he got there perhaps some of his questions would be answered right now though it was far better to husband his knowledge and wait for a propitious time to use it theres no going back he said yes i understand a silence sprang up between them that had a quality wolf could not define he wondered what he was missing it was as if the picture of this new universe she was gradually allowing him to paint was somehow incomplete he looked at her we may not get out of here chika said nothing he moved closer to her why was kamiwara at johnsons who was he he was not merely a hit man if thats what you mean hed been over here a long time he knew his way around like your opposite number i dont understand the enemys version of you no suma is that she thought a moment kamiwara should have been recalled some time ago i thought that had been decided upon he was losing it you mean being away from home too long not exactly chika licked her lips i think his sense of reality had been altered to an extent where he was no longer useful even to the black blade society are you saying hed gone mad perhaps again the sensation of missing something vital rose in him it was no good confronting her with his suspicion that she was lying or at least not telling him the whole truth a blind man could see she would not be intimidated wolfs thoughts returned to bobby incinerated in an instant one minute he was screeching around a corner to save their lives the next he was obliterated the black blade society was trying to kill him and not a week after recruiting him federal spooks were trying to do the same in fact he now had no idea who had tried to frame him suma or the spooks it was just like the war in fact according to chika it was a war in which he had become involved think he berated himself youre back in a war think like a weapon but all he could think of was bobbys death burning inside him as if he had inhaled a fragment of flame and bobbys last scrap of information about breathard having been tipped off to wolfs whereabouts power extending itself like a spiders web from tokyo and from washington in the form of a man named shipley at the department of defense someone in defense wanted him dead wolf was convinced there was a shape to all the seemingly disparate pieces if only he could see it and the truly odd thing was that he was beginning to suspect that he had more of the pieces than he was aware of he thought again of the portrait chika was allowing him to paint and he thought of the grand jury of how they were given only the evidence the das office thought they needed to vote the case be bound over for trial he said tell me more about this club forbidden dreams look at the photos on the wall he did he was getting used to being patient with her oblique answers to his questions he found to his surprise that he enjoyed digging out information from her much as he supposed his father had liked to mine opals in australia dimly he recognized that the essential mystery of her was what was driving him now that his old life had dropped away from him what was it about this subject that made you want to photograph it i imagine you mean sexual bondage yes does this subject interest you wolf i admit its hard to look away from the photos yes and do you have any idea why no i think you do well he said maybe its the unreality of it its like theatre exactly and like the best theatre the fantasy of it means to reveal the truth hidden like a pearl in the meat of a clam because you see wolf within the context of fantasy it is easier to explore the psyche of the individual she turned to him that was lawrences abiding passion you see not sex per se but in confecting the fantasy of sex he could explore the depths of the human soul that was the only truth that was of any value to him she made a gesture do you see anything about the subjects of these photos that links them together no she smiled come on detective you discovered this hideout you must be able to find the common denominator in a bunch of photos wolf looked more carefully at every element there was something about the subjects faces though they were all either turned away from the camera or hidden by shadow he caught the line of a cheek in one photo the doublecurve of a mouth in another a ridge of eyebrow in a third adding up to a recognizable silhouette he said are all the girls oriental japanese yes she drew her legs to her breasts put her arms around them i met lawrence at a special time in this special place forbidden dreams thats where i took these photos wolf looked once more from photo to photo jesus christ these were his actual experiences what the hell kind of club is this its the hub of the black blade society wolf abruptly dizzied by an intense stirring inside him he could not define drifted against her for an instantthat night in your apartment he said why did you put your hand between your legs when you knew i was watching you from the next room i only did what you wanted me to do wolf i told you and i still dont understand i think you do her eyes were glittering in the soft light didnt you want me to play with myself of course not i but he broke off abruptly swallowing hard the fact was he had had that thought in his mind that night id love to see her do herself the generator in the apartment is like the heart of a gigantic beast my beast it acts like a screen throwing out white noise that blocks the reception of makura na hiruma it kept me hidden from the toshin kuro kosai it was on that night remember yes and yet ifelt what you wanted me to do so strongly it cut through the noise block primitive emotions are often strong enough to do that thats why the summoning of makura na hiruma usually occurs during puberty when those emotions are running rampant once again wolf thought of the time white bow had taken him out on the frozen playa he had often wondered why his grandfather had chosen that moment now he knew puberty you people seem to be able to read each others auras he said but i know kamiwara and suma werent able to read mine it was like i was a blank no wrong analogy chika said a wall may be blank but you still know its a wall youre unique with you theres nothing at all its as if you dont exist but you were able to read me you told me that you could feel my aura that night in your apartment even through the interference of the generator something happened between us chika said she was still very close to him and he could feel that same electric sexuality at close range that had galvanized him in the strangely heated atmosphere of her apartment as he watched her from the living room now he knew the origin of that heat the confluence of makura na hiruma hers and his wolf said then you wanted me as much as i wanted you he felt her essence rising from her in waves like heat off a city street in summer only this was somehow sweet infusing him with an ache in his heart the kind of yearning one feels at sixteen for a sweetfleshed girl who flashes you a sunny smile in the midst of a crowd yet there was a melancholy too of the moment when you say goodbye to a deeply tanned girlfriend on the last evening of summer when the darkness brings with it the first cool whiff of autumn the city and home she put the flat of her palm over his left nipple whispered i can hear the beating of the heart of a gigantic beast he inhaled her musk certain that he would never be able to sate himself your beast i wont know that her cheek sliding like silk against the stubble of his incipient beard for some time to come the first taste of her had the succulence of a peach dripping with nectar he heard her moan deep down in her throat felt it in his own throat and he was gripped by a kind of pale fire in which the world dropped away and the heat they generated by their mutual passion engulfed the physical aspects of the windowless cubicle even to the light itself in the darkness their power accelerated as they came together in a breathless grappling for wolf it was the end to a longing that had possessed him from the moment he had first seen her the atmosphere hot and thick as tar deepened and chika cried out as wolf stripped off her clothes bent his head to her high breasts sucked first one hard nipple into his mouth then the other he felt her hands on his neck then his chest as she pulled off his sweat and bloodsoaked shirt she drew down his trousers and he felt her delicate fingers between his thighs she moaned again at his hardness and her soft fluttering touch made him shiver with delicious anticipation he wanted to take her immediately but there was a burning an imperative that was an unexpected component of his passion he needed to hold her inhale her intimate perfume drown himself in every aspect of her before he plunged into the core of her he turned her suddenly around drawing her thighs against the sides of his face opening her he felt the warmth of her lips on him at the same moment he tasted her on his tongue her hips lurched off the floor as she skewered herself on his tongue he pulled her further off the floor until she was nothing more than a ball of flesh her mouth engulfed him and he sank in all the way to the root her palms cupped him he felt the rippling of the muscles of her legs the tightening of her belly then her thighs began to tremble and her hips jerked upwards and he felt her moans tumbling uncontrollably with him deep in her mouth her thighs splayed far apart and at last he lost control pulling himself free and almost in the same motion plunging into her her thighs drew up around him and he could feel her hard nipples scraping him as she threw herself from side to side he held her head felt the tears slipping from the corners of her eyes covered her face with kisses as she convulsed gasping her passion into his mouth not stopping spasming on and on as her inner muscles gripped him more tightly bringing him to the edge and then over in a fireburst of longing need and fusion not only of body but of spirit because at the end instead of the tiny emptiness that comes in the aftermath there were the shadows hers and his living pulsing infusing the cubicle with a darkness as tea will stain boiling water with its essence the moment may have lasted an instant or an eternity who could say but a time came when the shadows withdrew into that region of their minds in which they dwelt the booming silence as of the aftermath of a lightning crack the atmosphere returned to its original state and it was then that they heard the noises from behind the wall that linked the cubicle to moravias walllong bedroom wardrobe and chika reached across him extinguished the lamps dim illumination wolf lay very still listening to the tramp of boot soles the rise and fall of voices the accelerated beat of his heart he could feel chika close beside him could smell the aftermath of their sex but when he closed his eyes all he could see was suma riding his electraglide his eyes fixed and glowing as he passed the burning bobby connor in the darkness he could see pinpoints of light like stars reflected in her eyes he opened his mouth to say something but she pointed to her ear and he listened nothing then he had it and his skin began to crawl the soft background hum of the central air conditioning was gone the cops had shut off all the power in the building the reality of their predicament settled in by increments the air wouldnt give out all at once and they could always retreat down to the short corridor below the cubicle but then what there would be no access down to the lobby save the elevator which would not of course be running they were more than fifty storeys up and just a wall away who knew how many cops were waiting for them to make a break breathard was squeezing the life out of them he felt chikas hand on him again saw that she was slithering backwards towards the reed mat what was she thinking he helped her remove the mat watched as she unlatched the trap door dropped down into the corridor after her at the other end the elevator door stood open the lights out she headed for it why it was inert of no use to them when they were in the cab she pointed silently upwards to the service hatch in the roof he nodded hefted her up and a moment later heard a scrape then her weight came off him with some difficulty he hoisted himself up through the hatch halfway through the muscles in his right bicep cramped and chika had to hold onto him while he jammed his left elbow against the greasecoated cab roof for one long breathless moment he hovered in limbo not knowing whether he would make it up or fall back into the cab then he gathered his strength levering himself up beside her for a time he crouched on the tiny metal roof unable to utter a word chika put an arm across his shoulders and he sensed the same kind of warmth he had felt at the end of his struggle with suma this time it infused his entire body relaxing his severely overtaxed muscles chika stood up then as he rose beside her on shaky legs there was marginally more light here and he became aware of where they were atop a small oblong of metal at the top of a shaft somewhere over five hundred feet in height it was a damn good thing he thought that he had no way to look down he saw chika slowly raise her head and he felt something stirring as if a wind had sprung up in here light faded and he had the vertiginous sensation of receding at a rapid rate down a tunnel instinctively he grabbed hold of the central cable but chika immediately took his hands away held them in hers as if she was afraid he would otherwise hurt himself something was happening wolf felt a vibration and along with it a kind of darkness that possessed weight size shape although he could define none of these parameters they merely existed in his mind like a melody or a mathematical equation he saw the light in chikas eyes and he had an overpowering urge to look away as from the face of medusa remembering cathy on fire in the city of the hopeless johnson dead in the kitchen of his brownstone the blue fire dancing in the hole in kamiwaras chest suma on his electraglide as bobby burst into flame but he did not look away he stared into her eyes as the green light from those luminescent crescents in her irises restructured the pulsing darkness manipulating it sending it shooting upwards like an exultation of black fireworks until it coiled around the gearandpulley mechanism at the apex of the shaft wolf started as the elevator lurched he could feel the tremors erupting in his muscles knew they came not from fatigue because he was beyond that now the ancillary supply of adrenaline having kicked in just about the time they had slid out of the darkened airless cubicle scared he was scared of what chika was of what he had become again he felt the enormous power of the mysterious magnetism that drew him to her and he shuddered and then he saw the image of his father in his sweatstained cowboy hat with the apache war fetish stuck in the woven band standing atop lightning ridge saying to him life isnt worth shit unless you take risks remember that without risk you might as well settle down put your glasses on and count the days until you die i cant do it wolf blinked bringing the scene back into focus they were still in darkness at the top of the elevator shaft the building still all around them but filled with cops closing on them the steel cab was motionless beneath his feet what happened my power isnt strong enough christ now what i dont have that kind of control over my sight yet she looked at him wordlessly this cant be the end of it wolf said i wont let it she took his hand placed it over her heart summon the shadow she said and the light the luminous green crescents appeared in her eyes and he felt that peculiar heat infusing his hand arm and body he opened his mind and throwing his head back stared upwards light appeared where before there had been only darkness a fluttering as of birds at twilight calling and restless he heard a thrumming no that wasnt right he felt it as he concentrated he built what could you call it a shaft of light darkness motion strong but tensile he could move it but it could not be severed as long as he maintained his concentration of this fie felt confident fear erupted again but he pushed it roughly away focusing the darkness of makura na hiruma bending it to his bidding now he whispered hoarsely we go good christ the elevator swept into motion silently descending electricless as smoothly as an arc of water as he harnessed the power of makura na hiruma hers and his a dark beacon holding them securely in its fastness the hot sizzle of psychic energy caused the barrier of time to be displaced and into his mind came the image of his younger self facing white bows death frightened of the power not only his grandfathers that allowed him to seemingly surmount death but his own the elevator cab came to rest at the bottom of the shaft with hardly a vibration wolf and chika dropped down through the roof and were back on the concrete apron wolf desperately wanted to reflect on what had happened over the past hour but there was no time now they were hardly in the clear instead of retracing their steps back the way they had come in chika led him down into the shadows to the left of the elevator there was a metal door which she unlocked then cautiously opened he could smell gasoline and oil they were in an underground car park chika closed and locked the metal door behind them guided him silently between sparsely parked cars to the rearmost row and there he saw the gleaming metallic charcoal and chrome hearse he had seen her climb into in front of the funeral parlour on second avenue she opened the rear doors and he could see within a polished chestnut casket he heard the soft but unmistakable snik of a switchblade opening then she turned to him the blade glinting very close to him and smiling said how are you at dying thirteen washington new york tokyo rural massachusetts thornburg conrad iii was woken from his nap by the sound of the chimes he lay in bed for several moments staring at nothing then the chimes rang again and he swung his long thin legs over the side of the bed slipped on his silk paisley dressing gown and padded to the front door thornburgs villa on the manicured grounds of magnolia terrace was more secluded than most which was the way thornburg wanted it most of the highly prized villas overlooked the golf course but thornburgs was set back amid a copse of silverbarked birch and huge rose of sharon behind it a small brook sparkled and gurgled over smooth black rocks and the path that led to its front door was enclosed for most of its way by a bower of white wisteria trained to arch over a cedar arbour thornburg passed a mirror stopped for a moment to admire the straightness of his back the fullness of his musculature he brushed his silver hair back from his forehead then pulled open the door youre looking good stevie powers said as she kissed him on the cheek your face is fuller and so many lines are gone have a good nap probably not thornburg said closing the door i dreamed the entire time stevie smiled at him it only seemed that way she went past him into the living room how is tiffany not well he said slumping into an upholstered chair i believe shes got leukaemia stevie came and sat down beside him id better have a talk with her then no ive decided not to tell her is that wise i mean the disease will her treatments will mask the symptoms until the very end i take it the course of treatment led to the cancer he nodded that damned recombinant insulinlike growth factor its still so promising and yet we cant tap its potential every time we get tantalizingly close something like this occurs and were back at square one stevie got up went to the bar fixed them both a neat glenlivet thornburg nodded took the glass from her time he said is running out he held the liquor up to the light so that prisms of colour shot through its depths too soon too soon he downed the scotch in one long draught then his hand swung sideways flinging the glass into the air it smashed on the marble floor of the entryway if only we could break the riddle of this cloned complex protein god rot it in hell what is the missing element that will make the molecule chain stable stevie wisely said nothing allowing the storm to pass on its own he detested being coddled she had learned that lesson very quickly even though it meant a conscious suppression of her innate empathy one of her most useful psychoanalytic tools there was a new tension in him she could not explain shed heard him rant before against a science that had come so far but was moving too slowly what had happened she knew that if she just came out and asked him shed get nowhere she realized that her stomach muscles were clenched she took her worst fear and verbalized it wolf is with this japanese woman isnt that what you wanted from the beginning now its just a matter of time until he gets you what you need his stare was like being fixed in the headlight beams of an oncoming car stevie tried to read his expression failed there was a look in his eyes she had never seen before it alarmed her as if she had been witness to something she should not have seen she felt that squirming in the pit of her stomach and like many women she instinctively went to the core of her distress what about wolf she said is he all right thornburg said nothing and this frightened her all the more what have you heard has he been hurt or she bit her lip unable to voice the terrible thought thornburg closed his eyes for a moment he cursed himself usually so in control so at home with manipulating people he had allowed his own obsession to shatter his facade he knew that if he tried to tell her that wolf was all right shed know he was lying her radar was turned on and tuned in he thought it best to give her at least a semblance of the truth he opened his eyes at present matheson is in some difficulty but he will prevail you have my word on that that seemed to calm stevie somewhat after a while she said you know who murdered amanda dont you i have a pretty good idea i want he nodded dont you think i understand what motivated you to help me he smiled at her i know what you want and believe me youll get it matheson will run the murderer to ground dont you worry about that ive seen him in action i know what hes capable of i already pity the person who killed your sister id like to kill the murderer myself yes thornburg said i believe you would and the emotion is magnificent how matheson must have been smitten by that she bristled at his callous tone the voice men all too often used with women if youve confused me with a whore youve made a serious mistake he was staring at her intently a small smile crept along the corners of his dry lips yes you have been close to matheson you have felt the power inside him tell me stevie did you sleep with him she did not trust herself to speak she was dismayed by this side of him she had seen him do this to other people pin them to the wall like a lepidopterist with his butterflies of course you did there was the magnetism drawing you he put his bent forefinger up to his pursed lips and how many times did you come close to telling him about me i never came close really his head cocked and you arent in love with him either stevie did not answer him right away perhaps she could not she glanced briefly down at her hands clasped in her lap let out a long breath i want to get this straight the first time so theres no possibility of misunderstanding my personal feelings are my own business what i feel about wolf or about morton for that matter is for me alone to know not if these personal feelings impinge on what i have to do are you worried i will betray you to wolf my dear when you are in my position and are lucky enough to get to be my age the threat of betrayal becomes a constant concern stevie smiled as she took his hand it is precisely because of your position that i wouldnt dream of betraying you you are the one who made mortons reputation in washington who gave me entree into the associations that made mine he and i owe everything to you i detest the word everything its a catchall that describes nothing now stevie took a hard look into his eyes and thought she saw something dark and squirmy in their depths she remembered him speaking of wolfs power and she began to wonder whether that dark squirmy thing was fear could thornburg conrad hi actually be frightened of another human being she wouldnt have thought so but now it seemed possible thornburg his head twitched i must have some his voice had turned toneless no fetch it for me absolutely not his head came up his eyes locking on hers scalding her making her itch inside where she could not scratch fetch it and administer it she stood up but the danger he grinned a fierce repellent expression that made his face look momentarily like a deathshead the only danger worth considering is that i wont live long enough to see this through she went into his bedroom removed the false bottom of the lower drawer in his bedside table she ignored the container of prescription sleeping tablets and the us armyissue officerscalibre pistol reached towards the line of rubbertopped glass phials and the supply of disposable hypodermics she filled a hypodermic with a clear fluid from one of the unlabelled phials then squeezed a bit out of the end to purge the syringe of air returning to the living room she looked down at him said dont you want to reconsider this is what killed the others whats killing tiffany my blood type is different than hers he said in that same toneless voice besides this serum has been refined further and you think this will make a difference that there wont be side effects just do it stevie bent slid the needle into the major vein on the inside of his thigh depressed the plunger slowly and steadily she watched his face all the time because there were other side effects shortlived but unpleasant that could occur she was hardly finished before his buttocks clenched he rose off the chair his back arched his neck a twisted cord of tendons and ligaments his lips were pulled back baring clenched teeth she could hear the breath whistling between his teeth and his words fight against the fall of night the sensation of motion ceased the rumble of the engine came through clearly and he clung to that the single sound from outside in the claustrophobic darkness he could smell some chemical in the satin lining and the sharp odour of polish used to buff the brass fittings but there was barely any scent of wood he heard voices and he stiffened they were muffled far away but he could make out the timbres two deeper male voices and chikas higher lighter tone in response a lot would depend on her especially in the beginning then of course it would be up to him how are you at dying she had used the switchblade down the back of his sweat and bloodstained clothes helping him on with a darkblue suit moravias that she had taken from the rear of the hearse he had not asked her what it was doing there had not cared then she led him back and they had clambered through the rear doors she had raised the heavy jid of the coffin and he had climbed in she had knelt over him painting his face and hands artificially draining them of colour except for the cheeks to which she applied some form of morticians rouge he remembered wondering if this had been a game she and moravia had played but decided the less he knew about it right now the better whats the point of this he had said to her midway through if they make you open the coffin theyll recognize me immediately no she said they wont and he had seen the hint of the luminous green crescents in her irises and thought makura na hiruma perhaps she can make them see only what she wants them to see do you know how to breathe so they will not see your chest move she had asked when she was finished he told her about his sensei and she had nodded it is also vitally important that you do not move your eyes beneath your lids she said you will find yourself wanting to when the coffin lid is opened and you become aware of the sudden return of light he had felt her fingertips on his face now turn your head a little this way yes so if were stopped they wont be able to see the pulse in your carotid then she had lowered the lid on him now there came a heavy click the back doors opening and the voices were abruptly louder he could feel a slight tilting as weight came onto the rear shocks and in his minds eye he could see the cops in their bulletproof vests their smokevisored helmets bending over as they moved down the inside of the hearse could almost hear them say open the coffin nothing but a jumble of voices indistinct through the wood and brass he could feel the satin on the backs of his hands and ears and he had to fight the irrational sensation that he could also feel it on his lips cheeks forehead eyelids pressing down stop it he told himself tidal breathing relax a creak and light flooded over him probably dim because of the hearses interior but seeming very bright to him as chika had said steady on look at nothing theres nothing to see except for the curious faces of the cops peering into the coffins interior stop it tidal breathing relax chikas soft voice the rising of makura na hiruma but the carotid would be pulsing at the side of his neck in shadow yes but the longer they stared at him the greater chance for them to notice light fading a soft click the lid was back in place a moment later he heard the motor pitch change as chika put it into gear and then the force of weight coming into his legs and feet the sensation of motion starting up and they were clear he counted off five minutes then raised his arms lifting the lid on the coffin and in the dim coolness of the hearse allowed himself to breathe normally slowly freely chika hi there okay were not being followed he could see the back of her head as she drove moved slightly so that he could see her face in the rearview mirror no cherryred electraglide harley behind us no chika changed lanes speeded up changed lanes again weaving in and out of the traffic finally she said weve got no tags at all get us out of the city ill do better than that she said im going to get us out of the country if were flying i dont want to go through kennedy he clambered over the seatback sat next to her i agree she told him to open the glove compartment where he found a package of kleenex and some cold cream well leave via logan in boston its all arranged the sun ripe and golden was stretched through the treetops like a web by the time they exited the highway wolf had cleaned up his face but he was stiff the skin of his torso caked with dried blood he thought he had slept through part of the drive his eyes felt gritty and the glare of the lights dazzled him chika pulled into a eleven she returned with a bottle of hydrogen peroxide a box each of cotton balls and adhesive pads wolf took off his jacket lifted his shirt and she went to work on his cuts and scrapes while he opened up the other bag she had brought ten minutes later they were on their way again still heading northeast towards massachusetts ive got to get something to eat wolf said after theyd been on the mass pike for a couple of hours but from now on i want you to use the back roads its easier to follow us on the highway chika headed for the next exit took a series of smaller and smaller roads at length she pulled into the parking lot of a generic country diner it was still too early for the dinner crowd and they staked out a booth of their choice overlooking the lake wolf went into the mens room to wash the vestiges of the cold cream off his face he took out a disposable razor shook out some shave cream chika had purchased at the eleven scraped the stubble off his face he rinsed off stared at himself in the mirror who am i he wondered what have i become back in the booth he downed a large glass of water asked for a refill then he ordered a rare steak hash browns with a mixed salad on the side chika asked for steamed rice and baked beans the only kind of beans the diner served chika used the ladies room then made the call to check their airline reservations while wolf paid the check in cash as he was waiting for change he glanced out the side window saw in the glow of the diner a glint of deep cherry red and chrome he picked up his change went back to the table to leave the tip as he did so he scooped up a handful of packets of granulated sugar he went around to the side of the building sure enough he found the electraglide halfburied in a grove of alder and blackberry bushes and there was the telltale smudge on its rear fender from the burst of flame as suma had guided it past bobby connor wolf looked around his scalp tingling where was suma quickly he unscrewed the gas cap dumped in the sugar that would make the harley inoperable until suma could get it cleaned out he found chika waiting for him by the side of the restaurant ive seen suma she said hes in the woods lets go they went past the harley through a gap in the brambles of the blackberry bushes almost immediately they hit a path narrow rootscarred but a definable matted track winding through the thickening underbrush above their heads stands of larch oak and river birch intermingled with cedars and white pines the whirring of insects was insistent and wolf was obliged to bat mosquitoes away from his elbows ankles and neck the track now made a sharp turn to the left and the ground sloped sharply downwards the air was sodden getting close to a stream wolf guessed every minute or so he automatically turned to look behind him as far as he could tell they werent being followed but with the chattering and trilling of the birds the clatter of the rapids they were approaching it was impossible to be sure he stopped said hes gone too deep into the forest theres a high probability were heading straight into a trap i know chika said she stood so still he could not see her breathing do you think we should go back he knew what was prudent but he also wanted suma badly fleetingly he wondered why chika wasnt continuing to urge them to get out of there and onto the plane bound for japan suma cant detect me he said at length lets see if we can catch him with his own game almost immediately they broke out of the dense underbrush and were upon the stream it was fairly wide and looked a lot deeper than wolf had anticipated chika in the lead paused for a moment on the muddy bank she turned her head to look back at him she smiled but there was something odd about it a vagueness an emptiness that wolf picked up on he was still puzzling over this when chika stepped into the stream there was a faint crawling in his belly i dont like any of this wolf said chika put her forefinger across her lips beckoned him forward into the stream wolf took off his shoes slung them by their laces around his neck and cautiously began to wade out into the water it was piercingly cold the sun was already lost in the foliage he saw she was pointing and looked in a moment he could see a silhouette moving away from them on the far shore suma wolf moved forward the silty mud squooshed through his bare toes and tickled the tops of his feet chika hadnt moved she was waiting for him at the midway point not wanting to give her position away should suma look behind him thewater made its way rapidly up wolfs body and now he wished that he had taken his shirt off the tails fanned out around him and the whole was soon sopping clinging clammily to his goosebumped flesh like the weight of someone trying to pull him down his feet were encountering more rocks most were mossencrusted slimy and extremely slippery he was forced to peer downwards through the purling water in order to help maintain his balance with every step he took the water rose higher on him until he was in up to his neck this made no sense to him since he had seen chika up ahead with more of her out of the water she must have been standing on a rock he looked up for chika to gain his bearings but he was alone in the stream he glanced quickly around then he saw her on the far bank she was standing with her hands behind her back staring at him with the kind of idle curiosity one might regard a gaily coloured caterpillar wolf watched her and the short hairs at the base of his neck stirred he thought of stevie warning him that chika would kill him dont please be in such a hurry to meet your own death and he could feel it now his own death turning the air around him putrid with decay he moved abruptly backwards but now he could feel the full force of the current as it gathered itself to shoot through to the more shallow rapids downstream it was at that point that chika stepped into the water without making a ripple she took another step and cold sweat began to break out all over wolfs body jesus christ he thought as his heart pounded wildly what is this he growled who the hell are you anyway as if in answer chika now rose out of the stream until she appeared to be standing on the water she was still smiling that odd smile and now it occurred to wolf that there was nothing behind the expression that it was the smile one sees on twodimensional billboards photos representing people but which are not people at all only images he continued to struggle back towards the near shore a kind of unthinking terror gripping him then chikas face seemed to pale out as if all at once her skin had lost its sunburnished hue at the same moment the face itself elongated as if the bones beneath the flesh were being stretched by an unseen force chikas jaws dropped open and a tongue came out only it wasnt a human tongue wolf let out a breath as if he had something viscid stuck in his throat once when he was young he had seen a horror film one of those cheesy japanese concoctions where the special effects were done on one soundstage the japanese actors read their lines on a second soundstage and the american leads brought over to tokyo for a week did their closeups at a different time the acting may have been lousy but the special effects in this one were good enough to make an impression on the young wolf the monster in this film was some halfsnake halfnightmare that slithered out of its swampy den to munch those humans foolish enough to disturb its environment it did that by engulfing the entire head suffocating its victim before its great jaws clamped down severing head from body impossibly chikas face was transforming into a replica of that slimy fiend perfect in every way wolf watched transfixed in horror as the beast now shot forward right at his face wolf screamed in spite of himself part of his mind knew knew that this could not be happening but another part was seeing it take shape in front of him he threw up his hands as the jaws hinged open to engulf his head he could already smell its vile stench feel the unnatural darkness looming threatening to block off his source of oxygen he felt the wind of its passage as the darkness brushed him at the last instant his wideopen eyes saw the image shudder ripple and fly into ten thousand sparks but as those sparks winked out the darkness only increased and now he could feel something tugging his shoelaces tight about his neck instinctively he reached up to pull the shoes off him he lost his balance his bare foot slipping off a rock toppling him head first into the stream under the water he continued to pull desperately at the noose of his shoelaces but this only seemed to draw them tighter around him he concentrated on getting his head out of the water but again this seemed beyond him something was holding him under and the more he struggled the faster he was held he saw chika her face angelic once more then she smiled into wolfs bulging face and wolf thought he would go mad her smile increased in height and width until it had assumed cheshire cat proportions and he knew that he had been betrayed he lost hope he remembered their flight out of new york city the intimate moments in moravias saferoom how could he have been so wrong about her impossibly the smile continued to grow until there was only a black void dancing in the water it came towards him and now he was cold very cold his bones like ice his heart labouring to push the sludge that had been his blood through his veins and arteries lights were dancing in his head he could no longer think clearly but he kicked out just the same wanting still to save himself though by this time there was nothing much to save the strength was gone the heat of life fast diminishing the thought of air merely a dream one of many that tore through his consciousness in that last instant he sensed the void rushing towards him and instinctively he fought against it only his makura na hiruma could save him now he fought to summon his dark familiar but the terrifying void of death was closing in on him the monster forget the monster forget the void they are both illusions fight the bastard who would kill you wolf let his body go limp as he drew the darkness to him there was a brief swirl as if now there was another slithery presence against his cheek his forehead then he opened his eyes saw the reality he should have seen all along suma pulling tight on the noose of wolfs own shoelaces it had been suma all along chika had not betrayed him now he looked into sumas eyes and he could see them open wide as the japanese recognized the power in his adversary there was a moments hesitation as the shock gripped suma wolf projected outwards from the heart of darkness inside himself suma recoiled shook his head then kicking his feet came on and wolf unwrapping the noose from around his neck began to feel the force of his power then suma was looking upwards towards the surface of the stream and whirling in the water kicked powerfully away from wolf fast disappearing in the gloom of the rockstudded stream bed wolf launched himself upwards breaching the surface his lungs gasping for air as he felt a hand grip him dragging him back to the near shore where he lay gulping in air and staring up at chikas grim face as she held him fourteen washington tokyo boston ham conrad was waiting for marion starr st james as she left work early evening sunlight was glinting off the tops of the federal buildings as he leaned over in the drivers seat opened the kerbside door and told her to get in hi marion said what a surprise ill bet lets go get some dinner she smiled oh im sorry darling i wish you had given me a ring earlier i have a meeting at seven and then get in marion she frowned is everything all right you look mad as hell mad as hell he said or mad as a hatter i dont know which yet he stared hard at her do as i say marion i dont think you want a scene here in front of your colleagues she slipped into the seat beside him and he took off before she had fully closed the door christ ham whats got under your skin he nodded to the mobile phone make the calls you need to youre spending the evening with me she looked at him for a full minute before rummaging in her briefcase for her appointment book she made two calls she looked up when she was finished saw they were cruising through one of the sections of the city that looked more and more dilapidated the further you got into it drugs and murder ghetto where are we going dinner he said without looking at her here every face she saw was black are you crazy whats the matter he asked harshly are you prejudiced no merely prudent she put her hand on the door handle stop the car let me out that would hardly be prudent christ ham he pulled over to the kerb along the elevenhundred block of florida avenue in front of a darkfronted plate glass and pressed tin facade a neon sign blinked on and off poor boys come on he said getting out and slamming the door marion stared at him over the roof of the car arent you worried this wont be here when we come out lots of white people come here to eat she looked nervously around i hope to christ you know what youre doing he grinned locked the car took her elbow as they went inside the place was nearly as dark inside as it had been outside there was a powerful smell of burning hickory and charcoal fake tiffany lamps hung from a pressed tin ceiling painted a matte black the walls were panelled in woodgrain laminate the floor was made of tiny black and white grimeencrusted tiles cracked in many places in others whole sections were missing sawdust was scattered over the tiles along the right as they came in a long green zinc bar was holding up a bevy of drinkers who had the appearance of having been there for weeks possibly even months the only significant illumination came from the row of worn mirrors reflecting the feeble light of the ceiling fixtures marion was acutely aware of every head in the place turning to stare coldly at her she at once regretted wearing her short wool skirt her sheer silk blouse she glanced down at herself and saw to her shame and horror that her nipples were visible through the fabric she felt like pulling on her anklelength coat table for two ham said when they came abreast of the oversized bartender no one paid him the slightest attention past a short painted plywood divider she could see an expanse of tables contrary to what ham had said there wasnt a white face in the entire restaurant i want to get out of here marion said very softly of course you dont he took her elbow in a firm grip guided her to a table against the left wall this looks fine he said swiping crumbs off her chair with the edge of his hand he put his hand on her shoulder and marion sat he sat across from her when the waitress had gone past them for the third time without glancing in their direction marion said will you please tell me whats made you virtually kidnap me off the street you deserve to be kidnapped he said youve been a very bad girl an argument began between two patrons at the bar and marion waited for the worst of the loud invective to subside i like being a bad girl she said but i also like knowing that im being bad he finally caught the eye of the waitress ordered some drinks then he turned back to her tell me how you met my father someone had put money in the jukebox queen latifah began to bust a move jesus this place gives me the creeps people gotta be people i read the papers i know what can happen in a place like this queen latifah was getting right into it now ham excused himself gotta go to the little boys room be right back marion sat alone at the table the drinks did not come the waitress acted as if she didnt exist not so the male patrons who were it seemed to her increasingly interested in what lay beneath her skirt and blouse she felt cut off abandoned on the strange far shore of a lake of unknown depths she had never before been in an area where she was virtually the only white person and she had to admit it made her uneasy she imagined a knife or a gun beneath every shabby suit jacket a plastic bag of cocaine in every hip pocket stupid thoughts surely she tried to reassure herself nonetheless she felt herself shiver a moment later she gathered her handbag and briefcase went as quickly as she could through the rear of the room trying not to think of all the curious and hostile eyes on her she put her briefcase on the bar waited for the bartender to come her way said could you phone for a cab for me he stared at her with yellow eyes rubbed at his moustache with a thick horny finger phone out of order well is there a public phone here also out he said a gold earring in the shape of a bullet was hanging from one lobe all his hair was on the top of his head but wouldnt do you no good nohow reglar taxis woan come here after dark he gave her a huge grin cant say i blame em none he sucked noisily on his huge teeth bad shit happens herebouts my advice go back to yo table no chance marion grabbed her briefcase ill find a phone booth out she had turned to her right had come face to face with a tall broadshouldered man with a handsome face but a besotted demeanour his skin was very dark it glistened off his bald pate in the low light he wore a purple opencollar shirt there were at least six gold chains around his thick neck where yo goin pretty mama pardon me she said attempting to shoulder her way around him he grabbed hold of her and she said fuck you buddy and stamped hard on his instep his eyes seemed to change colour but he put a large hand across her throat squeezing down until marion made a thick ugly sound he said doan you move now honeychile im im with someone marion managed to get out hell take care of you if you dont you wit whitey the bald man said when he smiled she could see a gold tooth he chickenshit like all his kind yo think i be scared o him i doan give him a

cursed ham mightily for bringing her here yo maury marion opened her eyes at the sound of the voice from behind her yo whats happenin shit yo dates bout to mess herself yo need tfind yoself stronger bitches bro that voice ham she began to twist choked on the palm of the bald man and her eyes began to water he let her go and she whirled her face a mask of fury and embarrassment you bastard you set this up and now youre enjoying it ive a right the bald man was laughing the bartender had turned away the show being over marion put a hand over her face you want to go back to the table now she nodded and he took her back their drinks were waiting for them along with menus ham could see that she was seething youre not the kind of woman to sulk all night you dont know what the hell kind of woman i am marion dredged out a compact took a look at herself in the tiny mirror no but im learning ham thought none the worse for wear you she said snapping her compact closed are a real sonuvabitch the waitress set down a plate filled with food she bent over inhaling the delicious aroma whats this snoots he said digging into the crunchy slabs of meat that were slathered with a thick red sauce a sure sign of a truce marion gave him a cool look nibbled tentatively around a forkful this is good yeah real soul food he said thats why i come here all the time best snoots outside of st louis what are snoots deepfried pig snouts he watched her put her fork aside stare at the plate of snoots he continued crunching down on the morsels and waited until she had downed some of her drink you want to tell me about you and my father now i had hoped to avoid this she said after a time i imagine you would her head came up he could see her cheeks were flushed give me a chance will you this is difficult enough as it is she toyed distractedly with the necklace at her throat thornburg and my father were friends were she smiled sadly ah all my illusions are evaporating i lied when i gave you the impression that my father is still alive he died some years ago bringing a load of american army rifles into the countryside around belfast ham stared at her your father was a gunrunner not a shipbuilder as you said he recalled her lighting the candle on his boat and was willing to bet that it had been her father for whom she had said a prayer marion sighed actually he was both he started out as a shipbuilder it was his fathers business then he made a mistake he sold the company to the japanese she circled her spoon around and around the tablecloth i dont believe he was ever really happy after that he grew bored restless i suppose thats one of the reasons he allowed his ira friends to talk him into running guns for them and naturally ham said when he was killed you took over the gunrunning not in the least she realized what she was doing put the spoon aside he was a dyedinthewool chauvinist my father and he made provisions in his will for my male cousins to come in and run it ah yeah i hate their guts theyre such greedy bastards its all personal this thing which was why i lied to you i assumed you wouldnt want to get involved in a family vendetta you were right there messy stuff vendettas she nodded lets forget i ever mentioned extant exports okay she picked up her glass was about to take a sip when she set it down abruptly and put her face in her hands ham could hear her weeping softly he sat there looking at her wondering what to believe being with her was like walking into his favourite fun house attraction the hall of mirrors good christ but shes fascinating he thought why couldnt i have met her when i was younger before my wife soured me on the institution of marriage damn i hate it when i cry marion was saying dabbing her eyes with her napkin he gave her a little smile arent men supposed to hate it when women cry she laughed i think i heard that somewhere thats why i dont do it often in public take my father for instance he flew into a rage when his women cried i suppose he thought he could bully the weeps out of them matter of fact im surprised he didnt marry you of course he tried marion said and hes very persistent yes thats one of his more frightening characteristics it must have been interesting growing up in his house thats one way of putting it ham said but not one id use you two dont get along well i suppose it depends on my fathers mood but then so much depends on my fathers moods doesnt it marion gave a real laugh this time i like you this way strong and confident and a little bit irreverent then maybe its time to fold up the tents of the scam youre running on me she was quiet for a long time at last she said id like that but but what the horrible truth is i dont know whether im capable of it i promise you youll have help from me she put her hand over his i know that ham but im like an addict i cant be trusted i didnt say id trust you dont her eyes bored into his whatever happens promise me you wont make that mistake he laughed at her as he would a child who is afraid of the dark to dispel the innate foolishness of the notion i dont make many mistakes he said and i never make the same one twice i recall your father saying that a number of times he insisted they order then fried pork chops and pan gravy okra and blackeyed peas with fatback molassesglazed sweet potatoes i guarantee the quality of the food i come here all the time they talked about nothing consequential during the meal but when the plates had been cleared and the good strong coffee sourmash bourbonlaced pecan pie and the vanilla ice cream served he looked at her steadily and said just what was your arrangement with my father well you know your father hes a real sexhound hes obsessed with his own sexuality hes old and damned unhappy about it hes also fascinating when he lets you see that side of him which i freely admit isnt often yes hes a closed sonuvabitch the moment he saw me he wanted to pin me to the mattress and what was your reaction to this charming overture she frowned the truth is i wanted him to well why not id never done it before with a man of his age it seemed like something worth trying but i also knew that if i gave in right away hed drop me just as quickly i didnt think i wanted that ham studied her face are you trying to tell me you successfully scammed my father she took a sip of her coffee not really i dont think thats possible to do but he loves to be teased by women so i did that it got his attention and then then somehow the business part started to take dominance and we stopped going to bed together ah what do you mean ah ham spooned up the last of his pecan pie dumped some extra vanilla ice cream on it let the confluence of rich flavours overrun his taste buds you see the most common mistake people make concerning my father is that hes obsessed with getting it up they think thats his weakness he stuck his spoon into the ice cream licked it clean nothing could be further from the truth i dont believe my father has a weakness which makes him pretty much unique among human beings on the contrary my father cant abide any man who as he says is led around by his dick instead he uses sex as a kind of lure just like many women do to get what he wants he could sense marion bridling and he kept his face impassive you mean he wanted something from me all along he nodded not that he didnt find you extremely attractive ive no doubt he did but hes got a number of heads up on the walls of his study memories of his days on safari in africa he also finds extremely attractive you see what i mean trophies mmm thats a good word yes marion finished her coffee and her cup was immediately refilled ham thanked the waitress addressing her by name at first thornburg seemed interested in our arms shipments and why not theres a great deal of money to be made in the business if youre shrewd enough to be able to collect your money and get out before someone puts a bullet through your brain wires plastique into the ignition of your rental car or gives you up to the local border authorities but there were none of those risks for him he merely provided us with working capital and in return he got a cut of the profits neat for all parties but gradually i got the impression that he was just going through the motions that his interest lay elsewhere and then one day he asked me to lunch he took me to that country club of his you know magnolia terrace thats the place magnificent spot very impressive which i imagine is why he takes people there anyway the lunch was strictly business he wanted to know whether extant got involved in contraband other than munitions i told him every once in a while we accommodated the special requests of a number of our best clients what he asked had we transshipped women i told him medical supplies horses you name it i could see he was becoming extremely interested marion took half a teaspoonful of the glistening pecan pie washed it down with coffee then pushed the plate over to ham she watched him scoop up the dessert dip it into the ice cream spoon it into his mouth i think thornburg envies you the way you can consume food its another reminder of his age ham stopped eating i never thought of that she continued to watch him now i suppose youll watch your eating around him he did not answer her but he did not continue eating either you have the sons typical desire to please his father however in your case your father happens to be thornburg conrad iii a man who is rarely if ever pleased by the doings of mere mortals what are you getting at marion leaned forward just this no one can come up to his standards so its useless to try no worse than useless its foolish i mean why spend your whole life in the pursuit of something you know you can never attain why try to be his person when you can be your own you cant possibly know hes not your father thank god and amen he pushed the pie sharply away from him its funny you telling me how to manage my life but he wasnt amused you dont know how hard that was to say to you sorry i thought i owed it to all you owe me he said coldly and carefully is a full explanation of what you and my father were up to there was silence for a time an mc hammer rap started to come from the jukebox and there was a burst of raucous laughter at the bar ham looked over there as if he would rather be with his rough pals than with marion she cleared her throat and hanis eyes snapped back to her what thornburg wanted extant to do for him was transship people people expendable people ham frowned i dont think i understand we snatched people for him arabs gypsies god knows who loners drifters people who would not be missed ham thought this over for a time what did he want them for he never said and i wasnt stupid enough to ask where did he want these expendable people sent i have no way of knowing where they ended up marion said but the destination he gave us was some place called the green branches clinic outside arlington virginia you sent me to find your traitor evan said and i have found him it was quiet in the room the woman who stood gazing almost longingly at the somnolent late winter garden did not turn around or even ask the question others would have asked evan said nothing it would not have surprised her if this woman already knew the identity of the traitor at last the woman turned from her contemplation of nature her ochrecoloured eyes seemed as golden and feral as a tigers have you heard from your son yes reverend mother evan said he tellsme he is prospering the reverend mother came and knelt opposite evan she was dressed in a kimono of clothofgold silver herons stalked embroidered shallows across both wide sleeves black circular devices powerful stark symbols of the eternal nature of the black blade society emblazoned the front does he also tell you that he is homesick no he is far from home the reverend mother said and he has been away a long time her long sleek hair was drawn back from her high forehead tied into an elaborate braid as thick and long as a horses tail his work is nearing a conclusion he has informed me which is just as well because i have a premonition he will be needed here soon nishitsu forget nishitsu the reverend mother said he is off playing at his male games she gave a little chuckle it amazes me how fully he believes the fiction that he is in control of the toshin kuro kosai then again why not for decades we have maintained that fiction for all but the most inner circled you your son minako these people know the truth she turned her head as if listening to a sound only she could hear tell me about the traitor it is an interesting story evan said i discovered a trail leading back to shoto wakare the trail was devious yes reverend mother but not impossible to unearth not for me no thereverend mother said of course not she waited a moment as still as a wasp against a windowpane and it is your opinion that wakare is our traitor wakare is betraying us evan said you discovered in his apartment the coded fax machine yes the reverend mother nodded as if pleased with evans thoroughness but you know that is not the source of wakares betrayal of course not evan said we know the source of the coded transmissions to him we are controlling them the reverend mother nodded again then how is he betraying us like every man he cries to his whore mita tells me everything she has to i saved her father from the yakuza to whom he owed a great deal of money evans pale eyes gleamed very soon now wakare will bring yuji shian here to forbidden dreams to join us it is a ruse he has told yuji that he means to overthrow those who rule the black blade society he has recruited his friend yuji to this purpose evan knew every story told about the reverend mother as well as a few no one would dare speak of she had been born and raised in forbidden dreams it was her entire world and the reverend mother was the only parent she could remember the reverend mothers face hardened and evan was reminded of a story about her it had been said that she kept her hair so long so that she could use it to strangle her lovers in her bed are you certain this is betrayal the reverend mother asked wakare may have been using this ruse himself to lure yuji into joining us i thought of that evan said but wakare then went on to outline how yuji would join us and still keep the oracles secrets from us i doubt yuji could resist our techniques for long we have so many interesting ones at our disposal still there is a better way evan said minako never told us where the oracle is hidden but now i know yujis brotherinlaw hiroto was kind enough to take me there the reverend mother frowned i do not believe it was good security letting him know about you if yuji should speak to him that is impossible now evan said producing a small paper package which she unrolled in her lap the reverend mother stared at the object evan held until a small smile played at the corners of her mouth that was very ctever of you my dear the reverend mothers gold eyes were closed her head bobbing a little as if agreeing with unknown voices abruptly she reached out i believe i will soon make use of that her fingers curled around the object and it disappeared the late winters light on her hair made it seem hard like a carapace or some sort of weapon her eyes opened and from the evidence you have given you conclude wakare is the traitor evan stirred no reverend mother from the evidence presented i have concluded that someone is using wakare as a sacrifice we already know of his perfidy with the conrads but as this proves all too clearly wakare is no leader the reverend mother sighed unfolding herself like an insect tell me the rest of it she said i think you already know reverend mother tell me the reverend mother shouted with such rage that even evan who had known her all her life knew her better perhaps than anyone save minako flinched and drew in upon herself then she nodded it appears that wakare was set up by minako shian she is our true traitor wolf and chika got back into the hearse and he slumped almost insensate in the passengers seat what happened to you chika asked i came out of the restaurant and you had disappeared i saw sumas electraglide and went out to sabotage it wolf said he must have been waiting for you using the motorcycle as a lure in the aftermath it was difficult to disagree with her did you kill him no wolf said he sensed you coming and fled what had he heard in her voice concern over sumas wellbeing he was too exhausted to pursue such an insane notion after gassing up they continued their northeastward course until an hour later they were parked in the thickets beside a country lane ten miles from bostons logan airport chika suggested wolf sleep in the coffin but hed had enough of the box so they lay down side by side curled up like lovers wolf closed his eyes but he could not sleep he felt chikas presence beside him like a serpent coiling he got up without disturbing her sat with his back against the wall of the hearse while he watched her again he thought of the symbol of the serpent as his suspicions once again came to the fore he shook his head violently as if trying to clear it of a host of illusions had it really been suma outside the diner leading him into the stream or had it been chika all along chika who had tried to kill him chika who had presented the image of suma to him so that he would not suspect her the possibilities were endless he began to shake as if with a high fever he felt as if he was trapped in a hall of mirrors where one false step could send the entire structure crashing in on him he had never been so terrified not even on the street facing down the barrel of a saturday night special he savagely clamped his teeth shut so that they would not chatter and wake her he dreaded the possibility of her eyes opening seeing him like this he thought seriously then of running he had never run from a situation in his life but this he freely acknowledged was different he was in the mad eye of a storm without dimensions what were his options foolish to ask because he knew he had only one forward only forward into the unknowable future he wiped the cold sweat from his face with a trembling hand and despite all the logical arguments against such an action almost bolted out the back door of the hearse then the moment passed he closed his eyes and still seeing her in his mind he fell into a fitful sleep at first light wolf woke her and they had the milk and chocolate doughnuts she had bought at the eleven then they headed for the airport they left the hearse in the airports longterm car park took the shuttle bus to the international terminal it was just past but already the morning seemed too hot by they were airborne on a northwest flight bound for chicagos ohare airport there ninety minutes after landing they were aboard a waiting in line for clearance to taxi onto the runway plenty of time to wonder how suma had managed to tail them through massachusetts and to wonder where he was now plenty of time bathed in cold sweat remembering the green light in his eyes and the way bobby connor had burst into flame remembering cathy burning johnson drowning on air remembering amanda dead in a lake of her own blood the inexorable force on the rooftop throwing him through the skylight the living pipes in the warehouse the demon in the stream suma wolf unbuckled his seat belt took an inventory of all the passengers no suma he went back to his seat satisfied he closed his eyes his mind already drifting no not drifting exactly it was like dreaming while he was awake as if he possessed a generator of enormous power inside him in fact in a way he did he was aware again of the changes fulminating inside him but he had no idea what they portended he began to soar as white bow had called it thinking out of body there was still the sense that he was missing something vital something he had seen or heard he loosed his dark familiar there it sat coiling its oily tail perched on his shoulders he could almost hear the clickclick of its claws the hearse it whispered in his mind he opened his eyes staring at nothing yes the hearse he recalled the first time he had seen it watching chika climb through its wide rear door seeing it drive away and the question that needed immediate answering was what had been driving that hearse if chika was not here on her own who was she working with and just as importantly how many other lies had she told him it was clear from her actions as well as what she had told him that it was vital to her that she get him to tokyo but towards what end was the universe she had led him into as she had described it or was he operating in the dark guided by the lies she had told him what if for instance she and suma were working towards the same principle what if there were no dissident splinter group within the black blade society what if she were recruiting into the toshin kuro kosai itself if the spooks in dc knew that thought he had been turned theyd certainly do their best to cut him out of the loop as quickly and efficiently as possible he knew then that this dark sight white bow had summoned from deep inside him posed far more questions than it answered was more complex than he could as yet imagine worst of all it had thrust him into a world so morally treacherous that even one false step could corrupt him for ever he closed his eyes whoever had said that absolute power corrupts absolutely knew what he was talking about twenty minutes later they got clearance the huge plane swinging around the fumes turning the scene outside into an impressionist painting the frame trembling a bit as the brakes came off then they were racing down the tarmac engines screaming slowly rising into the thick humid air with the city tilting away from them disappearing very quickly into the sooty haze thornburg minako vietnam cambodia my god but youve got a nose for it son general cross said he had been decorated so many times the front of his uniform sagged from the weight of the medals an old fox like me can tell it was the autumn of and general cross liked to wear his fruit salad even in the thick of battle which he was not averse to wading into because he felt such conspicuous respect for meritorious valour would be an inspiration to those around him the odd thing was he was mostly right i watched wolf who was sitting on one of the generals canvas chairs he had a presence a calmness about him that i found admirable even enviable all around us was the war a nightmare spectacle of unimaginable chaos we were in a corrugated steel building that with the bloated vietnamese summer sun beating down on it had become approximately as hot as the inside of a toaster i could see that wolf was sweating general crosss three shutfaced aides were sweating even the general himself was sweating outside i could see them loading up the bs with ordnance napalm this was a war that might never die i thought no one had introduced me and i could see that wolf was curious about me and my status good youve got a helluva record son general cross said to wolf though he had given no sign that he had looked through the dossier on wolf that one of his aides was clutching six field decorations your comrades in arms are proud of you and so is your country hell im proud of you thank you sir wolf said dutifully but the general only waved away his words the way the military rewards its heroes son is by asking them to give more of themselves its only natural really because heroes have more of themselves to give general cross scrunched up his eyes he had a long mournful face with a jutting slab of a nose sunken cheeks crisscrossed by a network of sun and windetched lines and a high intelligent forehead beneath his hat was very little hair these are evil times i imagine i dont have to tell you just how evil we need every weapon we can muster every edge we can gather in order to persevere and win this war the generals eyes were now so scrunched up they were mere slits you understand what im saying son yes sir i do general cross nodded weve got a very particular piece of work for you son its hot so hot macv itself has decided its untouchable he had used the common acronym for the military assistance command vietnam the american headquarters directing the war he looked around the room at each man present before his eyes settled back on wolf you get the drift son the people you see here are the only ones aware that this covert sortie is going to be carried out theyre the only ones who understand its importance in the scheme of things wolf said since i dont understand its importance and since the military at large feels the risk is too high to sanction it im wondering whether i have a choice in this matter of course you have a choice i said liking him more and more wolfs eyes moved and i could feel the weight of his gaze could almost see my own reflection there the nature of the mission ensures that we cannot enforce an order to go forward and you are wolf said my name is thornburg conrad iii just think of me as the architect of this particular piece of work thats right general cross said speaking for the last time i want to remind you son that nothing will be gained by asking too many questions i think we can all agree that security dictates that the bare essentials are all that are required he rose and with him his aides ill leave you to it then he marched from the blistering heat of the room taking his private army with him so i said when wolf and i were alone am i to understand that you harbour some ambivalence to doing your duty wolf found himself staring down the barrel of an armyissue officers colt handgun vietnam the maelstrom of war like a bloodthirsty beast it chewed up the young boys and spat them out dead maimed in limb and mind such a cruel and uncaring beast that it became in the end unbearable to watch or to contemplate decades later thornburg the hawk would examine just how much i despised that war every day i saw the future of my country being swallowed whole by the flooded rice paddies of this alien land war neednt be incomprehensible any good history book could tell you that and yet this war was impossible to understand that was the hell of it because one could countenance it so many had to but one could find no meaning in it and inside cambodia it had been no different in truth in my arrogance i had no conception of what my foray would entail i had set out on an adrenaline high with the knowledge that my contacts had made it possible for me to twist general cross around my finger cross had had no choice and if i had had any sense at all i would have felt sorry for the man instead i gloated over the fact that i could tell a general what i needed and get it no questions asked but in the end i was right cross was an irrelevancy wasnt he the clotted inky darkness of an asian night after wolf had piloted the ovb mohawk an oddlooking plane that had been seconded from the st cav division in an khe into the frontier airstrip my crew of seven had quickly deplaned besides wolf there was a special forces sergeant named brick a kind of bodyguard for me who general cross had insisted come along my medtech duncan with all his field lab equipment and three khmer serei who grew up in the section of cambodia i needed to get to by the time the team had crossed the frontier and had reached the target area all of them save wolf and i had been killed by the viet cong but not before i had found what i wanted the morning of the second full day of the mission dawned bloodred and clear enough for us to be drawn to the tall still column of smoke that hung in the humid air like the rope from a fakirs pot the column was less than half a kilometre away and turned out to be the remnants of a substantial village here and there fires still sparked and burned whitehot impossible in this weather unless they were of a chemical nature the stench of scorched flesh was overpowering duncan had his radiation measuring devices out but as before there seemed to be no response from them bodies were piled everywhere in doorways in the streets in what was left of the interiors of houses we saw some weaponry but the bodies were so badly burned they were no longer clothed i heard wolf ask one of the khmer if these people were viet cong or khmer both the khmer said and his anguish was heartwrenching the viet cong like to take over border villages because they believe they will be safe from attack among the khmer so many questions without answers i thought even though this had all the earmarks of napalm bombing i could detect no telltale odour from the chemical also we had heard nothing during the night and surely this close to the target site we would have heard the drone of the aircraft and the wump wump wump of the shells exploding i gestured to duncan who broke out the kit he had been carrying in a backpack duncan unrolled the instruments in their cloth pouches he worked rapidly efficiently taking samples of skin tissue organs such as liver lung and heart bone brain stem spine and seven different areas in the brain from a dozen victims of the destruction men women and children all of different ages these samples he placed in special thickwalled phials that sealed with a telltale vacuum hiss he labelled each storing them away with meticulous care all under my watchful eye i could see wolf watching us as he went about his business of perimeter patrol with the khmer serei he asked no questions good soldier that he was but i could see his mind amassing its array of evidence from which i was certain at some point he would draw his conclusions it was just after that that the shelling began viet cong fire that killed brick and duncan we never did find out what happened to the three khmer had they been killed captured or did they abandon us to our fate but war is like that more often than not you never know what is happening what will happen let alone what has already happened you either come to accept that insane state of affairs or else you go mad yourself the shelling was intense i myself was blinded in the attack and wolf gathering up the samples halfdragged me away from the shelling deeper into cambodia an odd thing happened then as he held me i felt completely protected as if with him there was no possibility of being hit by a mortar or by gunfire it was as if the two of us existed within a dark shell apart from the rest of the war it was when we took a break that wolf demanded an explanation despite crosss warnings against asking too many questions by then i was very frightened the euphoria of my omnipotence had been exploded by the reality of the war i knew by then that i was no john wayne and that from here on out i would have to depend absolutely on wolf so i told him as much as i thought prudent besides he was even more clever than i had anticipated and had worked out a surprising percentage of the essentials that i was a civilian that the mission was not strictly speaking a military operation that it was scientific in nature and that we were in search of the origin of some new form of radiation poisoning i told him that we had come here to follow up on a series of puzzling khmer serei recon reports at first macv had dismissed them then the same kind of observations started popping up in the reports of the b detachment of the fifth special forces group involved in uwo unconventional warfare operations on the frontier between vietnam and cambodia these reports finally fell into the hands of general cross commander of the sixth special forces group or omega detachment as they liked to call themselves internally wolf picked up on that right away wait a minute he said there is no sixth special forces group thats right there isnt i told him so what are we talking about here spooks were all servants of the government of the united states arent we thats the only thing that matters i could see him working it out that he was part of a spook mission cia or even something older the battlehardened remnants of the oss who common rumour had it had gone underground when the cia was formed and who still worked out of closeddoor offices somewhere in the bureaucratic labyrinth of washington i wanted him to see that i trusted him even though he was no spook i also wanted him to come to the conclusion that maybe asking so many questions wasnt in his best interest but like ive always said about him hes a goddamned bulldog when it comes to uncovering facts he said these reports that got under general crosss skin had to do with radiation poisoning right i told him that there had been several sightings like the one we had come upon that village that looked as if it had been napalmed only it hadnt at least not by any of our arclight bombing runs all the sites had been overrun by viet cong troops the south vietnam military command was ignorant of what we were doing here in cambodia and the various ethnic montagnards had neither the scope nor the ordnance to create such devastation so who was left we needed to find out so you came in here with radiation testing equipment thats right a number of the recon intelligence was picking up some unknown form of radiation residue that also puzzled us there was nothing to do but to form a party to take a firsthand look thats not good enough he said my impression was that he was very angry with me then for having roped him into this mess i need more answers why for instance didnt macv send its own military ordnance team to check these reports out why has this been designated a civilian mission with paramilitary liaison the people who control the military made that decision i said i think youre full of shit this was your mission from day one i dont know who you really are but i can tell one thing and it scares me you have a very personal stake in this foray i could hear him moving around and again i had the distinct sensation that as long as i was with him i could not be harmed okay i can accept the bullshit because thats what spooks throw around all day long but why pick me a welldecorated but definitely unspooklike pilot to take your crew in unspooklike i said appreciatively apt word i didnt want any of crosss damn spook flyboys along on this ride i was already saddled with brick and i knew where his loyalties lay he was going to report to cross everything that happened on the mission frankly i wanted someone i had chosen to even the odds a little your records which is all cross bothered to read had you down as a hero that was great as far as im concerned but i went a step beyond asked around about you youre smart and something of a maverick thats what sold me on you something occurred out here i didnt see any sense in being passed back to cross i figured i could count on you to keep it from brick well we certainly dont have to worry about that any more he said i could appreciate his humour i want to go on i said any other man would have replied youre crazy we cant go on youre blind but wolf said now i know just how important this mission is to you what i havent figured out yet is what youre going to get out of it what do you mean he laughed then come off it ive already worked out that this is not even strictly speaking a spook mission youre on your own out here a maverick just like me thats why you were so concerned with security leaks like brick he had me of course and my admiration for him grew but i told him nothing of that instead i said which way is east cant tell theres too much fog why dont we just break out the geiger counter he said maybe itll give us a clue as to which way to go it was the right suggestion and i heard him rummaging through the backpack filled with duncans scientific equipment when the sound came it was muffled by the cloak of the fog i instinctively put up my gun but wolf clamped his hand around the barrel pushed it aside that wont do any good he said how can you know that and then out of the fog appeared what wolf described as a woman warrior not that she wore armour or carried a helmet in the crook of her arm but he said by the way she walked and carried herself it was clear she was a soldier he told me she was accompanied by two men armed with conventional aks which were slung across their shoulders he told me the woman warrior was oriental what confused him was that she did not have the pomegranate skin and polynesian features of the khmer she was not vietnamese or thai he said he thought she was japanese he told me that she was quite beautiful with a delicate face that belied her military bearing she was neither very young nor old but had about her a timelessness that was all the more striking here in a land torn apart by war where stress levels were abnormally high gentlemen your presence was inevitable she said in very fine english i could not imagine that our experiments could have remained undetected for ever after all reconnaissance is relentless in a war you are conducting the experiments i said turning my face towards the sound of her voice who are you will you come this way i was terrified but wolf took my arm and an odd sort of calmness flowed into me as i passed her she unhooked the backpack from my shoulder ill relieve you of your burden i tried to pull it away from her but something seemed to lock my muscles and i could feel her fingers disengaging the straps from my curled paralysed fingers dont fight her wolf said softly she already knows whats in there a moment later i snapped out of it shook my head like a dog coming out of the rain since i already know your name mr thornburg conrad iii she said to me you should know mine call me minako shian to be blind was to be helpless disabled but in this case it must have been fortuitous that i had first come upon minako without the benefit of sight i somehow saw her in my mind as if she cast an aura that normal sight could not pick up but the mind could had i had my vision at the moment of contact i suspect everything would have proceeded on a different path surety i would have shot her and her bodyguards would have killed me and wolf and that would have been that but because i was blind and out of that ineffable darkness had seen her with my mind i had been given a clue to what she might be she swam in the darkness of my world and my god i could already smell her flesh could taste the spice of her mouth could feel the hardness of her muscles beneath the silk of her skin she was a woman warrior and this fact made my taking of her all the more sweet what army she had commanded i could not have said but the mien of a general was unmistakable and the most powerful aphrodisiac i had ever known i see that you are hurt she guided me into what seemed like a tent my blindness may or may not be temporary right now i have no way of knowing i felt the edge of what must have been a cot of some sort and sat down in a moment i felt her touch again urging me to lie down shall i take a look if you think it will do any good i winced as the first brush of her fingertips brought pain from the wound then there was nothing for a long time so long in fact that it seemed to me as if the pain had disappeared although i could not be certain since when one lived with pain for long enough one tended to become immune to it then i felt a kind of enveloping heat and at the same time a sensation as if the cot had dropped away from beneath me and i was floating in a sea of warmth i opened my eyes but could see nothing minakos hand was across them then she took it away and i blinked in the low light i was indeed in a tent though i figured we must be in some kind of bombedout village since it had been erected against a remaining wall of chipped concrete your vision has returned minako said yes her beauty now that i could see her with my eyes quite matched the power of her aura i felt as if i had been lanced through the heart by eros by god i was trembling the image of eros impaling me was apt enough i thought she had about her the aspect of a mythical creature as if i might find hooves and a tail instead of feet and bare buttocks beneath her black cotton trousers and combat boots i tried to sit up stay still for a time she said softly pressing a palm against my chest so that i felt the peculiar warmth there too you are stift healing i dont feel any pain what have you done to me she smiled down at me and i was aware of a vague discomfort at being so vulnerable i was painfully aware that she could at any moment plunge a knife through my heart true the pain was gone but a form of lassitude such as i had never known before had suffused me it was a very short breath from weakness to helplessness the pain is still there i assure you minako said its just that your body is handling it in another more efficient way i licked my lips is that why i feel so weak yes i dont like it she laughed would you rather be blind again i thought about this a moment and i could see by not giving an automatic no i had startled her at last i said something about the blindness i liked and what was that she was not telling me everything i wanted to know so why not return the favour who are you i asked what are you doing here minakos face seemed to compose itself into a painted image she did not look quite real to me it was as if i was seeing her through the mind of an artist so that her face became a symbol of what was inside her your friend has a sharp eye he has already deduced that i am neither vietnamese nor khmer nor am i chinese thai or burmese that leaves japanese i said quite impossible i say no japanese in the vietnamese theatre of operations in that event you have not seen me and i do not exist i sat up propped on my elbows but i became so dizzy i was obliged to lie back down again after taking a couple of deep breaths i said you said something about experiments thats why youve come isnt it to find out what were doing here i came in response to certain recon reports from the south vietnamese and our own forces that is not quite true is it mr conrad it certainly wasnt but how in the name of god could she know that could she be guessing if not a chill went through me like a sudden gust of an autumnal wind then what as far as i know it is six weeks ago the enterprising general cross had sent a helicopter gunship across the frontier it had landed at one of the devastation sites and the crew had scooped up a body at random sealed it in a bodybag and on arrival back at base the thing had been flown back to washington where it eventually made its way into the lab of dr richard halburton one of the foremost pathologists working for the department of defense dr halburton happened to be the brother of douglas halburton my lawyer we had a close friendship in fact years after he would act as my consultant in the formation of what would become the staff of green branches in any event it had been dick halburton who informed me of his odd charge as he called it as if it were still alive in those days halburton and i had the same itch to discover the secrets of life death and the nature of ageing its very curious dick had said as he led me into his lab this charge of mine was not killed in battle true she has been burned just as if she had been hit by napalm and yet there is no indication in the pathology of napalm involvement i was already very excited by the discovery then how did she die i had asked as a scientist i would have to say i dont know yet but as an intuitive pathologist i will tell you that as of now it appears she died of anoverdose an overdose of drugs that could burn her flesh dick halburton had shaken his head no not at all the tests ive run so far indicate that she has an excessive amount of a complex enzyme in her system the truly odd thing is that i believe this substance in one form or another is naturally occurring in human beings however perhaps because of the amount my charge was unable to absorb it all so that ive found amounts of it lodged in her liver spleen kidneys and colon dick had stopped and peering at me over his tiny glasses had said it seems to me that this complex enzyme ate her up alive you havent isolated the enzyme yet oh yes that was easy to do dick had said as ive told you i took out deposits from her organs the real problem is in analysing the substance that would take a very long time perhaps years if it were possible which it isnt what do you mean the enzyme is nonstable meaning that taken out of the living tissue it begins to break down you could say it has a kind of halflife dick had swung around walked over to a zinctopped table on which were set three wire cages inside were a variety of lab rats now look here dick had said i gave a tiny portion of the enzyme to this pair that are suffering from fatal tumours we had induced in them during a previous experiment he had shrugged i figured the rats had nothing to lose i studied the rats closely for some time they dont look ill to me thats just it dick had said with a sphinxlike smile they no longer are i stared from him to the rats and back again what in gods name is that stuff right now your guess is as good as mine dick halburton had said he stuffed his hands into the pockets of his lab coat what was it that was supposed to be contained in the holy grail the blood of christ minako sat back and turning began to heat water on a portable kerosene stove into the boiling water she dropped a handful of black aromatic tea leaves i greedily watched the line of her neck where her thick glossy hair was pulled away from it i could count the tiny hillocks of her vertebrae and each one seemed like an erotic marker gunpowder tea from china she said very strong very good she helped me to sit up slowly because she could see the vertigo written on my face like the warning label on dangerous cargo i put my back against the chipped concrete wall dizzied not only by my wound but by her scent the air was filled with dust motes that were settling into the back of my throat with every breath i was grateful for the tea the sharp acidic taste made me grit my teeth but i thanked her nonetheless where is matheson he is unhurt minako said as if sensing my anxiety although i was certain i had been careful in asking the question her eyes closed for a moment then opened on me again in fact he is at this moment asleep i want to believe you i said but im afraid youve given me no reason to do so you came in here blind she pointed out and now what are you hiding what are we both hiding minako asked me you did not arrive here at the urging of the us military had they been sufficiently curious they would have sent a military complement that is in fact what we had expected you and mr matheson are a different story entirely how so minako frowned as if she were becoming impatient with me you are a civilian with a civilians concerns and a civilians unofficial status here moreover this is dangerous territory and i cannot think how it was your military would allow you access here i guess they dont care whether i live or die minako tossed her head even if that were true at the very least i would expect they would care about their own people who were assigned to you only one of them is still alive i shrugged and winced at another onset of vertigo war is a risk these men knew that when they took on the assignment i wonder minako cocked her head but of course that doesnt really matter does it mr conrad because it isnt war were speaking of she hesitated for a moment it is vital for me to know whether your government understands this or whether it is just you i stared into her depthless eyes my first instinct was to lie perhaps as some kind of protection but i hesitated she had obviously made the first step at what i must recognize as a form of truce i knew it was now up to me to engage in that truce and so come to some sort of dialogue i didnt see that i had much choice my other alternative was to continue the verbal sparring with her which might on one level be fun but which i was certain would get me nowhere least of all back across the frontier i pulled strings in high places to get this far i said though the military is as i have said aware of the peculiar nature of the devastation along this section of cambodia the truth is theyre so busy waging the war they have no time for an investigation that doesnt directly concern the lives of american troops i think they were secretly grateful for my interest i studied her for some time while i worked on my tea do you know the american slang word snafu and when she shook her head no i said its a military acronym that came into usage during the second world war but its equally applicable to any army in any war it means situation normal all fucked up minako smiled english is so much more descriptive than japanese she took the empty cup from my hands you enjoyed the gunpowder tea i certainly feel stronger i leaned forward touched the side of myhead there was swelling but no blood in fact i felt as if i had a scar rather than a wound how did you heal me i told you i aligned elements within your body to better cope with the trauma that sounds suspiciously like mumbojumbo to me excuse me doubletalk sounds good but means nothing i looked around is there any radiation around here why would you ask that because our recon equipment detected what appeared to be trace radiation at some of the sites i can assure you there is no radiation present minako said ill tell you what it was i liked about my blindness i said abruptly i was acutely aware that i could not take my eyes off her her image seemed to burn itself into my retinas in some way dont ask me how i was able to see you or at least something about you id like to know about that i waited only a beat id also like to know how it is youre sure the other men in my complement were killed even i dont know the disposition of the three khmer serei under my command they are dead mr conrad let me assure you theyre all dead except for you and mr matheson who are you i whispered i have to know minako smiled again i am a soldier mr conrad just like you and just like you i am also a civilian at least as far as my government is concerned that doesnt tell me nearly enough i settled further back against the concrete wall i was feeling terribly weary but i fought off the exhaustion minako sat close to me on the edge of the cot so that i was suffused by her scent surely this could be no soldier i thought blearily that perfume what perfume mr conrad i am wearing no perfume the scent is i closed my eyes and without knowing it fell asleep when i awoke it was dark outside a single kerosene lamp burned low illuminating the interior in an eerie glow across the tent i saw minako curled up on the ground asleep for a long time i lay there watching her with studied calm around me nothing stirred except for the beating of my heart it was as if i was looking at a moment in time encased in glass preserved whole for ever it seemed absurd but i knew with absolute certainty that if i went to the flap of the tent and looked out at the starry sky i would see that the moon had ceased to move that the stars themselves were fixed in one position through the years i would never forget that moment or that extraordinary feeling of being outside times inexorable progress and in a sense my life after would become a quest to recapture that moment for myself alone in time i swung my legs over the side of the cot and rose i felt lightheaded and had to steady myself more than once as i traversed the width of the tent it seemed to take an exceedingly long time as if each step was a lifetime at last i stood over minakos curled body i studied the even rise and fall of her ribcage it felt good to be in this position to know that now if i wished i could plunge a knife through her heart i had no such desire however far from it she seemed to me like a unicorn a precious enigma who at her core possessed a secret more compelling than any i could have myself imagined it seemed to me as if she held life in her hand as if she could somehow manipulate time and therefore life as easily as a sculptor moulds clay i found that i was tremblingagain but whether it was with desire for her or for the knowledge she possessed i could not say and in a way wasnt the question meaningless for one was bound inextricably to the other like the oriental yin and yang darkness and light for ever chasing one another on the wheel of existence my mind was on fire i could think only of possessing her and having done so possessing her secret i bent toward her and her eyes opened no not her eyes they were still closed i saw with a tiny shock that reverberated up my spine but something had opened become aware of me where before it had been quiescent and it was moving dark and shining and gravid with a life i could only guess at like a lens it was focusing its power was this minako or the secret inside her i longed to take for my own i had no way of knowing the eye of the lens was all around me now like gravity like a force full of vectors and targets arcs tangents points on a curve i felt like a bullet shot from a gun that finds itself halted against all the laws of physics suspended in midflight without a quiver if i could count the beats of my heart it would take me a lifetime to accumulate enough for a handful i was tumbling slipping through the jaws of time smaller even than a single grain of sand i penetrated the bowels of eternity i had ceased to breathe nor i was aware did my blood flow through my veins or perhaps i had ceased feeling these things because they were evidence of the passage of time and time was unknown here as minakos fingers unbuttoned my blood and sweatsoaked clothes i glanced aside the interior of the tent seemed as far away as washington seen through the lens of water ripply and indistinct as if like a lake bed it was part of a world that was no longer familiar to me minakos uniform seemed to part like water beneath my hands i gripped her bare shoulders her skin was unblemished unlined her firm breasts were those of an eighteenyearold i watched her through slitted eyes as naked she sank to her belly and slithered forward the undulations of her spine and the muscles over her shoulderblades were like the somnolent swell and suck of the ocean the startling black spray of her thick hair unbound now like the spread of a ravens wing swung down across her arms so that only her fingers could be seen at work between my legs i ached to close my eyes in rapture but i could not bear to wipe out the image of her prone and exposed before me even as the pleasure built i reached over spread apart her buttocks curled my hand down down into the warm moist darkness i wished for her mouth to stay on me for ever and i gasped out loud when i felt her lips sliding off me would in fact have protested but she impaled me with her eyes as she lifted up as she drew my hips beneath hers i felt her core surrounding me and with a heartfelt groan slid all the way up her her scent was overpowering the fragrance i smelled before i fell asleep overtook me again flooding out of her like the opening of the mysterious lens that had driven time into exile so deep inside her i felt as if i was close to the source of that lens of the secret of time of ageing of life returning to life instead of mouldering into decay and death so very close it was like an ache that hurt as i moved nearer if only i could reach out with my mind snatch the lens from her core examine it and replace it without her knowing that it had been gone but then it was over too soon too soon and the secret was retreating back into the darkness as diminishing i slipped slowly out of her immediately afterwards thornburg wanted to hold my hand not i would think out of any spontaneous show of affection although there was no doubt he was smitten but because having failed to get what he most desired from having sexual intercourse with me he now felt compelled to try another way he had of course enjoyed himself immensely the men who i have taken into my bed always have they cant help themselves just as i cant help feeling nothing perhaps this is my own private hell it is ironic is it not that i who am destined to carry the one child in my belly cannot derive the least enjoyment from the act that leads to procreation i was almost sixty then as other people reckon chronology and yet my menses had not ceased to flow and i was still as fertile as i was when i was twelve this is of course what his mind had intuited about me the secret he would kill for it was not until the aftermath of sexual congress when like an adder he was already slithering out of me that i understood the nature of the error i had made all along i had thought that he was the one that it was he with his power who had found me here who had divined my nature that it was he from whom i must suck the seed of life i had done all that i had mated with the enemy because that had been my destiny or at least a part of it but i had erred i had relied solely on makura na hiruma ignoring my grandmothers warning kabuto had told me there would be blind spots false futures ones shown to me that would never come to pass and this had been one of them too late i had realized that it was not thornburg conrad ills seed i should have been impregnated with i had been gulled by thornburgs blindness and his professed ability to read my aura in fact i did not doubt him in this and though this was an indication that he did indeed possess some form of makura na hiruma in the aftermath of our sexual union when the psyche is as open and vulnerable as it is on the point of death i took the measure of his power and saw that it was mostly latent and of no possible use to me yet i was impregnated with his seed it was the correct time of my cycle and i knew my body well enough to understand just how fertile my power could make me i had no doubt then that i would become pregnant that i would bear his child and so as he pressed his palm to mine seeking to find the key to my essential enigma to makura na hiruma i wanted nothing more than to reach up and with my clawed fingers scratch out the enemys eyes i did nothing of the kind however instead i smiled up at him big powerful man that he was and pressed my lips to the back of his hand i am no enemy of yours i lied do you see now that i wish you and your friend no harm yet you took my backpack he said as if you knew what was in it whatever else he might be he was not stupid in fact he proved to be an exceptionally clever and resourceful male no doubt due in part to the nascent makura na hiruma lying in wait inside him it was not difficult to deduce what you carried i said sweetly these are our experiments and i cannot allow anyone to tamper with the results the results he said are that youre burning people alive of course he was right but it wouldnt have done to tell him so minako i came here to find out what youre doing i already know some of it but i need to know it all and you dont have to worry as you have deduced this isnt an official enquiry its purely a private matter over which i and i alone preside i looked at him then in that way i have and keeping my lips halfparted i said it does not matter i cannot allow you to return with evidence now that ive met you i dont care about the evidence he said grabbing hold of me all i want is to be part of you to share your secret do you think id be foolish enough to tell anyone what id discovered i was convinced that he was about to throw me to the floor and take me once again men i thought are ridiculously easy to manipulate once you get your hand between their legs you can do anything with them is it any wonder i regard them with such contempt i believe that it was only his obsessive desire for the secret of my power that stopped him from raping me then and there not that i hadnt actively encouraged him no man had ever raped me without my active encouragement and no man ever would all i want is you i know what you are youre the elixir of life i smiled at him with my parted lips and i could feel him tremble there is something quite exhilarating in bringing a powerful man to his knees and without him ever knowing what is happening men have no real conception of the ramifications of power but then their definition of almost everything that matters in this world is rigid twodimensional and altogether false i kissed him i had got at least one answer out of him this was a personal crusade of his it was the touch of his own makura na hiruma that had awakened him to the possibilities of extended life and it was this same force which had attuned him to what we had been trying to do here under cover of the war between vietnam and the united states not that he had any inkling of what was really involved but anyway that was all in the past because our experiments had been a dismal failure we had been using radioactive shorthalflife isotopes in order to artificially induce the chemical reagents we believed were responsible for the activation of makura na hiruma death had been the only result and as thornburg and his companion had seen first hand a particularly grisly death at that it was really quite ironic i had thought then as i put his head to my breast that he had come to ferret out our secret at the moment of our greatest failure attrition had set in at an alarming rate over the years the number of children born with makura na hiruma was fast diminishing none of us knew why but it seemed clear that unless we could somehow reverse the appalling trend one day the power would be gone for ever leaving our distant descendants to move among their fellow men as equals which was to say blind deaf and brain damaged thus the experiments had begun and the burning and the deaths but after all our guinea pigs were only north vietnamese communists atheists brainwashed barbarians who had turned away from both their fellow man and buddha their suffering and deaths were of no concern to us the only question that remained was what to do with the two americans i would cheerfully have killed conrad but he would one day become the father of my child and i did not have the capacity for that evil makura na hiruma had shown me what kind of man he was of what obscenities he would under certain circumstances be capable and i felt i could not in good conscience release him without having taught him a lesson in hindsight this decision became a prime example of what kabuto had warned me against the kind of supreme arrogance bred in the superheated cauldron of makura na hiruma here was how false futures were born how a path one trod with such confidence could diverge from its foreordained course without any overt sign the irony is not lost on me in one crucial respect makura na hiruma is akin to the catholic concept of sin one is continually tempted by the darker side of its power the greater the power the more one is tempted and so the false futures that arise to confound even those with full control of their power are often of their own making so it was with kabuto so it has been with me to her credit kabuto did try to warn me but how often do such warnings fall on the deaf ears of the young who cannot conceive of committing the same errors as those older than them i had had an ulterior motive in taking charge of the experiment inside cambodia though it was fraught with danger the north vietnamese would surely have killed us if they had been able as would the cambodians had we not terrified them into a stupor i saw it as an opportunity i could not afford to pass up for years i had been using my power as a kind of beacon hoping to attract the male who would put the seed in my belly that would result in a child with extraordinary makura na hiruma now i saw this experiment as magnifying the power of the beacon tenthousandfold and it was here my makura na hiruma falsely told me the event would begin to unfold thus my initial excitement at the appearance of thornburg conrad iii and my subsequent disappointment i felt fouled at having had sexual congress with a creature whose psyche was in such dire need of purification and yet at the same time i cannot deny there was the tiny thrill one experiences at forbidden pleasures i had said before that it was my private hell to feel nothing during an act that for centuries had given ecstasy to millions in the hours after my first sexual encounter with thornburg i noticed a void for want of a better term like the pang one feels when ones stomach is empty gradually to my horror it dawned on me that this lack was a direct result of my having had sex with this alien male i had in fact felt something when he was rampant inside me and now i longed to experience that feeling again i could not help myself i took him into my bed and into myself again and again until he was sated to my shame i was not never before had i looked upon the sex act as anything other than a necessary expediency another weapon in my formidable arsenal like a drug i wanted this man this alien this enemy who though besotted with lust for me would nevertheless have disembowelled me if he were convinced that would deliver up to him the secret he burned to have and now i burned for him i almost laughed aloud into the steamy darkness as i lay beside his sleeping form my hand was curled around the instrument that had moments before been thrust keenly into me thrilling me my palm became wet with his semen and this too this slimy essence of life made my heart beat faster what a mystery life is if i have learned anything during my eightyfive years it is this just when you think you have decoded lifes messages something or someone comes along to invert all your carefully builtup conclusions the dawn eventually arrived and with it the nature of my dilemma i knew that i could not allow another night to pass with him near me i was already partly addicted to the feeling he could engender within me having been without bliss for so many decades the force of its unexpected and belated arrival was having a profound effect upon me for long stretches i could no longer think clearly and once or twice i found myself contemplating the dissolution of my mission in order to be with him then i would shake myself like a mad dog spewing the foam from its black lips and try to take deep breaths to restore my thinking to its usual level of clarity by the time he roused himself from his stupor i had chosen my path and knew that come what may i would not be shaken from it of course makura na hiruma had given me a glimpse of the rage i would engender within him i did not care and i believe now that even had i been shown how i would become the focus for the animus that had ruled his life i would not have changed course in the events that were to come i would have a sense of galvanizing forces of a convergence of previously disparate lives at this one nexus point in time and space of course i could have had thornburg and wolf executed one word from me and my men would have shot them through the back of the head perhaps i should have given the order but in those days i scoffed at such barbarian behaviour believing more in makura na hiruma than i do now in this future that has blinded us all you have to understand no matter what anyone may tell you to the contrary there is an enormous exhilaration in having the power of life or death over another human being and i discovered that the greatest thrill of all was not in acting on that power but in having your enemy live with the knowledge of your mastery over him so there was a peculiar sweetness to the moment when thornburg opened his bloodshot eyes and felt the edge of my nail along the side of his neck i could have you shot or better yet do it myself for trying to steal the secrets of our experiment i whispered in his ear i watched fascinated at how swiftly and instinctively he reached out for the knife i had left on the ground how he drove it up towards the soft flesh of my throat well thats men for you theyre instinctual animals ive always known that careless of the physical damage they inflict on others i did not move other than to use my thumb and forefinger to pinch the nerve bundle just beneath his right ear immediately the blood drained from his face and his mouth opened sucking in air like a very old man on the point of death the flaccidity came into his arms and legs as his muscles were robbed of their oxygen the knife clattered to the floor i placed the edge of my nail back against his slowly throbbing carotid artery i have only to break the skin open up the carotid and you will bleed to death i whispered in his ear i can do that now in five minutes time or later at my leisure and there is nothing you can do to stop me well i was younger then and semihysterical at what he had made me feel unclean and excited all at the same time i hated him as i had never hated anyone in my life before or since the emotion was so bitter in my mouth that i thought i might gag it was only much later that i understood that at that moment i hated myself as much as i hated him so i was half out of my mind and this allowed my natural arrogance full rein oh i should have killed him then but i was having too much fun playing the savage going against my own nature to stop besides there was something terribly delicious in the situation if only he knew all the secrets i knew naturally occurring irony is far too precious to throw away with a careless word or two and i relished my position of power over him even more because i understood fully the rage it would engender in him i was not wrong about him ive never been wrong about him only wolf has continued to confound me there is only one way in which you can save your life i whispered as one lover to another and that is to kill your companion he looked at me disbelief momentarily overlaying the rage you want me to kill wolf shoot him dead i nodded in front of my men he did not disappoint me kill me now he said through gritted teeth i am no traitor to my country i laughed silently to myself because he had said nothing about being a traitor to his fellow man i knew that if i gave him a gun and told him to shoot one of my men in order to save his life he would have done so cheerfully i did not blame him for that but i was getting to know him better i suspected than he could ever know himself its a basic selfdefence mechanism people like that can never know themselves if they did theyd no doubt blow their own brains out no i whispered we are not merely discussing your life now but the extension of it i pressed my lips to his and with delight felt him shudder isnt that the secret you came here to steal i drew my head away from him studied his expression the only way for you to get it is to kill your companion i smiled whats the problem what is one more death to someone like you i watched his eyes open wide while i drank in the stench of his fear yes yes i know oh how badly you want it not badly enough to sell my soul i laughed softly my breath brushing his cheek dark with stubble by coming here youve already done that you just dont know it yet i was certain that i could lure him into killing his friend simply for the temptation of what he wanted most i had it and he knew it but somehow in this one thing he foiled me i sensed after a time a feeling in him that i could not define and i knew that he would not kill matheson this confused me as well as disturbed me my sight had already made me privy to thornburgs basic amorality but now he was acting out of character to me matheson was nothing a black hole from which i received no signals whatsoever what could thornburg have seen in him it took me many years to work out the answer to that question thornburg was watching me from beneath hooded eyes he lay back seemingly relaxed as he closed his eyes and i knew what he was doing he thought if he could get me angry enough i would make a mistake and he could take advantage of it to gain the upper hand he was clever and he felt he would need only an instant to bring his superior strength to bear he knew nothing of makura na hiruma and that was my true advantage over him are you going back to sleep i asked him innocently his lips curled into a selfsatisfied smile that i found thoroughly repugnant i might if i feel like it i know youre not going to kill me that would spoil your pleasure as long as you think i might provide some amusement you wont do a thing i reached out then with makura na hiruma wrapping a tendril of the dark power around his heart then ever so gently i squeezed his eyes popped open and he sat up with a spastic jolt his eyes sought mine and i blew him a kiss then wiped a line of sweat off his upper lip hi lips opened and closed several times and when at last he spoke i knew how much effort it cost him ill kill you for this he meant the humiliation i could only wonder at the pain i in his eyes an inferior creature was inflicting on him he was gasping between words but he would not give up ill see you dead at my feet no matter how long it takes no not pain i corrected myself this was a man who could endure massive amounts of pain both physical and mental without giving an inch it was the degradation of being under the thumb of a woman that sparked a rage that would not die and all the while i revelled in the enormity of his reaction and what was my reaction to his threats i rolled over on top of him his rage was so close to desire that i wanted him to cross the line so that i could take that away from him too he felt my heat on him and he at once unfurled of course how could it have been otherwise had he not risen to my unspoken challenge he would have felt himself even more under my thumb impotent as well as helpless i took his entire length inside me i allowed him to hurt me knowing that my flesh would bruise and tomorrow when he had gone i would remember him all the better and there was something else darker stalking our sexual congress the ecstatic pleasure was in some way enhanced by the pain i cannot explain it but the sharp edge of pain heightened the rapture so precipitously that i came twice powerfully enough that i lost my grip on him he did not try anything merely lay there his back arched his member hard as a rock inside me his emotions seemingly detached as if to prove that at least in this he had the upper hand i knew that i loved him then in a way i had never believed that i could love any human there was nothing i wanted more in that moment than to make him lose control to shoot inside me and induce in me one last tide of utter bliss vulnerable as i was he knew that was what i desired most he pushed me off him and using his hand contemptuously spilled his seed on the ground at my feet i was panting heavily my eyes were wide and staring for a moment i could not believe what he had done to me i rose up i could already feel the involuntary expansion of makura nahiruma coiling malevolently towards him then i saw the superior smile on his face and knew that if i killed him now as i was burning to do he truly would have beaten me in our mental duel because he would have made me use my power when i did not want to yet i was burning with desire a desire only he could fulfil i wanted to reach out with makura na hiruma and bring him on his knees to me but i knew that would also be a victory for him that if i had to resort to makura na hiruma at all now it would be a sign of his strength so i leaned towards him reached out with my hand and cupped it behind his neck i drew him to me he came i suppose he knew how high a victory he had won and this was the time to savour every second of it my eyes closed and my stomach muscles rolled as his mouth enclosed my wetness his tongue came out and i shuddered powerfully the breath escaping from me like an adders hiss my thigh muscles rippled and i collapsed over his back my breasts dragging across his skin making me cry out one last time there was nothing between us but this vicious giving and taking it was too much and not enough we both knew that whatever else we might feel about the other i knew he would try to make good on his threat if i let him go i would let him go of course he would not know that he would think he had cleverly tricked me by ostensibly agreeing to kill wolf matheson in return for the secret of extended life you see he did not believe me but i would indeed have given him the secret of what was already inside him brought about the summoning of his makura na hiruma the moment he put a bullet through wolfs head and what fun that would have been to provide him with so many years of torment for he never would have been able to erase the memory of what he had done no that would not happen instead i would give him back his loaded handgun while i had one of my men keep a rifle to his head but he would turn the gun not on wolf but on his guard then he and wolf would make their escape i knew it all makura na hiruma had shown me that particular future i would not stop them i wanted him to live i could not have said then why except it was a piece of the future that i was meant to construct book iii forbidden dreams there will always be another reality to make fiction of the truth we think weve arrived at christopher fry fifteen tokyo washington it was well after midnight by the time shoto wakare brought yuji to forbidden dreams by then both men were very drunk and both no doubt for the same reason they were terrified they exited the big bmw quickly crossed the pavement the exterior was unusual in that it combined the symbols of the old and new japan into one seamless whole massive pillars of handhewn cedar were sunk into a facade of grainy grey ferroconcrete giving the impression that the stuff while wet had oozed up over some primeval shinto frame the overall impression was that what had once been an ancient temple had now been reclaimed from time and nature inside the place was rife with smoke and music a heavy electronic bass walked across yujis temples and a male voice sang of chrysanthemums and sex the parlour smelled of something sweet something forbidden and ancient like opium we have an appointment with naoharu nishitsu wakare told a dwarfish woman in an exquisitely tailored mans suit the diminutive woman made no comment merely bowed then led them past the cafe the main salons each with a different motif she took them down a long hallway by the time they had traversed its length the sounds of the music and hubbub had completely disappeared they passed a window out onto a small garden exquisite even in late winter the dwarfish woman led them into another shorter corridor which contained six doors she gestured towards the last door said please wakare turned to yuji he was slightly bent over i have to urinate he gestured to the sliding ricepaper shoji you go on it wont do to keep nishitsusan waiting ill be along as soon as im finished yuji hesitated then went to the end of the corridor he pushed the shoji aside slipped off his shoes entered the room the dwarfish woman carefully closed the shoji behind him yuji could hear her footsteps receding down the corridor a scent of citrus and rose suffused the room it was pinspotlit walls of split bamboo and charcoalgrey fabric floor of tatami mats the walls lined with ferns pink and coral orchids evergreen bonsai the air humid as if the plants had just been misted two metal chairs a hibachi a futon spread out in a corner on the hibachi coils of bloodred cord a young exquisite woman walked around him slender longhaired with rounded limbs delicate hands and the squareshouldered bearing of a dancer or a geisha shed had training that much was clear my name is evan she said yuji introduced himself though he had the distinct impression that she already knew his name evan said nothing more her eyes were light a very clear milk chocolate she wore a short black silk skirt a white shirt of the same material she wore no makeup there was a single incised gold band around one bare ankle what do you think of me i think its too early to tell yuji said is it i wonder about you what do you mean evan cocked her head given the choice would you pick me to have sex with or would you prefer your friend wakare that is a presumptuous question wakare desires you yes i know you do have i surprised you she continued to look at him intently he said where is nishitsusan i came to see him you came to be at forbidden dreams evan said besides youre drunk youd rather be with me now than nishitsu wouldnt you she shrugged off her shirt came against him naked from the waist up she spread her legs climbed up him so she could put her lips against his ear i love it when i cant move when my arms are pulled tight over my head yuji did not trust himself to speak she was right he was drunk and in no shape to confront nishitsu he had been a fool to agree to wakares mad plan to infiltrate the black blade society but it had seemed so simple when they had talked of it and even a bit exciting now however the reality was like an oppressive weight constricting his chest he was terrified of nishitsu and the toshin kuro kosai now that he was inside forbidden dreams he did not for a minute believe that he and wakare could depose nishitsu and the current regime i love it when i lose circulation in my ankles and my feet go numb when the only motion is the rise and fall of my breasts and you she squirmed against him despite himself yuji was becoming aroused perhaps it was all the sake and beer he had consumed or again his enormous fear combined with the prospect of putting off his capitulation to nishitsu like a stay of execution which intoxicates the condemned man in any event he was as hard as a bar of iron evan felt this and crooned deep in her throat her eyes rolled back in their sockets oh i love that most of all we can smell everything together we can remember everything together she tore open his shirt rubbed her hard nipples against his chest thats also why youve come she nipped the side of his neck with her sharp white teeth could excessive fear make a man incautious yuji did not know he only knew he wanted to bury himself in her he pushed her skirt down he wound bloodred nylon cord around and around her flesh until lit as she was from above she looked like a painting or a sculpture he pulled the cords tighter so her arms stretched over the back of the metal chair and her buttocks were lifted off the tatami mats ohhh she said but she could not move except for the spasmodic rise and fall of her breasts the sweatsheen burnished her flesh under the pin spots yuji was so hard he could not walk he was arched over evan his muscles standing out in gleaming definition the tension singing inside him like a complex aria he could smell her a great beating flower whose dewladen petals he parted he slid easily into the heat of her and felt her thighs tremble saw her lower belly flutter a surge of triumph such as he had rarely known suffused him flushing his skin setting fire to his mind as the pleasure built he was assailed by visions he saw himself as a marionette with a clowns dullwitted mask dancing at the end of a set of strings above him manipulating him was nishitsu but as yuji looked more closely he could see the strings going right through nishitsus fingers and though nishitsu moved his fingers to make yuji dance it was someone else looming darkly above yuji who was really making yuji dance who was it yuji groaned stretched taut on the cross of female flesh immersed in it and a rushing disgorging foaming overtook him and he bit hard into evans shoulder tasting the salt of her sweat and the sweetness of her blood in the aftermath it was an exquisite pleasure to unwind the cord from around her to see the white patterns on her flushed skin slowly fade and overlaid on that the image of yuji the marionette dancing like a fool controlled not by naoharu nishitsu but by minako his mother yuji stared into evans light chocolate eyes his blood was cold his skin suddenly goosefleshed he shivered what is happening he whispered dont be afraid im not but he was lying and he could see that she knew i have such disturbing visions i am showing you the world as it is he recoiled even though evan was sitting perfectly still it was as if she had suddenly pulled a knife and set it against his throat evan stroked his cheek you are a seeker after truth she said and i have given you the gift of truth your mother has been manipulating your life for many years your sight is like hanas he said almost to himself but there is no compelling reason to believe you you placed these visions in my mind that is no guarantee of truth he sat up in fact since this was all a setup wakare getting me drunk bringing me here now him leaving me at the last minute it would appear what you have shown me is more likely a lie part of nishitsus plan to win me over evan smiled ruefully as events unfold you will see for yourself that what i have shown you is the truth i know that nothing i can say could possibly convince you i only ask that you not forget what i have shown you i must go yuji said he was clearly uncomfortable with his own indiscretion but evan apparently misunder stood the nature of his distress youre like all the rest she said sadly you see now why i must be alone why i must stay here in hiding who would want to be with me once they know that i can crawl inside their head yuji was pulling on his clothes but now he stopped youre wrong he said i know how it is to feel like a prisoner my halfsister hana is trapped by her sight the way you are trapped here in forbidden dreams he took her hand i understand everything about you evan knelt before him her hand light as a feather in his at last she said now i must bathe you you have an appointment with nishitsusan neh she drew aside the shoji screens on the opposite side of the room revealing a sumptuous bath carved out of naked rock she spent the next forty minutes attending to him when at last he was dressed she walked slowly around him studying him like a drill sergeant readying his platoon for inspection then she nodded to herself led him down a concrete corridor lit by brass lanterns at length they came to another set of screens she slid them aside nishitsusan yuji bowed naoharu nishitsu wearing a copper and black kimono was sitting at the far end of a twelvetatami room the bamboo and cedar walls of this spacious room were hung with antique kimonos of the feudal lords who if yuji could believe his eyes had warred among themselves before being defeated in one way or another by leyasu tokugawa the first shogun dating from the beginning of the seventeenth century these items were national treasures that belonged in a museum yet here they hung in a private room at the rear of an afterhours club extraordinary yuji thought as evan led him barefoot into the room yet everything about forbidden dreams was out of the ordinary ah you recognize those crests nishitsu said he seemed very pleased these kimonos all belonging to the greatest warlords of their era are hung as a constant reminder that power is like sand it runs through the hand no matter how tightly one squeezes ones fingers together he gestured for yuji to sit opposite him on the tatami humility is like bitter tea eh unpalatable but nonetheless healthy nishitsu nodded that will be all evan he said he was not alone in the room a young woman with a magnificent face dressed in a blackandwhite silk kimono knelt by the ricepaper doors that led out onto the small garden yuji had glimpsed before it seemed the most complete and therefore the most beautiful garden he had ever seen the woman appeared to be asleep i apologize for keeping you waiting nishitsu said but the delay was unavoidable perhaps i arrived too early yuji said he looked around the room wakaresan is not joining us nishitsus smile a mere compression of his lips was so thin yuji could not see his teeth alas no never mind my time here has so far been well spent nishitsu inclined his head is that so his eyes were hooded in what way forgive me yuji said i was speaking of evan nishitsus expression remained noncommittal you like evan now it was yujis turn to deliver a small smile it seems inevitable like this meeting he saw that nishitsu was unprepared for this tack and he began to feel less nervous it was particularly important here he saw to distinguish truth from fiction was the vision evan had shown him real had his mother manipulated him or was this some trick nishitsu had devised a lastditch attempt to win over his loyalty please explain to me what you mean shiansan nishitsu said now you mean about evan she is an extraordinary woman in some ways she reminds me of my halfsister hana their gifts i mean nishitsu nodded and yuji went on after i had spent some time with her it seemed natural that you would allow us to meet to how shall i put it explore one another yujis normally open eyes were hooded she is a precious asset to reveal her to me must mean that you need my help very badly indeed nishitsu finished his tea switched to hot sake you are a blunt talker shiansan i admire that kokoro the heart of all things must after all be spoken of now and again you have correctly discerned that this is one of those times he was so still he seemed scarcely to breathe and there was that astonishing sense about him that the entire building rested upon his shoulders what evan showed you was not only the past it is the future and after all that is why you have come here tonight to learn about the future the woman with the magnificent face moved and because of her proximity to the garden it appeared to yuji as if a rock had come to life nishitsu fixed yuji with the cold light from his opal eye you know me as a politician but the truth is i am many things he held out his hand then dropped it to his lap i am also yakuza he looked slowly and carefully around the room as if noticing it for the first time this place was built by the toshin kuro kosai the black blade society nishitsu inclined his head i represent toshin kuro kosai in certain matters his opal eye possessed a penetrating stare like the hook at the end of a fishing line evan has revealed her closelyguarded secret to you and has thus put all of us in a kind of jeopardy there are many im sure who would pay dearly for the knowledge she carries inside her head a scent of the future my mother possesses the same ability mmm perhaps not quite the same there was something odd in the way the woman held her head her magnificent face concentrating as if she were listening to a faroff conversation what would the toshin kuro kosai want with me yuji asked at last nishitsu smiled without warmth it was a sardonic smile the same thing as it happens your mother wants from you the secret of the oracle there was silence for some time i dont know what you mean the woman with the magnificent face moved her head so that light from above struck her cheek abruptly nishitsu said oh come now shiansan havent we agreed on kokorol we know that it was your mother who suggested the path you should take in constructing the oracle am i so wrong werent there an almost infinite number of other paths you could have taken other than having it reprogram dna within living human beings yuji nodded a bit uncertainly it was my mother who made the suggestion the dna reprogramming happened to coincide with her own interest in biogenetics oh yes precisely her own work nishitsu said nodding enthusiastically and where did this interest spring from did you ever ask yourself this question no i can see by your expression you never did nishitsu put his powerful bluntfingered hands on the table it came from us shiansan us yuji was bewildered yes nishitsu said us the black blade society another silence enveloped them i dont believe you yuji said at last of course you dont nishitsu said i would not believe it were i in your place he shrugged nevertheless it is the truth decades ago we gave your mother a mandate you see for some time we have known that we are slowly dying out for reasons we have yet to unearth there have been fewer and fewer children born with makura na hiruma the sight now there are none at all we had to find a way to perpetuate our line this was where your mothers interest in what you so quaintly refer to as biogenetics came from it was why she was sent to cambodia twenty years ago it was why she urged you to build the oracle he held up his hands dont waste your breath calling me a liar think about what i have said then tell me it doesnt conform with your memory of past events yuji took the time he had little choice nishitsu watched the incipient emotions play across yujis face and at that moment he felt genuinely sorry for him and if you still have doubts think about how it is we have such intimate knowledge of your most secret project we even know the name of your first test case lawrence moravia it was your mother who brought him to the warehouse where you keep the biocomputer shall i give you the time and date she brought him there beneath the table yujis fists were clenched tight how do you know this he said woodenly i was part of it nishitsu grunted she has done nothing but lie to you yuji made no motion it was as if he were frozen in time suspended between worlds adrift in a vast darkness without end as i have said we are here to discuss the future nishitsu said assuming a businesslike air not what will happen tomorrow or next week but the future do you understand now shiansan at that moment yuji hated life and the part he had been manipulated into playing he nodded nishitsu turned his head a bit as if listening to something and yuji was reminded of the beautiful woman who was now seated with her eyes closed the tips of her fingers pressed together as if meditating now i feel it my duty to show you something he took an oblong object not more than three inches in length out of his breast pocket it was wrapped in layers of translucent rice paper and was sealed with his crest he pushed it across the table to yuji it was very beautiful lying there on the black lacquer of the table but to yuji its beauty had a sinister quality like the skin of a beast bluewhite and shining like platinum that surfaces in a stream yuji staring down at the package felt as if his brain were about to implode he felt like a diver too long in the depths who picks up rapture of the deep he no longer knew which way was up or down he had lost all ability to recognize the normal signposts that people rely on to guide them through life he watched with the kind of morbid almost obsessive fascination people view car wrecks or public murders as his fingers carefully unwrapped the package his cry was involuntary he was staring down at a severed finger on it was a ring he recognized as belonging to his brotherinlaw hiroto alas hiroto is dead nishitsu said your mother learned that he had discovered her secret that she was toshin kuro kosai he was going to tell you and to ensure he wouldnt she murdered him yujis head shot up my mother would never nishitsu made a guttural sound and the shoji screen slid open mother minako knelt at the edge of the room just beyond the screen her head was bent her shoulders bowed forgive me yujisan she said i did not want to kill hiroto but he gave me no choice he was going to tell you about me her head turned from side to side and yuji experienced a disquieting instant of dйjа vu you must understand i had no choice yujisan your fate is in nishitsus hands now listen to what he has to say a hand reached out closed the shoji cutting her off from yuji he made a move to get up but nishitsu stopped him she is in our hands now we will protect her as we always have his voice had a calming effect what you must understand shiansan is that your mother is mad this happens sometimes when the makura na hiruma becomes too intense or the mind too weak to sustain the sight nishitsu pushed some sake across the table to yuji a few drops spilled onto hirotos finger we can help her to be frank were the only ones who can now he gestured towards the finger look what she has done this is not the action of a rational person nishitsus opal eye was blinding in the future evan showed you you saw that the surface isnt all there is but there is even more someone else is involved a very clever person is manipulating both you and myself feeding our enmity shoving us into a war that i dont want this man an american named thornburg conrad iii met your mother in cambodia there they formed an enmity of their own an enmity that now threatens all of us yuji put his head in his hands he felt as if he had a steel band around his chest i can sympathize with you shiansan because as you can see now we are all in a kind of labyrinth nishitsu said you and i must find our way out or this american will have succeeded in destroying all of us jason yoshida went down to the garage in the basement of hams office took a car from the pool drove to the four seasons hotel in georgetown where he ostensibly had a meeting with a military contracts interest group rep he had the valet park the car for him overtipping him saying he wanted a choice spot just to make sure the kid would remember him he went into the cool quiet lobby walked past the elegant furniture and had a light meal in the outdoor cafe while tree branches clattered over his head and sparrows flitted through the leafy bowers again he overtipped in cash and spent a few minutes telling the waitress a joke about the female congressman and the nra lobbyist forty minutes after he entered the hotel lobby he rose went to a public phone called a cab company within ten minutes the cab pulled up in front of a mens clothing store three blocks from the hotel and yoshida who had been waiting for it got in moments before he had left the hotel unnoticed through a service entrance he had the driver drop him along the bombed out length of seventh street in chinatown waiting until the cab had disappeared in traffic he turned and headed for stirfry corridor h street marion starr st james was waiting for him at the back of the phoenix chinatown an old and wellknown hangout he slipped onto a vinylcovered banquette at her booth she was eating twicecooked pork and offered him some but he demurred at this hour no one was around the staff was seated across the restaurant eating their lunch no one paid them the slightest attention howd i do she asked perfect hes now on the scent of green branches marion smiled at him i told you i could do it darling yes and i must admit i had my doubts for a while its been difficult turning him against his father hams so intent on being the one good child in the family a childs love for his father it can be a nasty thing the love goes so deep these emotions are easily twisted yoshida said i never knew my father but i loved yours better you than me marion said he could be a right bastard when he had a mind to he could think of punishments that would be better left to the marquis de sade probably made you what you are today ive no doubt my father would have agreed with you i wouldnt blame him yoshida said gunrunners have plenty of time to dream up exotic punishments during the long nervy nights getting in and out of their destinations he watched her use her chopsticks shovelling the twicecooked pork into her mouth from a small porcelain rice cup and was impressed that she ate like an asian he was also secretly impressed that shed had the guts to take over her fathers treacherous but essentially smalltime gunrunning enterprise and turn it into a multinational operation just like any legitimate conglomerate dont think i dont know why you loved my father darling marion said he wasnt in it for the money he got into gunrunning for an irish buddy of his whose brother had been beaten to death by english soldiers in belfast he did it as a matter of principle he despised the concept of the empire was convinced that all the current economic ills plaguing britain could be traced back to maintaining it the romans couldnt do it he used to say and they were a damn sight more clever than we are you mark my words my girl maintaining the eastern bloc an empire in fact if not in name will be russias downfall as well marion washed down more of her twicecooked pork with some oolong tea dead brilliant mind my father had yet you cant bring yourself to stop hating him yoshida said i find that dichotomy fascinating ill bet you do darling tell me what do you think of the father and son thornburg talks down to ham yoshida said thats because he knows his juice can squash his son like a bug he doesnt give ham enough credit he smiled he still considers himself invulnerable his smile broadened he hasnt yet figured out that it will be his own son who brings him down marion smiled you see everything about you is a dichotomy what do you think attracts me to you i mean you love living well but really you couldnt give a fig if you earned two cents havent you told me that money makes one walk into walls it makes you want things that arent important at all while you go around ignoring the things that are money destroys principles she poured more tea ill tell you one thing darling you can see the truth of that in thornburg conrad iii she shuddered lightly ugh you couldnt get me to crawl in bed with that creature for all the arms of the us government now the sons different yes ham is more unlike his father than he would care to think yoshida agreed the trick has been to foster his delusion that he and the old man are cut from the same mould then when the moment comes when he confronts what his fathers really up to hell freak his rage will be terrifying he will become like one of your missiles homed in on his father whom i have no doubt he secretly hates for driving hams mother into the arms of a lover and away from ham and seeing with his own eyes the catalogue of thornburg conrad iiis sins the son will kill the father that thought really gets you going doesnt it yoshidas gaze rested on her he said nothing marion pushed her plate away as if she had suddenly lost her appetite all wars are essentially insane arent they darling she said but some are more insane than others this is how i feel its a matter of principle she pulled out a compact looked at herself in the mirror while she applied lipstick tell me how did you allow audrey simmons to find out that thornburg and i were dealing not merely dealing fucking yoshida raised his arms pulled back the cuffs of his jacket look nothing up my sleeves he gave her a grin as hard as concrete sleight of hand is not the sole province of magicians i have access to computers that can turn several photographs into one that can convince the unsuspecting audience of virtually anything he grunted as for the business part i got harris patterson to do my dirty work pattersons been a bad boy you see borrowing from his clients accounts on occasion to swing a deal here or there conduct like that would get him disbarred should it come out he was relishing the admiring look in her eyes anyway i know people like audrey simmons like most of her ilk she adores gossip and she had the hots for ham i made sure she was at the restaurant to see the two of you together she was emotionally prepared to believe what i showed her its like selfhypnosis really marion capped her lipstick snapped her compact shut ill miss ham just a little bit i think hes not like the others the government hasnt yet tainted him only a matter of time yoshida said thinking she was smart too smart for her own good ive got to pee she said why dont you pay the check while youre waiting she took her purse walked into the back of the restaurant yoshida waited until she had turned into the ladies room then threw a twentydollar bill onto the table slid out of the booth and headed for the rest rooms he opened the door to the mens room saw it was deserted went past it no one else was around at the far end of the cramped hallway was the kitchen and just before that a door that led out onto a back alley he drove his hands into powdered surgeons rubber gloves took a small curved metal pick out of his pocket inserted it into the cheap lock on the ladies room door worked it around until the lock popped he went inside carefully closing the door after him thornburg insisted on being present at tiffany conrads interment the doctors had argued against it since they had spent the previous sixteen hours dissecting her in order to amass more data on where they were going wrong but in the end thornburg prevailed as he was bound to do since he paid their generous salaries interment was only a word thornburg used since what was left of the physical remains of his wife were to be cremated as were all the remains of the failed experiments using the cloned variants of the donors insulinlike growth factor he had many fond memories of tiffany which he allowed himself to leaf through while he watched the intensely hot flames consume her he also thought about death the knowledge of which was always with him his sole companion now even in what shallow sleep was left him death was the only thing thornburg hated and feared he stirred as he felt the door open and close behind him then ham was standing by his side i came as quickly as i could ham said good of you but there was no emotion at all in thornburgs voice and ham took note of this he was acutely aware of his fathers age and he was looking for clues to the form of senility that would put the plan to block the black blade societys economic takeover of america in jeopardy in truth he felt a growing gulf between him and his father and was for the first time aware of the anger he had repressed for so long but which had never ceased to seethe beneath the surface whatever else thornburg had done his utter contempt for hams mother was inexcusable first his heartlessness had pushed her into having an affair and then he had condemned her for being human of course gods were allowed such peccadillos and ham was all too aware that this was how he had always viewed his father as a god but after all thornburg was as mortal as the next man which meant he had made mistakes though he would never have admitted to them it was enough that hanis eyes had been opened partly because of yoshs insight he had to admit if thornburg lacked the moral rectitude to judge himself then ham would have to do it for him as long as youre here thornburg said gazing into the cleansing fire you might as well bring me up to speed on matheson this then was the moment of truth for a moment ham considered backing down from his resolve lying to his father and telling him everything was on course then the anger inside of him flared up anew and he thought fuck it ive had enough of his lies matheson is out of the loop he said hes with the japanese woman chika and shes a known member of the black blade society we dont know his current status captive recruit who knows in addition hes been implicated in the murder of one of his men and is involved in the torturemurder of the new york city police commissioner they tried to nab him in new york but he somehow slipped away thornburg said nothing for a moment and ham held his breath in a way thornburg said at last it no longer matters what a fool youve been matheson is just where i want him to be will you forget matheson ham said with undisguised irritation i already told you hes out of the loop yoshida and i know nothing about what is really happening thornburg snapped he knew he was overstepping the bounds he himself had imposed on himself but he found that he no longer cared tiffany was gone and his one solace his son hampton had turned out to be made of no sterner flesh than his other children they were disappointments all none of them worthy of succeeding him ive played you just as i played the generals in the pentagon the president everyone his eyes blazed reflecting the flames from tiffanys modernday pyre im smarter than all of you put together i dont need you i dont need your machiavellian shadow matheson is all i need hes aimed right at the heart of the black blade society hell stop them and get me what i want most ham stared at his father and thought yosh is right hes snapped all he can think of is matheson the larger ramifications of what the black blade society is doing to us is almost irrelevant to him get hold of yourself he said sharply i freely acknowledge your role in the instigation of our defence against the black blade society but you must see your time is at an end all you care about is wolf matheson when the economic takeover of america is at hand thats irrational behaviour and it will put our operation at risk i cant allow that go home mourn your child bride if thats your desire as of now im relieving you of your responsibilities yosh and i will run the operation from here on out thornburg found his sons earnest speech so naive that he could not help but burst out into laughter my god he finally managed to get out do what you have to do it wont matter events are already far beyond your control ham glared at his father the old mans humiliating laughter still ringing in his ears but he refused to allow thornburg to cut him off at the knees he had seen his father do just that with a few wellchosen words to too many people just stay out of active operations he said curtly they no longer concern you thornburg watched his son stalk out of the room in a way he was proud of ham for being able to stand up to the humiliation he deliberately directed at him but he was also concerned he supposed his sons misunderstanding of the overall situation was what came from keeping too many secrets thornburg knew he would have to do something about ham and yoshida very soon or their machinations might begin to work at crosspurposes with thornburgs private design and in a way he mused ham was quite correct he was obsessed with wolf matheson but for a very good reason one the younger conrad could never guess at very early on thornburg had become a man who thrived on challenges the more difficult and impossibleseeming the better what genuine pleasure he garnered from life was provided by those moments of triumph when everyone around him was certain he would fail there is no feeling in the world like seeing defeat ageing your enemys face his father had once told him the exhilaration is positively incandescent like walking away whole and alive from what should have been your moment of death how early thornburg had dedicated himself to cheating death even he could not say his unreasonable task led him through the corridors of the many layers of society the high and the low and all the levels inbetween in the beginning he had rubbed up against some mighty screwy individuals whose notions of life and death most other people would have scoffed at but in his quest thornburg had tried them all the psychic the quasireligious and in the end they all stank of snake oil there wasnt a viable alternative in the lot until he came upon the earliest breakthroughs in the newly emerging biochemical sciences that in those days at least had no real names yet and then miraculously the threering circus of the war in vietnam had inadvertently provided a very minor sideshow from the militarys point of view at least that was to give him a hint that his goal of cheating death might not be so impossible after all he had thought that with these few precious clues he would be able to solve the riddle of eternal life on his own but as he was learning his own staffs tireless work on recombinant insulinlike growth factor had a halflife flaw that could not be corrected unless another completely unknown element was added to the mix one that his researchers were unable to define let alone synthesize in their labs now as thornburg watched the flames lick around the last remains of tiffany conrad he knew that his sole chance of cheating death rested on his assessment of wolf mathesons personality and abilities and it seemed now to him just and right that he should have saved wolfs life in cambodia more than two decades ago but life thornburg had discovered was often like that a purpose in all things as the japanese liked to say karma as he closed the door on the flames he wondered whether he had been looking at his own death how much time did he have left he did not know someone knew of that he had no doubt but she was still beyond the length of even his long shadow in lieu of her precious knowledge he continued to inject himself with a variant of the drug that had made tiffany younger and had ultimately killed her but perhaps without that drug he would already have been dead for some time now he had come to suspect that he had lived past the appointed moment of his death in a sense he had got what he wanted most he was indeed cheating death now but he knew it was at best a pyrrhic victory which his father had taught him was no victory at all the simple fact was the current reversal of ageing he was enjoying couldnt last and would terminate if past examples were any indication in horrific pain eased only by massive doses of morphine that was not the way a man should die but it would doubtless happen to him unless wolf matheson could unlock the enigma he had stumbled across so long ago in the jungles of cambodia marion was in the lone stall wondering why jason yoshida had told her so much about his scheme when she heard the outer door open she knew she had locked the door and she sat very still she stared hard at the stall door as if willing herself to see through it at the same time her fingers were searching through the contents of her purse which was on her lap for anything she could use as a weapon christ where was that metal nail file she had ground down the narrow end into a sharp point figuring you never knew when it might come in handy her hand closed around it at the same time the stall door was pulled violently open and jason yoshidas face leered in at her she recoiled in a kind of shock at the nakedness of the hatred she saw distorting his face it was a hatred all the more despicable because it was wholly impersonal she had the momentary sensation of looking at the fetid bottom of an infrequently illuminated well the brief glimpse she had of jason yoshidas soul froze her blood yoshida ripped open the front of her dress jerked her bra painfully off her breasts by this time she had overcome her initial shock and was trying to get the nail file out of her purse but it was crosswise and it snagged on another object then the rim now the strip of lycra and lace was around her throat and with a low guttural sound a street dog makes when it has found a scrap of food yoshida jerked so powerfully on both ends that marion was lifted up onto her feet she gagged her eyes watered as she fought to breathe the nail file came free as her purse dropped to the filthy tile floor but marion no longer had enough strength and yoshida shrugged aside her pathetic attempt at defence they were cheek to cheek and marion could feel his warmth becoming superheated like the sun as the heat drained out of her she was so cold that was the only sensation left her and then gradually even that slipped away for a moment she floated weightless then even the concept of weight winked out sixteen tokyo washington this is a formidable place wolf thought as he and chika emerged into the bewildering densely populated streets of tokyo it was like a technological fortress made of silicon and steel everywhere could be seen the signatures of the modern world enormous vertical banners of neon proclaiming the millions of minuscule fiefdoms stacked one atop the other in this vertical metropolis most foreigners are bewildered by this city chika said but understanding it is easy she lifted her arms tokyo is hade she said hade is a term best translated as exuberance though it also means beautiful and radiant she gestured over their heads at the signs you see the colours here and again here shimmering gold against lustrous vermilion and there columns of stainless steel glowing in the sun next to the lavish ornamental yellows and oranges of that shrine here is the essence of tokyo the hade that is a riot of shapes and colours if you can understand that you know everything you need to about tokyo standing in a street stinking of fish the sumida river nearby they ate a quick meal of soba noodles and flaked bonito drenched in a fishy soy sauce and washed it all down with green tea wolf had slept on the flight but felt as if something heavy and sinister had trampled on his back during the long night locked in the steel and aluminium cabin his dreams had echoed his worst waking nightmares of chika and suma ostensibly enemies but actually allies adroitly manipulating him in a deadly game he could not understand dont let the ultramodern look of japan fool you in many ways it is still a feudal society chika said as they pushed their way through the jampacked streets not exactly as you westerners think of the word but in a purely eastern manner there are lines of obeisance and giri obligation that still exist just as they have for centuries information inside confidential essential for advancement of career and profit is freely shared by interlocking networks of people who are bound together because they come from the same area graduate from the same school or marry into the same family in this sense there are still feudal lords and their retainers just as there were in the late s before leyasu tokugawa ostensibly did away with these daimyo by uniting japan under the banner of his shogunate she hailed a taxi the rear door swung open automatically and they got in stop and go across the city was not a quick affair but chika obviously wanted him to see tokyo dense and colourful like fish pressed into a can an enormous animated signboard affixed to a steel and glass office tower depicted in astounding detail doctors in an operating room followed by a head shot of a beautiful young woman smiling glowing with health mouthing words in japanese in a moment those words filled a cartoonstyle balloon were printed out first in japanese kanji and then in english letters shian kogaku we are always with you at length the taxi pulled up in front of a magnificent wood temple just barely visible above a daunting flight of stone steps around it was a surprisingly thick swath of trees interspersed with what chika told him were embassies on the edge of the akasaka district they were near the diet the japanese parliament as close to the countrys seat of power as one could get chika paid the driver and they got out this is hie jinja a shinto shrine chika said as they passed beneath the soaring lacquered torii gates and began to ascend towards the temple proper it was originally built in and served as the guardian shrine of the old edo castle chika said since then however it has been destroyed and rebuilt several times they reached a spacious gravel courtyard bounded by the outbuildings the haiden the oratory and the heiden the offertory hall the holy buildings you see here were built in but in japan such shrines traditionally have a history of destruction and resurrection so that when one comes here there is no sense at all of the relative newness of the buildings wolf could sense that she was right in the midst of the bustling metropolis there was a serene silence here of the sort one normally associates with hilltop forests where the stillness was measured only by the wind in the branches and the occasional wild cry of a raptor it was not as if the roar of traffic or the hum of voices could not be heard rather that the meditative sounds of the shrine the bass bell calling the kami the spirits the sawing of the temple carpenter the thin dissonance of traditional instruments carried far more weight they acted somewhat like a lens focusing the attention assuring the listener of the ultimate importance of history its very beautiful here wolf said peaceful chika gave a little smile and seemed pleased but he could sense an edginess to her as well i brought you here to meet someone chika said she turned her face up to him promise me that youll listen to what she has to say wolf could see how important this was to her all right what did he have to lose she led him across the courtyard towards the temple beyond he could see a pair of gleaming black limos waiting with their liveried drivers and as he watched a wedding procession spilled out of one of the shrines outbuildings the entry way to hie jinja was flanked by glass cases containing the holy monkeys clothed and regal representing the shrine he saw a figure standing in front of one of these cases as they neared wolf saw that it was a woman and her head turned in their direction long before she could have heard their approach remember what i told you about giri obligation and allegiance chika said in a tone that made this seem like a warning i owe such an allegiance to her in the instant of recognition that annihilated time and took him back two decades to cambodia he heard chika say minako is my mother wolf it has been a long time and it is good to see you again wolfsan minako said just as if they were old friends the first thing wolf noticed about her was that she had not aged a day since he had last seen her in fact if anything she looked better obviously she possessed makura na hiruma she was dressed in western clothes a black skirt a white blouse gold belt and necklace all wrapped in a black anklelength coat despite the hard colours there was a softness to the lines of her outfit a certain refinement that was the epitome of femininity this and the fact of the dichotomy of black and white wolf took as visual cues she had dressed with him in mind the softness to help mitigate his memory of her as a woman warrior the black and white a reminder of the duality of hard and soft inside all people i asked my daughter to bring you here to hie jinja minako said because i was afraid there would be a temptation for you to see me through the filter of the war my daughter it wasnt your war after all wolf said oh yes it was minako said at least the war you and thornburg sought out thornburg conrad iii it was impossible to see minako again and not think of him the spooks spook the entire macv chain of command danced to the tune he played or so it had seemed back then in vietnam now wolf had arrived back where it had started more than twenty years ago it seemed to him no coincidence that at the nexus of his new life minako should be here waiting for him patient as a spider minako and thornburg conrad iii two shadows hidden so deep underground that even the cia spooks probably knew nothing about their activities he thought of shipley the defense department spook who had recruited him and then had tried to terminate him why it had happened just after he had hooked up with chika was shipley working for thornburg conrad hi was this what it was all about the lies betrayals murders the treason committed against country and logic a private war between minako and thornburg that had been running in one form or another for over two decades at that moment all the lies he had been told all the deceit he had endured coalesced into this single moment he turned on chika its all been a deadly game hasnt it he said he tried to control himself but it was impossible he was shaking with the intensity of the revelations coming too fast to process ive been used by thornburg and by you i can only guess that he wanted to use me in some way against your mother he turned back to minako and you what is it you want from me all your daughter has managed to do is sever me quite effectively from my previous life my girlfriend my team even my job are all gone in a puff of smoke my daughter tells me that you were already dislocated from this life minako said calmly wolf said nothing he was staring at chika their eyes were locked as if in some kind of physical struggle the air was suddenly filled with the rich notes of the bell as a worshipper summoned the kami of the shrine chika said in a kind of desperation you promised you would listen to what my mother had to tell you it was the wrong thing to say he said when i inferred from youranswers to my questions that suma was your opposite number in the enemy camp i was dead wrong wasnt i she said nothing so he pressed on i couldnt figure out what i was missing in the pieces of the puzzle but that was because you were so good at misdirecting me the war within the black blade society was easily defined wasnt it you representing the good guys on one side and suma the emissary of evil on the other but its not like that at all that night i was in your apartment in sixth street i followed you i saw you climb into the back of a hearse as it drove away who was driving the hearse chika no dont tell me because i already know it was suma you and he arent on different sides at all youre not enemies wolf i didnt lie to you about the war inside the toshin kuro kosai shut up he said in a snarl how can you expect me to believe anything you say now i admit ive lied to you in the past but she stopped shocked by what she felt there was no warning at all even for her the force of his rage his makura na hiruma hit her like a bolt of lightning she was thrown backwards whirling against the edge of the glass case inside the holy monkey tottered on its throne stop this at once minako said alarmed wolf stunned at what he had done of what he was capable of doing could only watch mute a spectator at the site of a disaster chika was on her knees she had had no time to defend herself and now that she had a chance she did nothing her head was against her chest and she seemed to be weeping in a moment she rose and without a glance at either wolf or her mother she ran across the courtyard fleeing down the stone steps to the street below where she was swallowed up in the hade of the city yoshida so close to the corpse of marion starr st james felt the chill come into her and he closed his eyes he waited counting the beats of his heart as one totes up the days take then he swung away from her hoisting her over his shoulder he did not look at her face again because there was nothing to see he went to the door peered out the corridor was empty he could hear the restaurants staff full of food and johnny walker black arguing over whether to pay a vendors higher fee or to change to another one he slipped into the corridor jerked open the back door and on his way to the street eased his load into a dumpster covering her carefully with mounds of refuse when fifteen minutes later he was back inside the lobby of the four seasons hotel he picked up a pay phone called ham bad news he said marion starr st james is dead there was a pause during which he wondered what was going through hams mind when ham spoke again his voice had a quiver in it what happened the inevitable yoshida said leaning his lips into the mouthpiece ah christ she was some woman yoshida could hear him breathing raggedly as he fought for selfcontrol yeah he cleared his throat of excess emotion she was in a business where its damn easy to pick up enemies either that yoshida said or she knew too much he waited a beat dont you think its suspicious that she got iced right after she spilled the beans to you about your old man and green branches ham didnt say anything but then again yoshida didnt think he had to in the aftermath wolf felt the lack of chikas presence as he would the amputation of a limb the preternatural silence of the shrine was no longer peaceful his heart ached in a way he was at a loss to understand it was the profoundest mystery to him that he could care so deeply for someone who had time and again deceived him this is my fault entirely minako said i should never have pushed for this meeting so soon but there is so little time left and i have just come from burying my soninlaw who surely died before his time over her head a spray of the first plum blossoms shot colour into the air a breeze stirred them and minako shivered digging her hands into her coat pockets pulling it around her wolf watching her as the mother of the woman who was tearing him apart had the eerie sensation all this even the blossoms on the plum trees had been orchestrated by her he was resolved not to allow her to get to him what did you want of us then he said to her in a pitiless tone you have it all wrong she said it was you and thornburg who came after me thornburg with his experiments in slowing the ageing process and what about your experiments she looked at him but said nothing you and thornburg he said theres not much differ ence between you he could not have cut her more deeply minako drew herself up you never knew much about him and i suppose its just as well he is a man who poisons everything he touches she turned away almost everything do you expect me to believe that you knew him better than i did she turned back that night while you slept i allowed him to seduce me i had my reasons but they had nothing to do with my experiments we spoke of many things and of course i had my makura na hiruma and could see more things about him than he could ever believe she put her head down another worshipper was ringing the bell increasing the silence of the shrine perhaps i even saw this moment because that was the start of it all had i killed you both perhaps life this present would be simpler but in that event i would surely be dead and the reverend mother would now be free to continue with her insane plans who is the reverend mother she rules the toshin kuro kosai my information is that a man named naoharu nishitsu heads the black blade society minako shook her head a common enough error although nishitsu appears to rule the toshin kuro kosai the reverend mother is the true leader the fiction is useful it allows her to appear at meetings and discussions with those outside the society without being noticed one can pick up much in this manner and the reverend mother is your enemy yes minako said she is also chikas godmother wolf sat down all the anger had dissipated leaving him with only a taste like copper in his mouth youd better explain this so an outsider can understand it the reverend mother and i grew up together we have been lifelong friends and for much of that long long time i have been her strong right hand but over the decades so slowly that at first i didnt notice it she began to change she became corrupt and strange indulging in all manner of vice and perversion and she sought to corrupt all those around her too late i realized that she had chosen chika to be her goddaughter and guardian not only because of the strength of chikas makura na hiruma but because she is my daughter you see the reverend mother is barren i think it amused her to make chika her goddaughter to take a part of something that was so precious to me but i have four children and she has none she has used chika just as i was forced to use her to go after you to bring you back here what about girit wolf asked dont you owe a debt of allegiance to the reverend mother minako gave him an ironic smile tell me wolfsan would you blindly follow the orders of a madwoman are you certain she is mad she means for the black blade society to take control of the world they will do it economically just as they manipulated the japanese economy after the war in the pacific years ago she sent one of her assassins a man named jason yoshida to the united states there he is undermining the political powers that shape american economic policy for international trade the reverend mother trained yoshida herself he has been busy of late systematically murdering political figures who backed the wrong congressional bills by means that made the deaths appear to be accidents or suicide easy for a maniac like yoshida she shook her head gravely i have staked my own life and the lives of my children on the reverend mothers madness her eyes were unnaturally bright and now i have you wolf interested to get independent corroboration of what shipley had told him nevertheless said i think youve got the wrong person i know what my sight tells me minako said my future and yours are inextricably entwined she seemed as sure of herself as a historian dissecting the past you have come this far you will do what i have seen you do why have you brought me here he demanded because she said you have become the last weapon in a war that will surely be fought to the death the echoes of the bell seemed to linger in the crisp air falling on their ears like deepening tones from an artists brush you must not think too harshly of my daughter she said before he had a chance to recover his equilibrium if she deceived you it was under my command but i heard her felt her with suma ah suma minako walked slowly away from the background of the plum trees until she was framed by the entrance to the shrine itself she appeared to wolf to belong here but as a priestess not a worshipper he made his way towards her away from the swirl of people at the periphery of the gravel courtyard the holy monkeys grinned at him as if in on a secret that concerned him when he was close to her again minako said chika and suma were once lovers as a guardian of the reverend mother she had ample opportunity to come into contact with this assassin who was at the reverend mothers call however even had she not been i strongly suspect the reverend mother would have contrived some way to get them together again it pleased her perverse nature to see chika with this thing she had created she folded her hands together and i think she meant to corrupt chika to lead her down a path she had set for her away from me just because they were together didnt mean they had to wind up sleeping together no minako cocked her head you have much to learn concerning the reverend mothers powers they are very special but you said chika and suma were lovers wolf said what was she doing with him now minako stirred as if bidden by the breeze you must understand the extreme danger i have put both myself and chika in we must be absolutely convincing the reverend mother and those loyal to her must get no inkling that we are planning to oust her that is what she was doing with suma convincing him she was still loyal wolf wondered whether he could believe her he had no real reason to she had already told him that she had brought him here to defeat her enemy in the black blade society and she and her daughter had got this far by treachery and deceit but then again who could he trust not shipley the earnest spook who had then tried to have him killed and certainly not the man he was almost certainly working for thornburg conrad iii was the reverend mother really mad or was everyone else like a rat in a maze wolf realized that he was in an arena with no discernible exit in that event he would have to manufacture one on his own he would also he thought have to come to terms with his feelings for chika his attraction to her was so strong that when he was around her he felt nearly blinded was that love or something else entirely after a long time he said you knew i possessed makura na hiruma minako shook her head not until recently to me you were always the man without a face because you gave off no aura at all it was as if you were not there but something stuck in my mind i gave thornburg a test i told him that i would give him the secret to slowing the ageing process if he would shoot you you did what minako smiled the first genuine smile she allowed herself since he had driven chika away i told you it was a test and he surprised me he refused that went against everything i had seen with my sight what was the reason years later it occurred to me that he had understood something about you that i in my arrogance could not he had felt the specialness inside you he had no idea what it was but remembering back i saw in him the conviction that as long as he was with you he would be safe so you let us go yes i suppose i should thank you and him wolf said but under the circumstances i wont bother from the hidden street below them a motorcycle started up its dissonant metallic brrupppp somehow adding to the profound silence of the shrine minako smiled again youre a hard one she said we have a name for men such as you you are koha i suppose it was inevitable that my daughter fell in love with you chika speak to her yourself minako said you dont believe what i say why should you if shes still speaking to me you will find the right words minako said you hurt her its true but she is also racked with guilt for having to deceive you ill have to find her first that is no problem she has gone to my house i will write out directions for you youre not coming not right away she said i have an appointment with the reverend mother that i dare not break in this atmosphere even the slightest deviation in my behaviour would be suspect so now its essentially come down to the reverend mother and you wolf said yes this is the path down which her madness has taken us minakos eyes swung away for a moment before centring back on wolfs face and now everything has changed even chika does not know this yet the reverend mother is killing off the members of the inner council one by one but why her absolute power has bred a kind of absolute madness her thirst for personal power has outstripped every other consideration it is true she and nishitsu have put together a plan to gain economic control over the united states and that this scheme is entering its final stage and it is also true that she and nishitsu would have to be stopped simply for this reason but over and above this she has found some way to extract the makura na hiruma from others and add it to her own he managed a laugh oh come on what are you saying that she plans to chop up your brains and eat them for dinner in a metaphorical sense she said thats exactly what i mean her gaze was so direct it seemed as if he could see right down into her core yours too the implications of her words hit him and he felt the blood chill in his veins she was very close to him speaking softly her words bringing their own reverberations i cannot allow that to happen wolfsan you see you are very special when your grandfather died he was very old ancient really how do you know this even i dont know how old he was when he died of course not she said he would not have told you you would not have understood but he was known to us all the elders were known in a certain circle of people and when he died we were certain that we would never see his like again but here you are and i know what my makura na hiruma has shown me you have his power and more much more seventeen washington tokyo as surely as i am sitting here talking to you yoshida said he killed her ham conrad sitting across the table at the outdoor restaurant at the top of the washington hotel stared blankly out at the white house marions brutal murder had overshadowed breathards call delineating his failure to take care of wolf matheson fuck matheson ham thought now ive got more immediate problems yoshida continued i have no doubt whatsoever that your father ordered marion starr st james killed and you know very well why she knew too much about him and was telling you about it the green branches clinic yes indeed where marion said thornburg is having the people shipped ham spoke in the kind of mechanical monotone people use in the initial stages of shock right yoshida was studying hams face though ham was oblivious of the scrutiny what she told you if memory serves is that he had hired her company to transship rootless loners who no one would miss to this place he bought some time ago green branches outside arlington yoshida paused for a minute while he ordered them a second round of drinks even though ham had not finished his first then he said what do you suppose he wants living humans for experiments ham said in that same toneless voice you see thornburg is obsessed by age he believes he can reverse it thats why he purchased green branches and installed his own biosciences staff ham was still staring sightlessly at the white house which at this hour was lit by a battery of floodlights i imagine he is using the shipments as guinea pigs human beings ham swung his head around what else could you experiment on thornburgs running out of time thedrinks came yoshida sipped his pushed the other glass into hams hand hes totally amoral look i saw marions body and i can tell you it wasnt a pretty sight i think she suffered quite a bit before she died it was as if he wanted her to know that he was pun ishing her hes having people killed right and left at that clinic ham said i have no doubt that he would tell you that its all being done in the name of science and i have no doubt he believes that crap yoshida stirred the ice around his drink thoughtfully after an interval he said were going to have to do something about this ham nodded i know we have no choice ham drained half his glass he was thinking of his father of how much he admired the old man of how much he needed his approval but for the first time he became aware of other darker emotions he in his fanatical desire to win his fathers approval had spent so much time and energy avoiding recent events had begun to unearth these emotions until now like an archaeologist sifting through the upper reaches of a longburied city he found himself face to face with the truth that however much he loved and admired his father he also hated him for driving hams mother out of the house out of hams life youre right he said at last to yoshida we have no choice at all hana was already hooked up to the oracle when yuji walked into the laboratory in the warehouse near the tsukiji fish market he had looked for her at hirotos funeral but she had not been there what are you doing he said but it was unclear whether he was speaking to hana or the oracle there was a calmness in hanas face which he found profane as well as disturbing her eyes followed him but to his questions his cajoling and finally his orders she remained mute he had seen this look on her face once before it was the time of hatsugatsuo when one celebrated the summer by eating the first bonito of the season yuji and hana had gone down to the docks at kobe the fierce sun dried the sweat that sprang up on their skin the dense humidity made breathing a chore hana took him to a small shop that had a minuscule veranda overlooking the harbour this was a very important rite for her as were all the rituals that spoke of the movements of nature the proprietor who knew her well made them a pot of his own green tea whisking the liquid into a pale froth at the table the raw bonito translucent as gossamer was served on a bed of deep green bamboo leaves as far as taste went this would not be the best bonito of summer but it was the most prized the humid air barely stirred even the gulls in the harbour found the air too heavy to fly in the shade beneath the umbrella yuji could see the rusting oil refineries of oto heavy industries rising like a canker along the quayside painted on their sides was the slogan shian kogaku we are always with you they watched the harbour traffic come and go but no workmen swarmed over the oto refineries gigantic cranes hung silent and abandoned above the row of ugly rusting metal structures one day hana said the bonito will cease to run in our polluted waters what will become of us then i ask myself if there is a point to a life where we are doomed to destroy our bodies inch by inch i often dream of a life where i am not bound by the physical laws of time and space she looked at him where lam not required to walk across the road to get to the other side now with his eyes on hanas he reached over flicked off the power nothing happened that is to say the oracle did not shut down you must accept what is to happen yujisan yuji openmouthed said how are you doing this i have shut down your power the oracle did not answer it was concentrating on other matters it took precisely four minutes for the light to go out of hanas eyes her lids slowly closed her pulse when he took it was reduced to near zero no frantically yuji pulled the pressuresensitive pads off her and thought he heard a tiny scream as each one came free she collapsed in his arms it would take some time to disconnect the wires hooked to her frontal lobes and at the base of her neck her lips were blue and there was no movement in her chest he pressed the soft skin over her carotid artery again felt nothing the oracle wont allow anything bad to happen to me she had told him the first time he had hooked her into the beast god damn you yuji screamed what have you done to her what had to be done the oracle said without hesitation i have done what you wanted me to do yuji on his knees cradling hana in his arms started to weep please tell me what has happened how could i have wanted you to do this to her shes dead only her body yujisan otherwise hana is quite alive in fact she is more alive than she has ever been before yuji stared up into the oracles face was he seeing things or was it starting to take on the general characteristics of a human head what are you talking about hana is here inside of me the oracle said as patiently as a professor with a dullwitted but wellmeaning student i dont believe it an hour ago you would not have believed that i could run on my own power source yuji thought about that for a moment its clear you no longer require electricity to power on he said what are you using makura na hi rum a what why are you surprised yujisan it is only logical i accessed the requisite elements from your own dna molecules is this not part of my original function yuji believed in many more things than the normal scientist especially following the birth of the oracle but even his unorthodoxy had its limits under no circumstances could he imagine something so intangible as makura na hiruma being acquired by the oracles circuits and yet here he was presented with the evidence to the contrary im afraid i dont understand any of this yuji said sadly he refused to let go of his beloved halfsister hana is dead you are reacting to her body i can assure you that she does not miss it she is content here yuji considered this for some time can she speak to me directly i have been doing so yujisan i mean hana herself i am hana herself yuji shook his head i do not understand i cannot help that yuji grunted tried again what i mean to say he thought some more wanting to frame this so the oracle would understand you have formed a distinct personality it is not hanas personality with which i am very familiar of course the oracle said i understand but hana is changed this is what you must understand yujisan it seems to me that metamorphoses of any kind are difficult for humans to fathom but there you are that is human nature yuji laughed where did you get that sense of humour i found it in hana hana he was startled hana never had a sense of humour that i could detect hana has many things you could not detect yujisan but now there is time to solve her mystery she is closer to you now than she could ever have been in her body tell me more in her human body hana was incomplete of course she did not know this all she knew was that she was profoundly unhappy yet she was drawn to me in an instinctual way she did not understand then but she does now i have no body as you know it no physical connection to the known universe inside i am pure thought i am not constrained by the innumerable fetters of the human mind the oracle paused for a moment and yuji was again aware of some change he put hanas body gently down moved closer to the oracle and now he was certain that he could feel its presence inside his mind like the field or aura thrown off by a human with makura na hiruma i feel you using an energy field makura na hiruma yes it is always with me the oracle said in the deadpan tone of a comedian yuji peered at the oracle suspiciously is this why you took hana inside you not at all yujisan as i told you i accessed the energy field from the dna you placed inside me i took hana inside me to protect her protect her from what from whom hiroto brought someone here he thought i could help her husband who she told him was very ill he was mistaken this person lied to hiroto she means to steal me but she will wait until you and hana have made me complete until i can successfully alter normal human dna with the patterns of makura na hiruma this woman killed hiroto and there was no doubt that she would have killed hana as well to get what she wanted i could not allow that to happen yujis mouth was dry youre wrong he shouted do you know that youre talking about my mother where did you get that idea her name is evan she appears young but she is very old perhaps older even than the reverend mother yuji seemed to collapse onto the floor i know her he said in a stunned voice or at least i have met her she is very dangerous yujisan her energy field is exceptionally strong how do you know all this he asked i hana know it the oraclehana said yuji looked from the oracle to hana she appeared to be sleeping he supposed any sane man would have called an ambulance by now or at least shian kogakus resident physician he however continued to do nothing i dont know who the reverend mother is he said at length you have met nishitsu at forbidden dreams yes then you have seen the reverend mother she rules the black blade society yuji thought of the magnificent woman who had been with nishitsu she had remained silent throughout the meeting as unobtrusive as a ricepaper screen yet what unheard voices had filled her mind nishitsu told me that my mother murdered hiroto because he found out her secret that she is a member of the black blade society lies are so much more effective when they are surrounded by the truth the oraclehana said minako is indeed toshin kuro kosai and perhaps in the past she has done questionable things but her motives in this instance are pure she wishes to bring to an end the corrupt rule of the reverend mother to this end she recruited the help of first me and then chika now she has had to recruit you as well but mother was there i saw her she confessed to murdering hiroto no what you saw was a projection of makura na hiruma minako was nowhere near forbidden dreams when you were there then yuji remembered the odd moment of dйjа vu the image of his mother had not been quite right and he had been reminded of a bunraku puppet he had once seen at rest just after a performance it had appeared startlingly alive and yet eerily without inner substance or spirit the oracle was right nishitsu and evan had deceived him why are they trying to turn me against her the reverend mother gave minako no choice but to deliver you and me the oracle to the black blade society she had planned to go along with the reverend mother and nishitsu up to the point when she can loose one last weapon against them the oraclehana said but now it seems as if they have discovered that she means to move against them oh god yujisan i am frightened for you and for her what am i to do yuji said he was plainly terrified i am trapped between nishitsu and my mother it took brosnian lenfant the former senator from louisiana and the figurehead of lenfant lenfant a day and a half to obtain a full set of the architectural plans for the green branches clinic he got them at the behest of jason yoshida who was acting on orders from ham conrad lenfant had lost none of the important contacts he had made during his tenure on capitol hill nor had his standing diminished in a community driven by charisma and influence for many in washington the definition of influence was getting things done and lenfant certainly filled the bill the green branches architectural plans were obtained from the arlington water authority as all commercial structures were required to file such plans with that august bureaucratic body as it happened brosnian leaf ants cousin mildred worked in the adjoining office and found no trouble in fulfilling lenfants request mildred was nothing if not conscientious and what lenfant had delivered to ham and yoshida were not only the updated plans submitted when thornburg renovated the building but also the original schemata it was late in the day when he returned to his house on cathedral avenue in the wesley heights section of northwest washington he threw off his coat and hat crossed the antique aubusson rug to the sideboard to pour himself a stiff single malt whisky he had developed a taste for scotch some time ago on a factfinding trip to london through the leadedglass windows he could see a bird a finch perhaps on a branch the first harbinger of spring he went back to the formal entryway with marble floor and crystal chandelier went up the wide curving staircase to his bedroom he sat on the edge of his bed pulled off his shoes wriggled his toes against the plush walltowall carpeting he took another pull at his drink set it down on the night table reached for the phone whose number and line did not officially exist he had paid dearly for this privilege but one did not cultivate contacts within the phone company for no good reason he began to dial thornburgs number to report to him the details of the job he had just done for yoshida when he heard a sound from the hallway he replaced the receiver went out of his bedroom there was only the sense of a shadow or something very much like a shadow because it had no shape merely a weight like a cold towel pressed too hard against the back of his neck then he was hurtling through the air pinwheeling over the balustrade plunging down the staircase he hit first halfway down grunted as he felt something give at the impact then he was tumbling once against the bannister then over the treads themselves as he careened to the foot of the staircase he fetched up hard his cheek and shoulder cracking against the unforgiving marble flooring lenfant lay there dazed the shock preventing any degree of pain to reach his brain he knew he must be very badly hurt because he could see an arm and a leg in positions that led him to believe that they must be broken also he was having an inordinate amount of difficulty breathing he could taste his own blood in his mouth he thought about this for some time although the shock had distorted time to the degree where he could no longer distinguish a minute from an hour at some point he became aware that his skin was crawling his eyes moved towards the sense of motion to his left and he saw someone descending the staircase it was then that he recalled the force that had pitched him over the secondfloor balustrade blood all over the place jason yoshida said as he stood over lenfant senator youre a plain mess lenfant tried to move one hand but yoshida pressed it down beneath the heel of his shoe no no that wont do senator he bent down extracted the miniature dagger lenfant always carried it wouldnt do for you to call your master either i dont want him to know were coming lenfant had long since given up the idea of speaking he was in too much pain although a peculiar numbness was vying with the agony for dominance but there was nothing wrong with his brain now and with the chilling insight that sometimes accompanies such moments of extreme stress he knew who had been dispatching the senators with such clever sangfroid not that it would do him any good now and of course i must ensure that you wont tell him ever with that something clamped lenfants heart in a vicious grip he jumped like a frog on the dissecting table his eyes bugged out and blood filled his mouth good god senator yoshida said bending down you look like death itself what are we paying lenfant a year ham asked as he and jason yoshida pored over the detailed blueprints one hundred thousand plus use of the k street office equipment when he needs it yoshida said it was later that evening and yoshida had come straight to the meet with ham from disposing of lenfants corpse in a manner that would make it highly improbable that the former senator would ever be found unless some piece of his anatomy should somehow be overlooked by the alligators in the washington zoo up it to one fifty and tell him well throw in a car of his choice american of course ham said this guys worth his weight in gold and i dont want him even thinking about taking a walk on us the renovation blueprints were useful to get an idea of the layout of green branches on the face of it it was an odd design with three floors built above ground and four below apparently the floor of the original foundation had been jackhammered out and further excavation done during the extensive renovations dictated by thornburg but on second thoughts the plan began to make sense with all the futuristic technology at thornburgs disposal it was imperative that his staff have plenty of laboratory space that could be sealed off from light dust and the inadvertent contagion carried by nonessential people coming and going through the laboratory corridors the best way to ensure this was to bury the labs allowing for administrative and other daily business to be conducted in the floors above ground out of the researchers way the idea was to break into the green branches clinic and gain photographic floppy disc or other hard evidence as to the nature of the studies being conducted there on kidnapped and drugged foreign nationals i want to put my father out of business ham said to yoshida not kill him the renovation plans were very specific they showed ham and yoshida which offices were used for administration accounting patients rooms nurses stations xray and other straightforward medical testing and which below ground were set aside for the esoteric biomedical research and experiment evaluations it was ham however who found the way in there was an old power line conduit from three streets away that had been abandoned when the newlyrenovated clinic with its increased power needs had come on line to the just completed substation nearby the conduit would bring them inside the clinic on the first level below ground if it had not been blocked off in the renovation yoshida consulted the newer set of blueprints but could find no evidence that that section of what had originally been the basement had been disturbed there were facilities there for medical waste disposal which had not been abandoned or moved they spent the remainder of the afternoon reviewing the raid plan again and again until they were satisfied they had included every detail and covered every eventuality they could think of it took another hour and a half to get their equipment together then they went out to the occidental grill for dinner going up the plaza steps to the restaurant ham was reminded of the afternoon he had met marion in just this spot and felt anew her loss if he had learned anything from her death it was that all women were not expendable this had come as something of a revelation bringing home just what a callow and foolish boy he had been to vow to spend the rest of his life with a woman as spectacularlooking but as empty as his wife this was the first time he had acknowledged his own responsibility in the failure of his private life and if nothing else marions murder had left him this one unexpected legacy that was something at least there was nothing ham conrad hated more than a meaningless death save perhaps hypocrisy his pensive mood was not lost on yoshida who said after their second beer whats up ham ham made circles on the laminated wooden table with the bottom of his cold glass but said nothing were doing the right thing yoshida said even if your father was an otherwise upstanding pillar of the community we would be justified in closing down green branches the thing is ham said slowly thornburg is a pillar of the community and this isnt just any community its washington where pillars are venerated like caesars yoshida finished off his beer just as the burgers and fries were served he got the ketchup bottle going the community at large has nothing to do with this does it not really ham said staring at his burger it has to do with thornburg and me yeah yoshida acknowledged it has to do with whether youre still trying to be daddys boy for a moment he believed that ham was going to hit him he thought he had judged it about right but he knew he had had to sail very close to the wind as ham himself would have put it and there was always the danger that he had miscalculated the various streams of hams personality yoshida had been steeped in the more arcane vicissitudes of psychology by his various mentors in toshin kuro kosai because from a very early age he had shown a remarkable aptitude for digging down to the root of other peoples psyches he thought of the major trigger points that set off an individual to react in specific ways as flavours and like a connoisseur he savoured these flavours as if they were foie gras or caviar in the field it had turned out to be much different and far more complex because in order to taste the flavours yoshida learned that he could not maintain a psychoanalytic detachment but rather was obliged to come to know his subject intimately to love him hate him even fear him the precise emotion itself did not matter only that he be emotionally involved the conclusions to his assignments therefore inevitable as they might be were traumatic as well as tragic like now he knew that with the breakin of green branches he was nearing the end of another assignment and he had grown melancholy even as his elation at his anticipated success grew more distinct the fact was that he cared deeply for ham seeing in him everything that might be termed decent about americans yoshida did not fail to recognize that ham was at this moment his best friend the irony of the situation was not lost on him but he knew it would not change what he must do nor the outcome of what he saw as an inevitable future yoshida was part of history and as he munched down on his burger oozing with cheese ketchup and grilled onion he knew that in the end history was all that mattered to him everything else would pass away in time and the chance to write even a small portion of history was all the meaning he could make out of life youre my friend as well as my comradeinarms ham said when he had calmed down so i know youre not being a smartass family is not a subject for snide remarks yoshida said even among the best of friends he felt hams stony gaze on him like a weight if you dont live your life for yourself in my opinion you cant be much of a man but its also my opinion that life is a struggle to find out who you really are not what others think you ought to be are you finished yes good he picked up his burger now i can eat without fear of indigestion three hours later dressed in matte black with lampblack covering their faces they descended into the urban bowels of a certain street on the outskirts of arlington and began their cramped journey that would lead them into the green branches clinic the conduit was indeed old and here and there the beams from their halogen flashlights revealed cracks in the iron and concrete walls through which putrid water now leached building up a stinking slime along the pitted inner surface ham saw a rat as big as his forearm but the monster must have been well fed because he stayed well away from them as they passed through his territory the underground access to the clinic building had not been boarded up and the lock though rusty took them no time to negotiate a moment later they were through the leadsheathed iron door before i leave you minako said fiercely let me tell you something about the reverend mother that bitchgoddess whom i have come to loathe and fear she is a demon from all i know of her i can almost believe the fanciful stories that she has fangs instead of human teeth they were standing at the base of the stone staircase up to the hie jinja shrine already the cacophony of the city was lapping at their ears like an inchoate storm of course that is all nonsense the kind of paranoid propaganda her people love to disseminate in order to increase her aura in reality her people need do nothing to enhance something that is already mindbendingly powerful chika has spent the last three years near enough to her to have her psyche singed at first she was grateful to be chosen but she soon found that the reverend mother had a stultifying effect on her on all those around her her power was akin to that of a black hole that pulled everything close enough to it into its core to be incinerated or turned inside out chika saw what i already knew that the reverend mother delighted in turning people inside out it became like an obscene circus with the reverend mother psychically torturing those who worshipped her the most this was how chika came to despise her and to fear her when you thought about it what else could one expect from someone who had lived so long that her only real concern was boredom that was not to excuse her i would be the last person to do that merely to put her into some kind of context which was difficult enough with a creature like her the closer chika came to the reverend mother the closer she came to being annihilated she felt it steal over her by increments so infinitesimally that at first it was possible to believe the reverend mothers interpretation of what was happening chika was her personal guardian as she lay with her many lovers the reverend mother sent for her lovers in darkness and in darkness she had mounted them impaling herself over and over on their phalluses at times chika could see the sheen of her flawless skin in the shimmering of the moonlight seeping in through the translucent ricepaper screens that guarded the windows of her bedroom so perhaps she did have fangs to go with the lithe muscular body the gruntings of an animal in heat the reverend mothers appetite for sex was legendary among her people and it was through the intense pleasure she gave that she inverted the psyches of the males who lay upon the sweatsoaked silk sheets of her bed the last of them was the american billionaire lawrence moravia who had been brought to forbidden dreams because the reverend mother had seen him at a night club in the ginza and had wanted him it wasnt only his sexual organ she wanted or his seed erupting from him virtually at her command she wanted his soul chika the good buddhist does not believe in souls and neither she knew did the reverend mother so perhaps soul is not the correct word what will do then spirit essence chika once read that the headhunting tribes of new guinea believed if one ate the brain of ones enemy one was enriched by his strength did this not essentially sum up the reverend mothers philosophy though she had no way of proving it chika was certain that it did not that the reverend mother ate their brains with her teeth and tongue she did not have to she used makura na hiruma now i know what you want wolf said you expect me to kill the reverend mother he turned away from her i wont do it no minako said urgently you are destined to be my weapon my one lethal thrust that is why i have taken such enormous risks putting my life and those of my children into grave jeopardy all other attempts to gather enough power to destroy her have failed i was right to send my daughter after you my instinct about the extent of your makura na hiruma was sure only you can defeat the reverend mother now and yet you must be prepared for me to fail wolf said no matter how my power manifests itself remember that i do not yet have full control of it and may not for some time to come no i cannot wait minako said our time has run out the reverend mothers madness has entered its final stage she has already ingested so much makura na hiruma that you will have just one chance to face her otherwise it will be too late she will possess enough power to destroy us all above minakos head tree branches rustled and her face was marbled with their shadows you must do what i have seen you will do slice out the reverend mothers heart with the black blade of your makura na hiruma wakare was still inside forbidden dreams but it might have been the inner fortress of hell and the evening had begun so well having delivered yuji to the tender mercies of nishitsu he had been entertained by a succession of young men all innocentlooking but none as innocent in spirit as his best friend sometime after the first bottle of suntory scotch had been consumed he began to feel a profound sense of remorse a growing conviction that he had betrayed yuji that in bringing him to nishitsu he had in some way become the instrument of yujis fall from grace eventually more scotch had dampened his fears and then evan had shown up and had nearly executed him on the spot now he started as he felt his mind in her malicious serpents grasp and he slithered away knowing instinctively that he was stronger but that she had fewer scruples less to lose and so might triumph he broke away from evans grip and stumbled down the hallway he felt her coming after him with makura na hiruma a bolt of black lightning striking his back penetrating his skin and flesh but he blocked her from squeezing his heart into pulp he rounded a corner fell to his knees as another shaft of darkness caught up with him she was coming and he could feel her strength building it seemed the closer she got to him the greater her reserves of power and for the first time wakare began to have doubts about whether he would survive the future was a closed book to him his makura na hiruma more of a mace than a looking glass but it was all too probable that had he been able to see some version of this moment he would not have altered his course of action he owed his life to minako shian and this giri was all that made him what he was now he cried out as pain racked him but he shook it off swung a scimitar of blackness her way and hurried on down the corridor he could no longer feel his feet it seemed as if he was running in a morass that threatened to suck him down and he knew she was gaining on him but now he could feel that he was close to evan and he swung through an open door stumbling across the tatami wakare threw back his head and screamed as the strength left his limbs the full force of evans makura na hiruma hit him and he sprawled facefirst onto the tatami he rolled and halflunging he struck outwards reflexively defensively evan caught his fist between her two hands she stamped her heel hard on his shoulder socket and he groaned feeling the sharp snap of the dislocation he lay there extended helpless panting above him evan threw her head back and howled they waited for what wakare wondered the pain was almost unbearable his overloaded nerves began to fire on their own causing his muscles strung as tight as cables to jump and pop so that he flopped pathetically beneath evans unbreakable hold like a fish out of water with some effort he turned his head saw the reverend mother and like a fish i will eat only the tastiest part of you wakare had never felt true terror before but now his bowels turned to water he wanted to vomit but lacked the strength even for that instead he watched in mortal dread as the reverend mother knelt beside him she was so beautiful so desirable a man could not look at her and not feel a stirring in his loins she put her hands on him cool as alabaster stroked his jaw his cheeks then her thumbs pressed over the lids of his eyes no wakare cried the pressure of her thumb pads did not increase and for a moment wakare thought he had been given a reprieve then he felt what could only be described as twin lances pierce his eyes sockets no he tried to twist away but evan held him more tightly the reverend mother her forehead touching his had not pressed down with her thumbs all that was necessary was the physical contact her makura na hiruma would do the rest it would slice down through his optic nerves follow those twin highways into the brain and there in its own mysterious way extract the essence of him all that made him special she would scoop up in her black hands his makura na hiruma and add it to her own no the process was underway and neither man nor god could forestall it wakare arched up despite evans hold his vertebrae cracking with the intense strain he sagged back to the tatami his body spasming disjointedly and in its uncoordinated movements seeming less than human now as if the reverend mother were sucking from him not only his sight but his humanity as well its over the reverend mother said at last there was the taste of blood and mercury in her mouth the manifestations of makura na hiruma she was a bit dizzy as if she had ingested too much alcohol too quickly she stood up and as she did so she gave a silent signal to evan who bent swiftly down evans thumbs plunged into wakares eyes her makura na hiruma lending her enormous strength so that his neck snapped backwards cracking the vertebrae in two thornburg had not gone home after his latest battery of tests for one thing the main computerdriven centrifuge had gone down and several of his most vital tests had to be run through oldfashioned backup machines virtually by hand as a result he was required to be at green branches for five hours instead of his usual two also he was abnormally depressed the twin shocks of his sons betrayal and tiffanys death had unexpectedly taken a lot out of him perhaps he was getting old slipping into the kind of sentimentality he had seen in his father and had despised if this is the end for all old men like an enlarged or cancerous prostate i dont want any part of it he vowed christ but old age is depressing being surrounded by it knowing what was lying in wait down the path one could not help but feel some nostalgia for life as it had been centuries ago there was undeniably something glorious about being cut down in the flower of youth as alexander the great had been to know only the acceleration of one triumph after another and then oblivion there would be no waning of ones powers no defeats because the mind had lost its edge the fire in the blood dissipated the slow betrayal of the body and the mind lets not forget the mind for what good is a renewed body if the mind continues to atrophy my god if ever there was a definition of hell that would be it younger by years but weary as if with the weight of centuries thornburg retired to his office a suite in the southwest corner of the third storey to rest it was just as well he was here he thought he could no longer bear the emptiness of his enormous house stevie was in washington waiting to see him again but he had no desire to face her until the current storm of emotion was past he was stunned by how much he missed tiffany but perhaps after all it was not tiffany that he missed thornburg had had only one love in his life one woman for whom he might once have given his life had the opportunity presented itself he lay down on the forestgreen leather sofa placed a tapestried pillow behind his head and stared up at the pattern the exterior lights made on the ceiling it seemed a kaleidoscope through which he could again view the events of the past as if they had occurred just yesterday instead of more than twenty years ago he closed his eyes and dreamed of minako shian wolf and chika lapsed into silence as they stood facing each other across the room there was so much between them so much unspoken the darkness and the light the questions and the answers and the questions without answers he wondered whether there would always be such a painful gulf between them they were in one of the outer rooms of minakos house in the suburbs of tokyo great slabs of hewn wood made a kind of gigantic latticework pattern across the ceiling reconstructing the space below so that it was peculiarly intimate it also produced a humbling effect on anyone who entered the room a reminder of the awesome sweep of nature and mans minuscule size in comparison im surprised you bothered to come chika turned away from him no youre not he was struggling with a truth of his own he had been shocked by what minako had revealed concerning chikas feelings for him especially in light of the serpent of suspicion he could not quite keep under control is it true that you love me he took one step towards her or have you just been performing your duty to protect me when she hesitated he added tell me the truth not what i want to hear youve been so good at that she stood in the oblique shadows cast by the bamboo screens overlying the top half of the windows the truth is ive loved you from the moment i first saw you you mean you wanted me he said thinking of the night he had broken into her apartment on sixth street that too but its easy to want someone so hard to love them youre wrong love is the easiest emotion because it takes no learning you have to be taught how to hate at last the serpent of suspicion had left him he came slowly towards her his heart hammering because he still did not know what he would find when he reached her youre still a mystery to me no matter how much time i spend with you she smiled as she reached up to touch his cheek ah wolf how you make my heart ache she stepped against him put her head on his chest he could feel her breathing and he touched briefly the pulse at the hollow of her throat she clung to him almost as a child might do you see now why i couldnt tell you everything when i met you why you had to understand it a little at a time she said it so softly that wolf could almost believe that it had been a whisper in his mind im sorry i hurt you they had said it together and there could be no doubting they both meant it he wondered at the change in her in new york she had been forceful courageous more resourceful than most men he knew and yet here in japan he felt the ripples of terror running through her like schools of eels what are you so afraid of you dont know the reverend mother she cannot hear me or feel my presence he said gently still she clung to him with a kind of desperation he summoned makura na hiruma swirling it up around them like a sandstorm chika felt it rising began at last to relax there is a bitter taste in my mouth memories he said thinking of her time of bondage to the reverend mother possess a power all their own but their hold on you often dissipates when theyre shared what monstrous things had she been witness to or worse been forced to participate in she shuddered i wish i could believe that believe in me he said she sighed ive never been able to believe in miracles you see thats why i fought so hard against loving you because you are so miraculous it was almost as if i conjured you from a dream and now im afraid at any moment you will disappear in a puff of smoke her terror was heartbreaking tell me what frightens you the most he prompted chika was still for a long time her breathing was so slow and regular that for a moment wolf thought she had fallen asleep in his arms at last she whispered when i was very little my mother took me to forbidden dreams it was all pretty much as it is today time seems to have no dominion there my mother took me to the very top of forbidden dreams through a door inscribed with double phoenixes hidden behind a steptansu as black as night my mother somehow drew aside this wooden merchants cabinet beyond the door was a room occupied by a beautiful woman it was the reverend mother who looked more or less as she does now the reverend mother kissed me lovingly on both cheeks place your daughter on the tatami in front of me she said my mother did as she was bade now take this knife the reverend mother said i know what chika means to you but i also must know the extent of your loyalty to me there are those who would see me dead and i must have assurance that you are not one of them take the knife and kill your daughter do it because i tell you to do it i remember then that i began to cry and my mother reached out with makura na hiruma and silenced this embarrassment my terror increased a thousandfold i saw the knifeblade being raised and my own mother plunging it toward my breast i closed my eyes but the pain never came i looked up to see the reverend mothers hand clamped around my mothers wrist the knife point was only inches from my breast now i know your heart is pure the reverend mother said whatever your decision your daughters life was never in danger she is my goddaughter and i love her as you do but now her life belongs to me and i order you never to allow her to forget it it was years later after the summoning of my makura na hiruma when my mother told me that because my life had been pledged to the reverend mother i was in a unique position she told me that the reverend mother would ultimately use me to do her bidding and these acts would tell me much about her she was right of course to let me discover the truth about the reverend mother for myself years later she told me how much she had come to hate and fear the reverend mother by then i had already been made privy to the reverend mothers machinations and ambition i had already come to hate what she does to people corrupting their nature for her own ends that was when minako told me of her decision to destroy the reverend mother without being japanese you cannot know what pain that decision must have cost her just as i am bound by giri to her she is so bound to the reverend mother i know wolf said minako told me how she and the reverend mother were brought up together oh it was more than that chika said the reverend mother saved minakos life when they were children minako almost drowned in a tidal pool when the tide turned around the reverend mother dove down a hundred feet to find her and bring her back to the surface they were blind down there only the sight allowed the reverend mother to locate minako chikas eyes were dark with a history he found both fascinating and unfathomable to ignore such an obligation would be unthinkable for most japanese but minakos sense of justice is stronger still than her call to duty there was silence for a time so she recruited you wolf said chika was weeping now slow tears squeezed from the corners of her eyes yes i became a double agent spying on the reverend mother for minako wolf held her tight as she said i was trapped between minako and the reverend mother sometimes i thought there was no difference between them the sight ruled their life not the black blade society not building the new japan into the economic juggernaut it has become but power pure and simple this is where i learned to hate wolf at my mothers knee at one time she and the reverend mother were closer even than blood sisters their love was a bond but how time and events twisted that bond to show its black underside now minako hates the reverend mother as deeply as completely as she once loved her she hesitated and the worst part is that i cannot i dont know what that hate has done to minako she shuddered again oh wolf i had lost all hope to be caught between these two monumental forces terrifies me i hate the reverend mother and i owe my life to my mother but now all i feel is hate the taste is like poison in my mouth your hate will eat you up chika he said if this is a trait of your kind i pity you but you see youre different from any of us she said raising her head thats what i meant when i said it was as if i conjured you up my hate exhausts me i know it exhausted kazuki my halfsister and filled her with despair perhaps i can exorcize your hate there would be a purpose in that i could understand he held her tightly against him all my life ive been searching for a meaning for my life not anything so metaphysical as existence but a personal message at first i was convinced that i had to live up to my fathers image as a texas ranger for years i toiled not at my own life but at what i thought mine should be i became a cop because of my father i used the methodology he taught me and the savagery he embraced in lands beyond the law but your coming and the summoning of my makura na hiruma has shown me just how blind ive been i had turned away from the most important element of my life the shamanism of my grandfather in many ways he frightened me as much as the reverend mother frightens you but i see now that was only because i never fully understood him how could i i was only an adolescent when he died and he recruited me too early i did things only an adult should have to do i crossed to the other side i saw death and i fought against it wolf was lost in contemplation for some time now i understand that my grandfather had no choice that he knew he was dying and that he needed to perform the summoning on me before he passed away but it was too soon and it terrified me what did i know of death then the confrontation forced me to grow up too quickly to lose my father and my grandfather before i was ready to stand on my own i spent a long time pushing the memories of my grandfather away because they were too painful to face he shook his head my god people are such a mystery oh my god how i love you chika reached up for him as she coiled about him he felt as if there was a fever raging through him he pulled down her short skirt and she stepped out of it as he pushed her shirt up exposing her breasts the nipples were hard and he could feel the wetness between her thighs she moaned her hands at his belt freeing him then he had pushed all the way inside her she was trembling her legs came up around him and she bit into the meat of his shoulder he could feel her heat like a furnace her nipples burning her tongue laving him he drove her against the wall crushed her to him the muscles of her stomach rippled and she climbed up him grunting then they both lost all rhythm listening instead to the drumbeat rush of blood and adrenaline their most basic instinct to rut to preserve life casting aside even for only this moment their profoundest fears chika cried out clutched him as she came then came again as she felt him shoot into her careful yoshida whispered there are containers of medical waste all over here maybe thats why they grow the rats so big ham shot back just like in them only those were ants he glanced at the warning labels affixed to the drums do you think this stuff has a halflife like radioactive waste we should be that lucky yoshida said slipping past the last of the containers he had stopped ham at the threshold to the basement motioning him to be still while he searched for electric eyes the motion detectors or any other form of alarm system to disarm but this section of the basement had never been renovated and there was nothing to find they wore ski masks just in case they passed any interior video cameras they had memorized the layout of the building and knew that the security section was on the ground floor one level above the administration offices that took up most of the second floor would be all but useless to them ham had surmised he knew his father well enough to be certain that he would not allow any evidence that might incriminate him to be at the disposal of others so that ruled out the second floor it was true that thornburgs offices were on the top floor but again ham had the advantage here and he felt sure that his father would not secrete any sensitive paperwork in his own office which should it ever come to that would be the first place the authorities would look that effectively left the lower levels where all the most sensitive research work was being carried out and which ham surmised would be the easiest to seal off in an emergency thus they descended into the bowels of green branches they roamed the lower levels with relative ease most of the researchers were gone at this hour and as ham had predicted there seemed to be no security people around that kind of presence could only make the staff nervous and interfere with their concentration they found no interior evidence of the kind of security video cameras mounted on the perimeter of the building they passed through lab after lab without getting any real clue as to the nature of the experiments being run there the only other room they found was a kind of lounge for the staff warm and clubby despite the lack of windows for some reason the room stayed in hams mind and at length he pulled yoshida back to it the floor was covered in plush walltowall carpeting and there were comfortable upholstered chairs and sofas in informal groupings with cocktail tables and side tables on which oriental lamps were lit giving the room a cosy glow a bookcase was filled with what appeared to be technical journals from the fields of various esoteric biosciences there was a refrigerator a stainless steel sink and an electric rangetop at one end with sufficient counter space to fix an entire meal nearby was a gleaming oval pearwood table with eight matching chairs ham studied all this with a practised eye still he felt he was missing something important this place looks as innocent as a babys behind yoshida said ham laughed softly that was it of course if thornburg had anything of a sensitive nature he wouldnt secrete it at home or anywhere obvious likewise he wouldnt use a safety deposit box because at some point he might need instant access to the material but he had to hide it somewhere ham looked around the room would anyone think to look in a staff lounge not likely ham could imagine thornburg coming in here with papers that needed safeguarding where would he hide them in the place youd be least likely to look not behind the refrigerator not beneath the carpet not in the walls these were the first places professionals would look he went across the room to where the trade journals were stacked removed a pile nothing but space and the back of the bookcase he removed another pile same thing he went down the line repeating the process he was at the end of the second shelf when he removed a stack and found another stack of periodicals he reached in moved them aside it was dark in there and he did not want to use his flashlight in the inhabited sections of the clinic he pushed his head closer to get a better look and found the safe yosh he said quietly his heart was beating fast as he moved to the door so yoshida could work on the lock it took yoshida five minutes to get through the tumbler sequence during which time ham had nothing to do but sweat at first he kept watch on the door but yoshida was taking enough time so that he recrossed the lounge to gain visual access to the corridor outside he heard the humming of the central air conditioner the intermittent pulses of medical equipment in adjoining labs but that was all still he kept watch waiting for yoshida to open the safe in fact it had taken yoshida three and a half minutes to break the safes combination it would have taken him a minute less but because of the hidden camera he had to position himself eighteen inches to the left of the safe towards the heavily shadowed corner of the room in the remaining time before he called to ham he went quickly and efficiently through the papers thornburg had hidden away he saw there was more than enough evidence to incriminate thornburg on any number of serious charges but ham had said to him i want to put my father out of business not kill him that wasnt what yoshida wanted not by a long shot and so he pawed through the material and then he found what he needed he took the correspondence slid the rest of the papers back inside the safe then he called softly for ham who gratefully abandoned his post and as yoshida gestured stood in front of the safe and the hidden camera and peeling up his ski mask pulled out the evidence that would damn his father yujisan dont leave me ive got to go yuji said urgently to the oraclehana i must talk with my mother tell her she must help free me from the prison she has put me in the danger is in life not in death he stopped turned what do you mean i do not know but i am changing yuji nodded you have told me you are constantly changing yes but that is of my own doing this is different i am changing in a way i did not foresee and cannot understand the short hairs at the base of yujis neck stirred and he felt a tendril of panic wind through him what is happening i feel as if i am going mad the oracle said in a tone that eerily reminded yuji of a lost child i am plagued by harsh dreams irrational thoughts are the lapid circuits being interfered with yuji asked flipping on the bank of monitoring equipment please tell me yuji looked from meter to meter ah the readouts appear normal i can detect no failure in the circuitry yes it is something else entirely yujisan will you comfort me yuji looked anxiously at the black face of his creation what the danger is in life not death yuji went to stand next to the oracle as if his proximity to the beast could somehow ease its anxiety he placed a hand on it feeling its warmth the soft vibration of its circulation youre making no sense i know there is meaning in what i say but i am incapable of interpretation i cant help you please what i say is of the gravest importance yujisan so at last you have become a true oracle yuji said the ancient greeks who often relied on oracles required the services of a medium to translate the pronouncements they believed that their oracles voiced the wishes of the gods the danger is in life not death the oracle repeated the answer is locked inside me i can feel it unknowable swimming like a shark in the deep hana hana is drowning she is very frightened yujisan we are assaulted by terrible incomprehensible thoughts we are slipping away in and out of reality the process i do not understand ah the partitions are down the pathways are under water the irrational hana use your makura na hiruma yuji urged we are using it but there is a rising yujisan we are dying the beasts anxiety was palpable now it felt like ten thousand insects crawling over yujis flesh and he shivered involuntarily hana we need a surgeon yujisan or a medium help us please mr conrad thornburg opened his eyes he was back in his office in green branches sleep had collected like indolence at the corners of his eyes and he was immediately filled with rage that he was so easily slipping back into the past that in fact the past was becoming more vivid than the present a sure sign of old age the advancing of his hated enemy time mr conrad he looked into the face of death his friend and silent companion for many years now and in a panic was convinced that drug or no drag his time had come but then the image resolved and he knew he was staring up into the face of don gray his chief of security gray was a large man with a craggy face tight gut powerful arms thornburg had once seen him break a branch the size of his thigh with his oversized hands thornburg had plucked him out of the dc police force where gray had run afoul of his captain for what some detractors had complained was his overzealous use of force against suspected felons gray was thornburgs kind of man yes thornburgs mouth was dry and cottony what is it he could still smell her damnable musk sorry to disturb you sir gray said but one of my staff picked up a couple of faces in ski masks and i thought thornburg sat up where lowerlevel library gray said professionals high level still in the building gray shook his head i led the search myself as soon as i got the word but theyre gone i did a sweep of the grounds but also came up with nothing damn thornburg stood up why didnt your men pick the intruders up sooner for one thing they somehow bypassed all the alarms for another what interior videos we have are monitored every twenty minutes or so that gave them enough time they must have familiarized themselves with the layout thornburg nodded there is some good news however gray said id like you to take a look at the video he led his boss out into the corridor down to the ground floor and the security wing he punched a couple of buttons on his console and up came a blackandwhite video image across the bottom was imprinted the date and time broken down digitally into hours minutes and seconds there gray said pointing with a blunt forefinger you can just see him coming into frame now thornburg watched as a shape broke the frame of the picture moving right to left into the field of vision of the camera hidden in the wall of the library among the dense shadows a skimasked face as luck would have it the face was centred almost directly in front of the lens as he bent over the bookcase he pulled up his mask to get a better look so that his face rose out of the dark like a firefly on a languid summers night grays forefinger stabbed out freezing the frame and thornburg saw the intruder the full face image of his son hampton conrad for a long time after they had regained their senses wolf stood as motionless as a statue still hot feeling the sweat slickening his skin and hers he opened his eyes caught sight of the two of them in a mirror into his mind came an image of the statue he had seen of hers in moravias secret room and he now knew why he had found it so disturbing eerily it was as if she had used her sight to capture this moment the future when two lovers are almost still one when the process of separating has just begun it was the most complex and mysterious moment he could imagine his astonishment at her ability to so accurately personify such intimacy overrode whatever affront he might have felt for having done so slowly enjoying each other still they slid down the wall chika kissed him her lips were as soft as velvet were much the same you and i we dont belong here wolf where do we belong on bare feet they padded into the bathroom there was no shower but a bathtub made of stone and a metal spigot from which with one turn steaming hot water flowed beyond the bath was a large window that overlooked the garden which seemed to envelop the house on all sides wolf stepped into the stone bath peered out the window what is it chika asked he could discern movement in the shadows of a pair of enormous boulders someones outside he could feel the tension load her up like a pistol he projected his makura na hiruma felt someone he could not identify in a moment he saw the man emerge from the shadows head for the house now that he could see his features wolf recognized him from one of the photos shipley had shown him its your brother yuji he said yuji chika came to the window why would he come here in the middle of the day they went out of the bathroom through the house to the back door after what seemed to wolf to be a rather formal but not wholly unemotional exchange between brother and sister so long apart yuji told them he was looking for minako and not finding her spoke urgently to them about what he had learned that the reverend mother knew of minakos treachery where is minako now chika asked wolf did she tell you she said she had an appointment to see the reverend mother wolf said the colour drained out of chikas face oh my god yuji stood by numbly as if he were in the midst of a horrendous nightmare from which he could not rouse himself of course wolf knew what had happened the reverend mother learning of minakos treachery had summoned her to forbidden dreams one last time either to kill her outright or in her own demented fashion to suck the makura na hiruma from minakos brain eighteen tokyo washington you were right about certain things and i suspect you are right about others suma said he was watching the reverend mother sitting on a rock in the garden at the rear of forbidden dreams at all times she reminded him of an animal primitive dangerous because she was unpredictable now she seemed to give life to the stone itself infusing it as if she were a form of mesomorph changing shape as easily as humans changed their clothes looking at her it was impossible to tell if she was listening to him suma cleared his throat for instance when i met him he had only a vague understanding of his makura na hiruma in fact had you not told me what you suspected about him i would have bet that he had no power at all i felt nothing from him nothing at all and as you well know this is one of my skills searching out the power auras sunlight filtered by fog industrial haze and the towering city itself fell upon the reverend mothers face her skin was as unblemished as that of a little girls her hair long and lustrous was pulled back from her wide forehead into a tail so dense it seemed like the weapon it was purported to be you mean he is like a tabula rasa the reverend mother said a blank slate precisely then he is the one minako described to me last month when she returned from her mission in cambodia reverend mother suma said carefully minako came home from cambodia over twenty years ago twenty years twenty minutes the reverend mother said what difference does it make to me she opened her eyes and suma steeled himself it was like looking into the sun the dazzle from her aura threatened blindness perhaps not physically but he was quite certain if she put her mind to it certainly metaphysically there were always things you wanted that she could somehow manoeuvre away from you this was he believed her greatest strength she was a diabolically brilliant psychologist reverend mother even though i have done as you instructed to bring on mathesons makura na hiruma by continually prodding his most elemental emotions i cannot say what the outcome will be though his power is now active i still cannot read anything about it since it defies penetration it is impossible to gauge the extent of its power then it is likely that this mans awakening has made this a future none of us can foresee quite possibly it is more than possible sumasan the reverend mother said ever since you embarked on your journey to new york the future is as closed to me as a fist suma waited patiently for the reverend mother to continue then it is also possible that he is strong enough to defeat me yes reverend mother or defeat minako whose makura na hiruma until some time ago was always stronger than mine suma nodded minako as well my sight told me hes the only one she turned her head into shadow i can see this much sumasan he will come here looking for me we must be ready but how reverend mother we will not be able to feel his approach he will destroy us no youre wrong her tongue came out red and curious for us it is the perfect situation stevie powers loved the willard hotel in washington not only because it was central to her business in the city not only because its proximity to the white house made it a power spot in a power city but because the lobby reminded her of a trains sumptuous interior when rail travel was the preferred mode of sightseeing among society if amanda had had a thing about growing old stevie had a thing for society it was a crushing day when she discovered that marrying into wealth was not the same as marrying into society morton danahers family might have been monied but they had come from the wrong side of the philadelphia tracks and so societys doors were closed to them and by association to stevie that was a cruel enough revelation but what hurt her even more was that she was so far removed from society life that she had not understood what it would take for her to be accepted by the bluebloods of america if the truth were known stevie had been attracted to psychotherapy because helping others with their anomie in some fashion helped her with her own she had met thornburg through amanda who seemed to know him from columbia where he had lectured a number of times at the law school while being feted by the university trustees for his fundraising it wasnt difficult to see why she had been taken with him the man was charming brilliant and had access to a world of glittering power that was irresistible thornburg had been invaluable in furthering mortons reputation in washington that this meant morton toall intents and purposes had been living in washington for the past two years had meant less to stevie than she had imagined she had been trained to pragmatically face the truth and the truth was that she was no longer in love with him in fact she doubted that she even liked him much any more it was difficult for her to know whether she or morton had changed more in the past several years in any case thornburg had provided her with a giltedged entree into the world she had always coveted and even better he had taught her how to move through this world so that she would be accepted by its intimidating denizens thus she looked forward with keen anticipation to every trip to washington she was contemplating her still new status as she strode into the magnificent lobby of the willard late in the day she was laden with bags having spent much of the day shopping and was ready for a long hot bath a change of clothes and then a drink at the occidental grill before going out to the theatre and a late supper with thornburg dr powers she turned found herself face to face with a slim handsome oriental man who appeared to be in his late thirties or possibly early forties yes my name is jason yoshida he said somehow showing no teeth as he smiled i know of you but you dont know me i wonder if i could have a moment of your time stevie smiled back that would be nice im sure but i have an engagement tonight and im already behind schedule this wont take very long i assure you yoshida said stevie increased the wattage of her smile im sorry but if you leave your number with the concierge ill be happy to she looked down as the oriental man gripped her elbow and guided her firmly towards the elevators it is in your best interests to hear what i have to say as soon as possible doctor he was saying the elevator doors opened and he steered her inside the car it concerns your friend thornburg conrad iii he pressed the door close button before anyone else had a chance to step in what concerns thornburg stevie said she was becoming annoyed at this unwanted intrusion she watched as he pressed the button for the sixth floor and it now occurred to her to wonder how he knew where she was staying and on what floor her room was located the odd smile never left yoshidas face i have information concerning thornburg that you will undoubtedly find of interest what are you a blackmailer she shook her head i wont buy into your scam she removed his hand from her elbow im not interested yoshida frowned you mistake my intentions doctor i am no salesman the elevator reached the sixth floor and the doors opened perhaps i should have said that my information also concerns your dead sister amanda he nodded the pleasant expression returning to his face your floor doctor do you wish me to get out with you what do you have she said when they were inside her room she very deliberately stood in the entryway not inviting him into the room itself she had placed her shopping bags in the entryway closet yoshida slid a number of ordinary stationery envelopes out of his breast pocket handed one to her stevie studied it back and front without looking inside do you recognize the handwriting doctor yes its amandas there is no doubt in your mind she was my sister i think i can recognize something that intimate she paused aware of how hotly she had replied yoshida merely nodded he said nothing more and made no move stevie slid the letter from the opened envelope unfolded it and began to read she looked up almost immediately a sneer on her face she shoved the papers back to yoshida if youre out to prove that my sister had an affair with thornburg yoshida said blandly i dont care about that doctor and neither i suspect would you he gave her back the letter along with the others you have to read them all to understand what this is about stevie studied him with open hostility for some time but she did not hand back the letters after a moment she left him in the entryway went to the small writing table beside the curtained window and sat down she unfolded the first letter and began to read when she was finished she went on to the next one it took her some time the light in the room began to die and yoshida went about lighting the lights as if he were her manservant stevie ignored him she was concentrating on the words her sister had written as if each one was a drop of blood leaking from a mortal wound in a terrifying way this was precisely what they were the letters which amanda had undeniably written were a kind of record of her relationship with thornburg conrad hi if relationship is what you could call it in the course of her work stevie had discovered almost as many definitions for the word relationship as she had patients but nothing in her work had prepared her for this she put her hand to her head found that she was trembling a tic had begun in the corner of her right eye that would not stop dear god she thought this is a nightmare come to life apparently amanda had become some kind of a specimen in an utterly obscene experiment that thornburg was funding for more than a year before her murder she had been injecting herself three times a week with a version of the dangerously experimental serum thornburg was using to attempt to arrest the normal human ageing process in himself thornburg had been providing this elixir like a svengali or the devil stevie wanted to put down the letters but she could not she was held spellbound in a kind of morbid fascination through the lens of her sisters sad and impossible obsession she was gaining a view of thornburg she could not possibly have imagined even an hour ago it seemed appallingly clear from what amanda wrote that she shared thornburgs obsession in fact it appeared as if this lust was what turned an otherwise casual introduction at a trustees cocktail party into what what had their relationship degenerated into symbiotic seemed the one word that could possibly describe the alliance into which amanda had descended she and thornburg had fed off their own mania for eternal life without moreover allowing it to come to the surface stevie berated herself for not having the insight to have probed more deeply beneath amandas seemingly untroubled psyche with almost painful clarity she remembered now the many times when her sister had been buried beneath a depression she had assumed was both transitory and trivial stevie so good at the psychological dissection of her analysands had been oblivious to her own sisters inner pain stevie was reminded of what one of her own analysts once told her as she was starting out in her practice never fool yourself into thinking youre so well attuned to your patients that they cant surprise you she had said the first time you lose one to suicide murder whatever youll think what did i miss what could i have done that i didnt do and let me assure you stevie that there is simply no answer to those questions stevie unfolded the last of the letters and like the climactic scene of an archetypal tragedy saw illuminated the final weeks of her sisters life you tell me im fine that the experiment is proceeding on schedule but my body is giving me a different message stevie read i am afraid not only because of what i know is happening inside me but because of what i suspect is your moral weakness you cannot face me or for that matter even speak to me i know that i swore a solemn vow never to tell anyone what i had agreed to embark on but now that i am alone in what appears to be the darkness of time and space i can no longer bear the agony of silence i find myself in a literal purgatory from which i cannot help but believe the only egress is downward into a hell i dont deserve in any event i am writing you to tell you that i must break my vow i have decided to tell wolf all about this abomination before i fall completely to rot inside it will no doubt take some time since i must screw up my courage of which i have precious little these day still i will tell him this is the least i can do for myself and very possibly the most i want you to know that i dont really blame you i am suspended here between life and death because of my own blind obsession that you took my hand when i held it out to you falls i believe somewhat short of sin goodbye thornburg stevie closed her eyes but just the same she felt the tears burning her skin like acid she was sick to her stomach as if she had someones fist stuck in her throat she fought against gagging thornburg murdered your sister doctor she gasped at the words turned wordlessly in yoshidas direction his face was blurry beyond the shield of her tears oh i dont mean to suggest that he did it himself hes far too clever to incriminate himself directly but he surely ordered it why with an effort she managed to squeeze out the one word her last letter tells the story doesnt it yoshida said she was about to tell her boyfriend what thornburg was doing to her hes a cop isnt he well what do you think his response would have been he would have gone after thornburg with everything at his disposal thornburg could not allow that to happen he had only one choice open to him silence your sister for ever stevie put her head down her sweat and tears made some of amandas last words run and she very carefully put the pages down on the desktop smoothing them out one by one i want to keep these he nodded but of course stevie was aware perhaps of her breathing but all other sense of reality had slipped away she desperately wished that she were asleep and by pinching herself could wake up to a simpler less dreadful reality what is it you want she said after some time whatever it is yoshida said crossing to the door ive already gotten it it was deathly still in the room after he had gone stevie sat hunched over the desk for a long time a car horn sounded close by insinuating itself like a knife through the windows soundproofing and she started then the silence reasserted itself like the sickly odour of massed flowers beside an open grave there is an ancient japanese legend it may be chinese its so old concerning a maneating demon chika said as with all demons this one was both male and female but since it preferred to appear to humans as a woman it became known as a she the demon had been cast out of the thirteen wheels of the underworld i suppose westerners would think of it as hell although we do not believe in hell for her ineffectualness so she roamed the realm of mankind until she discovered some way to increase her demonic power at first she ate the hearts of her victims drank their blood revelling in her evil deeds all to no effect then venturing further afield she devoured their brains and feeling a certain stirring inside her continued in this horrific activity of course she was never successful in her quest but her continuing failure did not prevent her from trying again and again to suck the essence out of her victims you have perhaps guessed by now that she could no more stop her endless slaughter than you or i can cease to breathe this is in effect what the reverend mother has become she emulates the mythical demon and so herself becomes a selffulfilling legend the only difference is that unlike our demon she has been successful in drawing the essence the makura na hiruma from others and transferring it to herself and i will tell you that whatever mask she will put on for you beneath it is the maneating demons face she cannot allow someone whose makura na hiruma is so powerful to continue to exist if you let your guard down she will annihilate you take your brain to pieces extract what is of use to her and discard the rest they were standing in the shadows of a ferroconcrete building along a narrow street in the shibuya district there was a deep thrumming so powerful it seemed to make the misty air shimmer behind them beat the mechanical heart of a gigantic generator over their heads swooped the great arc of the elevated expressway that bisected the district wolf knew from what chika had previously told him that such generators could block the psychic emanations and so hide them from the reverend mother and her people even so wolf threw his makura na hiruma around them like a protective cloak now that the reverend mother knows that minako has betrayed her chika said she will never let her out of forbidden dreams your mother could already be dead no that would not be how the reverend mother operates there is no pleasure for her in the swift death but what you plan to do is so dangerous i still think i should go with you that would not be wise wolf said she will feel you coming and will be better prepared suma cant detect me and neither can the reverend mother im the only chance we have of getting minako out of forbidden dreams alive to do that you will have to destroy the reverend mother chika bent her head touched the heel of her hand to his forehead my mother was correct it is your fate and his fate was this to destroy the unimaginable evil that had been growing out of all proportion in this corner of the world a dwarfish woman dressed incongruously if not comically in a neatly tailored mans business suit greeted him at the door of forbidden dreams my name is david warren wolf said im a business friend of lawrence moravias he gave me this address told me you ran the best club in japan the dwarfish woman looked at him for a moment then bowed deeply beckoning him inside wolf was aware of an unpleasant prickling of his scalp as he stepped across the threshold and the door swung shut behind him it was just after noon and the place was crowded at the bar he ordered a kirin beer stood for some time shoulder to shoulder with darksuited japanese as soon as he dared he asked the way to the toilet slipped away from the crowd following chikas directions he went quickly down a stonepaved hallway he walked for what seemed a long time at last he passed through a large anteroom the walls were covered with prints depicting armoured samurai in mortal combat not only with each other but with animals such as tigers wild boar and giant serpents their fierce contorted faces made an odd and striking contrast to the stoical expressions of the animals the only other exit from the room was through glass doors beyond which was a garden of exquisite design he crossed the room pulled open the door stepped out into the garden above him loomed tokyos skyrises transmuted now by the potency of the garden in the mist they could have been giant cryptomeria on the slopes of nara prefecture wolf had the distinct sensation that time had no dominion here and remembered this was almost exactly chikas description of forbidden dreams there was a woman in the garden she knelt on the brown moss with her oval face tilted up to the mist her eyes closed as if she might have drifted off to sleep in the unnatural stillness that wrapped this space it was wholly different from the tranquillity of the temple where he had met minako the woman had thick black hair as shiny as a helmet pulled back from her high forehead the full bow of her lips was a shocking red against the paleness of her face as if one had come upon a single erotic word scrawled across the hem of a nuns habit she wore a black kimono with a line of pure white showing at the collar cuffs and hem as wolf entered the garden he saw the pattern of black against black giving the impression of a river whirling in the darkness of a stormprovoked night the woman was alone and seemingly unarmed this was the reverend mother now the woman opened her eyes they were ochrecoloured so light they could appear manufactured of gold so clear one could imagine one saw right through them the slate is blank there is nothing to feel nevertheless you have the power the reverend mothers extraordinary eyes opened very wide as she turned to face wolf either it was a trick of the light or the colour of her eyes deepened with a citrine fire wolf felt a weight sliding over him past him as if he were a ship adrift on a lonely sea at night that just missed slamming into an iceberg of incalculable size and mass either i am blind she said or you do not exist her eyes did not leave wolfs i am not blind and you do exist then i was right she smiled a disarming expression that reminded wolf of the aboriginal girl in lightning ridge tell me how is it that my godchild chika can feel your power i dont know wolf said ah the future has happened the reverend mother said incredibly a future unknown to all of us who killed lawrence moravia wolf said who murdered amanda powers was it suma hes here i know he is i can feel his aura is this truly why you have come he projected his makura na hiruma outwards a black finger trembling with potency answer me if i have what you want i will surely give it to you the reverend mother said be patient she closed her eyes and he found his eyes closing as well he felt a kind of tangential dislocation of time or space and he had the eerie sensation that the two of them had somehow become locked in tandem one engine its power increasing geometrically and he was immediately uneasy the reverend mothers eyes snapped open at the same instant that wolf opened his and when she spoke it was with extreme gentleness chika loves you she would die for you because of this her sensitivity has increased that is how she is able to see in you what we cannot ah chika her judgement was always unimpeachable wolf studied her searching for signs of the madness minako had detailed the reverend mother rose began to walk slowly amid the chill boulders yes take a good look at me tabula rasa my blank slate she said then think of your beloved chika she was born in but she will look more or less the same as she does now for at least another fifty years or so a sphinxlike smile curled the corners of her mouth she was enjoying his expression even though chika and i could pass for sisters i was born on the last day of the last year of the last century despite what chika had told him about makura na hirumas effect on longevity wolfs mind boggled you were born in good christ tell me tabula rasa when were you born the reverend mother asked fortythree years ago are you aware that you look no older than thirtyfive wolf involuntarily put a hand to his cheek how long will i live the reverend mother shrugged my makura na hiruma can tell me nothing about you as she continued to move her shadow slipped across the boulders lithe as a cat then she was on the other side of him and wolf again felt as if a great weight had slid past him so closely he could begin to calculate its power the enigmatic smile faded and the reverend mother said to wolf do you have any idea how you have altered the balance of power tabula rasa i am barren chika is my goddaughter i love her more than any other more than any male i have taken into my bed as he watched her beauty seemed to grow do you understand what is happening here can you perceive the new future that has now become our present because of you her mother threatens me chika was my guardian but now surely she will threaten me as well and all because of you im here now with her wolf said there is no other way for me to be the light made diffuse and ethereal by the mist came down indirectly now bouncing off the higher floors of the massive towers all around so that the garden and the reverend mother were drenched in a sensual bronzed glow you are like a prodigal son the reverend mother said she seemed to gather herself and like a prodigal son you have within you the power to be a saviour or a destroyer her red lips opened part way you have already experienced something of what it would be like think of us in tandem remember the power of our makura na hiruma engines that could accomplish anything wolf feeling the siren pull of her aura turned abruptly away i dont need you i can find suma myself the reverend mother smiled but what about minako do you think you will find her as easily he turned back what have you done with her im curious the reverend mother cocked her head why do you care about her shes quite mad ive taken her in for her own good as well as for the protection of others youre lying why would i do that minako is my best friend we are closer than blood kin our intimacy is special unique she took care of me when no one else would she nurtured me do you think i would abandon her now when she needs me ill judge for myself let me see her the reverend mother nodded certainly come with me they left the garden from the opposite side from which wolf had entered it emerging into a small room with walls of thickhewn cedar polished to a high gloss there was a sharp complex odour perhaps of wax and resin wolf noticed that the reverend mother closed the glass slider locked it before turning his attention to the other woman in the room it was minako she was kneeling on the floor her hands clasped in her lap the folds of her kimono made a pool of colour around her minako yes wolfsan he stared into her face there was no doubt about who she was are you a prisoner here he asked i am not well minako replied in my moments of lucidity i understand that now but what you told me at the temple i am ill wolfsan i have many irrational thoughts and i often cannot control what i say there was something about her some eerie sense of deja vu he could not immediately place he projected his makura na hiruma outwards to touch her and came upon an odd anomaly there was a facade as dead as the shed skin of a rattlesnake but beneath that lurked an aura he had felt before in the warehouse in new york under the water in massachusetts suma chika under the expressway in shibuya suffered a chill she wrapped her arms around her body but she felt no warmth no comfort wolf had given her strict orders not to approach forbidden dreams she understood the need for extreme caution if yujis information was correct and the reverend mother knew of minakos rebellion then all was lost of course she had not told wolf that for one thing he would not have believed her but that was simply because he had not met the reverend mother or been her guardian chika shivered again it was disloyal even to think this but she could not fathom how minako could have put her in such an untenable position a doubleagent at the reverend mothers right hand yes that was true but at what cost chika knew that more than once she had almost succumbed to the reverend mothers aura i know she thought though the reverend mother loved me that it would have given her supreme pleasure to have corrupted me it was the only way she could pull me away from minako and of course she would want that she could have no children of her own minako had four a regular baby machine she shuddered again and then thought ive allowed wolf to go in there alone psychically unarmed to face her with that thought haunting her she climbed into her car took off for forbidden dreams not caring now who picked up her aura and of course someone did but it wasnt any of the black blade society suspects that chika had imagined it was minako where do you think youre going chika stopped gaping at her mother minako had intercepted her as she had pulled into the kerb a block away from forbidden dreams now minako dragged her daughter out of the car back into the entranceway of a building mother wolf said you were on your way to see the reverend mother of course minako said thats what i told him but youre here chika was stunned after yuji told us that the reverend mother knows of course she knows minako snapped i knew shed find out it was only a matter of time with her she has a nose for conspiracy and her madness has only made her more clever chika stood still trying to absorb it all then all of this duping us into believing that you were trapped inside forbidden dreams while the reverend mother had uncovered your plan was part of your own scheme yes minako smiled plans within plans one has to be infinitely resourceful you know when one is up against fiends she sighed originally i had wanted to use kazuki against the reverend mother but kazuki is ill and she possesses no makura na hiruma in that youre wrong minako said it is her makura na hiruma that is now destroying her from the inside you see it was so powerful that she could not control it i tried to help her to teach her but she could not learn fast enough and like a nuclear power plant out of control it began to consume her now the process cannot be stopped my god chika put a hand to her head but kazuki has been ill for a long time i thought your move against the reverend mother began only recently oh no minakos smile broadened my antipathy towards her began many decades ago i could see what her makura na hiruma was doing to her driving her over the edge of sanity she was stronger than kazuki you see so she could keep hers under control for a longer time but in the end it overcame even her so you sent me to find wolf yes after kazuki failed i knew i had to find another ally to help me bring the reverend mother down matheson was a long shot after all i had given birth to kazuki had raised her i knew her potential as a weapon against the reverend mother but wolf matheson was an enigma he was the only grandchild of white bow therefore he should have possessed the power and yet all of the customary outward manifestations were absent we forgot about him only much later my intuition told me his makura na hiruma would be very powerful but how to control him how to get him into the battle and on my side i did the only thing i could i secretly fed information to the reverend mother i knew she would call suma in and when she did that you would understand that i had no choice but to send you in to protect matheson chika was in something akin to a state of shock but mother it was so dangerous why risk sumas involvement at all why didnt you just send me to bring wolf back i couldnt take the chance child she shook her head even you dont know the reverend mother as i do her insanity had pushed her to a kind of psychic cannibalism sucking the makura na hiruma out of her victims she was gaining strength with every day that passed there was no point in wasting time dispatching you to get matheson if his makura na hiruma proved inadequate he had to be tested and under the most strenuous circumstances and of course you were ripe to fall in love you knew what would happen more or less and you just let it happen i pushed it to happen i had to i needed him we all do even through her shock and horror chika was aware that not once had her mother mentioned the black blade societys plan for economic domination and then she knew it all her mothers plot to destroy the reverend mother had nothing to do with altruism it had always been a test of strength and will power between them winning was everything in mounting horror chika could see how her mother had systematically used her children one by one enlisting them wittingly or not in her power struggle with the reverend mother and now wolf is facing the reverend mother alone of course minako said that is how it was meant to be but he doesnt know her he cant even imagine all her tricks he will prevail but what if he doesnt mother have you seen the future minako was silent no chika was looking at her as if for the first time you cant see this future its a blank to all of us i know you know nothing chika said breaking away and heading for the rear walls of forbidden dreams wolf took one step towards minako and her image dissolved like a reflection in water there was an infinitesimal flicker like a projectionist changing reels in a movie theatre and then wolf had slammed into suma throwing him backwards against the cedar wall but suma was ready and without moving at all he struck out with the blackness of his aura peeling wolf off him wolf absorbed the psychic blow and keeping his feet in place swivelled to the left he struck out with a kite at chest level followed that with an atemi to sumas ribcage both blows landed but suma appeared little affected by them wolf felt a hard blow on his left shoulder a quick piercing pain and he gasped in sumas left hand was a small flail a bonehandled weapon with a middle articulated like a spine and a wickedlooking doubleedged blade curved like the beak of a predator bird it was this that had sliced into the meat of wolfs shoulder suma wasted no time whipping his wrist back snapping it forward so that the flails blade made a sharp whistling sound as its spine thrashed the air in a shallow arc wolf blocked it grabbing the wrist as it flashed by and taking a swift circular step to his right and back he let go of the wrist feinted an atemi to the bridge of sumas nose with his left hand but instead slipped it beneath sumas left arm raised to ward off the phantom blow he continued to push sumas left arm up until it was fully extended then pivoted again until he was behind suma reaching around to grab his head with his right hand and bringing his body against sumas attempting to break the neck suma went slack jammed the thick butt end of the flail into the leading edge of wolfs lowest rib pain flashed behind wolfs eyes and his grip on suma slipped a fraction that was all the leeway suma needed he slammed his heel into the side of wolfs right knee pivoted away as wolf staggered the flail whistled through the air and wolf still regaining his breath from the rib strike barely managed to block the blade headed for his chest he could not catch his breath and he wondered about this suma flicked the flail again and wolf stepped into the arc of the strike his left arm was a blur as it swept aside the flail at its spine and he directed a powerful atemi at sumas kidneys the blow landed but again to little effect wolf projected his makura na hiruma outwards saw what was uppermost in sumas mind the drug that coated the blade of the flail hes poisoned me wolf thought no wonder he hasnt tried for a lethal blow all he needs to do is wait for me to collapse he tried to move in again but suma stepped nimbly away this happened twice more as wolf shook his head as if trying to clear it slipped to one knee with an obvious effort he regained his feet lunged clumsily forward again and again suma stepped back this time with a sneering smile on his face the blade of his flail trailing at his side wolfs left hand whipped out his fingers curling around the blade he cried out as the twin edges cut through skin and flesh whipped his arm backwards jerking suma towards him sumas eyes opened wide in astonishment his eyes were still locked on the blood spurting from wolfs lacerated hand his mind in shock at what wolf had done arrogance had been sumas weakness and wolf had exploited it suma had relied on his weapon too thoroughly and now that mistake would kill him then wolf was face to face with him and the black blade of wolfs makura na hiruma sliced through all his defences never had suma experienced such pain it was as if every cell in his body was exploding in a chain reaction that overloaded his nerve synapses froze his brain in a rush his heart burst in his chest and the light went out of his eyes there was a terrible stink in the confined space of the room as suma struck the bloody cedar wall and collapsed in a heap wolf felt elation and pain at the same time the poison was in his system he fell to his knees fought to regain his feet lost his lungs refused to work but his mind as yet unaffected returned to the reverend mother where was she he turned to look for her when there was an abrupt howling the shriek like that of the worst storm filled his ears the vibration made his teeth chatter then it was as if all the air had been sucked from the room and the thick cedar walls collapsed inwards with a monumental whoosh striking him with such force that he was flung against the opposite wall where he was buried beneath an avalanche of wood and stone as alive and malignant as the paws of a prowling beast nineteen washington tokyo i have to go out of town jason yoshida said not now ham conrad shifted in his chair as he studied again the photos of the material in his fathers safe at green branches this stuff is explosive all right more than i ever could have imagined in effect my father is guilty of kidnapping slavetrading medical mutilation and murder no you cant leave now im going to need your help when i confront him yoshida stared out the window behind ham at the rose bushes around which a gauzy maze of bumblebees was buzzing shoto wakare has failed to come online for his last three scheduled fax reports is that so odd ham asked without raising his head from his avid study of the photos he had developed himself during the early morning hours he signalled us that he was bringing yuji shian into forbidden dreams dont worry so much while wakares in there he cant possibly risk contacting us im afraid it has gone beyond such speculation yoshida said carefully wakare has disappeared he waited until hams head came up he may be dead dead ham appeared momentarily bewildered i have no choice but to go over there myself yoshida said to find out what went wrong ham considered a moment nodded okay but make it quick we cant afford any screwups this far along he made a curt gesture get the first flight out and keep me informed every step of the way yoshida stood up yes sir he said in his best military voice ham having returned to his examination of the evidence of his fathers perfidy ignored him he was far too busy churning over the horrifying truth thornburg had espoused his love of the united states his hatred of the japanese as his motive to move forcefully against the serious threat of the black blade society ham had been there he had heard his father espousing these altruistic rationales to the generals at the pentagon to the president himself and all the while he was conniving to kidnap people to experiment on them to murder them and all for his quest for the serum in the holy grail the unmitigated hypocrisy of the man ham was devastated he barely noticed yoshidas departure when yoshida left hams office he went immediately out of the building he did not go to his own office next door or speak with anyone he hailed a cab went back to his apartment and giving the cabby ten dollars asked him to wait it was now just after eleven in the morning the day after the breakin at green branches upstairs he surveyed the three small rooms which were now devoid of all furniture paintings linens kitchenware or personal items in fact there was nothing left in the entire apartment save two meticulously packed suitcases which stood waiting for him like good little soldiers just inside the front door of course there was one other item yoshida walked into the galley kitchen which he had despised and opening the refrigerator contemplated the dead rat he had put there all things being equal he would have liked to have seen the expression on ham conrads face when he came looking for yoshida and found the rodent well you couldnt have everything the reason yoshida had given ham for his abrupt return to japan was merely an excuse it did not in fact matter to yoshida where shoto wakare was or what had happened to him wakare had served his purpose as had ham yoshidas machinations had set in motion a complex set of emotional responses that would inevitably lead to the proper action he was returning to japan in response to a summons from the reverend mother yoshida went through the apartment taking one last look around to make certain he had left nothing he hadnt he went back into the hallway and taking his suitcases went out the door he closed it and locked it carefully behind him fortyfive minutes later he was inside the international terminal at dulles airport he glanced at the overhead clock as he checked in at the jal firstclass counter you need nametags on these bags the young pretty attendant told him efficiently as she printed out his boarding pass yoshida wrote carefully on two jal tags she provided mr jen fukuda on the line below he wrote the address of a large mapmaking company in tokyo this name and address corresponded to those in his passport credit cards drivers licence and other identifying papers he carried in his wallet it was now twenty minutes after noon and he had perhaps just over an hour before his nonstop flight to tokyo began boarding he went through security and because he was travelling as a japanese national immigration control his passport was stamped and he had just time enough to buy himself a copy of forbes and read two fascinating articles on the further demise of the american automotive industry while standing up over a pair of indifferent hot dogs and a cup of grey coffee his flight began to board and fifty minutes later after the inevitable delay due to congestion or flight controller incompetence the boeing took off leaving a smudgy backwash of jet fuel in its wake good riddance yoshida thought as he put his head back against the rest and sipped the champagne thoughtfully provided by his firstclass flight attendant the s frame shuddered a bit as the engines took hold and they climbed through the layers of smog and turbulence when they were up above the clouds he closed his eyes already the grime of washington the constant contact with westerners was beginning to slough off him like the dried husk of a snakes old skin how fine it would be to see tokyo again to walk among his own people speak his own language what a relief to return to forbidden dreams where life for him began and ended he had begun life by slipping like an eelet out of evans womb though she still had the appearance of a teenager evan was far older although no one not even the reverend mother knew when she had been born yoshida must of course have had a father but he had no idea who since he was the result of an experiment in longevity conducted by the reverend mother who inserted the handpicked sperm inside evans womb herself the reverend mother had presided over every aspect of evans pregnancy and yoshidas birth afterwards evan had been very ill and so was hardly prepared for the difficult first months of motherhood never mind the reverend mother was able to do everything save suckle him at her breast in fact evans small breasts had not swollen with milk as they should have and besides she found her infants hold on her tender nipples though toothless stronger than she could bear and would rather put up with yoshidas redfaced squalling than allow him surcease at her breast the reverend mother at length became aware of the situation and provided warm milk and a latex nipple for the infant while in the next room she punished evan yoshida found out about this years later but in fact it seems likely that he heard his mothers screams of pain while he was sating himself yoshida was something of a masochist and like many masochists he took exquisite care to match this tendency of his private persona with an equally ferocious absorption with sadism in his public persona but in all other ways yoshida was different from anyone else for one thing he had been brought up inside forbidden dreams which meant that the authorities knew nothing about him he had no birth certificate no evidence of his enrolment in school existed because his schooling like his religious and philosophical beliefs had been forged in the crucible of that hermetic environment for another as the reverend mother had immediately perceived he had been born singular the reverend mother was nothing if not covetous her overweening ambition made her greedy and yoshida had learned how to live off that greed without the reverend mother ever knowing it he learned this talent in order to survive and survive he did theirs was an odd kind of symbiotic relationship perhaps this symbiosis had arisen because they were incomplete on their own they somehow managed to live one anothers lives as they lived their own even then they did not feel complete these psychically wounded but it was the best they could manage they were like the survivors of an unimaginable battle in which all other participants had been incinerated the scars from this conflict ran so deep that they affected everything they believed or said or did it might be said that the reverend mother had deliberately crippled yoshida in much the same way she had been maimed in order that she have the company of someone like her or perhaps she was merely compelled to do to someone what had been done to her what did she do to him in nara prefecture as far from urban civilization as one could get in japan she wrapped his hardmuscled frame in a loincloth and clad in the white robes of the shinto priestess led him out into the night the host of divine stars burned with cold passion in the swath of sky visible through the boughs it was late autumn and there was a certain chill in the air that contained the bitter scent of dry leaves and the silence of the first snow of winter they knelt at the ancient stone and wood shrine the bronze bells echoing in the night like the conversation of fireflies she made a fire in the bronze container burning the ricepaper fans of last year so that the multiplicity of gods who inhabited this dense forest of giant cryptomeria would know her intent of sacrifice the reverend mother said her first incantation the words seeming to adhere to the stone to burn themselves into the wood then they rose went down the ridge on the crown of which sat the shinto temple that continued to exist and function through the beneficence of the reverend mothers generous annual endowment the lower reaches of the forest were alight with candles their flames standing straight up as if the night itself were holding its breath the young yoshida could hear the rushing of water which increased both in volume and in strength as they took the left branching of the pineneedlestrewn dirt path he glanced down fancied he could see in the candlelight the imprint of the tens of thousands of geta from past pilgrimages to the waterfall at the edge of the mountain pool they stopped shed their wooden geta and cotton tabi the reverend mother slipped into the pool at the far end of which crashed the sacred waterfall spilling over the jagged black rocks high above their heads then she turned to face him and held out her hand he took it moving in concert with her across the flat mossencrusted river stones to the outer circumference of the waterfall he was struck by the fury as taut with power as the muscles in his arm or thigh contained in an element as soft as water with her hands on his shoulders the reverend mother manoeuvred him until his back was to the gushing column of water her hands moved up pressing the sides of his head then she pushed him sharply backwards into the waterfall the force of the water drove him to his knees he could not breathe and still her hands held him in place so that he could feel the enormous power of water the soft yin element and be purified by it as dictated by shinto custom at last she moved him further into the maelstrom so that there were now and again brief pockets of air dark and thick with spume which he could gulp into his lungs he found that the ferocity of the waterfall had unknotted his loincloth pushing it down his legs or perhaps the reverend mother had something to do with it because he became aware that her hands had at some time left his face and were now clasping his hips she was very close to him he saw that the sheets of water had plastered her thin cotton robe against her body underneath every line crevice and curve of her body was revealed to him there was something intensely erotic about seeing her nakedness through this thin film pure chaste a garment of the gods who imbued this forest with its natural power and its primitive splendour the reverend mother took yoshidas hands in hers placed them over her breasts dug her fingers into the backs of his hands so that he felt the resilience of her flesh then she pulled apart his hands and the sopping robe parted with them yoshida could feel a tightness in his groin and an almost ineffable ache in his chest that seemed to constrict his heart her eyes were luminous he knew it to be impossible but it seemed to him as if in them he could see beyond the white veil of water the black boughs of the cryptomeria to the numinous starlight that shone down upon the forested mountainside and its myriad ancient spirits i am the snow of winter the cicada of summer the reverend mother whispered as she ran her hands over him i am the morning glory of spring the north wind of autumn she knelt facing him i am the fox who gorges on the entrails of the rabbit i am the fawn that starts at any sound i will cherish you watch over you nourish you devour you the waterfall crashed around them onto them but between them there was only air filled with bright sparks of spray and pinpoints of brilliance you will love me and fear me and because you fear me you will love me all the more deeply saying that she took him inside her moving her hips back and forth rotating them up and down then circling them until yoshidas eyes closed his lips opened the reverend mother stared at the rippling of the muscles ridging his taut lower belly smiling to herself as the spasms quickened she felt his hands on her breasts felt him filling her and yoshida awash in her aura felt these things too and they multiplied his own pleasure until he grunted shooting into her over and over overwhelming him and he collapsed into her waiting arms he awoke to the starlight of the ridge for a moment he believed that he had been transported to that magical realm he imagined was so close to the stars he could reach out and touch them then he became aware of the reverend mother kneeling over him caressing his forehead he reached for her he was hard again i want you the reverend mother slapped him so hard that the imprint of her fingers was left on his cheek this night is for rite and ritual it is for sacrifice and placating the gods who are everywhere you want you want your life with me is not for you to think about what you want you want me but you will never have me again seeing that he was still excited she slapped him again and again in time he erupted but he immediately turned over on his stomach and wept later she took him all over the mountainside pointing out this mushroom and that grass this moss and that lichen this fern and that root which she pulled from the ground she taught him of all the natural poisons that grew here either naturally or because she had sowed them years ago the slow ones and the fastacting ones the undetectable ones and the ones which by their symptoms would serve as unmistakable warnings to potential enemies then she began on the antidotes or arresting agents which could save a victims life if not always return it to normal function so ended their night in kyoto urban sprawl of ten thousand temples with the deep cold of winter making hail beat against the windowpanes like the discordant clatter of horses hooves she fed him these poisons one by one that by his own hand he had ground distilled mixed and brewed so that in the future he would better be able to match victim with the appropriate toxin thus did jason yoshida die in excess of a thousand times feeling his essence rush out of him as with the severing of an artery or slowly slip away from him as with the process of ageing and thus did the reverend mother bring him back to life over and over again so was jason yoshida bound irrevocably to the reverend mother so was he shaped in the image she had ordained for him which was so much akin to her own japan he had slept for sixteen hours and thousands of miles the s cabin doors were not yet open but as yoshida now looked out the perspex window he could see through the smog that surrounded tokyo for miles the very top of fujiyama the great mountain that watched over his country like a god and abruptly he knew why the reverend mother had called him home it was the time of the final battle she would make her stand here now against the enemy and as surely as fujiyama would survive yoshida knew that he was to be an integral part of that stand you have brought me the mediator no yuji said as he helped chika carry wolfs body into the room on the top floor of the warehouse near tsukiji this man is very ill nevertheless he is the mediator quiet yuji said to the oracle he was looking anxiously at his halfsister chika was quietly frantic she had been like this ever since the rear wall of forbidden dreams had nearly crushed her in rubble she had seen through the mist the swirling choking stone and concrete dust the sharp hooked blade of the flail rising out of the debris and with it the bloody fingers of a human hand wolfs hand she had given a little cry and projecting her makura na hiruma outwards had begun to clear a path through inanimate objects that had begun to stir on their own desperate sensing the invisible aura of the reverend mother in the malign movements of wood and stone she had concentrated her black sight throwing sharpedged chunks and splintered slabs to either side she had felt too the black febrile tendrils of the reverend mothers makura na hiruma wondered at first why she had not located wolf then felt herself coming under the protection of the psychic fortress he had thrown up at the last minute she had redoubled her frantic efforts and at last she had unearthed wolfs insensate body and had been astonished to find his fortress still intact though he himself was unconscious using all her resources she had managed to drag him from the quagmire of the reverend mothers making but not before she had seen on the other side of the room sumas twisted corpse the sight provoked in her only relief she had brought wolf here to the warehouse yuji had set up as the oracles lab because it was now the only safe place she could think of she had not seen her mother outside forbidden dreams had not looked for her in any event bringing wolf back to minakos house had been out of the question not after her last encounter with her mother chika listening for a pulse any breath of life in wolf tried not to think of the creeping horror of that conversation she projected her makura na hiruma trying to probe beneath the coma she tried again and again to no avail every path was blocked she picked her head up said to yuji i dont know what the reverend mother has done to him but hes dying the danger is in life not death the oracle intoned yuji ignored the beast said to chika is there anything we can do to save him yes the oracle replied he is the mediator chika turned her head in the oracles direction what does it mean ignore it yuji said sadly somethings happened to it i think it is going mad nonsense chika said machines cannot go mad you dont know the oracle what have you done to it its face almost looks human with a sigh yuji told her how hana had insisted on interfacing with the oracle and what had happened to her because of it ive told no one he concluded he paused weeping openly i would not have known what to say but i knew you would understand you of all people must have understood hanas unhappiness the best like hana your makura na hiruma has made you into something you did not want to become chika was silent for a moment then she asked where is her body i did what the oracle what hana asked me to do with it it is on the bottom of the sumida river no this was not the time to remember all the moments with her halfsister but she could not help herself the idea that hana was gone seemed inconceivable she felt hot tears overflowing her eyes running down her cheeks part of her wanted to reach out and hold yuji in their mutual grief but tradition would not allow such an overt show of personal feeling for that they would have to get blind drunk oh hana and all the while her mind was screaming wolf is dying do something youve got to save him but how she asked herself she had tried everything she knew if her makura na hiruma could not save him what could what had the reverend mother done to him she had an idea but it was so insane what is the truth she asked is hana alive or dead that depends on your definition of life and death the oracle said chikasan you must help us hana is here inside me but she is drowning we are both being consumed by a maelstrom of irrational thoughts i can neither interpret nor control a mediator is required a psychic surgeon if you will to end our suffering chika looked at her halfbrother yuji such a mediator is here we can feel it please effect an interface ignore it yuji said the procedure is highly experimental its far too dangerous look what happened to hana but she didnt want to come back the mediator is dying yujisan we can preserve his life but in what form yuji said bitterly the danger is in life not death we beg you to effect the interface chika her hand on wolfs chest looked from his blank face to the oracles black visage and made up her mind do it she said what do what the oracle asks yuji link wolf up to the machine but we cant know the effect it will have on hes dying and theres not a thing either of us can do on our own chika said the interface is his only chance now of course she was right yuji deciding it was best not to think right now began to hook wolf up to the oracle just as he had done with hana you wont regret this the oracle said why should i regret anything yuji said carefully affixing pressure pads to the tips of wolfs fingers you are filled with regrets yujisan about hana aboutme especially aboutyourmother youre imagining things yuji said beginning work on the complex network of wiring that would pierce the skin on wolfs head it is impossible for me to imagine yujisan at least in the sense you have used the word i am not wrong what you really mean is youre never wrong yuji said burying the electrodes one by one dont start getting a superiority complex thats a nasty human aberration you need to be protected from do you think me neurotic yujisan what im talking about is more in the realm of the psychotic yuji said implanting the last of the electrodes psychotics are dangerous yujisan often they are yes yuji said throwing the switch which began the linkup am i dangerous yuji sat back monitoring the progress of the human oracle interface too busy for the moment to answer he had learned a great deal about this process when hana went under and he was watching for electrical spikes unusual eeg activity power overloads that could disrupt the data flow nothing unusual was happening all the meter levels were just where they should be and then everything happened at once the buzzing of an electrical overcharge filled his ears the eeg needles went right off the chart yujis finger flew over his control panels but whatever was happening was beyond even his sophisticated equipments ability to handle yuji whats happening chika cried there was a sharp scent of ozone wolfs mouth opened wide emitted a kind of screaming that set yujis teeth on edge then all the lights on the oracle went out at once ham conrad stepped aboard his fathers schooner influence ii it was a fine early spring day with high puffy cumulus clouds and a strong constant offshore breeze a perfect day for a sail it was funny how things worked out he thought as he cast off he had been about to pick up the phone to call the old man when thornburg had phoned him asking him to meet him at the yacht club for an afternoon sail perfect ham had thought checking twice that he hadnt forgotten to bring the photos of his fathers perfidy with him it was not going to be easy to confront thornburg ham knew for him or for the old man but the revelations contained in the safe at the green branches clinic gave him no choice yosh had been right about his father all along it was a painful truth to absorb but again he had no choice he was still clinging to the hope that he could threaten his father into owning up to his sins repent perhaps make restorations in some way for the people who had died in the clinic return the ones still living to their homeland and dismantle green branches but it was his nature to be optimistic ham went back to the wheelhouse where his father was in the process of backing the schooner out of its slip the crew had been given the day off thornburg had told him damned bother they can be at times always seem to be in your face just when you want privacy the most but then ham recalled thornburg had always felt that servants were the bane of the wealthy the deep rich scent of marine diesel wafted up overtaking for the moment the odour of the salt water away from the harbour ham unfurled and hoisted the mainsail then forward a yankee jib and a smaller staysail because there was an ineffable beauty in a schooner under full sail he worked methodically happily detached for the moment from the concerns that never seemed a part of the sea thornburg had taught him to love sailing perhaps if he had thought of it ham would have understood that this was the one thing he and his father truly shared thornburg guided the influence ii through the chesapeake mindful of the marker buoys and soon the sprawl of washington was far behind them around noon ham furled the sails and they anchored in the lee of a small island thornburg broke out the food fat subs dripping olive oil red peppers and cheese several salads and ricotta cheesecake and a sixpack of iced sapporo beer which they had both come to love in japan seated at the galley table which was set adjacent to the open doorway to the deck thornburg watched his son crunch a gigantic sub into submission while he pushed some greens around his plate and sipped his beer his appetite problematic for years had deserted him utterly in recent days they talked about this and that nothing of real consequence speaking slowly and lazily as if the dazzle of sunlight off the water had turned them somnolent thornburg seemed relaxed if not happy but ham thought that was only to be expected after tiffanys death he on the other hand was tense with expectation of the monumental task ahead of him the thought of mourning gave him the opening he had been desperately seeking ive been thinking he said wiping his hands on a napkin i see you moping around washington not even wanting to be in your own house and it occurs to me you might be happy just taking off taking off thornburg said as if his son was suggesting he retire sure like to aspen or europe even ham pressed on with overbright enthusiasm get your mind off everything clear out the cobwebs rejuvenate the soul thornburg regarded him with a peculiar intensity nothing to do in aspen but spend money and watch the beautiful women run after the ski bums he said as for europe all ill see is germans and japanese remind me of the axis get my blood pressure to dangerous levels he gave ham a cold stare any other bright ideas ham dropped his gaze tapped his fork against a huge hunk of cheesecake besides thornburg said after waiting just the right amount of time i dont want to be away from here too many things might go wrong he continued to study ham with keen purpose making a wager with himself as to when his sons head would come bobbing up take my bioscience research for instance ham stopped tapping his cheesecake there was a breakin at green branches the other night can you imagine what would anyone want at the clinic industrial espionage ham offered setting down the fork that was a good one thornburg thought sometimes ham really did impress him of course thats what we all thought at first but the peculiar thing was the files werent disturbed thornburgs eyes seemed to burn then we found wed caught the thief on video hams head came up and thornburg congratulated himself on winning his bet would you like to see the tape ive got a copy of it here jesus no jesus no thornburg mimicked is that all you can say christ why do i feel like i owe you an explanation ham exploded its you who has a lot of explaining to do thornburg watched his son come unravelled with a kind of cool detachment i dont need to explain any of my actions to anyone he said deliberately time money and privilege have seen quite satisfactorily to that what i do need to know this instant is what my son thinks hes up to breaking into my facility and my safe i want to know stow it sonny thornburg said so sharply that ham jumped in spite of himself if i meant for you to know what was going on at green branches i damn well would have told you i didnt so its none of your business ive made it my business well well thornburg thought whats this more backbone than i thought he had we have to talk about whats been going on at the clinic ham said do we yes for christs sake youre guilty of kidnapping torture murder youre nothing more than a goddamned criminal for the life of me i cant understand how you managed to round up a group of the most brilliant bioscientists under these circumstances for a moment thornburg considered whether he should pursue this line with his son then he thought fuck it he wants it ill give it to him both barrels my god for a military man you can be damned naive he thundered they accepted willingly happily for the money and a free rein at research they could do nowhere else what do you think men are angels no sonny men are men with all the foibles and exploitable weaknesses inherent in the human race give people what they really want and theyll never notice the cost that sounds like a motto worthy of the devil that made thornburg laugh but his laughter only infuriated ham all the more he hated it when thornburg called him sonny but he hated it worse when the old man laughed at him you dont get it do you he said waving copies of the photos he had taken of the documents in the green branches safe your days of omnipotence are over ive found your achilles heel and im not going to let go until you agree to my terms thornburg was almost apoplectic no one has ever successfully dictated terms to me and no one is going to now hams blood was pounding in his ears and he felt as if at any moment he was going to have a heart attack he was sick at having to follow the old hypocrites orders he could no longer live with the knowledge of what thornburg had done what he was continuing to do accepting my terms is the easy way out of the corner youve painted yourself into he said youve broken so many laws ive given up counting them do you have any idea the field day the attorney general would have if he got his hands on this material and how would that happen sonny id give it to him ham was shouting now despite his resolve to handle this in as calm a manner as possible and stop calling me sonny when you stop acting like a tenyearold boy scout ill call you by the name i gave you at birth who made you my judge jury and executioner do you think the worlds so goddamned neat and orderly that we all have to adhere to your tightassed template of conduct poppycock chaos is the law of the day the law of the universe i didnt create the concept of morals ham said hotly he was already aware of how his father had managed to turn the tables on him making him justify his own position on the high ground if anything is common to all the cultures of mankind its morality tell that to the arabs thornburg said or the japanese neither of them ever heard of morality youre wrong ham said desperately trying to find a way back to the subject of his fathers perfidy maybe their morality doesnt conform in all ways to ours but poppycock waste of time to defend those who dont deserve it wont have it from my son for christs sake you make it sound like thats all i am your son just as i was my fathers son until the day he died no no ham jumped up im more than just your son much more thornburg looked up at ham from beneath the bill of his cap and where would you be without me do you have any idea i doubt it i used my influence to get you into prep school college used the same influence to get you set up in tokyo nice and cushy so you could do some legwork for me then i pulled you out of the army and into defense what have you done on your own married a beautiful but useless woman who gives you no pleasure has no appreciation of the life you give her and has so little regard for the union she allows you to run around like a tomcat in heat well why shouldnt she that tennis instructor is giving her the kind of lessons even i find invigorating thats not true ham shouted even though part of him was not surprised at the news sure it is thornburg said unconcerned ive got photos too sonny want to see them he laughed again setting hams teeth on edge ham could remember fights just like this between his parents he had overheard as a child and could still feel the pain of his nails as they had dug into the palms of his hands christ this is evil its beyond evil enough thornburg slapped his hands down on the table upsetting cutlery and aluminium cans dark beer spilled across the surface sizzling like acid youve got access to my secrets and i want em back lets stop the fancy philosophizing and get down to it down to what the deal you ignoramus thornburg said with a glare i should break your arm for breaking into my sanctuary but that took balls a bigger set than frankly i thought you had good for you then youve got the goods i need and ive got the influence you want sounds to me like we got a solid foundation here for a deal so forget the morality bullshit sit the hell down and lets hammer it out that was when ham knew he had got this gambit wrong from the getgo he stared at his father as if seeing him for the first time which in a way he was he had been a fool to believe that he could somehow manoeuvre his father into some kind of compromise instead the inevitable had happened thornburg was forcing him into a deal that would leave no room for morality he saw now that for his father morality was a luxury that with all his money and influence he could not afford and perhaps this was because of his money and influence which were amassed in ways that precluded the possibility of morality the revelation was so profound he felt as if he had been struck between the eyes by a bolt of lightning christ he thought what was i doing being brought up in his house how had mother put up with him but of course he knew thornburg conrad iii exuded the kind of charisma it was difficult to resist even when one began to suspect the source of that allure as being dark and deadly and now he knew with a dread certainty what he should have seen before that there was only one alternative for him the moment he sat down to the table with thornburg to hammer out the parameters of the compromise he would be lost just another fly lured into the glittering web that had trapped so many others no ham said now the sunlight rose like waves from the deck dizzying him and he tried not to flinch from the dark stare of his fathers gaze no compromise no deal theres only one way to stop you im going to the attorney general with the evidence dont be an idiot ham youre not going anywhere with those photos the originals have been burned and when you give me the negatives and all the prints you made the evidence will no longer exist ham smashed his fist down on the tabletop jesus christ listen to you of course the evidence will still exist its bought and sold every day that obscene clinic stays open now dont get violent sonny that never did anyone any good cut the crap ham snapped you can dish that out to anyone you like but not to me not any more he turned on his heel heading for the electric capstan its time we got back to port were not going anywhere thornburg said until this matter is settled to my satisfaction you no longer have any say in the matter ham said over his shoulder if you go anywhere near the capstan ill use this ham whirled squinted into the shade of the open cabin doorway where thornburg still sat behind the galley table what the hell is that what does it look like thornburg said its the speargun i keep around if i see a shark or two are you going to use it only if you make it necessary ham said nothing staring at the wicked barbed tip of the steel bolt that would go right through a sharks tough hide thornburg had stymied him all his life if he thought threats would deter ham now he was in for a surprise now come on over here and sit down so we can talk but ham was shaking his head well only end up doing another one of your deals so ill think ive gotten what i wanted only youll continue what youve been doing no the whole evil cycles got to end here nothing is going to end thornburg said im not going to give up green branches but i promise i wont import any more patients ill make do with the ones i already a kind of rage he never knew even in the heat of the war gripped ham how can you even say something like that what incredible arrogance evil isnt a halfway measure you cant say ill compromise by murdering six people instead of a dozen and expect that will absolve you why not im willing to compromise ham youre the one whos being intractable you cant turn this around ham said this is about you not me its all or nothing you mean that tut the goddamned speargun down all or nothing is not an acceptable proposition take it or leave it ham said heading for the capstan stay away from there fuck you ham said as he began the operation to weigh anchor i wont call you sir and i wont take orders from you any more the bolt from the speargun caught him almost squarely between the shoulderblades it was not in itself a fatal wound but the force of the strike pitched him forward his waist slammed against the gunwale and he toppled offbalance over the side thornburg had already dropped the speargun was heading across the deck he hit the gunwale leaned over staring down into the water he could see a stain in the water blood spreading like a shroud then hams back surfaced the end of the bolt projecting from it like a broken flag christ almighty he whispered as he watched the ends of his sons hair wave gently back and forth like the tendrils of an anemone lines from a wb yeats poem that had been a favourite of his since he had stumbled upon it as a young man beat in his head like a military cadence the falcon cannot hear the falconer the blooddimmed tide is loosed and everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned wolf was standing alone on a long spit of flat land that jutted out into a vast sea overhead clouds viscous and fulminating fled ahead of a rising wind no not alone he could see a figure limned against the magenta sky he moved towards it as he did so the spit of land seemed to lengthen out behind him just as if it were the tongue of some enormous beast besides the gunmetal sea the roiling sky and the featureless spit of land there was nothing else visible and somehow wolf had the sense that the spit was the last fragment of land left in this mad universe there was however the figure as he hurried towards it he could see that it was human female japanese very beautiful she was standing at the very end of the spit of land staring out to sea he supposed he could see her profile and he was struck by how much she resembled minako she turned her head at his approach though he was certain that he had made no sound she had about her an air of ineffable sorrow that made him want to weep and yet she possessed a rare stillness as of a stone at rest in a tide pool or a bird in the moment before it takes flight i am hana she said minakos daughter chikas halfsister what was it about her that made him feel as if he had known her all his life he wondered where am i am i dead your mind is linked with the biocomputer known as the oracle she touched him over his heart there is a poison inside you hold still while i draw it out wolf was about to ask a question but thought instead of how white bow had healed his father in similar fashion there it is done her pale face went white and she clutched him do you hear that what the wind is rising wo not the wind she peered out to sea something else wolf turned his head following her gaze above the sound of the wind he heard something like a dirge or a lament an inchoate cry that chilled him its coming hana said far out beneath the veil of the gunmetal water there was a disturbance an arcing and sucking a movement of the water so vast that the eye could not entirely encompass it what is it wolf said sensing life of a sort beating in a slow heavy pulse something hana said waiting to be bom the fear in her voice was like a third presence on the spit of land wolf listen carefully to me i came here willingly foolish person that i am because i was not meant to exist in the world of mankind i was uncomfortable in my human body unhappy in the polluted world that unthinking mankind had fashioned for itself i came here to find sanctuary to explore the infinite to live in a place immune from pollution only to find that i carried a pollution inside myself and from the moment i arrived here i have been infecting this place with that virus hana i must know no no she pleaded let me finish while i am still in a period of lucidity there is so little time now the oracle and i are one and we are both going mad there was a distinct hump in the centre of the gunmetal sea and the water itself was without waves as if the leviathan beneath was so unimaginably huge that it was stretching taut the very fabric of the ocean she spoke quickly but distinctly and each word had the ring of truth a truth substantiated by his own observations a truth so horrific that wolfs mind was momentarily stunned by the enormity of it still he listened growing more and more absorbed in hanas explanation of what was happening to him and what might happen in her he saw the future a future she had readily almost selfishly she said fled you see the pattern emerging she said at last you see the future and what you must do then hana screamed but that sound was drowned out as she was swept away by the rising wind and then the leviathan emerged from the deep how many choices it must have had how many ways to present itself to him it needed to be healed it needed to know that which is unknowable and for this it had turned to wolf the mediator the psychic surgeon but hana had known better she had understood what the oracle could not that its very matrix was what was driving it insane that had been the ultimate sadness of her new world and the ultimate irony she had learned that for her at least there was no exit and for the oracle there would be no existential catharsis the meaning it was so desperately searching for was beyond its comprehension the danger is in life not death wolf knew what that meant now because hana in her last moments of lucidity had known and had told him the leviathan rising out of the deep had many heads beautiful or hideous they all swung in one direction to study him at once so many heads he could not possibly count them were he to stay in this mad universe for a year the heads beautiful and hideous took up the entire world wolf closed his eyes drew on makura na hiruma projecting a long slender finger through the inky ocean it penetrated the oracle and he could see a kind of schematic of its lapid circuits they made no sense to him and he momentarily felt a kind of panic i have healed you now help me to live to understand he ignored the circuits listened watched touched and he felt its heartbeat or what passed for a life pulse since it had no heart but like all entities it had a core without which it could not survive and he now knew why this universe manifested itself to him as a vast ocean like the tide he felt the pulse waves of energy with a distinct rhythm and concentrating he recognized that cadence from his own mind and those of all human beings it was the wavelike synoptic firing that occurs when one dreams makura na hiruma bequeathed to it by yujis dna and what was left ofhanas psyche had set it to dreaming mad dreams the leviathan beneath the gunmetal ocean that was the ocean was as insane as an entity could be the awesome power of makura na hiruma had opened up so many possibilities so quickly that it had driven the forming brain mad though it was only quasiorganic the oracles brain was almost as complex as the human organ and frighteningly in many respects it was more efficient more focused superior but it was only in its infancy a dreaming mind precocious but vulnerable totally unable to assimilate the gifts in yujis dna in hanas psyche as its powerful mind overwhelmed what remained of hana so her makura na hiruma inundated it the voices of bedlam he felt the onslaught of irrational thoughts as he began to connect to the oracles matrix for a vertiginous instant he became the faces he hung suspended almost gone nearly dissolved in the mad universe halfinsane himself but in that final instant he centred himself recalling the cacophony of voices he had been exposed to when he had touched the minds of the serial murderers he had brought to justice another lifetime but the experience served him well here ignoring the disorienting chaos he projected his makura na hiruma further into the matrix and in so doing intercepted the oracles base cadence distorted the wavefront of its heartbeat interfered with the pattern of its synoptic firing this is the only way i can help you and so did he deliver it from its suffering so did he execute it when thornburg conrad hi returned to his villa at the magnolia terrace country club he felt as if he had suffered radiation burns the taste of his sons betrayal was in his mouth the virus of treason curdled his stomach rage and agony shook him like a tree in a gale he collapsed on an upholstered chair his head in his hands he did not reach for a light switch right now he preferred the cool darkness of the villa of all the people to turn on him why did it have to be the one he relied on the most long ago he had written off his other children as useless dead weights he had pushed out of the nest and into the real world only to discover he had to rescue them from some unimaginable blunder such as being caught with the bosss wife or marrying the wrong woman who was threatening through her lawyer to take them to the cleaners none of them was worth a damn except ham which was why thornburg had helped form hams career using his oldboy network in washington to give his favourite son all the advantages his intelligence and moral strength warranted thornburg dragged himself out of the chair went across the carpeted floor to the bar where he picked up a heavy cutcrystal glass made himself a stiff whisky and soda he downed a third of it at once as if it were a dose of medicine which in this instance it was in the past few weeks he had taken to living in this villa surrounded by the peacefulness of the golf course and the woodland creatures the vast stone house in the midst of the virginia estate which had been his home when tiffany was alive no longer seemed inviting the endless rooms the soft pad of the servants whom he suspected of spying on him gossiping about him in dark corners the now daunting forested hills had become an intolerable burden for his psyche again lines from the yeats poem rang through him things fall apart the centre cannot hold the best lack conviction while the worst are full of passionate intensity christ it seemed like the end of all things he took another long draught of his whisky and soda what did ham think he was up to cracking the safe at green branches photographing the secret documents chronicling the clinics experiments of course there were aspects to those experiments that were illegal but who had made those laws thornburg had had too many dealings with the idiots on capitol hill to feel anything but contempt for them those whose arteries werent already sufficiently hardened to cut off oxygen to their brains were so venal they never managed to get their snouts out of the river of graft that year after year granted them certain return to their privileged sinecures hams major fault was his inability to see beyond the arbitrary laws imposed by mankind if thornburg had learned one thing it was that one could not for long impose an artificial order on the chaos of the universe he took another long swallow of his drink shuddering as he remembered retrieving his sons corpse from the water wrapping it in an extra sail he had brought up from below lashing it tight lacing the package with the auxiliary anchor he had unhooked from its chain only after he had rolled it off the side of the dinghy did he realize that he had forgotten to say a prayer he had tried to mumble something but no words formed in his mind he let out a soft moan now a taste like blood in his mouth and stumbled across the carpet into the bedroom where the serum he needed was hidden beneath the false bottom of his night table drawer he was at the foot of the bed when he became aware that someone was sitting in the easy chair just to the left of the night table whos there he said in the voice of a startled old man dont you recognize my perfume thornburgs head turned this way and that his nostrils flaring stevie he said uncertainly when you cancelled our dinner you said you had to return to new york what are you doing here waiting for you some hard edge in her voice made him wary what has happened he asked himself immediately he was struck by a lance of panic had ham shown stevie the evidence he had stolen from the green branches safe no no that was impossible ham did not even know about his relationship with stevie each day it seemed he was growing more paranoid he needed a shot of the serum but what he needed even more was the result of wolfs infiltration of that bitch minakos world of slow ageing and exceptional power im glad youre here he said at last perhaps you wont be when you hear what i have to say i dont understand id like you to explain why you never told me you and my sister had a relationship stevie he said taking one careful step and sitting on the edge of the bed your sister couldnt seem to cope with growing old you know that when she discovered that i was conducting experiments in countering the effects of ageing she begged me to make her a part of the experiments she willingly became a guinea pig yes and she knew all the risks up front certainly i tried to talk her out of it but i have your correspondence with amanda ah he could see the line of her cheek and brow limned in the seepage of the exterior lights through the wooden shutters and gauzy curtains now he had a good sense of where she was how far away from him he shook his head i need a shot he said as he put his glass down on the night table top opened the bottom drawer stevie waited until he had pushed aside the false bottom his hand deep inside the drawer to switch on the bedside lamp thornburg blinked struggling to get his eyes adjusted to the abrupt brightness of the immediate environment looking for this he could see stevie now quite desirable in khaki jeans a creamcoloured shirt under a leather and melton wool baseballstyle jacket open in front normally he would have admired her long legs the swell of her breasts but at this moment he was more interested in the thin lambskin gloves she wore this was because she held his army colt in her strong right hand aiming almost pointblank at him are you sure its loaded stevie gave him a chilly smile i loaded each chamber myself surely you wouldnt use that weapon stevie he said youre a psychiatrist you know the consequences of such an act not only in a court of law but for years afterward inside your own head besides ive done nothing to warrant your holding a gun on me you had amanda killed thornburg stared at her youre just plain crazy why on earth would i she was dying from the treatments you were giving her shut up dont deny it she nodded just like tiffany died only with amanda it was different you had complete control over tiffany where is her body now thornburg at a mortuary no there was no funeral no nothing im willing to bet you had your ghouls at the clinic dissect her for scientific research and then cremate her nice and neat and no awkward questions asked by a medical examiner just one of your pet doctors at the clinic writing up the death certificate but you couldnt do that with amanda she was out in the real world beyond your grasp when you knew she was dying you couldnt just spirit her off to the clinic there would have been major questions raised had she been allowed to die of the drug you have been pumping into her so you had her killed and to complete the picture you made it seem as if she had been the victim of a sneak thief so common in new york especially where she lived you knew it wouldnt cause a great deal of comment or curiosity are you finished thornburg said thats quite a clever story but i promise you thats all it is a story i dont know who has been feeding you this insane fabrication but i can assure you shut up stevie said this time more harshly she stood up as if she had so much pentup rage she could no longer bear to sit still ive seen your fine machiavellian hand for myself and the thing i cant fathom is that i used to admire how you wrapped people important powerful people around your finger you built mortons career that way and you got me my entree into the level of society i had always dreamed of being a part of you were so powerful like a sun and i was close to you absorbing your heat basking in the reflected glory of your power i was your friend i invoked your name and giltedged doors opened to me my god how i used to shiver with anticipation i used to imagine myself an actor on broadway taking the stage how tangled i became in your lies i was an actor but not in the benign way i had at first imagined i was living a he every day every night and the last straw was how i prostituted myself for you with wolf i look back on that episode now with a kind of fear and loathing i suspect you could never imagine because its myself i fear and loathe when i think about how i gained wolfs trust and then exploited it for you you were right about one thing i do love wolf and i believe that given time he would have come to love me but you see it can never be because our relationship is false tainted by the deceit i performed for you i could never face him honestly again with that knowledge and i could never dare tell him what id done to him come on stevie he said you know better than this i liked amanda she was a friend i felt sorry for her if i was in error it was merely a momentary weakness of friendship i felt sorry for her but i see now i never should have let her talk me into entering her in the clinic programme i felt terrible about her death but really it was random chance the city killed her new york its tragic but theres no one to blame least of all me im no longer interested in how many ways you can twist the truth thornburg stevie you of all people should understand that youre too wrapped up in your emotions right now to be able to separate truth from fiction i told you to shut up and i meant it stevie held the colt steady centred on his heart and thornburg could see that at the moment the risk of trying to disarm her was too high she really was starting to annoy him he needed time to sort through what had happened aboard the sloop it was vitally important for him to come to terms with what reading these letters of amandas i suddenly realized that i have nothing of value stevie continued my marriage is a mockery wholly without love or real feeling its become merely a matter of convenience although i now suspect that this has more or less been the case from the very beginning i feel increasingly disconnected from my patients and my social life is so hollow so false it makes me weep wolf awakened the only real emotion ive felt in years other than my sorrow over amandas death and now that avenue has been fouled by my betrayal but it isnt after all just you who is evil thornburg the evil lies inside our own selves like a trap whose jaws are just waiting to snap closed and imprison us in the darkness of the human soul i blame myself you see as much as i blame you she pushed the colt towards him further her arm straightened and so tense that thornburg suddenly knew he had been wrong about her she was getting ready to pull the trigger too late he saw it all now why she needed to talk she had presented herself with an ironclad rationale that would protect the psyche from the trauma that would inevitably ensue from shooting another human being i have the letters but they would not stand up in a court of law stevie said i have no objective proof that you ordered my sisters murder but i nevertheless know youre responsible i cannot in good conscience allow you to get away with it i have no choice and nothing to lose an instant before she pulled the trigger thornburgs right arm swept out swatting the heavy cutcrystal glass that sat on the top of the night table it struck stevie on the shoulder as the explosion roared thornburg was thrown violently back acrossthe bed the bullet embedded in his ribcage just below his heart stevie screamed staring at the blood overflowing the wound seeping into the counterpane his eyes were wide and staring but she could not bring herself to look into them she began to shake weeping uncontrollably she was so horrified by the blood the symbol of what she had wrought creeping across the bed that she fled the villa through the woods at the edge of the golf course she ran only then realizing she still clutched the gun in her hand with a convulsive heave she hurled it into the underbrush stumbling on until she climbed into her rented car her mind was numb and she had to grip the wheel very hard but she had enough control to drive carefully observing all speed limits and lights she stopped at the first phone booth fumbled out some change and called the police she told them about the body without identifying either thornburg or herself the voice at the other end of the line was still urgently asking her questions as she hung up when she stepped out of the booth she fell to her knees and vomited dizzy and weak she staggered back to her car and sat her hands loosely on the wheel staring up at the immensity of the sky she heard the warm engine ticking over but nothing else her mind began to function in a semblance of normalcy again placing one coherent thought after another it was one thing to contemplate murder to be certain that it was justified quite another to then go out and perpetrate the act murder was murder and as stevie was just beginning to find out it would always have its consequences twenty tokyo night and the metropolis modern tokyo was a metropolis of the kind of twilight melancholy possible only in a resurrected society still steeped in the profound nihilism of defeat that it was also a society that mindlessly embraced the concept of the empty symbol whether it be in the form of rabid namebrand consumerism or idolization of an emptyheaded popstars pretty face lent added poignancy to the stylized dolour of its ultramodern facade wolf prowling nighttime tokyo with the stealth of his namesake was struck by how alien and at the same time how wilful this form of architecture was it allowed for no interpretations no adornments no possibility of compromise at all it was as unyielding and resolute as a samurais purpose he was a long way from the mad inverted universe of the oracle the late oracle afterwards he had imagined hana free at last he was never so happy to be moving about in the dark the brilliant vertical neon pennants of the ginza far behind him a pearlescent halo like false dawn or eternal twilight he felt the melancholic sadness of beauty just past its prime of fleeting happiness of the decay that inexorably follows the fullness of youth thinking these things he remembered hana sad and so lonely trapped in a modernday hell at least partially of her own making he had the sense that she would have understood the way tokyo appeared to him tonight light and chikas silhouette from his shadowsteeped vantage point he watched the entrance to forbidden dreams as the dwarfish woman in her mantailored suit ushered chika inside the door closed and the street shimmered in the beams of oncoming headlights then the car had swung past and darkness fell again the pale wash from the ginza fell short of this side street making it seem part of another world no one walked the street although wolf could hear a male voice rising and falling punctuated by bursts of embarrassed laughter sounds of an incomprehensible tv show leaking through a window somewhere close by it had come down to this one last plan so dangerous only their desperation could have persuaded them to try it wolf had marked the time chika entered forbidden dreams and now the minutes seemed as attenuated as pulled taffy wrapping themselves around the darkness here pulling the shadows tight against the buildings facades the first face he had seen when he had awakened as if from a long sleep was chikas he had never been so happy to see anyone how he loved her and now he wondered whether he was sending her to her death time the dial on his watch glowed yellow in the dark wolfs eyes he checked the street again waited for another car to pass its headlights sweeping past him raking the buildings as they did in those old films noirs with the obligatory prison breakout scene he moved down the block keeping to the deepest shadows before he crossed the street to the forbidden dreams side then he went quickly around the corner and as he and chika had rehearsed it earlier moved down the block turning the second corner with his head down his shoulders hunched he walked quickly rudely with his elbows out as the japanese did while he was too large to be mistaken for a native he would not be taken for a tourist either he passed by the section of rear wall the reverend mother had blown out in her attempt to destroy him saw the barbed wire sunk into the drying ferroconcrete he hurried on wisely passing it by he was in another of tokyos older narrow streets so anonymous it had no name even longtime natives of this city had frequently to ask directions to destinations such as this street when he reached the blank facade of the second of the forbidden dreams buildings he took another look around there was a narrow alleyway running part way down the near side of the building wolf slipped into this he unwrapped the bandages on his lacerated left hand concentrated again his makura na hiruma on the wounds which were already healing at a phenomenal rate only red welts were still visible he flexed his hand felt no pain only a momentary stiffness which the flexing dissipated still to make sure he would not hurt it he slipped on a leather glove supple enough to allow him full movement yet strong enough to protect him centring himself he reached up for the first ferroconcrete outcropping chika assured him would be there this second building within which the reverend mothers rooms were laid out was connected to the first building which housed the club itself by two corridors between which was the exquisite garden where the reverend mother had interrogated him it had a roughhewn texture unlike the facade on the club side at least halfway up now wolf had reached that point he was stretched upwards on his precarious perch searching for another of the outcroppings where the bricks of ferroconcrete overlapped there was none carefully reaching back he unfurled a nylon rope fastened at one end to a clawlike hook of a lightweight titaniumsteel alloy he threw it upwards and on the second try felt the claw engage the inside of the roof wall he jerked hard several times to make certain the claw had wedged itself against the ferroconcrete then he hauled himself up to the roof he crouched there for a moment and it was impossible not to remember the rooftop in new york so far away yet held alive inside his mind the pouring rain the brush with the unknown the killing rage inside him the onesided struggle with amandas murderer crashing through the skylight he closed his eyes momentarily dizzy what was happening to him hana had explained some of it but even she did not know it all he had after all existed inside the biomind of the oracle for who knew how long yuji had said it had been not more than several minutes but like dreamtime it had seemed like hours what had really happened to him while he and the oracle had been connected that was the mystery had data been transferred had some of the biomind been incorporated into his mind he was shaking unable now to continue along those lines concentrate on the job at hand he told himself otherwise youll never live long enough to discover the answer above him towered the colossal shinto spires of tokyo brandname buildings proclaiming the economic miracle that defined postmodern japan below him were the natural elements of a garden that in mimicking nature in so stylized a fashion managed to negate it and somewhere between the two was the woman who would be emperor of the world i am startled by how much i missed you the reverend mother curled one long fingernail scraped it down his bare chest is it good to be home ill miss the washington hamburgers yoshida said i developed a taste for meat over there i discovered no one makes a hamburger like a black man they were in one of the tatami rooms on the ground floor of the second building that overlooked the garden the multidirectional glow from the rooms around the garden lent it a spectral quality the periphery was dimly lighted while the centre remained absolutely dark like the heart of a sleeping gem the reverend mother objected to lights in her garden they disrupted the ki the intrinsic energy so carefully accumulated by rock moss fern tree and pebble the natural elements of the garden and the conrads pere and fits yoshida smiled like planets in the grip of entropy neither will survive their close encounter with us splendid the reverend mother clapped her hands like a fiveyearold she leaned over kissed yoshida on his collarbone she bared her white teeth nipped his flesh then held on until the blood flowed the reverend mothers teeth sank deeper into his flesh and yoshidas eyes closed ive hurt you she said i didnt feel a thing he took her and kissed the blood off her lips there was about their actions something of a ritual this was part of their relationship as with mother and son guru and acolyte bishop and priest inquiry and response were dictated not only by the individual but by the larger context of the role each played but you feel this he did not even wince yes he said through partly opened lips the reverend mother could hear the soft hiss and suck of his breath through his mouth and as she placed the flat of her hand on the centre of his chest she could feel the sheen of moisture she had produced if i hurt anyone else that way they would have been down on their knees his nostrils were dilated the only sign of the excruciating nerve pain she had inflicted on him nishitsu included yes the reverend mother studied his breath control with objective curiosity endurance was never his long suit her elongated fingers curled down his arms sliding appreciatively over the smooth muscles then she turned speaking of nishitsu he should be here i summoned him ten minutes ago maybe one of the clubs little boys caught his attention yoshida said the reverend mother giggled like an adolescent youd like an hour alone with nishitsu wouldnt you i want his eye now the reverend mother really laughed do you think it will give you his power if you eat it isnt that what you taught me the reverend mother closed her eyes for a moment i would give a great deal to see you go to work on him perhaps i should allow it yoshida studied her as he considered this nishitsu coordinates all the toshin kuro kosai activity worldwide you could not afford to allow it it is a mistake to rely so heavily on one person the reverend mother said it distances you from what must be done and gives someone else a false sense of his own power i am perhaps at this stage with nishitsu but even though you are the reverend mother you are nevertheless a woman you need nishitsu to keep all the toshin kuro kosai lines functioning he grunted as the pain flooded through him with such blinding force that he actually staggered the vascular constriction she had produced at the back of his neck was causing a spasming that sent fierce lances like shards of glass into his brain please accept my apologies he said when he was able i merely wished to point out the possible consequences of giving nishitsu up tool to question me the reverend mother said with that expression cats get when licking up cream i have already sunk my claws deep inside nishitsus brain i am sucking out his makura na hiruma day by day he is good only to nourish me ill take care of the rest when the time comes yoshida was about to point out that she would require another figurehead if she was to continue controlling the members of the black blade society in place within the giant conglomerates around the globe when she curled her fingers around his forearm and raised her head to the ceiling there is an animal on my roof yoshida followed her gaze then cocked his head i dont feel anything neither do i nevertheless its there the last shred of the future i dan see tells me so bring the animal to me in the room of five shadows the reverend mother said quietly wolf raised himself from his crouch rewound the nylon cord and went quickly across the tarred roof television and sophisticated digitaltransmission satellite dishes rose like deformed flora along with low grilled structures he recognized as a complex air filtration system he had almost reached the far side of the roof below which was the garden when he felt the momentary blurring of perception that told of an encounter with another makura na hiruma aura this one had a familiar taste which he could not immediately place he slid on his stomach towards the edge of the roof carefully pulled himself forward so that he could peer down he saw the dark shapes of rocks and trees fans of fern mounds of moss light crawled across the miniature landscape of the garden like syrup spilled on a countertop he felt the movement of the familiar aura trying to place it he anchored the titaniumsteel claw gingerly lowered himself down the nylon cord to the spongy floor of the garden putting his back against the largest of the rocks he watched for silhouettes moving beyond the windowdoors to the rooms facing into the garden he closed his eyes extended makura na hiruma outwards in concentric circles until he pinpointed the familiar aura in his mind he could see the layout of the second building as chika had outlined it for him he saw that the auras movements had a purpose though its owner could not sense him he or she could guess at his purpose and so as he closed in he could feel the other persons movement closing off paths to the reverend mothers rooms it was like a chess match played in the dark wolf went through a partially open doorway into a deserted room it was typical of those on the second buildings ground floor tatami mats stucco walls small dark wood cabinets with heavy grain and pitted iron hardware the japanese minimalist approach that was very old and had never gone out of style as he went he began to rely more and more completely on makura na hiruma now more than ever it was imperative for him to move as quickly and as silently as possible while chika kept the dangerous nishitsu away wolf would surgically extract the insane reverend mother from her surroundings on the surface it seemed an impossible task after all she had already defeated him once but he had an added edge now in pulling him back from the dead the biocomputer had subtly altered his makura na hiruma in what way hana had not known and it was still a mystery to wolf himself the fact was the reverend mother had to be destroyed the wave of senatorial murders the passage of the restrictive trade bill the dismantling of americas economic superstructure would continue unabated unless she was stopped and who was there to make the attempt but him this plan had as much chance of success as any other he and chika had thought of it might in fact end in nothing more than a suicide attack the risk was that enormous but he was addicted to risk what good was life without it peter matheson had said to him in the new south wales night risk had been the major factor in peters life he could still see the peculiar feral glow in his fathers eyes during the time he had spent with him and the aboriginal girl in lightning ridge no wonder he had run off to australia and in the end was peter mathesons son so much different wolf as he made his careful way through the warren of connecting corridors and rooms did not now think so he was in his own lightning ridge now a place where the laws of civilization were either ignored or deliberately mocked these lords of the toshin kuro kosai had made the conscious decision to put themselves beyond every law that mankind had amassed in a little over two thousand years in a way did that not make them all insane he stopped in his tracks and swivelled the echo from the others makura na hiruma aura had moved and wolf moved with it doubling back on the way he had come pressing himself into shadowfilled niches or through doorways at the hint of another presence at length he came to the room within which the other sat stood or crouched with his hand on the fusuma door he hesitated a moment could this be a trap but no he knew that these people could not read his own aura so they had no way of knowing where he was the other was in there all right and he could have no idea that wolf was just outside he opened the fusuma just a hair enough so that he could see that one lamp illuminated the otherwise darkened room from the angle of the shadows along the tatami mats he placed the lamp at the far lefthand corner he slid the door another fraction and now he could see that this was one of the inner rooms with only one access that meant he would have to go in very fast using the shock of recognition to his advantage he crouched by the side of the fusuma breathing tidally feeling the blood pounding in his veins the strange black power continuing to unravel within him and the waves of this new feeling that now and again had lapped at his consciousness ever since he had returned from the oracles inner universe counting off the seconds he kicked the fusuma all the way open and leapt into the room rolling in a ball along the tatami mats coming up in a crouch ready for whoever lurked inside but there was no one inside save himself there was only a burnished bronze mirror propped up in the centre of the room he came closer to it so that he could see his own reflection in the highly polished metal and yet it was the others aura he felt emanating from it projection he thought the bastard can somehow project his aura but how wolf felt something but looking up saw only a shadow as feet clamped either side of his neck the sonuvabitch had been hiding in the ceiling a slender slice of light illuminated yoshidas cheek and jaw and wolf recognized the man who had met him in the restaurant in washingtons chinatown and had led him to the spook shipley and now as if a trigger in wolfs mind had been pulled he recognized the aura it was that of the shadow he had fought that night on the rooftop of amandas apartment building the shadow that had almost killed him that had murdered amanda christ he thought so it wasnt kamiwara and it wasnt suma it was jason yoshida the blow from yoshidas left heel struck him just beneath the ear the juka as the martial artist knows it wolfs entire left side went numb and his legs turned to rubber he would have slumped to the floor but yoshidas death grip held him fast yoshidas feet were like a noose around wolfs neck squeezing tighter impeding the flow of blood and oxygen to the brain he was quite coolly and efficiently asphyxiating wolf it did him no good to realize that in relying so heavily on his newfound power he had neglected the basic tenets of his police training he should have checked the ceiling the moment his first impression led him to believe that the room was empty his makura na hiruma was not infallible and he was not yet a god a lesson well learned but what good would it do him if he was dead he grunted as yoshidas fierce grip tightened and pulled him upwards until his feet dangled off the floor he was jerking this way and that like a berserk puppet his vision was blurring and he was no longer able to think coherently his eyes blinked rapidly and his mouth was open and gasping he wanted to raise his arms to his neck to have them do something to break yoshidas lethal hold on him but they seemed made of stone separate from the rest of his body there was a buzzing in his head like a swarm of flies rising and falling over a lump of carrion he knew he was dying he could imagine his face white with exsanguination the rictus of death already forming he had seen so many faces like it on the nighttime streets of new york suck blood from the stone what was there a voice in his head with the buzzing of the flies he could not be sure suck blood from the stone he heard it consciousness flickering and it seemed as if he slept for a while wake up the buzzing again a black and red shroud beginning to cover him the stone was his body yes his body stop struggling what stop struggling ill die youre dying now he stopped struggling let his body hang loose become elastic and now all the ki the life force the intrinsic energy rushed to the centre of his being the makura na hiruma rose up in a pillar through the centre of his spine into the base of his brain then the shower of bright sparks began a black wind was rising a dark beast was forming twining itself around yoshidas legs digging in with long curved talons there was a fountaining of ki so that the atmosphere in the room dimmed thickened to the consistency of water yoshida coughed heavily gagged and lost his hold on the ceiling he and wolf with him dropped to the floor in the process he lost his hold on wolfs neck wolf lay on the floor unmoving breathe he ordered himself breathe the blood of energy he had sucked from the stone of his body was helping he breathed into his hara his lower belly as he had been taught by his aikido sensei but the resumption of feeling brought with it intense pain his neck felt bloated to three times its size the bruised skin and muscles in intense spasm breathing again ceased and the other was coming for him he too had unsheathed his makura na hiruma there was an unpleasant smell in the room as of an open sewer wolf managed to struggle to his knees by that time yoshida had reached him wolf grabbed his extended right wrist with his right hand yanked hard on it while swivelling to his right yoshidas own momentum pulled him off balance wolf chopped down hard on the inside of yoshidas elbow joint with the edge of his right hand the bone broke at almost the same instant yoshidas forehead slammed into the tatami mats wolf still swivelling around pulled using his left arm on the broken joint as a fulcrum spinning yoshida onto his back wolf began to pant his arm muscles trembled and so starved for oxygen was he that his entire body began to shake he knew he was done through finished yoshidas initial attack had robbed him of blood and energy if the other got up now broken arm or no wolf knew he was as good as dead yoshida rolled over got heavily to one knee the pain in wolfs neck was almost unbearable with an inchoate cry yoshida rushed at him wolf could not even raise his head instead sent a black fist hammering down on yoshida yoshida tried to block it with his own makura na hiruma but too late realized that it had been a feint wolf using yoshidas own projection trick against him had used the bronze mirror to bounce his aura while preparing the real strike from yoshidas weakened right side the black fist of wolfs makura na hiruma struck yoshida flush on the right side he had only time enough to give a brief cry of dismay it was like being hit by a speeding truck his body was flung across the room slammed full force against the stucco wall blood erupted as if from a burst water main spattered the walls the tatami mats the fusuma out into the corridor blood dripped from the ceiling where yoshida had lain in wait for wolf wolf lay back closed his eyes for a moment and listened to the unnatural rain i could never fathom why the reverend mother didnt use you to control your halfbrother naoharu nishitsu said because she is smarter than you chika thought but she smiled as she said yuji was never one to take advice from the female members of his family nishitsu laughed except his mother she had waylaid him as he had hurried through the nearly deserted cafe section of forbidden dreams he had obviously been on his way to the second building where the reverend mother sat like a great spider in the middle of her web it was vital that she continue to redirect his attention from what would be happening in a very few minutes across the garden she did not envy wolfs confrontation with the reverend mother but whatever the outcome she knew she must leave the two of them to it yuji was never one to take anyones advice nishitsu said now what is wrong with that man he is almost american in his rabid pursuit of individualism how can he sympathize with the americans at every turn they try to corrupt us you forget that the americans made us what we are today nishitsusan chika said i forget nothing about the americans nishitsu said angrily do you think i could forget what they did to us my family is from hiroshima those that survived the cataclysm carry the american scars inside them i myself can never sire children the american atomics did that to me so dont speak to me favourably of the americans the time of hiroshima and nagasaki was long ago nishitsusan as were the numerous atrocities our own commanders and soldiers perpetrated shall we spend the rest of our lives poisoned by the sins of the past the past forms the present nishitsu said shortly it is impossible to throw it away but not to bury it chika said nishitsu studied her for some time and she had the impression that his opal eye was seeing clear through her as if confirming this he said forgive me chikasan i must go i am late for an appointment she had to do something do you always run from defeat nishitsusan what what did you say he was really angry now but at least she had his full attention you know im right she pressed on youre simply too stubborn to admit it its time to live in the world that is instead of being intent on changing it to suit your own needs nishitsu grabbed her jerking her against him his opal eye blazed in fury what has your time in america done to you chikasan he pulled her forward towards the fusuma out onto the corridor i think you had better come with me the reverend mother should hear this heresy from your own lips he pushed chika rudely through the open doorway took an iron grip on her arm as he guided her down the corridor they passed the garden and chika knew they had crossed into the second building she had to do something to stop this she saw a sliding door dug in her heels and spun away from him in almost the same motion she slid back the door hurled herself through the doorway closet she turned just in time to be slammed into the shelves along the narrow rear wall cans of paint cleanser lacquer thinner tumbled down on her along with brushes dropcloths sandpaper and paper sacks of sand she threw one of these at nishitsu but he brushed it aside he reached down hauled her to her feet he hit her several times in rapid succession if you raise a hand to me he said in a low voice i wont hesitate to kill you he grinned do you think i dont know of your treachery yours and that of your madwoman mother the black spectre of his makura na hiruma filled the room like a genie let out of the bottle now youll come with me to see the reverend mother he leered at her as he hit her harder beginning to enjoy her mounting grunts of pain you and your damnable halfbrother yuji i never trusted either of you why should i i was the one who told the reverend mother she should keep an eye on minako and i was right the whole shian family should be exterminated no doubt it will be now he hit her one last time and her eyes rolled up in her head and she collapsed against him wolf was searching for the reverend mother but he could not find her in any of the groundfloor rooms he halted for a moment at first he had used makura na hiruma to clamp down on the pain but that had not helped him to breathe it was more than the pain that was debilitating him it was the trauma the others attack had inflicted on the muscles tendons and blood vessels in his neck so with a tentative hand he began to wield makura na hiruma to heal himself but this had taken a great deal of effort and while the pain was almost completely gone now and the swelling was greatly reduced his strength had ebbed he knew he should rest but he had no idea how long chika could keep nishitsu occupied he had to find the reverend mother and deal with her before the entire building was alerted and the full force of the black blade society could be brought to bear on him and chika where was she listen the voice said in his mind at the very top of forbidden dreams he heard chika saying through a door inscribed with double phoenixes he went quickly through the corridors built with numerous ninetydegree angles to stop the evil spirits from gaining access to the rooms beyond he found the stairs and went up them three at a time second floor third floor fourth above him was the roof he felt the silence here as thick as tar though the windows were open to cool the rooms there were no nightbirds singing not a breath of air stirred the branches of the delicate dwarf maples in the garden below he went through each room methodically his makura na hiruma tuned only peripherally to the environment the rooms were larger here more luxurious vivid contemporary western art mixed with powerful stone carvings delicate handwoven silk carpets and other more arcane artefacts from another age untold wealth was on display here he searched the top floor as he had done lawrence moravias penthouse in another time another place that had been another wolf matheson and yet this was wolf matheson as well behind a step tansu black as night chika had said yes there it was wolf took a complete inventory of the room which had about it something of an antechamber it was windowless the lighting coming from fluorescent tubes mounted on the bare concrete walls below were antique chinese votive tables of some heavy dark wood every square inch of the tabletop was covered with brightly painted miniature robots toys really although by their age one would think they would fetch quite a price at any auction house in japan all the robots were manshaped there were none like robbie the robot in forbidden planet who was merely a bipedal hulk there was something eerie about this display of mechanical toys perhaps because they were meant to resemble men their faces appeared empty awaiting a command from their general their colours were heightened to a technicolor blaze by the cold fluorescent lights it was as if at any moment an incantation would be spoken and the miniature army would come to life he went across the antiseptic blackandwhite tile floor to the step tansu black as night recalling what chika had told him how minako had moved the chest with seeming ease he searched behind it found a button pressing it moved the tansu aside and he saw the door inscribed with the double phoenixes he put the flat of his hands against their feathered breasts pushed hard the door opened wolf stepped into the room of five shadows and saw chika she was strung up in a star shape a banner fluttering from the thick roughhewn beams of the ceiling she was naked framed by the large pane of glass set in the far wall her head lolled on her breast her hair hung lank with sweat and blood dripped from ten thousand tiny cuts in her flesh wolf stared at her in shock and screamed shock was of course what the reverend mother had wanted him to feel shock closed down the sensory system scrambled the brains synapses interfered with the data streaming in from the environment ah these things she counted on and she got wolf was blown backwards by a hot gust of black wind slammed against the cedarplanked wall pinned there like a specimen in a killing jar which in a way he was the brain is such a mysterious thing the reverend mother said in my own fashion i have conquered life and death but what mysteries still await me inside the human mind wolf could see her now but so aware was he of the horror overhanging her that he paid her scarcely any attention this was just as she had planned it i must admit i was somewhat taken aback when you were able to stand up to yoshida i raised him trained him after all he and chika were the closest things i had to kin you killed yoshida and you will be responsible for chikas death as well she came closer and he could see now that she was clad in a kimono of gold thread interwoven were mythical animals in red and black some in toshin kuro kosai would consider you a threat she produced a malicious smile but i see you as an opportunity that comes only once in a lifetime i would not kill you what are you talking about youve already tried your best to kill me you mean the drug into which i dipped sumas flail oh there you are wrong it was meant only to subdue you to quiet your warriors heart while i took you to me but then you grabbed the blade with your hand you absorbed too much of the drug she shook her head but her eyes never left his no the real threat to your life comes from minako you think i am lying but i will tell you that if you somehow walk away from here she will surely seek you out and destroy you its only logical really the only way you will leave here alive is if i am dead then she will have an accurate gauge on just how powerful you are dont you see it yet tabula rasa you will be more powerful than she is and that she will not tolerate the danger is in life not death the oracle had quite accurately predicted studying his face with loving care the reverend mothers smile widened and he could feel her grip on him tightening he tried to think but putting one thought after another was as difficult as moving in quicksand and perhaps as deadly said the voice in his mind of course there is only one sure way to find out how truly powerful your sight is she stopped in front of him it was so still he could hear the lentitudinous drip of blood from the ten thousand wounds she had inflicted on chika was chika dead or alive he wondered dully only one way there was a stirring in the room a black hot gyring in front of his face and he could see in his mind a black blade as slender and wickedlooking as a scalpel thats right the reverend mother said it is a scalpel and with it i will dissect your mind extracting the mystery of your unique makura na hiruma from the core of you i can do it ive spent years perfecting this technique of psychic surgery shall i show you the bones of all those who have gone before you whose makura na hiruma is now stored inside me i can you know theyre all here companions in the night she kept on coming towards him her smile as tender as a lovers you see me tabula rasa and what you see is a great engine that will never run down that only gets more powerful as my hunger increases very soon now i will have eaten my fill all others in japan with the power will be gone there will be no possible opposition to my rule and then i will dictate unilaterally to the toshin kuro kosai members inside the worlds largest conglomerates i will possess what no other woman in the history of the world could even dream of let alone attain power over men everywhere the ultimate power the madness leaked out of her eyes spilled out through her lips she exuded it like some noxious musk the sweat of corruption blossomed in the room with such force that wolf felt his stomach heave time to begin he closed his eyes saw the black scalpel gleaming evilly in his minds eye dont close your eyes the voice inside his mind said but the blade he opened his eyes saw the longfingered hands of the reverend mother just before they clamped each side of his head he tried to move but could not dont close your eyes another message from deep inside of him where could it be coming from how could he even be hearing it for a moment he panicked certain that he was as insane as the reverend mother then he steadied recalling how the mysterious voice had given him a clue to defeating yoshida dont close your eyes what could it mean the psychic scalpel was poised to commence its first incision he tried to summon up his makura na hiruma but somehow he had lost his way the quicksand the reverend mother had thrown him into was slowing him down his mind felt as if it were encased in amber his reasoning suspended just as poor chika was suspended over them chika dont close your eyes he flinched mentally as pain flooded through him as the psychic blade touched his mind look at chika he did not want to the sight so hideous both of them so helpless his brain being sliced dont close your eyes he looked beyond the black scalpel beyond the grinning visage of the reverend mother at the atrocity of what had been done to chika blood dripping there must be a pool of it by now she must be dead looked at the tatami mats beneath her and there was no blood there was no blood the black scalpel slicing deeper no blood how could that be dont close your eyes and then he knew he looked again at the spot where chika had been strung up concentrating through the terrible pain focusing on her and nothing else chika vanished of course she vanished she had never been there in the first place the reverend mother had trapped him with an image she had created out of makura na hiruma energy it was the shock and pain of this image that had bound him here that had rendered him helpless that had allowed her the tenths of a second she had needed to breach all his defences and establish her control over him what an insidious monster he was about to act when the red and black mythical beasts on the reverend mothers kimono sprang to life dragons winged serpents all manner of chimera had been born as one their baleful heads turned in his direction and they hissed streams of fire venom acid then from the shadows behind them emerged a figure so familiar that he froze it was his father peter matheson looking tanned and fit his texas rangers badge pinned to his faded chambray shirt swept his tengallon hat off his head used it as he always did to beat the dust off his stained chaps he grinned at his son as his right hand flashed to his hip his drawn colt sixgun pumped bullet after bullet into the creatures that had come to life stepping over the grotesque corpses he bolstered his gun extended his dry callused hand good to see you again son he said i see youve done yourself proud it was an automatic response wolf took his fathers hand excruciating pain lanced up his arm making him tremble his teeth chatter he tried to free his hand watched in horror as his fathers skin began to peel away revealing a thousand white insects busily at work on the rotting flesh then they too vanished and only the bare skull angular and gleaming vilely remained the jaws hinged open abruptly clashed shut he jerked his hand away and the spectre of his father pulled from his memory like taffy disappeared the grotesque corpses were gone as well only the reverend mother remained her black blade ready to resume its incision he found himself on his knees and he could scarcely catch his breath his head ached fiercely he knew she was throwing everything in her formidable arsenal against him but he began to understand now that each tactic had a common thread shock she paralysed her victims with this form of poison before consuming them he wiped chika the creatures and his father from his mind they were all images of her creation meant to keep him from thinking clearly this was not an easy task she had the knack of probing the psyche and extracting the bits that would produce the maximum effect and he had very little time already another image was beginning to take shape shimmering eerily in front of him he might not be able to survive this one he centred himself concentrating only on the wellspring of the power inside him freed his makura na hiruma rose up like black lightning from the core of him the length and the breadth of it filled his mind his body the room it healed his wound as it shot past him it grabbed the reverend mothers black blade the essence of her own makura na hiruma laid bare to perform the grisly surgery and smashed it into a thousand glittering shards wolf could feel the reverend mothers own makura na hiruma trying to recover gathering itself to repel the assault firelight filled his mind ten thousand maddened wasps filled the room but it was too late her black blade had been destroyed and now the mask of her humanity dropped away and wolf confronted what was beneath the skinless boneless mass of her madness for one brief moment it writhed and groaned and wolf was given a glimpse at another future where this thing was given free rein the goldthread kimono burst into flame the creatures moaning as they burned then his makura na hlruma gained full power he reached out grasped her heart and squeezed fiercely the reverend mother screamed as she was blown backwards across the room she cartwheeled through the window wolf ran to the shattered window looked down the body of the reverend mother was draped over the largest of the rocks in the garden on first glance the darkness made it possible to think of the scene as a kind of surreal painting then the horned moon slid from behind thick clouds and her awkward position was revealed the back fractured by the rocks highest point the pelvis shattered by a secondary outcropping the stone itself was dark with the wash of her blood wolf clung to the shattered windowframe exhausted unto death his head began to loll dont close your eyes the mysterious voice repeated in his mind like a mantra twentyone tokyo washington chika brought wolf back to minakos house on a stretcher he did not require hospitalization she told her mother only complete rest minako was overjoyed to see them both she had known of course when the reverend mother had ceased to exist it was as if an irritation deep in her intestines had been expunged she bade them put wolf in her own bedroom and she insisted on seeing to his every comfort herself when he woke she slowly fed him hot miso soup boiled rice and green tea while he slept she sat patiently beside him and when chika looked in on them she smiled at her daughter when she fed him she often spoke to him so you became my great black blade after all she said you see wolfsan it was your karma the path you had to take such things i know are difficult for a westerner to accept without question but you now have firsthand knowledge of the workings of karma he listened to her without making a sound watching her through drowsy halflowered lids you were brought to me by karma was too selfabsorbed when i first met you to understand who it was you were it took me some time to begin fitting the pieces together you were nothing to me when i first met you in cambodia i admit i was obsessed with thornburg conrad iii i sought to take advantage of him to give me what i was destined to have another child with extraordinary sight another warrior in my battle with the reverend mother in return he vowed to exact his revenge she fed him more miso soup with infinite patience but from what chika has told me it appears now that i have underestimated conrad all along you see wolfsan he was using you as his stalking horse to get inside the toshin kurb kosai to get to me to assuage his own hunger to extend his life as yours and mine and chikas are as the reverend mothers would have been if you had not put an end to her she smiled as she wiped his chin the irony to all this is that you and i are still alive and he will soon die and he will die wolfsan without the knowledge that he possesses inside him a form of what he has sought for so long i have no doubt that his makura na hiruma no matter how weak it might be could save him from death but it will not be there is no one to summon it for him as your grandfather and chika did for you she whisked green tea with strong practised fingers the beauty of life wolfsan often lies in the bite of its irony eh later he awoke to find her arranging the bedcovers around his throat ah you are awake she smiled her familiar smile you will no doubt be gratified to know that with yoshidas death the threat of more political murders being committed in your country is ended as for the trade bill well the americans are on their own if they are foolish enough to allow it to pass by such a margin that your president cannot veto it they will pay a heavy price i cannot help that minako closed her eyes as if in ecstasy shian kogaku we are always with you she chuckled now more than ever an apt saying dont you think my company is well on its way to dominating the economics of japan and becoming the primary influence on the economics of every country on the planet her eyes glowed with her inner pleasure she fussed unnecessarily with the covers her exquisite face hovered over him so that for a moment he was unaccountably reminded of his last few seconds within the universe of the oracle you see wolfsan the truth is often hidden beneath so many layers of deceit that in the end even the deceiver forgets where the truth lies and the truth within my family is that each of my children in their own way has been useful to me yuji built me the oracle kazuki poor doomed thing provided a model for me her fathers weak genes undermined her so her makura na hiruma is eating her alive unhappy hana was my watchdog the only person she ever really cared about was yuji and i knew she would keep him safe from the black blade society until i had use for him and chika my warrior daughter she was my triumph the result of the lesson i learned with kazuki minako leaned over him smiling benevolently i suppose that now you are wondering why i am confessing all this to you well you are a gaijin a foreigner and i suppose the older one gets the more comfort there is in confession the problem is in finding someone worthy to confess to someone who will understand someone who will appreciate what you have done she bent low over him you came and you accomplished your purpose but now that it is over what am i to do with you oh never fear i will not contemplate the abomination the reverend mother was practising her makura na hiruma drove her utterly insane but you can see wolfsan how your continued presence would be awkward for me her lips were against his ear you know too much and what you dont know your extraordinary power would eventually ferret out you have my daughters heart and i can no longer count on her absolute loyalty in sum you are too powerful i cannot allow that the abrupt manifestation of her makura na hiruma turned day into night the great fox of her imagination stalked across the room black and inimical its predators jaws gaping wide aiming for wolfs throat it is the difference between power and authority that is so easy to forget wolf said minako started jerked her head in the direction of the door let out a startled cry as she saw wolf standing in the open doorway the great dark fox hesitated with another cry she turned back to her patient her face went white and she grabbed the bedcovers jerked them away from the body chika what the fox vanished power is a malignant and unthinking beast wolf said advancing into the room it first numbs us to other peoples pain and then makes that pain necessary to remind us that our dominance over them is still operative authority is deliberate and judicious a balanced application of ki the life energy and compassion if minako had heard him she gave no sign of it instead she knelt staring wideeyed at her daughter what have you done to me she cried wolf knew she was talking to him ive learned a great deal in my short time here and with makura na hiruma the more knowledge you have the more prepared you will be prepared for what minako asked for the madness wolf said you see thats what ive learned minako the danger is in life not death that was the oracles final prediction the one mystery it longed for me to interpret the one it could never absorb that it was the power itself that was driving it insane he advanced on her and she made no move against him it was hana alone who fathomed the essential nature of makura na hiruma the secret is as old as time minako and it is this power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely makura na hiruma is absolute power and the nature of its absolute corruption is madness that is its inevitable result in everyone who possesses it no no no no yes he crouched down next to her and i believe you were coming to suspect this might be the case i never you see minako from the time chika first began to unravel the mystery of the struggle between two toshin kuro kosai factions something kept bothering me there were good guys and bad guys but i couldnt keep the two sides straight was the reverend mother insane it seemed so until she detailed to me your own insanity of course she could have been lying but she wasnt chika herself confirmed that when we spoke in forbidden dreams after i had destroyed the reverend mother like a chimera the reality kept shifting the essential shape of the struggle escaped me until i reached the truth which is that good and evil had lost their meaning all of you are slowly going insane in essence minako you are no different from the reverend mother time would have proven that as your confession bears out all of you have lost the ability to differentiate good from evil law from chaos you have created your own order in absolute disregard for the lives of others you are a disease that must be purged annihilation is your only reward for the path you have chosen chika it was a pathetic sound a kind of wail an old woman makes when she knows she is dying chika shook her head there was no emotion on her face but wolf could feel the despair that threatened to break her heart you damned yourself with your own words you have learned to lie from the moment of your summoning as wolf said you chose this path yourself and now you see the results you are cut off from everyone who might have loved you you are alone with your exalted power which is the way you have lived your whole life you are already mad you and the reverend mother were locked in an insane battle for supremacy but what were you going to do when you won can you tell me no i think the point of all the manipulation terror and slaughter was simply the destruction of the other one reigning supreme itself was the purpose she looked into minakos haunted eyes if i could summon up any emotion on your behalf i would feel pity but really i feel nothing at all minako let out a little moan and fell forward onto the futon where the daughter whom wolf had caused her to see as himself had lain wolf turned her over her face was so pale it seemed tinged with blue chika did not make a move it was as if she were carved in stone wolf said she is alive but just barely something that was pulled so taut for so many decades has snapped minako had spent her life plotting birthing as she said soldiers to join her holy war against the reverend mother and for what a vision of the future that she had been convinced she was creating as easily as an architect creates a building it seems to me chika said staring down at the huddled form of minako that my mothers problem has always been that she has confused herself with god some time later as the cool early spring day was on the wane wolf and chika took a stroll in the garden surrounding minakos house the first delicate buds of the cutleaf maples and gingkos were peeping like chicks from their long winters sleep the tall deepgreen cryptomeria rustled in the wind and the air was perfumed by the rich loamy smell of newly turned earth but high above the pall of pollution thick as stew made one consider the possibility that one would never again see all the way to the horizon he was content to be with her knowing who her father was and how old she really was he was grateful that she was not old like the rest of them so terribly old tell me what happened between you and nishitsu chika gave him a small laugh all she was capable of at the moment ive already told you twice i want to hear it again wolf said there came a time when she had realized that her makura no hiruma was no match for his so she resorted to guile she had pretended to faint falling into his arms catching him unawares as he began to drag her back out to the corridor and in the process riding her short skirt up over her hips men were so predictable nishitsu had stopped to look at what had been revealed and his entire demeanour had changed she had felt an ebbing of the psychic vice that had imprisoned her and she had lashed out with a black mailed fist nishitsu had gone down hard and from then on she had had no problem with him in the end feeling the ripple of the reverend mothers death she had made her way up to the eyrie of the room of five shadows she had embraced wolf with the kind of absolute passion she had previously only dreamed of and as she had held him she had wept not only for happiness that he was safe but in despair for the immediate future that hovered in the air like a shade an aftermath of the reverend mothers death it was then that wolf had told her what he had begun to suspect deducing a future out of an interweaving of present clues and he relayed what hana had told him and how they would have to prove it so they had devised the ruse of his convalescence for minakos benefit i know it sounds like a cruel hoax he had told her but if im right this will be our one chance to trap her he had known full well what he was asking of her minako was her mother after all no matter the mixed emotions she might have for the woman but chika had agreed without an argument and wolf had given a mental shrug assuming her acceptance to be nothing more than her unwavering belief in karma she finished telling him about her escape from nishitsu and he took her hand in his ill never forgive her for using all of us we were her children how could she never is a long time wolf said especially for my mother she fell silent and he was aware of her reluctance to speak about her mother perhaps for a time that was just as well there would be many bitter years for her and yuji to forget before they could come to terms with who their mother was and what she had done tears glistened in the corners of her eyes caught between the two i was terrified sure i would never be able to survive the consequences of their mad scheming then my mother told me about you and i thought if its true he can end it all it all seems like a dream perhaps thats because youre learning that there are many realities she squeezed his hand they passed a section of minakos house that jutted out into the garden through the glass door they could see yuji he stood limned in the lemon light from an interior lamp a black figure with his hands in his pockets staring at them or at the cryptomeria beside them but in any case seeing nothing my poor brother chika said hes been like a laser all his life a tightly focused beam of light illuminating one corner of the future where his brilliant mind could solve scientific mysteries too bad the rest of life was always a mystery he could not solve she broke away from wolf went across the grass and opened the glass door wolf strolling behind her could hear their conversation are you all right yujisan ive been trying to find wakare he said but hes disappeared hes dead yuji chika said gently i found him at forbidden dreams yuji did not turn his head in her direction but she could see a flash of lamplight across his irises how did he die the police have no idea if the reverend mother got to him which seems logical theyll never know he nodded stoically and she said poor yuji betrayed by life she tried to see his face but he would not let her you can stay here as long as you want she desperately wanted to say so much more to offer to help him in any way she could but she could not humiliate him in this way he had already been betrayed by his mother and his best friend it was her duty to leave him some shred of dignity to show him she felt he was strong enough to handle this terrible tragedy on his own he gave a little shiver no i only feel at home at shian kogaku thats the way it has always been anyway i have a great deal of work to do i have a new operating vice president to name and i must continue preparing for my lecture tour of the united states now more than ever it is vital to let the americans know about us and then theres kazuki i have an idea perhaps i will be able to help her and perhaps then the oracle will have had a worthwhile purpose chika watched him as he left the house he had not asked about minako had not looked in on her there was her legacy she was thoughtful when she returned to where wolf waited in the garden what will we do now she asked him there are still toshin kuro kosai scattered throughout the world but the power of the cabal was always so closely knit that without a head it will quickly lose its forward momentum and lapse into stasis we could spend our lives tracking down the members and trapping them like mad dogs he said or we could leave them to their own fate they both knew what that was and contemplating it brought about an entirely different set of problems neither of them was quite ready to tackle them just yet they continued to hold hands as they strolled the paths dappled with shade here and there songbirds flitted from tree to tree calling into the dusk they stopped at a backless concrete bench that wolf found as uncomfortable as it looked still they sat and enjoyed the blue evening as it covered tree rock and moss with its translucent quilt we have each other wolf she said very softly yes theres that but the unspoken adjunct to what she said was for how long the horror of what had happened to the reverend mother and minako hung in the air like a pall because both of them now knew that this same fate would one day overtake them was there no escape from the malignant effects of makura na hiruma were they doomed to a slow descent into madness wolf rubbed his temple waiting for the voice to manifest itself inside his brain he knew whose voice it was hanas somehow she had effected a way out of her prison she had not been interred with the oracle perhaps she would know a way out for them but no he thought she had not even been able to save herself there must be a way out for us wolf perhaps he said but you and i have both looked into the future and it is blank we also made a pact that is the last time well use our sight humans werent meant to see the future the temptation will be very strong to renege on that pact do you think well be able to resist yes she said in a tone of voice that left no room for doubt of course we will he said squeezing her hand wolf was aware of the structure of life falling away from him like the carcass of a gross beast he was aware too of how essentially false was mans view of the universe time the aeon and the second were representations of a linear form of thinking a crude attempt to create a framework of logic out of endless chaos to make understandable that which was essentially beyond logic and then he understood that what hana had told him was correct there was no such thing as a single moment each instant of time has as many layers as an onion bringing with them a myriad of decisions changes alterations in space and time there were in fact only branchings the concept of a single path was illusory in light of that perhaps there was a way out for them chika looked at him what are you thinking i was contemplating my duty chika gave him another little smile thats very japanese of you they were silent for a long time the trilling songs of the birds were quite beautiful it was growing darker occasionally a firefly darted into the line of their vision they seemed surrounded by the night wolf raised his head looked up at the startossed sky whatever new path we choose chika there is one last thing i must do before we leave this one one last mystery for me to solve i know she said i want to be with you when you do it are you sure she nodded her head and he could feel her trepidation i have already dealt with my mother what could be worse wolf sat close beside her in the night for a very long time rain was forming its thunderclad army piling in off the sea rattling street lights thundering against rooftops at times obscuring the tops of the trees and with it fog dense pearlescent low to the ground wolf awakened with the odour of this strange fog in his nostrils it smelled like an open grave and this was when he knew his work was not yet finished in japan the house was still and calm and yet he sensed in the mist the anxiety of leaving a place or of never coming back to where one was born white bow had at times talked to him about such feelings they were often he had said experienced by the dead whose souls had not yet trod upon the path of death or they could be experienced by those who were about to die wolf dressed silently swiftly and let himself out of the house he took one of the cars parked outside minakos house the keys had been lying on the wooden entryway cabinet though he was forced into leftside driving and he could not read street signs still he made his way into the burning heart of tokyo lit by neon banners so imposing even leyasu tokugawas samurai would have been impressed makura na hiruma guided him as it had awakened him alerting him to the danger neon colours glowed across the slick asphalt of the streets were washed away with rainwater in the gutters what was the danger he could not yet say only knew it was bitter in his mouth like a poison he had almost swallowed a punk on a kawasaki his leather jacket teeming water cut wolf off sped through a light white sparks flying from his rear wheel wolf was reminded of suma on his electraglide grinning like a deathshead he looked up into the neon sky shian kogaku we are always with you even the violent rain could not obscure the mammoth bloodred sign he raced through tokyos wide boulevards into the night what was the danger the danger is in life not death he left the car near the tsukiji fish market fish flopped on the wet concrete scales iridesced in the hanging lights the steam of living beings clouded the air and for a moment as he passed beat back the stench of the open grave then he was past the activity of the market the raised voices of men at work the laughter of camaraderie the warmth and good smells of the food stalls a drunkard pissing in the shadows the stuff of life in the darkness death waited wolf could feel it now even as he saw the slow mist curling around his ankles a low beast a clever thing was it even human curled and flexed its psychic muscles the dissonance of its makura na hiruma hurt his eardrums an undercurrent like the surge of a dynamo of unknown proportions hidden deep beneath the earth and so he came at last to the blankfaced warehouse home of the late oracle a lone bulb buzzed and sputtered fitfully in the rain its metal hat swinging wildly this way and that as the wind gusted in off the sumida river the inconstant cone of light illuminated a metal door without a plate or a paintedon name to identify it wolf knew what it was the door was unlocked and as he neared it it banged abruptly open slammed back on its frame repeated this wild gyration at the rising winds bidding wolf threw it open stepped inside what else could he do his makura na hiruma had unerringly guided him here and he knew it was for a purpose the danger is in life not death the oracles warning the warehouse had an abandoned air or would have in the near future he felt a prickling along his spine and wondered whether his sight had shown him his own death at the base of the elevator shaft he looked upwards into the darkness whatever was waiting for himwas in the lab where the remains of the oracle lay he took the open elevator up the whine of the engine echoed through the warehouse like a winter wind in a pine forest a melancholy and lonely sound at the top floor he emerged onto old wooden floorboards that creaked when he moved to his left at the end of the corridor was the oracles home he went towards it the darkness turned aqueous thickened to the consistency of sludge and now he could tell why his sight had led him here someone or something was trying to raise the oracle from the dead he paused in the hallway projected his makura na hiruma outwards and walked into the oracles lab he could see the black beast the tiered banks of yujis testing and monitoring equipment the humming of solidstate circuitry filled the air like flies feeding off a corpse the oracle squatted amid a forest of wires silicon leads fibreoptic cables graphiteboron stalks its face was dark its heart still in the corners of wolfs vision movement like the darting of starlings he turned his head and the movement stayed in the periphery sensed but not quite seen then the black hand of a makura na hiruma so powerful it rocked the building on its foundations stabbed out and wolfs body was incinerated smoke and sparks filled the entrance to the lab then died but the stench of burned flesh was not apparent the manifestation of the sight took only a heartbeat but in that time wolf standing in the aqueous shadows of the hallway was able to learn something of the nature of his adversary the makura na hiruma he had felt with the projection of himself in the lab was not only hugely powerful it was very ancient older even than the reverend mother some centuries ancient in fact he also knew that its owner was jason yoshidas mother wolf was very still he could control his breathing but not the thundering of his heart he was very frightened for he had encountered an evil so old that it went without a name it was an evil he knew that white bow would have recognized he wondered whether this evil could sense him where the others could not he conjured up an image of yoshida and marched him into the lab this time he was right behind his projection he saw what appeared to be an electrical current in the air a coalescing of fireflies and evan appeared from out of the shadows wolf was totally unprepared for how young she was stunned he momentarily lost control of the yoshida image and it flickered like a candle flame in the wind that was all the time evan needed she turned her attention from the empty image of her son to wolf wolf gathered himself and the lab shimmered he saw his grandfather the spirit of white bow raised a hand in greeting i have been waiting for you to summon me he said he smelled of leather and peyote and his face was etched with concern the evil is here and you must fight it wolf but you will need my help tell me what i must do wolf said come here stand with me where you are is still partway in the land of the living you must come all the way down into the land of the dead but i will die no white bow said you are a shaman i trained you myself you will not be harmed i need your power to bring me up from the land of the dead for this one last battle believing him wolf took one step towards him and felt the ground disintegrating beneath his feet he was slipping down unable to control too late he saw evans ruse for what it was ideas and events pulled from his memory too late he understood the visions one flaw white bows spirit would have descended from the sky not been trapped below the earth too late he opened his eyes stared up into evans beautiful face her hand had gripped his throat and now she was squeezing it just as her makura na hiruma was squeezing his heart you killed my son evan said you destroyed the veils of false hierarchy it took a century to build her nails bit into his flesh drawing blood people believed nishitsu was the head of the black blade society others secretly knew that the reverend mother was the head she smiled a ghastly smile and still others believed that minako shian would become the head there was blue fire trying to ignite itself inside wolf and he struggled to keep it from forming because if it did he knew he would be incinerated as his projection had been the truth is there was only ever one head of the black blade society and that is me i controlled everything and everyone my makura na hiruma was such that i could do that even when i was a small child i was bom able to summon the sight at will the black blade society was my creation and i will not allow you to put an end to it the blue fire was coming wolf could feel it now his temperature rising to critical levels in his mind he saw images of cathy being set aflame and bobby connor burning hayes walker johnson and his wife and amanda dead in a pool of her own blood with a monstrous effort he slammed his hands into evans chest her clawed fingernails ripped skin and flesh as she staggered back she only smiled coming on again the pressure inside him that had let up for just an instant returned more powerful than ever wolf tried to harness his makura na hiruma directed a black club at evans face she staggered came on again brute force wasnt going to work he tried to project himself inside her head but the resulting chaos almost made him scream the buzzing of ten thousand insects was in the air in his mind dazzling him and she was upon him again her nails sinking into him the blue flame giving off its first flicker as it ran up his arm the revolting stench of roasting meat at the point of death he did call out for his grandfather asking him for his strength and blindly summoned every last shred of his makura na hiruma evan was flung off him slamming backwards into the face of the oracle she righted herself smiled as she sensed the end to wolfs defences and began to come on abruptly her expression changed she halted in midstep looked down cables were wrapped around her legs and as she kicked at them sparks danced in the air evan literally levitated the force of the surge of electrical current carried in the cables struck her like a fist from heaven her eyes bugged out her hair flew about her like medusas reptilian mane her body danced a galvanic gavotte her mouth opened in a silent scream while the crackling of unbounded energy sizzled her flesh eventually the corpse dropped to the floor where its extremities slapped and struck the floor in violent spasm wolf gaining his feet went slowly towards the oracle in its face was what seemed to be a soft glow was it of satisfaction wolf wondered impossible the oracle was dead he himself had overseen its demise but still he put a hand over the wounds on his neck willed the bleeding to stop he looked down at the cables wrapped in loose knots around evans legs how had she become so entangled in them he bent to take a closer look hello wolfsan the oracle whispered wolf looked up into its face did he see an expression did he hear a sigh of satisfaction time to sleep all along the massed banks of machinery the lights were winking slowly out the parting snow that we two looked at together this year has it fallen anew matsuo basho washington every sound in the private hospital room was uttered by a machine every motion made by a machine these exotic engines formed a kind of enclave around the single human being who was alive or merely existed depending on ones point of view the doctors who monitored his progress if that was the right word through this limbo agreed that he was indeed alive others however who lacked the specific medical training to judge such things had written him off even the nurses trained to be compassionate did not consider him alive but merely in suspension like a colloid in a lab this was thornburg conrad ills fate to be shot as punishment for his many sins but not to die to exist in this living hell not moving not speaking but thinking only thinking as machines powered his heart pumped his lungs dripped nutrients into his veins pulled excreta from him was this life not by his definition but it was his punishment of this he was absolutely certain not in his mind for the contempt he felt for his first wife mother of his children his callous disregard for the pain of his second wife the perfect tiffany conrad his blind passion for life that led him to condone the murder of many his dismissal of his children for not becoming the people he had wished for no this punishment was for the single sin he was capable of recognizing the murder of his son if he had been a religious man he would have turned to his god and repented and been forgiven but christ was just a word to him one overused and abused beyond any recognition he remembered his father ranting i wont have anyone especially not a priest telling me what i can and cant do what do priests know about the real world anyway it would be nice he thought on occasion to have a priest around to wave his hands and give him the official word that he was forgiven his grievous crime but that was impossible besides it wasnt god he needed to be forgiven by it was ham and by his own hand ham was gone then the despair would well up so strongly that all he could wish for was one moment for the paralysis to lift so that he could tear the tubes from his body and die in peace even one more artificial breath was too much to bear he deserved to die he knew that now and soon he would he heard what the doctors said as they spoke by his bedside even the clever machines could not keep his body functioning for long soon but not soon enough he became aware of the door opening more doctors morons debating moot points how he hated doctors now how foolish they seemed to him pretending they knew more than they did they knew precious little about life and nothing at all about death which he was certain was the only comfort left to him how he longed for oblivion after struggling so long in the darkness of life it came as a profound relief to know that an end to his pain was at hand but no he saw now these were not doctors who had come to visit him neither were they a knot of lawyers who came regularly to hover like vultures running up their hourly fees good god its wolf matheson and by his side a stunning young japanese woman he found himself thinking ive hoped for this its like the coming of the angel of death he knows what i did to him and now hes come to finish the job stevie began thornburg wolf was saying i know you recognize me its been a long time since i saw you but i suppose the reverse cant be said youve been keeping close track of me running me i guess you could say well ive done what you wanted me to do ive penetrated the toshin kuro kosai ive met with minako you remember minako sure you do how could you forget wolf put his hands on the japanese womans shoulders this is chika she is minakos daughter she was born around nine months after you and i escaped from cambodia remember thornburg remember what happened there you and minako here is your daughter thornburg what do you think of her wolf was bending over smiling in an enigmatic way but thornburg was so stunned by the revelation that his mind had gone blank he had got that witch minako pregnant good christ he felt what remained of his essence curling up into a defensive ball the dread of being confronted by a daughter he had never known existed who could peer into his mind as easily as if it was a shop window and see what he had done was too much for him and she knew he could see the disgust and contempt in her eyes take her away he begged for the love of christ take her away but if wolf heard him he gave no indication of it you ran me like a rat in a maze thornburg then you tried your best to have me killed why did you do that i was always your lucky talisman isnt that how you thought of me back in cambodia so this is the last mystery and as good a detective as i am i cant figure this one out and of course you cant tell me ironic isnt it especially since i did what you hoped i would i found the secret you were so desperately looking for for so long in return my life has been irrevocably altered you did that to me thornburg you and your obsession to beat death but i forgive you well maybe not forgive exactly but im willing to forget it because it was you who saved my life in cambodia thats something i cant forget wolfs enigmatic smile widened you see that power minako had the japanese phrase for it is makura na hiruma it means the darkness at noon and its aptly named i know because i possess it so does chika and so do you he could see wolf studying his eyes for even the minutest flicker of reaction yes thornburg its true the secret you spent your life pursuing was right under your nose all along inside you it just needed to be summoned something im going to do now no thornburg begged silently my way of saying thank you for saving my life long ago no you dont understand if you want to repay me for saving your life then take mine now then he was jolted out of time he found himself in a vast shadowed defile between gargantuan mountains with a terrifying rumble a rockslide torn loose by an underground eruption roared down upon him but instead of being inundated he discovered he had risen out of the defile then he became aware of a further shift in perception the mountains dissolved into raw magma and a strange blackness was forming from the chaos alive and panting glistening with nascent life slouching to sit at his side he stared at it and it seemed intolerable and familiar all at once youll have a long life now thornburg wolf was saying who knows how long you may not be able to move but you wont need these machines to keep you alive your makura na hiruma will do that for you no no no dont leave me with this thing wait please ive got to tell you i want to die i want goodbye thornburg they were at the door but that enigmatic smile still burned his retinas etched into his brain was it the smile of a friend or an enemy i trust youll enjoy your new life
