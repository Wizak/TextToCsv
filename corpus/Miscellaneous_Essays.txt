miscellaneous essays contents on the knocking at the gate in macbeth murder considered as one of the fine arts second paper on murder joan of arc the english mailcoach the vision of sudden death dinner real and reputed on the knocking at the gate in macbeth from my boyish days i had always felt a great perplexity on one point in macbeth it was this the knocking at the gate which succeeds to the murder of duncan produced to my feelings an effect for which i never could account the effect was that it reflected back upon the murder a peculiar awfulness and a depth of solemnity yet however obstinately i endeavored with my understanding to comprehend this for many years i never could see why it should produce such an effect here i pause for one moment to exhort the reader never to pay any attention to his understanding when it stands in opposition to any other faculty of his mind the mere understanding however useful and indispensable is the meanest faculty in the human mind and the most to be distrusted and yet the great majority of people trust to nothing else which may do for ordinary life but not for philosophical purposes of this out of ten thousand instances that i might produce i will cite one ask of any person whatsoever who is not previously prepared for the demand by a knowledge of perspective to draw in the rudest way the commonest appearance which depends upon the laws of that science as for instance to represent the effect of two walls standing at right angles to each other or the appearance of the houses on each side of a street as seen by a person looking down the street from one extremity now in all cases unless the person has happened to observe in pictures how it is that artists produce these effects he will be utterly unable to make the smallest approximation to it yet why for he has actually seen the effect every day of his life the reason is that he allows his understanding to overrule his eyes his understanding which includes no intuitive knowledge of the laws of vision can furnish him with no reason why a line which is known and can be proved to be a horizontal line should not appear a horizontal line a line that made any angle with the perpendicular less than a right angle would seem to him to indicate that his houses were all tumbling down together accordingly he makes the line of his houses a horizontal line and fails of course to produce the effect demanded here then is one instance out of many in which not only the understanding is allowed to overrule the eyes but where the understanding is positively allowed to obliterate the eyes as it were for not only does the man believe the evidence of his understanding in opposition to that of his eyes but what is monstrous the idiot is not aware that his eyes ever gave such evidence he does not know that he has seen and therefore quoad his consciousness has not seen that which he has seen every day of his life but to return from this digression my understanding could furnish no reason why the knocking at the gate in macbeth should produce any effect direct or reflected in fact my understanding said positively that it could not produce any effect but i knew better i felt that it did and i waited and clung to the problem until further knowledge should enable me to solve it at length in mr williams made his dbut on the stage of ratcliffe highway and executed those unparalleled murders which have procured for him such a brilliant and undying reputation on which murders by the way i must observe that in one respect they have had an ill effect by making the connoisseur in murder very fastidious in his taste and dissatisfied by anything that has been since done in that line all other murders look pale by the deep crimson of his and as an amateur once said to me in a querulous tone there has been absolutely nothing doing since his time or nothing thats worth speaking of but this is wrong for it is unreasonable to expect all men to be great artists and born with the genius of mr williams now it will be remembered that in the first of these murders that of the marrs the same incident of a knocking at the door soon after the work of extermination was complete did actually occur which the genius of shakspeare has invented and all good judges and the most eminent dilettanti acknowledged the felicity of shakspeares suggestion as soon as it was actually realized here then was a fresh proof that i was right in relying on my own feeling in opposition to my understanding and i again set myself to study the problem at length i solved it to my own satisfaction and my solution is this murder in ordinary cases where the sympathy is wholly directed to the case of the murdered person is an incident of coarse and vulgar horror and for this reason that it flings the interest exclusively upon the natural but ignoble instinct by which we cleave to life an instinct which as being indispensable to the primal law of selfpreservation is the same in kind though different in degree amongst all living creatures this instinct therefore because it annihilates all distinctions and degrades the greatest of men to the level of the poor beetle that we tread on exhibits human nature in its most abject and humiliating attitude such an attitude would little suit the purposes of the poet what then must he do he must throw the interest on the murderer our sympathy must be with him of course i mean a sympathy of comprehension a sympathy by which we enter into his feelings and are made to understand them not a sympathy of pity or approbation in the murdered person all strife of thought all flux and reflux of passion and of purpose are crushed by one overwhelming panic the fear of instant death smites him with its petrific mace but in the murderer such a murderer as a poet will condescend to there must be raging some great storm of passion jealousy ambition vengeance hatred which will create a hell within him and into this hell we are to look footnote it seems almost ludicrous to guard and explain my use of a word in a situation where it would naturally explain itself but it has become necessary to do so in consequence of the unscholarlike use of the word sympathy at present so general by which instead of taking it in its proper sense as the act of reproducing in our minds the feelings of another whether for hatred indignation love pity or approbation it is made a mere synonyme of the word pity and hence instead of saying sympathy with another many writers adopt the monstrous barbarism of sympathy for another in macbeth for the sake of gratifying his own enormous and teeming faculty of creation shakspeare has introduced two murderers and as usual in his hands they are remarkably discriminated but though in macbeth the strife of mind is greater than in his wife the tiger spirit not so awake and his feelings caught chiefly by contagion from her yet as both were finally involved in the guilt of murder the murderous mind of necessity is finally to be presumed in both this was to be expressed and on its own account as well as to make it a more proportionable antagonist to the unoffending nature of their victim the gracious duncan and adequately to expound the deep damnation of his taking off this was to be expressed with peculiar energy we were to be made to feel that the human nature ie the divine nature of love and mercy spread through the hearts of all creatures and seldom utterly withdrawn from man was gone vanished extinct and that the fiendish nature had taken its place and as this effect is marvellously accomplished in the dialogues and soliloquies themselves so it is finally consummated by the expedient under consideration and it is to this that i now solicit the readers attention if the reader has ever witnessed a wife daughter or sister in a fainting fit he may chance to have observed that the most affecting moment in such a spectacle is that in which a sigh and a stirring announce the recommencement of suspended life or if the reader has ever been present in a vast metropolis on the day when some great national idol was carried in funeral pomp to his grave and chancing to walk near the course through which it passed has felt powerfully in the silence and desertion of the streets and in the stagnation of ordinary business the deep interest which at that moment was possessing the heart of man if all at once he should hear the deathlike stillness broken up by the sound of wheels rattling away from the scene and making known that the transitory vision was dissolved he will be aware that at no moment was his sense of the complete suspension and pause in ordinary human concerns so full and affecting as at that moment when the suspension ceases and the goingson of human life are suddenly resumed all action in any direction is best expounded measured and made apprehensible by reaction now apply this to the case in macbeth here as i have said the retiring of the human heart and the entrance of the fiendish heart was to be expressed and made sensible another world has stepped in and the murderers are taken out of the region of human things human purposes human desires they are transfigured lady macbeth is unsexed macbeth has forgot that he was born of woman both are conformed to the image of devils and the world of devils is suddenly revealed but how shall this be conveyed and made palpable in order that a new world may step in this world must for a time disappear the murderers and the murder must be insulated cut off by an immeasurable gulph from the ordinary tide and succession of human affairs locked up and sequestered in some deep recess we must be made sensible that the world of ordinary life is suddenly arrested laid asleep tranced racked into a dread armistice time must be annihilated relation to things without abolished and all must pass selfwithdrawn into a deep syncope and suspension of earthly passion hence it is that when the deed is done when the work of darkness is perfect then the world of darkness passes away like a pageantry in the clouds the knocking at the gate is heard and it makes known audibly that the reaction has commenced the human has made its reflux upon the fiendish the pulses of life are beginning to beat again and the reestablishment of the goingson of the world in which we live first makes us profoundly sensible of the awful parenthesis that had suspended them o mighty poet thy works are not as those of other men simply and merely great works of art but are also like the phenomena of nature like the sun and the sea the stars and the flowers like frost and snow rain and dew hailstorm and thunder which are to be studied with entire submission of our own faculties and in the perfect faith that in them there can be no too much or too little nothing useless or inert but that the further we press in our discoveries the more we shall see proofs of design and selfsupporting arrangement where the careless eye had seen nothing but accident on murder considered as one of the fine arts to the editor of blackwoods magazine sir we have all heard of a society for the promotion of vice of the hellfire club c at brighton i think it was that a society was formed for the suppression of virtue that society was itself suppressed but i am sorry to say that another exists in london of a character still more atrocious in tendency it may be denominated a society for the encouragement of murder but according to their own delicate greek euphaemismos it is styled the society of connoisseurs in murder they profess to be curious in homicide amateurs and dilettanti in the various modes of bloodshed and in short murderfanciers every fresh atrocity of that class which the police annals of europe bring up they meet and criticise as they would a picture statue or other work of art but i need not trouble myself with any attempt to describe the spirit of their proceedings as you will collect that much better from one of the monthly lectures read before the society last year this has fallen into my hands accidentally in spite of all the vigilance exercised to keep their transactions from the public eye the publication of it will alarm them and my purpose is that it should for i would much rather put them down quietly by an appeal to public opinion through you than by such an exposure of names as would follow an appeal to bow street which last appeal however if this should fail i must positively resort to for it is scandalous that such things should go on in a christian land even in a heathen land the toleration of murder was felt by a christian writer to be the most crying reproach of the public morals this writer was lactantius and with his words as singularly applicable to the present occasion i shall conclude quid tam horribile says he tam tetrum quam hominis trucidatio ideo severissimis legibus vita nostra munitur ideo bella execrabilia sunt invenit tamen consuetudo quatenus homicidium sine bello ac sine legibus faciat et hoc sibi voluptas quod scelus vindicavit quod si interesse homicidio sceleris conscientia est et eidem facinori spectator obstrictus est cui et admissor ergo et in his gladiatorum cdibus non minus cruore profunditur qui spectat quam ille qui facit nec potest esse immunis sanguine qui voluit effundi aut videri non interfecisse qui interfectori et favit et proemium postulavit human life says he is guarded by laws of the uttermost rigor yet custom has devised a mode of evading them in behalf of murder and the demands of taste voluptas are now become the same as those of abandoned guilt let the society of gentlemen amateurs consider this and let me call their especial attention to the last sentence which is so weighty that i shall attempt to convey it in english now if merely to be present at a murder fastens on a man the character of an accomplice if barely to be a spectator involves us in one common guilt with the perpetrator it follows of necessity that in these murders of the amphitheatre the hand which inflicts the fatal blow is not more deeply imbrued in blood that his who sits and looks on neither can he be clear of blood who has countenanced its shedding nor that man seem other than a participator in murder who gives his applause to the murderer and calls for prizes in his behalf the prmia postulavit i have not yet heard charged upon the gentlemen amateurs of london though undoubtedly their proceedings tend to that but the interfectori favil is implied in the very title of this association and expressed in every line of the lecture which i send you i am c x y z lecture gentlemen i have had the honor to be appointed by your committee to the trying task of reading the williams lecture on murder considered as one of the fine arts a task which might be easy enough three or four centuries ago when the art was little understood and few great models had been exhibited but in this age when masterpieces of excellence have been executed by professional men it must be evident that in the style of criticism applied to them the public will look for something of a corresponding improvement practice and theory must advance pari passu people begin to see that something more goes to the composition of a fine murder than two blockheads to kill and be killed a knife a purse and a dark lane design gentlemen grouping light and shade poetry sentiment are now deemed indispensable to attempts of this nature mr williams has exalted the ideal of murder to all of us and to me therefore in particular has deepened the arduousness of my task like schylus or milton in poetry like michael angelo in painting he has carried his art to a point of colossal sublimity and as mr wordsworth observes has in a manner created the taste by which he is to be enjoyed to sketch the history of the art and to examine its principles critically now remains as a duty for the connoisseur and for judges of quite another stamp from his majestys judges of assize before i begin let me say a word or two to certain prigs who affect to speak of our society as if it were in some degree immoral in its tendency immoral god bless my soul gentlemen what is it that people mean i am for morality and always shall be and for virtue and all that and i do affirm and always shall let what will come of it that murder is an improper line of conduct highly improper and i do not stick to assert that any man who deals in murder must have very incorrect ways of thinking and truly inaccurate principles and so far from aiding and abetting him by pointing out his victims hidingplace as a great moralist of germany declared it to be every good mans duty to do i would subscribe one shilling and sixpense to have him apprehended which is more by eighteenpence than the most eminent moralists have subscribed for that purpose but what then everything in this world has two handles murder for instance may be laid hold of by its moral handle as it generally is in the pulpit and at the old bailey and that i confess is its weak side or it may also be treated sthetically as the germans call it that is in relation to good taste footnote kant who carried his demands of unconditional veracity to so extravagant a length as to affirm that if a man were to see an innocent person escape from a murderer it would be his duty on being questioned by the murderer to tell the truth and to point out the retreat of the innocent person under any certainty of causing murder lest this doctrine should be supposed to have escaped him in any heat of dispute on being taxed with it by a celebrated french writer he solemnly reaffirmed it with his reasons to illustrate this i will urge the authority of three eminent persons viz st coleridge aristotle and mr howship the surgeon to begin with stc one night many years ago i was drinking tea with him in berners street which by the way for a short street has been uncommonly fruitful in men of genius others were there besides myself and amidst some carnal considerations of tea and toast we were all imbibing a dissertation on plotinus from the attic lips of stc suddenly a cry arose of fire fire upon which all of us master and disciples plato and greek hoi peri ton platona rushed out eager for the spectacle the fire was in oxford street at a pianoforte makers and as it promised to be a conflagration of merit i was sorry that my engagements forced me away from mr coleridges party before matters were come to a crisis some days after meeting with my platonic host i reminded him of the case and begged to know how that very promising exhibition had terminated oh sir said he it turned out so ill that we damned it unanimously now does any man suppose that mr coleridge who for all he is too fat to be a person of active virtue is undoubtedly a worthy christian that this good s t c i say was an incendiary or capable of wishing any ill to the poor man and his pianofortes many of them doubtless with the additional keys on the contrary i know him to be that sort of man that i durst stake my life upon it he would have worked an engine in a case of necessity although rather of the fattest for such fiery trials of his virtue but how stood the case virtue was in no request on the arrival of the fireengines morality had devolved wholly on the insurance office this being the case he had a right to gratify his taste he had left his tea was he to have nothing in return i contend that the most virtuous man under the premises stated was entitled to make a luxury of the fire and to hiss it as he would any other performance that raised expectations in the public mind which afterwards it disappointed again to cite another great authority what says the stagyrite he in the fifth book i think it is of his metaphysics describes what he calls greek kleptaen teleion ie a perfect thief and as to mr howship in a work of his on indigestion he makes no scruple to talk with admiration of a certain ulcer which he had seen and which he styles a beautiful ulcer now will any man pretend that abstractedly considered a thief could appear to aristotle a perfect character or that mr howship could be enamored of an ulcer aristotle it is well known was himself so very moral a character that not content with writing his nichomachean ethics in one volume octavo he also wrote another system called magna moralia or big ethics now it is impossible that a man who composes any ethics at all big or little should admire a thief per se and as to mr howship it is well known that he makes war upon all ulcers and without suffering himself to be seduced by their charms endeavors to banish them from the county of middlesex but the truth is that however objectionable per se yet relatively to others of their class both a thief and an ulcer may have infinite degrees of merit they are both imperfections it is true but to be imperfect being their essence the very greatness of their imperfection becomes their perfection spartam nactus es hunc exorna a thief like autolycus or mr barrington and a grim phagednic ulcer superbly defined and running regularly through all its natural stages may no less justly be regarded as ideals after their kind than the most faultless mossrose amongst flowers in its progress from bud to bright consummate flower or amongst human flowers the most magnificent young female apparelled in the pomp of womanhood and thus not only the ideal of an inkstand may be imagined as mr coleridge demonstrated in his celebrated correspondence with mr blackwood in which by the way there is not so much because an inkstand is a laudable sort of thing and a valuable member of society but even imperfection itself may have its ideal or perfect state really gentlemen i beg pardon for so much philosophy at one time and now let me apply it when a murder is in the paulopostfuturum tense and a rumor of it comes to our ears by all means let us treat it morally but suppose it over and done and that you can say of it greek tetelesai or in that adamantine molossus of medea greek eirzasai suppose the poor murdered man to be out of his pain and the rascal that did it off like a shot nobody knows whither suppose lastly that we have done our best by putting out our legs to trip up the fellow in his flight but all to no purpose abiit evasit c why then i say whats the use of any more virtue enough has been given to morality now comes the turn of taste and the fine arts a sad thing it was no doubt very sad but we cant mend it therefore let us make the best of a bad matter and as it is impossible to hammer anything out of it for moral purposes let us treat it sthetically and see if it will turn to account in that way such is the logic of a sensible man and what follows we dry up our tears and have the satisfaction perhaps to discover that a transaction which morally considered was shocking and without a leg to stand upon when tried by principles of taste turns out to be a very meritorious performance thus all the world is pleased the old proverb is justified that it is an ill wind which blows nobody good the amateur from looking bilious and sulky by too close an attention to virtue begins to pick up his crumbs and general hilarity prevails virtue has had her day and henceforward vertu and connoisseurship have leave to provide for themselves upon this principle gentlemen i propose to guide your studies from cain to mr thurtell through this great gallery of murder therefore together let us wander hand in hand in delighted admiration while i endeavor to point your attention to the objects of profitable criticism the first murder is familiar to you all as the inventor of murder and the father of the art cain must have been a man of firstrate genius all the cains were men of genius tubal cain invented tubes i think or some such thing but whatever were the originality and genius of the artist every art was then in its infancy and the works must be criticised with a recollection of that fact even tubals work would probably be little approved at this day in sheffield and therefore of cain cain senior i mean it is no disparagement to say that his performance was but so so milton however is supposed to have thought differently by his way of relating the case it should seem to have been rather a pet murder with him for he retouches it with an apparent anxiety for its picturesque effect whereat he inly raged and as they talkd smote him into the midriff with a stone that beat out life he fell and deadly pale groand out his soul with gushing blood effusd par lost b xi upon this richardson the painter who had an eye for effect remarks as follows in his notes on paradise lost p it has been thought says he that cain beat as the common saying is the breath out of his brothers body with a great stone milton gives in to this with the addition however of a large wound in this place it was a judicious addition for the rudeness of the weapon unless raised and enriched by a warm sanguinary coloring has too much of the naked air of the savage school as if the deed were perpetrated by a polypheme without science premeditation or anything but a mutton bone however i am chiefly pleased with the improvement as it implies that milton was an amateur as to shakspeare there never was a better as his description of the murdered duke of gloucester in henry vi of duncans banquos c sufficiently proves the foundation of the art having been once laid it is pitiable to see how it slumbered without improvement for ages in fact i shall now be obliged to leap over all murders sacred and profane as utterly unworthy of notice until long after the christian era greece even in the age of pericles produced no murder of the slightest merit and rome had too little originality of genius in any of the arts to succeed where her model failed her in fact the latin language sinks under the very idea of murder the man was murdered how will this sound in latin interfectus est interemptus est which simply expresses a homicide and hence the christian latinity of the middle ages was obliged to introduce a new word such as the feebleness of classic conceptions never ascended to murdratus est says the sublimer dialect of gothic ages meantime the jewish school of murder kept alive whatever was yet known in the art and gradually transferred it to the western world indeed the jewish school was always respectable even in the dark ages as the case of hugh of lincoln shows which was honored with the approbation of chaucer on occasion of another performance from the same school which he puts into the mouth of the lady abbess recurring however for one moment to classical antiquity i cannot but think that catiline clodius and some of that coterie would have made firstrate artists and it is on all accounts to be regretted that the priggism of cicero robbed his country of the only chance she had for distinction in this line as the subject of a murder no person could have answered better than himself lord how he would have howled with panic if he had heard cethegus under his bed it would have been truly diverting to have listened to him and satisfied i am gentlemen that he would have preferred the utile of creeping into a closet or even into a cloaca to the honestum of facing the bold artist to come now to the dark ages by which we that speak with precision mean par excellence the tenth century and the times immediately before and after these ages ought naturally to be favorable to the art of murder as they were to church architecture to stained glass c and accordingly about the latter end of this period there arose a great character in our art i mean the old man of the mountains he was a shining light indeed and i need not tell you that the very word assassin is deduced from him so keen an amateur was he that on one occasion when his own life was attempted by a favorite assassin he was so much pleased with the talent shown that notwithstanding the failure of the artist he created him a duke upon the spot with remainder to the female line and settled a pension on him for three lives assassination is a branch of the art which demands a separate notice and i shall devote an entire lecture to it meantime i shall only observe how odd it is that this branch of the art has flourished by fits it never rains but it pours our own age can boast of some fine specimens and about two centuries ago there was a most brilliant constellation of murders in this class i need hardly say that i allude especially to those five splendid works the assassinations of william i of orange of henry iv of france of the duke of buckingham which you will find excellently described in the letters published by mr ellis of the british museum of gustavus adolphus and of wallenstein the king of swedens assassination by the by is doubted by many writers harte amongst others but they are wrong he was murdered and i consider his murder unique in its excellence for he was murdered at noonday and on the field of battle a feature of original conception which occurs in no other work of art that i remember indeed all of these assassinations may be studied with profit by the advanced connoisseur they are all of them exemplaria of which one may say nociurn versat manu versate diurne especially nocturn in these assassinations of princes and statesmen there is nothing to excite our wonder important changes often depend on their deaths and from the eminence on which they stand they are peculiarly exposed to the aim of every artist who happens to be possessed by the craving for scenical effect but there is another class of assassinations which has prevailed from an early period of the seventeenth century that really does surprise me i mean the assassination of philosophers for gentlemen it is a fact that every philosopher of eminence for the two last centuries has either been murdered or at the least been very near it insomuch that if a man calls himself a philosopher and never had his life attempted rest assured there is nothing in him and against lockes philosophy in particular i think it an unanswerable objection if we needed any that although he carried his throat about with him in this world for seventytwo years no man ever condescended to cut it as these cases of philosophers are not much known and are generally good and well composed in their circumstances i shall here read an excursus on that subject chiefly by way of showing my own learning the first great philosopher of the seventeenth century if we except galileo was des cartes and if ever one could say of a man that he was all but murdered murdered within an inch one must say it of him the case was this as reported by baillet in his vie de m des cartes tom i p in the year when des cartes might be about twentysix years old he was touring about as usual for he was as restless as a hyna and coming to the elbe either at gluckstadt or at hamburgh he took shipping for east friezland what he could want in east friezland no man has ever discovered and perhaps he took this into consideration himself for on reaching embden he resolved to sail instantly for west friezland and being very impatient of delay he hired a bark with a few mariners to navigate it no sooner had he got out to sea than he made a pleasing discovery viz that he had shut himself up in a den of murderers his crew says m baillet he soon found out to be des sclrats not amateurs gentlemen as we are but professional men the height of whose ambition at that moment was to cut his throat but the story is too pleasing to be abridged i shall give it therefore accurately from the french of his biographer m des cartes had no company but that of his servant with whom he was conversing in french the sailors who took him for a foreign merchant rather than a cavalier concluded that he must have money about him accordingly they came to a resolution by no means advantageous to his purse there is this difference however between searobbers and the robbers in forests that the latter may without hazard spare the lives of their victims whereas the other cannot put a passenger on shore in such a case without running the risk of being apprehended the crew of m des cartes arranged their measures with a view to evade any danger of that sort they observed that he was a stranger from a distance without acquaintance in the country and that nobody would take any trouble to inquire about him in case he should never come to hand quand il viendroit manquer think gentlemen of these friezland dogs discussing a philosopher as if he were a puncheon of rum his temper they remarked was very mild and patient and judging from the gentleness of his deportment and the courtesy with which he treated themselves that he could be nothing more than some green young man they concluded that they should have all the easier task in disposing of his life they made no scruple to discuss the whole matter in his presence as not supposing that he understood any other language than that in which he conversed with his servant and the amount of their deliberation was to murder him then to throw him into the sea and to divide his spoils excuse my laughing gentlemen but the fact is i always do laugh when i think of this case two things about it seem so droll one is the horrid panic or funk as the men of eton call it in which des cartes must have found himself upon hearing this regular drama sketched for his own death funeral succession and administration to his effects but another thing which seems to me still more funny about this affair is that if these friezland hounds had been game we should have no cartesian philosophy and how we could have done without that considering the worlds of books it has produced i leave to any respectable trunkmaker to declare however to go on spite of his enormous funk des cartes showed fight and by that means awed these anticartesian rascals finding says m baillet that the matter was no joke m des cartes leaped upon his feet in a trice assumed a stern countenance that these cravens had never looked for and addressing them in their own language threatened to run them through on the spot if they dared to offer him any insult certainly gentlemen this would have been an honor far above the merits of such inconsiderable rascals to be spitted like larks upon a cartesian sword and therefore i am glad m des cartes did not rob the gallows by executing his threat especially as he could not possibly have brought his vessel to port after he had murdered his crew so that he must have continued to cruise for ever in the zuyder zee and would probably have been mistaken by sailors for the flying dutchman homeward bound the spirit which m des cartes manifested says his biographer had the effect of magic on these wretches the suddenness of their consternation struck their minds with a confusion which blinded them to their advantage and they conveyed him to his destination as peaceably as he could desire possibly gentlemen you may fancy that on the model of csars address to his poor ferryman csarem vehis et fortunas ejus m des cartes needed only to have said dogs you cannot cut my throat for you carry des cartes and his philosophy and might safely have defied them to do their worst a german emperor had the same notion when being cautioned to keep out of the way of a cannonading he replied tut man did you ever hear of a cannonball that killed an emperor as to an emperor i cannot say but a less thing has sufficed to smash a philosoper and the next great philosopher of europe undoubtedly was murdered this was spinosa i know very well the common opinion about him is that he died in his bed perhaps he did but he was murdered for all that and this i shall prove by a book published at brussels in the year entitled la via de spinosa par m jean colerus with many additions from a ms life by one of his friends spinosa died on the st february being then little more than fortyfour years old this of itself looks suspicious and m jean admits that a certain expression in the ms life of him would warrant the conclusion que sa mort na pas t toutfait naturelle living in a damp country and a sailors country like holland he may be thought to have indulged a good deal in grog especially in punch which was then newly discovered undoubtedly he might have done so but the fact is that he did not m jean calls him extrmement sobre en son boire et en son manger and though some wild stories were afloat about his using the juice of mandragora p and opium p yet neither of these articles appeared in his druggists bill living therefore with such sobriety how was it possible that he should die a natural death at fortyfour hear his biographers account sunday morning the st of february before it was church time spinosa came down stairs and conversed with the master and mistress of the house at this time therefore perhaps ten oclock on sunday morning you see that spinosa was alive and pretty well but it seems he had summoned from amsterdam a certain physician whom says the biographer i shall not otherwise point out to notice than by these two letters lm this lm had directed the people of the house to purchase an ancient cock and to have him boiled forthwith in order that spinosa might take some broth about noon which in fact he did and ate some of the old cock with a good appetite after the landlord and his wife had returned from church footnote june drinke part of boules of punch a liquor very strainge to me says the rev mr henry teonge in his diary lately published in a note on this passage a reference is made to fryers travels to the east indies who speaks of that enervating liquor called paunch which is indostan for five from five ingredients made thus it seems the medical men called it diapente if with four only diatessaron no doubt it was its evangelical name that recommended it to the rev mr teonge in the afternoon lm staid alone with spinosa the people of the house having returned to church on coming out from which they learnt with much surprise that spinosa had died about three oclock in the presence of lm who took his departure for amsterdam the same evening by the nightboat without paying the least attention to the deceased no doubt he was the readier to dispense with these duties as he had possessed himself of a ducatoon and a small quantity of silver together with a silverhafted knife and had absconded with his pillage here you see gentlemen the murder is plain and the manner of it it was lm who murdered spinosa for his money poor s was an invalid meagre and weak as no blood was observed lm no doubt threw him down and smothered him with pillows the poor man being already half suffocated by his infernal dinner but who was lm it surely never could be lindley murray for i saw him at york in and besides i do not think he would do such a thing at least not to a brother grammarian for you know gentlemen that spinosa wrote a very respectable hebrew grammar hobbes but why or on what principle i never could understand was not murdered this was a capital oversight of the professional men in the seventeenth century because in every light he was a fine subject for murder except indeed that he was lean and skinny for i can prove that he had money and what is very funny he had no right to make the least resistance for according to himself irresistible power creates the very highest species of right so that it is rebellion of the blackest die to refuse to be murdered when a competent force appears to murder you however gentlemen though he was not murdered i am happy to assure you that by his own account he was three times very near being murdered the first time was in the spring of when he pretends to have circulated a little ms on the kings behalf against the parliament he never could produce this ms by the by but he says that had not his majesty dissolved the parliament in may it had brought him into danger of his life dissolving the parliament however was of no use for in november of the same year the long parliament assembled and hobbes a second time fearing he should be murdered ran away to france this looks like the madness of john dennis who thought that louis xiv would never make peace with queen anne unless he were given up to his vengeance and actually ran away from the seacoast in that belief in france hobbes managed to take care of his throat pretty well for ten years but at the end of that time by way of paying court to cromwell he published his leviathan the old coward now began to funk horribly for the third time he fancied the swords of the cavaliers were constantly at his throat recollecting how they had served the parliament ambassadors at the hague and madrid turn says he in his doglatin life of himself tum venit in mentem mihi dorislaus et ascham tanquam proscripto terror ubique aderat and accordingly he ran home to england now certainly it is very true that a man deserved a cudgelling for writing leviathan and two or three cudgellings for writing a pentameter ending so villanously as terror ubique aderat but no man ever thought him worthy of anything beyond cudgelling and in fact the whole story is a bounce of his own for in a most abusive letter which he wrote to a learned person meaning wallis the mathematician he gives quite another account of the matter and says p he ran home because he would not trust his safety with the french clergy insinuating that he was likely to be murdered for his religion which would have been a high joke indeed toms being brought to the stake for religion bounce or not bounce however certain it is that hobbes to the end of his life feared that somebody would murder him this is proved by the story i am going to tell you it is not from a manuscript but as mr coleridge says it is as good as manuscript for it comes from a book now entirely forgotten viz the creed of mr hobbes examined in a conference between him and a student in divinity published about ten years before hobbess death the book is anonymous but it was written by tennison the same who about thirty years after succeeded tillotson as archbishop of canterbury the introductory anecdote is as follows a certain divine it seems no doubt tennison himself took an annual tour of one month to different parts of the island in one of these excursions he visited the peak in derbyshire partly in consequence of hobbess description of it being in that neighborhood he could not but pay a visit to buxton and at the very moment of his arrival he was fortunate enough to find a party of gentlemen dismounting at the inn door amongst whom was a long thin fellow who turned out to be no less a person than mr hobbes who probably had ridden over from chattsworth meeting so great a lion a tourist in search of the picturesque could do no less than present himself in the character of bore and luckily for this scheme two of mr hobbess companions were suddenly summoned away by express so that for the rest of his stay at buxton he had leviathan entirely to himself and had the honor of bowsing with him in the evening hobbes it seems at first showed a good deal of stiffness for he was shy of divines but this wore off and he became very sociable and funny and they agreed to go into the bath together how tennison could venture to gambol in the same water with leviathan i cannot explain but so it was they frolicked about like two dolphins though hobbes must have been as old as the hills and in those intervals wherein they abstained from swimming and plunging themselves ie diving they discoursed of many things relating to the baths of the ancients and the origine of springs when they had in this manner passed away an hour they stepped out of the bath and having dried and cloathed themselves they sate down in expectation of such a supper as the place afforded designing to refresh themselves like the deipnosophil and rather to reason than to drink profoundly but in this innocent intention they were interrupted by the disturbance arising from a little quarrel in which some of the ruder people in the house were for a short time engaged at this mr hobbes seemed much concerned though he was at some distance from the persons and why was he concerned gentlemen no doubt you fancy from some benign and disinterested love of peace and harmony worthy of an old man and a philosopher but listen for a while he was not composed but related it once or twice as to himself with a low and careful tone how sextus roscius was murthered after supper by the balne palatin of such general extent is that remark of cicero in relation to epicurus the atheist of whom he observed that he of all men dreaded most those things which he contemned death and the gods merely because it was supper time and in the neighborhood of a bath mr hobbes must have the fate of sextus roscius what logic was there in this unless to a man who was always dreaming of murder here was leviathan no longer afraid of the daggers of english cavaliers or french clergy but frightened from his propriety by a row in an alehouse between some honest clodhoppers of derbyshire whom his own gaunt scarecrow of a person that belonged to quite another century would have frightened out of their wits malebranche it will give you pleasure to hear was murdered the man who murdered him is well known it was bishop berkeley the story is familiar though hitherto not put in a proper light berkeley when a young man went to paris and called on pre malebranche he found him in his cell cooking cooks have ever been a genus irritabile authors still more so malebranche was both a dispute arose the old father warm already became warmer culinary and metaphysical irritations united to derange his liver he took to his bed and died such is the common version of the story so the whole ear of denmark is abused the fact is that the matter was hushed up out of consideration for berkeley who as pope remarked had every virtue under heaven else it was well known that berkeley feeling himself nettled by the waspishness of the old frenchman squared at him a turnup was the consequence malebranche was floored in the first round the conceit was wholly taken out of him and he would perhaps have given in but berkeleys blood was now up and he insisted on the old frenchmans retracting his doctrine of occasional causes the vanity of the man was too great for this and he fell a sacrifice to the impetuosity of irish youth combined with his own absurd obstinacy leibnitz being every way superior to malebranche one might a fortiori have counted on his being murdered which however was not the case i believe he was nettled at this neglect and felt himself insulted by the security in which he passed his days in no other way can i explain his conduct at the latter end of his life when he chose to grow very avaricious and to hoard up large sums of gold which he kept in his own house this was at vienna where he died and letters are still in existence describing the immeasurable anxiety which he entertained for his throat still his ambition for being attempted at least was so great that he would not forego the danger a late english pedagogue of birmingham manufacture viz dr parr took a more selfish course under the same circumstances he had amassed a considerable quantity of gold and silver plate which was for some time deposited in his bedroom at his parsonage house hatton but growing every day more afraid of being murdered which he knew that he could not stand and to which indeed he never had the slightest pretension he transferred the whole to the hatton blacksmith conceiving no doubt that the murder of a blacksmith would fall more lightly on the salus reipublic than that of a pedagogue but i have heard this greatly disputed and it seems now generally agreed that one good horseshoe is worth about spital sermons as leibnitz though not murdered may be said to have died partly of the fear that he should be murdered and partly of vexation that he was not kant on the other hand who had no ambition in that way had a narrower escape from a murderer than any man we read of except des cartes so absurdly does fortune throw about her favors the case is told i think in an anonymous life of this very great man for healths sake kant imposed upon himself at one time a walk of six miles every day along a highroad this fact becoming known to a man who had his private reasons for committing murder at the third milestone from knigsberg he waited for his intended who came up to time as duly as a mailcoach but for an accident kant was a dead man however on considerations of morality it happened that the murderer preferred a little child whom he saw playing in the road to the old transcendentalist this child he murdered and thus it happened that kant escaped such is the german account of the matter but my opinion is that the murderer was an amateur who felt how little would be gained to the cause of good taste by murdering an old arid and adust metaphysician there was no room for display as the man could not possibly look more like a mummy when dead than he had done alive thus gentlemen i have traced the connection between philosophy and our art until insensibly i find that i have wandered into our own era this i shall not take any pains to characterize apart from that which preceded it for in fact they have no distinct character the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries together with so much of the nineteenth as we have yet seen jointly compose the augustan age of murder the finest work of the seventeenth century is unquestionably the murder of sir edmondbury godfrey which has my entire approbation at the same time it must be observed that the quantity of murder was not great in this century at least amongst our own artists which perhaps is attributable to the want of enlightened patronage sint mcenates non deerunt flacce marones consulting grants observations on the bills of mortality th edition oxford i find that out of who died in london during one period of twenty years in the seventeenth century not more than eightysix were murdered that is about four threetenths per annum a small number this gentlemen to found an academy upon and certainly where the quantity is so small we have a right to expect that the quality should be firstrate perhaps it was yet still i am of opinion that the best artist in this century was not equal to the best in that which followed for instance however praiseworthy the case of sir edmondbury godfrey may be and nobody can be more sensible of its merits than i am still i cannot consent to place it on a level with that of mrs ruscombe of bristol either as to originality of design or boldness and breadth of style this good ladys murder took place early in the reign of george iii a reign which was notoriously favorable to the arts generally she lived in college green with a single maidservant neither of them having any pretension to the notice of history but what they derived from the great artist whose workmanship i am recording one fine morning when all bristol was alive and in motion some suspicion arising the neighbors forced an entrance into the house and found mrs ruscombe murdered in her bedroom and the servant murdered on the stairs this was at noon and not more than two hours before both mistress and servant had been seen alive to the best of my remembrance this was in upwards of sixty years therefore have now elapsed and yet the artist is still undiscovered the suspicions of posterity have settled upon two pretenders a baker and a chimneysweeper but posterity is wrong no unpractised artist could have conceived so bold an idea as that of a noonday murder in the heart of a great city it was no obscure baker gentlemen or anonymous chimneysweeper be assured that executed this work i know who it was here there was a general buzz which at length broke out into open applause upon which the lecturer blushed and went on with much earnestness for heavens sake gentlemen do not mistake me it was not i that did it i have not the vanity to think myself equal to any such achievement be assured that you greatly overrate my poor talents mrs ruscombes affair was far beyond my slender abilities but i came to know who the artist was from a celebrated surgeon who assisted at his dissection this gentleman had a private museum in the way of his profession one corner of which was occupied by a cast from a man of remarkably fine proportions that said the surgeon is a cast from the celebrated lancashire highwayman who concealed his profession for some time from his neighbors by drawing woollen stockings over his horses legs and in that way muffling the clatter which he must else have made in riding up a flagged alley that led to his stable at the time of his execution for highway robbery i was studying under cruickshank and the mans figure was so uncommonly fine that no money or exertion was spared to get into possession of him with the least possible delay by the connivance of the undersheriff he was cut down within the legal time and instantly put into a chaise and four so that when he reached cruickshanks he was positively not dead mr a young student at that time had the honor of giving him the coup de grce and finishing the sentence of the law this remarkable anecdote which seemed to imply that all the gentlemen in the dissectingroom were amateurs of our class struck me a good deal and i was repeating it one day to a lancashire lady who thereupon informed me that she had herself lived in the neighborhood of that highwayman and well remembered two circumstances which combined in the opinion of all his neighbors to fix upon him the credit of mrs ruscombes affair one was the fact of his absence for a whole fortnight at the period of that murder the other that within a very little time after the neighborhood of this highwayman was deluged with dollars now mrs ruscombe was known to have hoarded about two thousand of that coin be the artist however who he might the affair remains a durable monument of his genius for such was the impression of awe and the sense of power left behind by the strength of conception manifested in this murder that no tenant as i was told in had been found up to that time for mrs ruscombes house but whilst i thus eulogize the ruscombian case let me not be supposed to overlook the many other specimens of extraordinary merit spread over the face of this century such cases indeed as that of miss bland or of captain donnellan and sir theophilus boughton shall never have any countenance from me fie on these dealers in poison say i can they not keep to the old honest way of cutting throats without introducing such abominable innovations from italy i consider all these poisoning cases compared with the legitimate style as no better than waxwork by the side of sculpture or a lithographic print by the side of a fine volpato but dismissing these there remain many excellent works of art in a pure style such as nobody need be ashamed to own as every candid connoisseur will admit candid observe i say for great allowances must be made in these cases no artist can ever be sure of carrying through his own fine preconception awkward disturbances will arise people will not submit to have their throats cut quietly they will run they will kick they will bite and whilst the portrait painter often has to complain of too much torpor in his subject the artist in our line is generally embarrassed by too much animation at the same time however disagreeable to the artist this tendency in murder to excite and irritate the subject is certainly one of its advantages to the world in general which we ought not to overlook since it favors the development of latent talent jeremy taylor notices with admiration the extraordinary leaps which people will take under the influence of fear there was a striking instance of this in the recent case of the mkeands the boy cleared a height such as he will never clear again to his dying day talents also of the most brilliant description for thumping and indeed for all the gymnastic exercises have sometimes been developed by the panic which accompanies our artists talents else buried and hid under a bushel to the possessors as much as to their friends i remember an interesting illustration of this fact in a case which i learned in germany riding one day in the neighborhood of munich i overtook a distinguished amateur of our society whose name i shall conceal this gentleman informed me that finding himself wearied with the frigid pleasures so he called them of mere amateurship he had quitted england for the continent meaning to practise a little professionally for this purpose he resorted to germany conceiving the police in that part of europe to be more heavy and drowsy than elsewhere his debut as a practitioner took place at mannheim and knowing me to be a brother amateur he freely communicated the whole of his maiden adventure opposite to my lodging said he lived a baker he was somewhat of a miser and lived quite alone whether it were his great expanse of chalky face or what else i know not but the fact was i fancied him and resolved to commence business upon his throat which by the way he always carried bare a fashion which is very irritating to my desires precisely at eight oclock in the evening i observed that he regularly shut up his windows one night i watched him when thus engaged bolted in after him locked the door and addressing him with great suavity acquainted him with the nature of my errand at the same time advising him to make no resistance which would be mutually unpleasant so saying i drew out my tools and was proceeding to operate but at this spectacle the baker who seemed to have been struck by catalepsy at my first announce awoke into tremendous agitation i will not be murdered he shrieked aloud what for will i lose my precious throat what for said i if for no other reason for this that you put alum into your bread but no matter alum or no alum for i was resolved to forestall any argument on that point know that i am a virtuoso in the art of murder am desirous of improving myself in its details and am enamored of your vast surface of throat to which i am determined to be a customer is it so said he but ill find you custom in another line and so saying he threw himself into a boxing attitude the very idea of his boxing struck me as ludicrous it is true a london baker had distinguished himself in the ring and became known to fame under the title of the master of the rolls but he was young and unspoiled whereas this man was a monstrous featherbed in person fifty years old and totally out of condition spite of all this however and contending against me who am a master in the art he made so desperate a defence that many times i feared he might turn the tables upon me and that i an amateur might be murdered by a rascally baker what a situation minds of sensibility will sympathize with my anxiety how severe it was you may understand by this that for the first thirteen rounds the baker had the advantage round the fourteenth i received a blow on the right eye which closed it up in the end i believe this was my salvation for the anger it roused in me was so great that in this and every one of the three following rounds i floored the baker round th the baker came up piping and manifestly the worse for wear his geometrical exploits in the four last rounds had done him no good however he showed some skill in stopping a message which i was sending to his cadaverous mug in delivering which my foot slipped and i went down round th surveying the baker i became ashamed of having been so much bothered by a shapeless mass of dough and i went in fiercely and administered some severe punishment a rally took place both went down baker undermost ten to three on amateur round th the baker jumped up with surprising agility indeed he managed his pins capitally and fought wonderfully considering that he was drenched in perspiration but the shine was now taken out of him and his game was the mere effect of panic it was now clear that he could not last much longer in the course of this round we tried the weaving system in which i had greatly the advantage and hit him repeatedly on the conk my reason for this was that his conk was covered with carbuncles and i thought i should vex him by taking such liberties with his conk which in fact i did the three next rounds the master of the rolls staggered about like a cow on the ice seeing how matters stood in round twentyfourth i whispered something into his ear which sent him down like a shot it was nothing more than my private opinion of the value of his throat at an annuity office this little confidential whisper affected him greatly the very perspiration was frozen on his face and for the next two rounds i had it all my own way and when i called time for the twentyseventh round he lay like a log on the floor after which said i to the amateur it may be presumed that you accomplished your purpose you are right said he mildly i did and a great satisfaction you know it was to my mind for by this means i killed two birds with one stone meaning that he had both thumped the baker and murdered him now for the life of me i could not see that for on the contrary to my mind it appeared that he had taken two stones to kill one bird having been obliged to take the conceit out of him first with his fist and then with his tools but no matter for his logic the moral of his story was good for it showed what an astonishing stimulus to latent talent is contained in any reasonable prospect of being murdered a pursy unwieldy half cataleptic baker of mannheim had absolutely fought sixandtwenty rounds with an accomplished english boxer merely upon this inspiration so greatly was natural genius exalted and sublimed by the genial presence of his murderer really gentlemen when one hears of such things as these it becomes a duty perhaps a little to soften that extreme asperity with which most men speak of murder to hear people talk you would suppose that all the disadvantages and inconveniences were on the side of being murdered and that there were none at all in not being murdered but considerate men think otherwise certainly says jeremy taylor it is a less temporal evil to fall by the rudeness of a sword than the violence of a fever and the axe to which he might have added the shipcarpenters mallet and the crowbar a much less affliction than a strangury very true the bishop talks like a wise man and an amateur as he is and another great philosopher marcus aurelius was equally above the vulgar prejudices on this subject he declares it to be one of the noblest functions of reason to know whether it is time to walk out of the world or not book iii collers translation no sort of knowledge being rarer than this surely that man must be a most philanthropic character who undertakes to instruct people in this branch of knowledge gratis and at no little hazard to himself all this however i throw out only in the way of speculation to future moralists declaring in the meantime my own private conviction that very few men commit murder upon philanthropic or patriotic principles and repeating what i have already said once at least that as to the majority of murderers they are very incorrect characters with respect to williamss murders the sublimest and most entire in their excellence that ever were committed i shall not allow myself to speak incidentally nothing less than an entire lecture or even an entire course of lectures would suffice to expound their merits but one curious fact connected with his case i shall mention because it seems to imply that the blaze of his genius absolutely dazzled the eye of criminal justice you all remember i doubt not that the instruments with which he executed his first great work the murder of the marrs were a shipcarpenters mallet and a knife now the mallet belonged to an old swede one john petersen and bore his initials this instrument williams left behind him in marrs house and it fell into the hands of the magistrates now gentlemen it is a fact that the publication of this circumstance of the initials led immediately to the apprehension of williams and if made earlier would have prevented his second great work the murder of the williamsons which took place precisely twelve days after but the magistrates kept back this fact from the public for the entire twelve days and until that second work was accomplished that finished they published it apparently feeling that williams had now done enough for his fame and that his glory was at length placed beyond the reach of accident as to mr thurtells case i know not what to say naturally i have every disposition to think highly of my predecessor in the chair of this society and i acknowledge that his lectures were unexceptionable but speaking ingenuously i do really think that his principal performance as an artist has been much overrated i admit that at first i was myself carried away by the general enthusiasm on the morning when the murder was made known in london there was the fullest meeting of amateurs that i have ever known since the days of williams old bedridden connoisseurs who had got into a peevish way of sneering and complaining that there was nothing doing now hobbled down to our clubroom such hilarity such benign expression of general satisfaction i have rarely witnessed on every side you saw people shaking hands congratulating each other and forming dinner parties for the evening and nothing was to be heard but triumphant challenges of well will this do is this the right thing are you satisfied at last but in the midst of this i remember we all grew silent on hearing the old cynical amateur l s that laudator temporis acti stumping along with his wooden leg he entered the room with his usual scowl and as he advanced he continued to growl and stutter the whole way not an original idea in the whole piece mere plagiarism base plagiarism from hints that i threw out besides his style is as hard as albert durer and as coarse as fuseli many thought that this was mere jealousy and general waspishness but i confess that when the first glow of enthusiasm had subsided i have found most judicious critics to agree that there was something falsetto in the style of thurtell the fact is he was a member of our society which naturally gave a friendly bias to our judgments and his person was universally familiar to the cockneys which gave him with the whole london public a temporary popularity that his pretensions are not capable of supporting for opinionum commenta delet dies natur judicia confirmat there was however an unfinished design of thurtells for the murder of a man with a pair of dumbbells which i admired greatly it was a mere outline that he never completed but to my mind it seemed every way superior to his chief work i remember that there was great regret expressed by some amateurs that this sketch should have been left in an unfinished state but there i cannot agree with them for the fragments and first bold outlines of original artists have often a felicity about them which is apt to vanish in the management of the details the case of the mkeands i consider far beyond the vaunted performance of thurtell indeed above all praise and bearing that relation in fact to the immortal works of williams which the neid bears to the iliad but it is now time that i should say a few words about the principles of murder not with a view to regulate your practice but your judgment as to old women and the mob of newspaper readers they are pleased with anything provided it is bloody enough but the mind of sensibility requires something more first then let us speak of the kind of person who is adapted to the purpose of the murderer secondly of the place where thirdly of the time when and other little circumstances as to the person i suppose it is evident that he ought to be a good man because if he were not he might himself by possibility be contemplating murder at the very time and such diamondcutdiamond tussles though pleasant enough where nothing better is stirring are really not what a critic can allow himself to call murders i could mention some people i name no names who have been murdered by other people in a dark lane and so far all seemed correct enough but on looking farther into the matter the public have become aware that the murdered party was himself at the moment planning to rob his murderer at the least and possibly to murder him if he had been strong enough whenever that is the case or may be thought to be the case farewell to all the genuine effects of the art for the final purpose of murder considered as a fine art is precisely the same as that of tragedy in aristotles account of it viz to cleanse the heart by means of pity and terror now terror there may be but how can there be any pity for one tiger destroyed by another tiger it is also evident that the person selected ought not to be a public character for instance no judicious artist would have attempted to murder abraham newland for the case was this everybody read so much about abraham newland and so few people ever saw him that there was a fixed belief that he was an abstract idea and i remember that once when i happened to mention that i had dined at a coffeehouse in company with abraham newland everybody looked scornfully at me as though i had pretended to have played at billiards with prester john or to have had an affair of honor with the pope and by the way the pope would be a very improper person to murder for he has such a virtual ubiquity as the father of christendom and like the cuckoo is so often heard but never seen that i suspect most people regard him also as an abstract idea where indeed a public character is in the habit of giving dinners with every delicacy of the season the case is very different every person is satisfied that he is no abstract idea and therefore there can be no impropriety in murdering him only that his murder will fall into the class of assassinations which i have not yet treated thirdly the subject chosen ought to be in good health for it is absolutely barbarous to murder a sick person who is usually quite unable to bear it on this principle no cockney ought to be chosen who is above twentyfive for after that age he is sure to be dyspeptic or at least if a man will hunt in that warren he ought to murder a couple at one time if the cockneys chosen should be tailors he will of course think it his duty on the old established equation to murder eighteen and here in this attention to the comfort of sick people you will observe the usual effect of a fine art to soften and refine the feelings the world in general gentlemen are very bloodyminded and all they want in a murder is a copious effusion of blood gaudy display in this point is enough for them but the enlightened connoisseur is more refined in his taste and from our art as from all the other liberal arts when thoroughly cultivated the result is to improve and to humanize the heart so true is it that ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes emollit mores nec sinit esse feros a philosophic friend well known for his philanthropy and general benignity suggests that the subject chosen ought also to have a family of young children wholly dependent on his exertions by way of deepening the pathos and undoubtedly this is a judicious caution yet i would not insist too keenly on this condition severe good taste unquestionably demands it but still where the man was otherwise unobjectionable in point of morals and health i would not look with too curious a jealousy to a restriction which might have the effect of narrowing the artists sphere so much for the person as to the time the place and the tools i have many things to say which at present i have no room for the good sense of the practitioner has usually directed him to night and privacy yet there have not been wanting cases where this rule was departed from with excellent effect in respect to time mrs ruscombes case is a beautiful exception which i have already noticed and in respect both to time and place there is a fine exception in the annals of edinburgh year familiar to every child in edinburgh but which has unaccountably been defrauded of its due portion of fame amongst english amateurs the case i mean is that of a porter to one of the banks who was murdered whilst carrying a bag of money in broad daylight on turning out of the high street one of the most public streets in europe and the murderer is to this hour undiscovered sed fugit interea fugit irreparabile tcmpus singula dum capti circumvectamur amore and now gentlemen in conclusion let me again solemnly disclaim all pretensions on my own part to the character of a professional man i never attempted any murder in my life except in the year upon the body of a tomcat and that turned out differently from my intention my purpose i own was downright murder semper ego auditor tantum said i nunquamne reponam and i went down stairs in search of tom at one oclock on a dark night with the animus and no doubt with the fiendish looks of a murderer but when i found him he was in the act of plundering the pantry of bread and other things now this gave a new turn to the affair for the time being one of general scarcity when even christians were reduced to the use of potatobread ricebread and all sorts of things it was downright treason in a tomcat to be wasting good wheatenbread in the way he was doing it instantly became a patriotic duty to put him to death and as i raised aloft and shook the glittering steel i fancied myself rising like brutus effulgent from a crowd of patriots and as i stabbed him i called aloud on tullys name and bade the father of his country hail since then what wandering thoughts i may have had of attempting the life of an ancient ewe of a superannuated hen and such small deer are locked up in the secrets of my own breast but for the higher departments of the art i confess myself to be utterly unfit my ambition does not rise so high no gentlemen in the words of horace fungos vice cotis excutum reddere ere qu ferrum valet exsors ipsa secandi second paper on murder considered as one of the fine arts doctor north you are a liberal man liberal in the true classical sense not in the slang sense of modern politicians and educationmongers being so i am sure that you will sympathize with my case i am an illused man dr north particularly ill used and with your permission i will briefly explain how a black scene of calumny will be laid open but you doctor will make all things square again one frown from you directed to the proper quarter or a warning shake of the crutch will set me right in public opinion which at present i am sorry to say is rather hostile to me and mine all owing to the wicked arts of slanderers but you shall hear a good many years ago you may remember that i came forward in the character of a dilettante in murder perhaps dilettante may be too strong a word connoisseur is better suited to the scruples and infirmity of public taste i suppose there is no harm in that at least a man is not bound to put his eyes ears and understanding into his breeches pocket when he meets with a murder if he is not in a downright comatose state i suppose he must see that one murder is better or worse than another in point of good taste murders have their little differences and shades of merit as well as statues pictures oratorios cameos intaglios or what not you may be angry with the man for talking too much or too publicly as to the too much that i deny a man can never cultivate his taste too highly but you must allow him to think at any rate and you doctor you think i am sure both deeply and correctly on the subject well would you believe it all my neighbors came to hear of that little sthetic essay which you had published and unfortunately hearing at the very same time of a club that i as connected with and a dinner at which i presided both tending to the same little object as the essay viz the diffusion of a just taste among her majestys subjects they got up the most barbarous calumnies against me in particular they said that i or that the club which comes to the same thing had offered bounties on well conducted homicides with a scale of drawbacks in case of any one defect or flaw according to a table issued to private friends now doctor ill tell you the whole truth about the dinner and the club and youll see how malicious the world is but first let me tell you confidentially what my real principles are upon the matters in question as to murder i never committed one in my life its a well known thing amongst all my friends i can get a paper to certify as much signed by lots of people indeed if you come to that i doubt whether many people could produce as strong a certificate mine would be as big as a tablecloth there is indeed one member of the club who pretends to say that he caught me once making too free with his throat on a club night after every body else had retired but observe he shuffles in his story according to his state of civilation when not far gone he contents himself with saying that he caught me ogling his throat and that i was melancholy for some weeks after and that my voice sounded in a way expressing to the nice ear of a connoisseur the sense of opportunities lost but the club all know that hes a disappointed man himself and that he speaks querulously at times about the fatal neglect of a mans coming abroad without his tools besides all this is an affair between two amateurs and every body makes allowances for little asperities and sorenesses in such a case but say you if no murderer my correspondent may have encouraged or even have bespoke a murder no upon my honor nothing of the kind and that was the very point i wished to argue for your satisfaction the truth is i am a very particular man in everything relating to murder and perhaps i carry my delicacy too far the stagyrite most justly and possibly with a view to my case placed virtue in the greek to meson or middle point between two extremes a golden mean is certainly what every man should aim at but it is easier talking than doing and my infirmity being notoriously too much milkiness of heart i find it difficult to maintain that steady equatorial line between the two poles of too much murder on the one hand and too little on the other i am too soft doctor too soft and people get excused through me nay go through life without an attempt made upon them that ought not to be excused i believe if i had the management of things there would hardly be a murder from years end to years end in fact im for virtue and goodness and all that sort of thing and two instances ill give you to what an extremity i carry my virtue the first may seem a trifle but not if you knew my nephew who was certainly born to be hanged and would have been so long ago but for my restraining voice he is horribly ambitious and thinks himself a man of cultivated taste in most branches of murder whereas in fact he has not one idea on the subject but such as he has stolen from me this is so well known that the club has twice blackballed him though every indulgence was shown to him as my relative people came to me and said now really president we would do much to serve a relative of yours but still what can be said you know yourself that hell disgrace us if we were to elect him why the next thing we should hear of would be some vile butcherly murder by way of justifying our choice and what sort of a concern would it be you know as well as we do that it would be a disgraceful affair more worthy of the shambles than of an artists attelier he would fall upon some great big man some huge farmer returning drunk from a fair there would be plenty of blood and that he would expect us to take in lieu of taste finish scenical grouping then again how would he tool why most probably with a cleaver and a couple of paving stones so that the whole coup doeil would remind you rather of some hideous ogre or cyclops than of the delicate operator of the nineteenth century the picture was drawn with the hand of truth that i could not but allow and as to personal feelings in the matter i dismissed them from the first the next morning i spoke to my nephew i was delicately situated as you see but i determined that no consideration should induce me to flinch from my duty john said i you seem to me to have taken an erroneous view of life and its duties pushed on by ambition you are dreaming rather of what it might be glorious to attempt than what it would be possible for you to accomplish believe me it is not necessary to a mans respectability that he should commit a murder many a man has passed through life most respectably without attempting any species of homicide good bad or indifferent it is your first duty to ask yourself quid valeant humeri quid ferre recusent we cannot all be brilliant men in this life and it is for your interest to be contented rather with a humble station well filled than to shock every body with failures the more conspicuous by contrast with the ostentation of their promises john made no answer he looked very sulky at the moment and i am in high hopes that i have saved a near relation from making a fool of himself by attempting what is as much beyond his capacity as an epic poem others however tell me that he is meditating a revenge upon me and the whole club but let this be as it may liberavi animam meam and as you see have run some risk with a wish to diminish the amount of homicide but the other case still more forcibly illustrates my virtue a man came to me as a candidate for the place of my servant just then vacant he had the reputation of having dabbled a little in our art some said not without merit what startled me however was that he supposed this art to be part of his regular duties in my service now that was a thing i would not allow so i said at once richard or james as the case might be you misunderstand my character if a man will and must practise this difficult and allow me to add dangerous branch of art if he has an overruling genius for it why he might as well pursue his studies whilst living in my service as in anothers and also i may observe that it can do no harm either to himself or to the subject on whom he operates that he should be guided by men of more taste than himself genius may do much but long study of the art must always entitle a man to offer advice so far i will go general principles i will suggest but as to any particular case once for all i will have nothing to do with it never tell me of any special work of art you are meditating i set my face against it in toto for if once a man indulges himself in murder very soon he comes to think little of robbing and from robbing he comes next to drinking and sabbathbreaking and from that to incivility and procrastination once begin upon this downward path you never know where you are to stop many a man has dated his ruin from some murder or other that perhaps he thought little of at the time principiis obsta thats my rule such was my speech and i have always acted up to it so if that is not being virtuous i should be glad to know what is but now about the dinner and the club the club was not particularly of my creation it arose pretty much as other similar associations for the propagation of truth and the communication of new ideas rather from the necessities of things than upon any one mans suggestion as to the dinner if any man more than another could be held responsible for that it was a member known amongst us by the name of toadinthehole he was so called from his gloomy misanthropical disposition which led him into constant disparagements of all modern murders as vicious abortions belonging to no authentic school of art the finest performances of our own age he snarled at cynically and at length this querulous humor grew upon him so much and he became so notorious as a laudator tentporis acti that few people cared to seek his society this made him still more fierce and truculent he went about muttering and growling wherever you met him he was soliloquizing and saying despicable pretender without grouping without two ideas upon handling without and there you lost him at length existence seemed to be painful to him he rarely spoke he seemed conversing with phantoms in the air his housekeeper informed us that his reading was nearly confined to gods revenge upon murder by reynolds and a more ancient book of the same title noticed by sir walter scott in his fortunes of nigel sometimes perhaps he might read in the newgate calendar down to the year but he never looked into a book more recent in fact he had a theory with regard to the french revolution as having been the great cause of degeneration in murder very soon sir he used to say men will have lost the art of killing poultry the very rudiments of the art will have perished in the year he retired from general society toadinthehole was no more seen in any public resort we missed him from his wonted haunts nor up the lawn nor at the wood was he by the side of the main conduit his listless length at noontide he would stretch and pore upon the filth that muddled by even dogs are not what they were sir not what they should be i remember in my grandfathers time that some dogs had an idea of murder i have known a mastiff lie in ambush for a rival sir and murder him with pleasing circumstances of good taste yes sir i knew a tomcat that was an assassin but now and then the subject growing too painful he dashed his hand to his forehead and went off abruptly in a homeward direction towards his favorite conduit where he was seen by an amateur in such a state that he thought it dangerous to address him soon after he shut himself entirely up it was understood that he had resigned himself to melancholy and at length the prevailing notion was that toadinthehole had hanged himself the world was wrong there as it has been on some other questions toadinthehole might be sleeping but dead he was not and of that we soon had ocular proof one morning in an amateur surprised us with the news that he had seen toadinthehole brushing with hasty steps the dews away to meet the postman by the conduit side even that was something how much more to hear that he had shaved his beard had laid aside his sadcolored clothes and was adorned like a bridegroom of ancient days what could be the meaning of all this was toadinthehole mad or how soon after the secret was explained in more than a figurative sense the murder was out for in came the london morning papers by which it appeared that but three days before a murder the most superb of the century by many degrees had occurred in the heart of london i need hardly say that this was the great exterminating chefdoeuvre of williams at mr marrs no ratcliffe highway that was the dbut of the artist at least for anything the public knew what occurred at mr williamsons twelve nights afterwards the second work turned out from the same chisel some people pronounced even superior but toadinthehole always reclaimed he was even angry at comparisons this vulgar gout de comparaison as la bruyre calls it he would often remark will be our ruin each work has its own separate characteristics each in and for itself is incomparable one perhaps might suggest the iliad the other the odyssey what do you get by such comparisons neither ever was or will be surpassed and when youve talked for hours you must still come back to that vain however as all criticism might be he often said that volumes might be written on each case for itself and he even proposed to publish in quarto on the subject meantime how had toadinthehole happened to hear of this great work of art so early in the morning he had received an account by express dispatched by a correspondent in london who watched the progress of art on toadys behalf with a general commission to send off a special express at whatever cost in the event of any estimable works appearing how much more upon occasion of a ne plus ultra in art the express arrived in the nighttime toadinthehole was then gone to bed he had been muttering and grumbling for hours but of course he was called up on reading the account he threw his arms round the express called him his brother and his preserver settled a pension upon him for three lives and expressed his regret at not having it in his power to knight him we on our part we amateurs i mean having heard that he was abroad and therefore had not hanged himself made sure of soon seeing him amongst us accordingly he soon arrived knocked over the porter on his road to the readingroom he seized every mans hand as he passed him wrung it almost frantically and kept ejaculating why now heres something like a murder this is the real thing this is genuine this is what you can approve can recommend to a friend this says every man on reflection this is the thing that ought to be then looking at particular friends he said why jack how are you why tom how are you bless me you look ten years younger than when i last saw you no sir i replied it is you who look ten years younger do i well i shouldnt wonder if i did such works are enough to make us all young and in fact the general opinion is that toadinthehole would have died but for this regeneration of art which he called a second age of leo the tenth and it was our duty he said solemnly to commemorate it at present and en attendant rather as an occasion for a public participation in public sympathy than as in itself any commensurate testimony of our interest he proposed that the club should meet and dine together a splendid public dinner therefore was given by the club to which all amateurs were invited from a distance of one hundred miles of this dinner there are ample shorthand notes amongst the archives of the club but they are not extended to speak diplomatically and the reporter is missing i believe murdered meantime in years long after that day and on an occasion perhaps equally interesting viz the turning up of thugs and thuggism another dinner was given of this i myself kept notes for fear of another accident to the shorthand reporter and i here subjoin them toadinthehole i must mention was present at this dinner in fact it was one of its sentimental incidents being as old as the valleys at the dinner of naturally he was as old as the hills at the thug dinner of he had taken to wearing his beard again why or with what view it passes my persimmon to tell you but so it was and his appearance was most benign and venerable nothing could equal the angelic radiance of his smile as he inquired after the unfortunate reporter whom as a piece of private scandal i should tell you that he was himself supposed to have murdered in a rapture of creative art the answer was with roars of laughter from the undersheriff of our county non est inventus toadinthehole laughed outrageously at this in fact we all thought he was choking and at the earnest request of the company a musical composer furnished a most beautiful glee upon the occasion which was sung five times after dinner with universal applause and inextinguishable laughter the words being these and the chorus so contrived as most beautifully to mimic the peculiar laughter of toadinthehole et interrogatum est toadinthe hole ubi est ille reporter et responsum est cum cachinno non est inventus chorus deinde iteratum est ab omnibus cum cachinnatione undulante non est inventus toadinthehole i ought to mention about nine years before when an express from edinburgh brought him the earliest intelligence of the burkeandhare revolution in the art went mad upon the spot and instead of a pension to the express for even one life or a knighthood endeavored to burke him in consequence of which he was put into a strait waistcoat and that was the reason we had no dinner then but now all of us were alive and kicking straitwaistcoaters and others in fact not one absentee was reported upon the entire roll there were also many foreign amateurs present dinner being over and the cloth drawn there was a general call made for the new glee of non est inventus but as this would have interfered with the requisite gravity of the company during the earlier toasts i overruled the call after the national toasts had been given the first official toast of the day was the old man of the mountains drunk in solemn silence toadinthehole returned thanks in a neat speech he likened himself to the old man of the mountains in a few brief allusions that made the company absolutely yell with laughter and he concluded with giving the health of mr von hammer with many thanks to him for his learned history of the old man and his subjects the assassins upon this i rose and said that doubtless most of the company were aware of the distinguished place assigned by orientalists to the very learned turkish scholar von hammer the austrian that he had made the profoundest researches into our art as connected with those early and eminent artists the syrian assassins in the period of the crusaders that his work had been for several years deposited as a rare treasure of art in the library of the club even the authors name gentlemen pointed him out as the historian of our art von hammer yes yes interrupted toadinthehole who never can sit still yes yes von hammer hes the man for a malleus hreticorum think rightly of our art or hes the man to tickle your catastrophes you all know what consideration williams bestowed on the hammer or the ship carpenters mallet which is the same thing gentlemen i give you another great hammer charles the hammer the marteau or in old french the martel he hammered the saracens till they were all as dead as doornails he did believe me charles martel with all the honors but the explosion of toadinthehole together with the uproarious cheers for the grandpapa of charlemagne had now made the company unmanageable the orchestra was again challenged with shouts the stormiest for the new glee i made again a powerful effort to overrule the challenge i might as well have talked to the winds i foresaw a tempestuous evening and i ordered myself to be strengthened with three waiters on each side the vicepresident with as many symptoms of unruly enthusiasm were beginning to show out and i own that i myself was considerably excited as the orchestra opened with its storm of music and the impassioned glee began et interrogatum est toadinthehole ubi est ille reporter and the frenzy of the passion became absolutely convulsing as the full chorus fell in et iteratum est ab omnibus non est inventus by this time i saw how things were going wine and music were making most of the amateurs wild particularly toadinthehole though considerably above a hundred years old was getting as vicious as a young leopard it was a fixed impression with the company that he had murdered the reporter in the year since which time viz twentysix years ille reporter had been constantly reported non est inventus consequently the glee about himself which of itself was most tumultuous and jubilant carried him off his feet like the famous choral songs amongst the citizens of abdera nobody could hear it without a contagious desire for falling back into the agitating music of et interrogatum est toadinthehole c i enjoined vigilance upon my assessors and the business of the evening proceeded the next toast was the jewish sicarii upon which i made the following explanation to the company gentlemen i am sure it will interest you all to hear that the assassins ancient as they were had a race of predecessors in the very same country all over syria but particularly in palestine during the early years of the emperor nero there was a band of murderers who prosecuted their studies in a very novel manner they did not practise in the nighttime or in lonely places but justly considering that great crowds are in themselves a sort of darkness by means of the dense pressure and the impossibility of finding out who it was that gave the blow they mingled with mobs everywhere particularly at the great paschal feast in jerusalem where they actually had the audacity as josephus assures us to press into the temple and whom should they choose for operating upon but jonathan himself the pontifex maximus they murdered him gentlemen as beautifully as if they had had him alone on a moonless night in a dark lane and when it was asked who was the murderer and where he was why then it was answered interrupted toadinthehole non est inventus and then in spite of all i could do or say the orchestra opened and the whole company began et interrogatum est toadinthehole ubi est ille sicarius et responsum est ab omnibus non est inventus when the tempestuous chorus had subsided i began again gentlemen you will find a very circumstantial account of the sicarii in at least three different parts of josephus once in book xx sect v c of his antiquities once in book i of his wars but in sect of the chapter first cited you will find a particular description of their tooling this is what he says they tooled with small scymetars not much different from the persian acinac but more curved and for all the world most like the roman sickles or sic it is perfectly magnificent gentlemen to hear the sequel of their history perhaps the only case on record where a regular army of murderers was assembled a justus exercitus was in the case of these sicarii they mustered in such strength in the wilderness that festus himself was obliged to march against them with the roman legionary force upon which toadinthehole that cursed interrupter broke out asinging et interrogatum est toadinthehole ubi est ille exercitus et responsum est ab omnibus non est inventus no no toad you are wrong for once that army was found and was all cut to pieces in the desert heavens gentlemen what a sublime picture the roman legions the wilderness jerusalem in the distance an army of murderers in the foreground mr r a member now gave the next toast to the further improvement of tooling and thanks to the committee for their services mr l on behalf of the committee who had reported on that subject returned thanks he made an interesting extract from the report by which it appeared how very much stress had been laid formerly on the mode of tooling by the fathers both greek and latin in confirmation of this pleasing fact he made a very striking statement in reference to the earliest work of antediluvian art father mersenne that learned roman catholic in page one thousand four hundred and thirtyone of his operose commentary on genesis mentions on the authority of several rabbis that the quarrel of cain with abel was about a young woman that by various accounts cain had tooled with his teeth abelem fuisse morsibus dilaceratum cain by many others with the jawbone of an ass which is the tooling adopted by most painters but it is pleasing to the mind of sensibility to know that as science expanded sounder views were adopted one author contends for a pitchfork st chrysostom for a sword irenus for a scythe and prudentius for a hedgingbill this last writer delivers his opinion thus frater probat sanctitatis mulus germana curvo colla frangit sarculo ie his brother jealous of his attested sanctity fractures his brotherly throat with a curved hedgingbill all which is respectfully submitted by your committee not so much as decisive of the question for it is not but in order to impress upon the youthful mind the importance which has ever been attached to the quality of the tooling by such men as chrysostom and irenus footnote page one thousand four hundred and thirtyone literally good reader and no joke at all dang irenus said toadinthehole who now rose impatiently to give the next toast our irish friends and a speedy revolution in their mode of tooling as well as everything else connected with the art gentlemen ill tell you the plain truth every day of the year we take up a paper we read the opening of a murder we say this is good this is charming this is excellent but behold you scarcely have we read a little farther before the word tipperary or ballinasomething betrays the irish manufacture instantly we loath it we call to the waiter we say waiter take away this paper send it out of the house it is absolutely offensive to all just taste i appeal to every man whether on finding a murder otherwise perhaps promising enough to be irish he does not feel himself as much insulted as when madeira being ordered he finds it to be cape or when taking up what he takes to be a mushroom it turns out what children call a toadstool tithes politics or something wrong in principle vitiate every irish murder gentlemen this must be reformed or ireland will not be a land to live in at least if we do live there we must import all our murders thats clear toadinthehole sat down growling with suppressed wrath and the universal hear hear sufficiently showed that he spoke the general feeling the next toast was the sublime epoch of burkism and harism this was drunk with enthusiasm and one of the members who spoke to the question made a very curious communication to the company gentlemen we fancy burkism to be a pure invention of our own times and in fact no pancirollus has ever enumerated this branch of art when writing de rebus deperditis still i have ascertained that the essential principle of the art was known to the ancients although like the art of painting upon glass of making the myrrhine cups c it was lost in the dark ages for want of encouragement in the famous collection of greek epigrams made by planudes is one upon a very charming little case of burkism it is a perfect little gem of art the epigram itself i cannot lay my hand upon at this moment but the following is an abstract of it by salmasius as i find it in his notes on vopiscus est et elegans epigramma lucilii well he might call it elegans ubi medicus et pollinctor de compacto sic egerunt ut medicus gros omnes cur su commissos occideret this was the basis of the contract you see that on the one part the doctor for himself and his assigns doth undertake and contract duly and truly to murder all the patients committed to his charge but why there lies the beauty of the case et ut pollinctori amico suo traderet pollingendos the pollinctor you are aware was a person whose business it was to dress and prepare dead bodies for burial the original ground of the transaction appears to have been sentimental he was my friend says the murderous doctor he was dear to me in speaking of the pollinctor but the law gentlemen is stern and harsh the law will not hear of these tender motives to sustain a contract of this nature in law it is essential that a consideration should be given now what was the consideration for thus far all is on the side of the pollinctor he will be well paid for his services but meantime the generous the nobleminded doctor gets nothing what was the little consideration again i ask which the law would insist on the doctors taking you shall hear et ut pollinctor vicissim greek telamonas quos furabatur de pollinctione mortuorum medico mitteret doni ad alliganda vulnera eorurn quos curabat now the case is clear the whole went on a principle of reciprocity which would have kept up the trade for ever the doctor was also a surgeon he could not murder all his patients some of the surgical patients must be retained intact re infect for these he wanted linen bandages but unhappily the romans wore woollen on which account they bathed so often meantime there was linen to be had in rome but it was monstrously dear and the greek telamones or linen swathing bandages in which superstition obliged them to bind up corpses would answer capitally for the surgeon the doctor therefore contracts to furnish his friend with a constant succession of corpses provided and be it understood always that his said friend in return should supply him with one half of the articles he would receive from the friends of the parties murdered or to be murdered the doctor invariably recommended his invaluable friend the pollinctor whom let us call the undertaker the undertaker with equal regard to the sacred rights of friendship uniformly recommended the doctor like pylades and orestes they were models of a perfect friendship in their lives they were lovely and on the gallows it is to be hoped they were not divided gentlemen it makes me laugh horribly when i think of those two friends drawing and redrawing on each other pollinctor in account with doctor debtor by sixteen corpses creditor by fortyfive bandages two of which damaged their names unfortunately are lost but i conceive they must have been quintus burkius and publius harius by the way gentlemen has anybody heard lately of hare i understand he is comfortably settled in ireland considerably to the west and does a little business now and then but as he observes with a sigh only as a retailer nothing like the fine thriving wholesale concern so carelessly blown up at edinburgh you see what comes of neglecting business is the chief moral the greek epimutheon as sop would say which he draws from his past experience at length came the toast of the day thugdom in all its branches the speeches attempted at this crisis of the dinner were past all counting but the applause was so furious the music so stormy and the crashing of glasses so incessant from the general resolution never again to drink an inferior toast from the same glass that my power is not equal to the task of reporting besides which toadinthehole now became quite ungovernable he kept firing pistols in every direction sent his servant for a blunderbuss and talked of loading with ballcartridge we conceived that his former madness had returned at the mention of burke and hare or that being again weary of life he had resolved to go off in a general massacre this we could not think of allowing it became indispensable therefore to kick him out which we did with universal consent the whole company lending their toes uno pede as i may say though pitying his gray hairs and his angelic smile during the operation the orchestra poured in their old chorus the universal company sang and what surprised us most of all toadinthehole joined us furiously in singing et interrogatum est ab omnibus ubi est ille toadinthehole et responsum est ab omnibus non est inventus joan of arc in reference to m michelets history of france what is to be thought of her what is to be thought of the poor shepherd girl from the hills and forests of lorraine that like the hebrew shepherd boy from the hills and forests of juda rose suddenly out of the quiet out of the safety out of the religious inspiration rooted in deep pastoral solitudes to a station in the van of armies and to the more perilous station at the right hand of kings the hebrew boy inaugurated his patriotic mission by an act by a victorious act such as no man could deny but so did the girl of lorraine if we read her story as it was read by those who saw her nearest adverse armies bore witness to the boy as no pretender but so they did to the gentle girl judged by the voices of all who saw them from a station of good will both were found true and loyal to any promises involved in their first acts enemies it was that made the difference between their subsequent fortunes the boy rose to a splendor and a noonday prosperity both personal and public that rang through the records of his people and became a byeword amongst his posterity for a thousand years until the sceptre was departing from judah the poor forsaken girl on the contrary drank not herself from that cup of rest which she had secured for france she never sang together with the songs that rose in her native domrmy as echoes to the departing steps of invaders she mingled not in the festal dances at vaucouleurs which celebrated in rapture the redemption of france no for her voice was then silent no for her feet were dust pure innocent noblehearted girl whom from earliest youth ever i believed in as full of truth and selfsacrifice this was amongst the strongest pledges for thy side that never once no not for a moment of weakness didst thou revel in the vision of coronets and honor from man coronets for thee o no honors if they come when all is over are for those that share thy blood daughter of domrmy when the gratitude of thy king shall awaken thou wilt be sleeping the sleep of the dead call her king of france but she will not hear thee cite her by thy apparitors to come and receive a robe of honor but she will be found en contumace when the thunders of universal france as even yet may happen shall proclaim the grandeur of the poor shepherd girl that gave up all for her country thy ear young shepherd girl will have been deaf for five centuries to suffer and to do that was thy portion in this life to do never for thyself always for others to suffer never in the persons of generous champions always in thy own that was thy destiny and not for a moment was it hidden from thyself life thou saidst is short and the sleep which is in the grave is long let me use that life so transitory for the glory of those heavenly dreams destined to comfort the sleep which is so long this pure creature pure from every suspicion of even a visionary selfinterest even as she was pure in senses more obvious never once did this holy child as regarded herself relax from her belief in the darkness that was travelling to meet her she might not prefigure the very manner of her death she saw not in vision perhaps the arial altitude of the fiery scaffold the spectators without end on every road pouring into rouen as to a coronation the surging smoke the volleying flames the hostile faces all around the pitying eye that lurked but here and there until nature and imperishable truth broke loose from artificial restraints these might not be apparent through the mists of the hurrying future but the voice that called her to death that she heard for ever great was the throne of france even in those days and great was he that sate upon it but well joanna knew that not the throne nor he that sate upon it was for her but on the contrary that she was for them not she by them but they by her should rise from the dust gorgeous were the lilies of france and for centuries had the privilege to spread their beauty over land and sea until in another century the wrath of god and man combined to wither them but well joanna knew early at domrmy she had read that bitter truth that the lilies of france would decorate no garland for her flower nor bud bell nor blossom would ever bloom for her but stop what reason is there for taking up this subject of joanna precisely in this spring of might it not have been left till the spring of or perhaps left till called for yes but it is called for and clamorously you are aware reader that amongst the many original thinkers whom modern france has produced one of the reputed leaders is m michelet all these writers are of a revolutionary cast not in a political sense merely but in all senses mad oftentimes as march hares crazy with the laughinggas of recovered liberty drunk with the winecup of their mighty revolution snorting whinnying throwing up their heels like wild horses in the boundless pampas and running races of defiance with snipes or with the winds or with their own shadows if they can find nothing else to challenge some time or other i that have leisure to read may introduce you that have not to two or three dozen of these writers of whom i can assure you beforehand that they are often profound and at intervals are even as impassioned as if they were come of our best english blood and sometimes because it is not pleasant that people should be too easy to understand almost as obscure as if they had been suckled by transcendental german nurses but now confining our attention to m michelet who is quite sufficient to lead a man into a gallop requiring two relays at least of fresh readers we in england who know him best by his worst book the book against priests c which has been most circulated know him disadvantageously that book is a rhapsody of incoherence m michelet was lightheaded i believe when he wrote it and it is well that his keepers overtook him in time to intercept a second part but his history of france is quite another thing a man in whatsoever craft he sails cannot stretch away out of sight when he is linked to the windings of the shore by towing ropes of history facts and the consequences of facts draw the writer back to the falconers lure from the giddiest heights of speculation here therefore in his france if not always free from flightiness if now and then off like a rocket for an airy wheel in the clouds m michelet with natural politeness never forgets that he has left a large audience waiting for him on earth and gazing upwards in anxiety for his return return therefore he does but history though clear of certain temptations in one direction has separate dangers of its own it is impossible so to write a history of france or of england works becoming every hour more indispensable to the inevitablypolitical man of this day without perilous openings for assault if i for instance on the part of england should happen to turn my labors into that channel and on the model of lord percy going to chevy chase a vow to god should make my pleasure in the michelet woods three summer days to take probably from simple delirium i might hunt m michelet into delirium tremens two strong angels stand by the side of history whether french history or english as heraldic supporters the angel of research on the left hand that must read millions of dusty parchments and of pages blotted with lies the angel of meditation on the right hand that must cleanse these lying records with fire even as of old the draperies of asbestos were cleansed and must quicken them into regenerated life willingly i acknowledge that no man will ever avoid innumerable errors of detail with so vast a compass of ground to traverse this is impossible but such errors though i have a bushel on hand at m michelets service are not the game i chase it is the bitter and unfair spirit in which m michelet writes against england even that after all is but my secondary object the real one is joanna the pucelle dorleans for herself i am not going to write the history of la pucelle to do this or even circumstantially to report the history of her persecution and bitter death of her struggle with false witnesses and with ensnaring judges it would be necessary to have before us all the documents and therefore the collection only now forthcoming in paris but my purpose is narrower there have been great thinkers disdaining the careless judgments of contemporaries who have thrown themselves boldly on the judgment of a far posterity that should have had time to review to ponder to compare there have been great actors on the stage of tragic humanity that might with the same depth of confidence have appealed from the levity of compatriot friends too heartless for the sublime interest of their story and too impatient for the labor of sifting its perplexities to the magnanimity and justice of enemies to this class belongs the maid of arc the romans were too faithful to the ideal of grandeur in themselves not to relent after a generation or two before the grandeur of hannibal mithridates a more doubtful person yet merely for the magic perseverance of his indomitable malice won from the same romans the only real honor that ever he received on earth and we english have ever shown the same homage to stubborn enmity to work unflinchingly for the ruin of england to say through life by word and by deed delenda est anglia victrix that one purpose of malice faithfully pursued has quartered some people upon our national funds of homage as by a perpetual annuity better than an inheritance of service rendered to england herself has sometimes proved the most insane hatred to england hyder ali even his far inferior son tippoo and napoleon have all benefited by this disposition amongst ourselves to exaggerate the merit of diabolic enmity not one of these men was ever capable in a solitary instance of praising an enemy what do you say to that reader and yet in their behalf we consent to forget not their crimes only but which is worse their hideous bigotry and antimagnanimous egotism for nationality it was not suffrein and some half dozen of other french nautical heroes because rightly they did us all the mischief they could which was really great are names justly reverenced in england on the same principle la pucelle dorleans the victorious enemy of england has been destined to receive her deepest commemoration from the magnanimous justice of englishmen joanna as we in england should call her but according to her own statement jeanne or as m michelet asserts jean darc was born at domrmy a village on the marshes of lorraine and champagne and dependent upon the town of vaucouleurs i have called her a lorrainer not simply because the word is prettier but because champagne too odiously reminds us english of what are for us imaginary wines which undoubtedly la pucelle tasted as rarely as we english we english because the champagne of london is chiefly grown in devonshire la pucelle because the champagne of champagne never by any chance flowed into the fountain of domrmy from which only she drank m michelet will have her to be a champenoise and for no better reason than that she took after her father who happened to be a champenoise i am sure she did not for her father was a filthy old fellow whom i shall soon teach the judicious reader to hate but says m michelet arguing the case physiologically she had none of the lorrainian asperity no it seems she had only the gentleness of champagne its simplicity mingled with sense and acuteness as you find it in joinville all these things she had and she was worth a thousand joinvilles meaning either the prince so called or the fine old crusader but still though i love joanna dearly i cannot shut my eyes entirely to the lorraine element of asperity in her nature no really now she must have had a shade of that though very slightly developed a mere soupon as french cooks express it in speaking of cayenne pepper when she caused so many of our english throats to be cut but could she do less no i always say so but still you never saw a person kill even a trout with a perfectly champagne face of gentleness and simplicity though often no doubt with considerable acuteness all your cooks and butchers wear a lorraine cast of expression these disputes however turn on refinements too nice domrmy stood upon the frontiers and like other frontiers produced a mixed race representing the cis and the trans a river it is true formed the boundary line at this point the river meuse and that in old days might have divided the populations but in these days it did not there were bridges there were ferries and weddings crossed from the right bank to the left here lay two great roads not so much for travellers that were few as for armies that were too many by half these two roads one of which was the great high road between france and germany decussated at this very point which is a learned way of saying that they formed a st andrews cross or letter x i hope the compositor will choose a good large x in which case the point of intersection the locus of conflux for these four diverging arms will finish the readers geographical education by showing him to a hairs breadth where it was that domrmy stood these roads so grandly situated as great trunk arteries between two mighty realms and haunted for ever by wars or rumors of wars decussated for anything i know to the contrary absolutely under joannas bedroom window one rolling away to the right past monsieur darcs old barn and the other unaccountably preferring but theres no disputing about tastes to sweep round that odious mans odious pigstye to the left things being situated as is here laid down viz in respect of the decussation and in respect of joannas bedroom it follows that if she had dropped her glove by accident from her chamber window into the very bulls eye of the target in the centre of x not one of several great potentates could though all animated by the sincerest desires for the peace of europe have possibly come to any clear understanding on the question of whom the glove was meant for whence the candid reader perceives at once the necessity for at least four bloody wars falling indeed a little farther as for instance into the pigstye the glove could not have furnished to the most peppery prince any shadow of excuse for arming he would not have had a leg to stand upon in taking such a perverse line of conduct but if it fell as by the hypothesis it did into the one sole point of ground common to four kings it is clear that instead of no leg to stand upon eight separate legs would have had no ground to stand upon unless by treading on each others toes the philosopher therefore sees clearly the necessity of a war and regrets that sometimes nations do not wait for grounds of war so solid in the circumstances supposed though the four kings might be unable to see their way clearly without the help of gunpowder to any decision upon joannas intention she poor thing never could mistake her intentions for a moment all her love was for france and therefore any glove she might drop into the quadrivium must be wickedly missent by the postoffice if it found its way to any king but the king of france on whatever side of the border chance had thrown joanna the same love to france would have been nurtured for it is a strange fact noticed by m michelet and others that the dukes of bar and lorraine had for generations pursued the policy of eternal warfare with france on their own account yet also of eternal amity and league with france in case anybody else presumed to attack her let peace settle upon france and before long you might rely upon seeing the little vixen lorraine flying at the throat of france let franco be assailed by a formidable enemy and instantly you saw a duke of lorraine or bar insisting on having his throat cut in support of france which favor accordingly was cheerfully granted to them in three great successive battles by the english and by the turkish sultan viz at crcy at nicopolis and at agincourt this sympathy with france during great eclipses in those that during ordinary seasons were always teasing her with brawls and guerilla inroads strengthened the natural piety to france of those that were confessedly the children of her own house the outposts of france as one may call the great frontier provinces were of all localities the most devoted to the flours de lys to witness at any great crisis the generous devotion to these lilies of the little fiery cousin that in gentler weather was for ever tilting at her breast could not bin fan the zeal of the legitimate daughter whilst to occupy a post of honor on the frontiers against an old hereditary enemy of france would naturally have stimulated this zeal by a sentiment of martial pride had there even been no other stimulant to zeal by a sense of danger always threatening and of hatred always smouldering that great fourheaded road was a perpetual memento to patriotic ardor to say this way lies the road to paris and that other way to aixlachapelle this to prague that to vienna nourished the warfare of the heart by daily ministrations of sense the eye that watched for the gleams of lance or helmet from the hostile frontier the ear that listened for the groaning of wheels made the high road itself with its relations to centres so remote into a manual of patriotic enmity the situation therefore locally of joanna was full of profound suggestions to a heart that listened for the stealthy steps of change and fear that too surely were in motion but if the place were grand the times the burthen of the times was far more so the air overhead in its upper chambers were hurtling with the obscure sound was dark with sullen fermenting of storms that had been gathering for a hundred and thirty years the battle of agincourt in joannas childhood had reopened the wounds of france crcy and poictiers those withering overthrows for the chivalry of france had been tranquillized by more than half a century but this resurrection of their trumpet wails made the whole series of battles and endless skirmishes take their stations as parts in one drama the graves that had closed sixty years ago seemed to fly open in sympathy with a sorrow that echoed their own the monarchy of france labored in extremity rocked and reeled like a ship fighting with the darkness of monsoons the madness of the poor king charles vi falling in at such a crisis like the case of women laboring in childbirth during the storming of a city trebled the awfulness of the time even the wild story of the incident which had immediately occasioned the explosion of this madness the case of a man unknown gloomy and perhaps maniacal himself coming out of a forest at noonday laying his hand upon the bridle of the kings horse checking him for a moment to say oh king thou art betrayed and then vanishing no man knew whither as he had appeared for no man knew what fell in with the universal prostration of mind that laid france on her knees as before the slow unweaving of some ancient prophetic doom the famines the extraordinary diseases the insurrections of the peasantry up and down europe these were chords struck from the same mysterious harp but these were transitory chords there had been others of deeper and more sonorous sound the termination of the crusades the destruction of the templars the papal interdicts the tragedies caused or suffered by the house of anjou by the emperor these were full of a more permanent significance but since then the colossal figure of feudalism was seen standing as it were on tiptoe at crcy for flight from earth that was a revolution unparalleled yet that was a trifle by comparison with the more fearful revolutions that were mining below the church by her own internal schisms by the abominable spectacle of a double pope so that no man except through political bias could even guess which was heavens vicegerent and which the creature of hell she was already rehearsing as in still earlier forms she had rehearsed the first rent in her foundations reserved for the coming century which no man should ever heal these were the loftiest peaks of the cloudland in the skies that to the scientific gazer first caught the colors of the new morning in advance but the whole vast range alike of sweeping glooms overhead dwelt upon all meditative minds even those that could not distinguish the altitudes nor decipher the forms it was therefore not her own age alone as affected by its immediate calamities that lay with such weight upon joannas mind but her own age as one section in a vast mysterious drama unweaving through a century back and drawing nearer continually to crisis after crisis cataracts and rapids were heard roaring ahead and signs were seen far back by help of old mens memories which answered secretly to signs now coming forward on the eye even as locks answer to keys it was not wonderful that in such a haunted solitude with such a haunted heart joanna should see angelic visions and hear angelic voices these voices whispered to her the duty imposed upon herself of delivering france five years she listened to these monitory voices with internal struggles at length she could resist no longer doubt gave way and she left her home in order to present herself at the dauphins court the education of this poor girl was mean according to the present standard was ineffably grand according to a purer philosophic standard and only not good for our age because for us it would be unattainable she read nothing for she could not read but she had heard others read parts of the roman martyrology she wept in sympathy with the sad misereres of the romish chaunting she rose to heaven with the glad triumphant gloria in excelcis she drew her comfort and her vital strength from the rites of her church but next after these spiritual advantages she owed most to the advantages of her situation the fountain of domrmy was on the brink of a boundless forest and it was haunted to that degree by fairies that the parish priest cur was obliged to read mass there once a year in order to keep them in any decent bounds fairies are important even in a statistical view certain weeds mark poverty in the soil fairies mark its solitude as surely as the wolf retires before cities does the fairy sequester herself from the haunts of licensed victuallers a village is too much for her nervous delicacy at most she can tolerate a distant view of a hamlet we may judge therefore by the uneasiness and extra trouble which they gave to the parson in what strength the fairies mustered at domrmy and by a satisfactory consequence how thinly sown with men and women must have been that region even in its inhabited spots but the forests of domrmy those were the glories of the land for in them abode mysterious powers and ancient secrets that towered into tragic strength abbeys there were and abbey windows dim and dimly seen as moorish temples of the hindoos that exercised even princely power both in lorraine and in the german diets these had their sweet bells that pierced the forests for many a league at matins or vespers and each its own dreamy legend few enough and scattered enough were these abbeys in no degree to disturb the deep solitude of the region many enough to spread a network or awning of christian sanctity over what else might have seemed a heathen wilderness this sort of religious talisman being secured a man the most afraid of ghosts like myself suppose or the reader becomes armed into courage to wander for days in their sylvan recesses the mountains of the vosges on the eastern frontier of france have never attracted much notice from europe except in for a few brief months when they fell within napoleons line of defence against the allies but they are interesting for this amongst other features that they do not like some loftier ranges repel woods the forests and they are on sociable terms live and let live is their motto for this reason in part these tracts in lorraine were a favorite hunting ground with the carlovingian princes about six hundred years before joannas childhood charlemagne was known to have hunted there that of itself was a grand incident in the traditions of a forest or a chase in these vast forests also were to be found if the race was not extinct those mysterious fawns that tempted solitary hunters into visionary and perilous pursuits here was seen at intervals that ancient stag who was already nine hundred years old at the least but possibly a hundred or two more when met by charlemagne and the thing was put beyond doubt by the inscription upon his golden collar i believe charlemagne knighted the stag and if ever he is met again by a king he ought to be made an earl or being upon the marches of france a marquess observe i dont absolutely vouch for all these things my own opinion varies on a fine breezy forenoon i am audaciously sceptical but as twilight sets in my credulity becomes equal to anything that could be desired and i have heard candid sportsmen declare that outside of these very forests near the vosges they laughed loudly at all the dim tales connected with their haunted solitudes but on reaching a spot notoriously eighteen miles deep within them they agreed with sir roger de coverley that a good deal might be said on both sides such traditions or any others that like the stag connect distant generations with each other are for that cause sublime and the sense of the shadowy connected with such appearances that reveal themselves or not according to circumstances leaves a coloring of sanctity over ancient forests even in those minds that utterly reject the legend as a fact but apart from all distinct stories of that order in any solitary frontier between two great empires as here for instance or in the desert between syria and the euphrates there is an inevitable tendency in minds of any deep sensibility to people the solitudes with phantom images of powers that were of old so vast joanna therefore in her quiet occupation of a shepherdess would be led continually to brood over the political condition of her country by the traditions of the past no less than by the mementoes of the local present m michelet indeed says that la pucelle was not a shepherdess i beg his pardon she was what he rests upon i guess pretty well it is the evidence of a woman called haumette the most confidential friend of joanna now she is a good witness and a good girl and i like her for she makes a natural and affectionate report of joannas ordinary life but still however good she may be as a witness joanna is better and she when speaking to the dauphin calls herself in the latin report bergereta even haumette confesses that joanna tended sheep in her girlhood and i believe that if miss haumette were taking coffee alone with me this very evening february in which there would be no subject for scandal or for maiden blushes because i am an intense philosopher and miss h would be hard upon four hundred and fifty years old she would admit the following comment upon her evidence to be right a frenchman about thirty years ago m simond in his travels mentioned incidentally the following hideous scene as one steadily observed and watched by himself in france at a period some trifle before the french revolution a peasant was ploughing and the team that drew his plough was a donkey and a woman both were regularly harnessed both pulled alike this is bad enough but the frenchman adds that in distributing his lashes the peasant was obviously desirous of being impartial or if either of the yokefellows had a right to complain certainly it was not the donkey now in any country where such degradation of females could be tolerated by the state of manners a woman of delicacy would shrink from acknowledging either for herself or her friend that she had ever been addicted to any mode of labor not strictly domestic because if once owning herself a prdial servant she would be sensible that this confession extended by probability in the hearers thoughts to having incurred indignities of this horrible kind haumette clearly thinks it more dignified for joanna to have been darning the stockings of her hornyhoofed father monsieur darc than keeping sheep lest she might then be suspected of having ever done something worse but luckily there was no danger of that joanna never was in service and my opinion is that her father should have mended his own stockings since probably he was the party to make the holes in them as many a better man than darc does meaning by that not myself because though certainly a better man than darc i protest against doing anything of the kind if i lived even with friday in juan fernandez either friday must do all the darning or else it must go undone the better men that i meant were the sailors in the british navy every man of whom mends his own stockings who else is to do it do you suppose reader that the junior lords of the admiralty are under articles to darn for the navy the reason meantime for my systematic hatred of darc is this there was a story current in france before the revolution framed to ridicule the pauper aristocracy who happened to have long pedigrees and short rent rolls viz that a head of such a house dating from the crusades was overheard saying to his son a chevalier of st louis chevalier astu donn au cochon manger now it is clearly made out by the surviving evidence that darc would much have preferred continuing to say ma fille astu donn au cochon manger to saying pucelle dorlans astu sauv les fleursdelys there is an old english copy of verses which argues thus if the man that turnips cries cry not when his father dies then tis plain the man had rather have a turnip than his father i cannot say that the logic of these verses was ever entirely to my satisfaction i do not see my way through it as clearly as could be wished but i see my way most clearly through darc and the result is that he would greatly have preferred not merely a turnip to his father but the saving a pound or so of bacon to saving the oriflamme of france it is probable as m michelet suggests that the title of virgin or pucelle had in itself and apart from the miraculous stones about her a secret power over the rude soldiery and partisan chiefs of that period for in such a person they saw a representative manifestation of the virgin mary who in a course of centuries had grown steadily upon the popular heart as to joannas supernatural detection of the dauphin charles vii amongst three hundred lords and knights i am surprised at the credulity which could ever lend itself to that theatrical juggle who admires more than myself the sublime enthusiasm the rapturous faith in herself of this pure creature but i admire not stage artifices which not la pucelle but the court must have arranged nor can surrender myself a dupe to a conjurors legerdemain such as may be seen every day for a shilling southeys joan of arc was published in twenty years after talking with southey i was surprised to find him still owning a secret bias in favor of joan founded on her detection of the dauphin the story for the benefit of the reader new to the case was this la pucelle was first made known to the dauphin and presented to his court at chinon and here came her first trial she was to find out the royal personage amongst the whole ark of clean and unclean creatures failing in this coup dessai she would not simply disappoint many a beating heart in the glittering crowd that on different motives yearned for her success but she would ruin herself and as the oracle within had told her would ruin france our own sovereign lady victoria rehearses annually a trial not so severe in degree but the same in kind she pricks for sheriffs joanna pricked for a king but observe the difference our own lady pricks for two men out of three joanna for one man out of three hundred happy lady of the islands and the orient she can go astray in her choice only by one half to the extent of one half she must have the satisfaction of being right and yet even with these tight limits to the misery of a boundless discretion permit me liege lady with all loyalty to submit that now and then you prick with your pin the wrong man but the poor child from domrmy shrinking under the gaze of a dazzling court not because dazzling for in visions she had seen those that were more so but because some of them wore a scoffing smile on their features how should she throw her line into so deep a river to angle for a king where many a gay creature was sporting that masqueraded as kings in dress nay even more than any true king would have done for in southeys version of the story the dauphin says by way of trying the virgins magnetic sympathy with royalty on the throne i the while mingling with the menial throng some courtier shall he seated this usurper is even crowned the jeweled crown shines on a menials head but really that is un peu fort and the mob of spectators might raise a scruple whether our friend the jackdaw upon the throne and the dauphin himself were not grazing the shins of treason for the dauphin could not lend more than belonged to him according to the popular notion he had no crown for himself but at most a petit ecu worth thirty pence consequently none to lend on any pretence whatever until the consecrated maid should take him to rheims this was the popular notion in france the same notion as to the indispensableness of a coronation prevails widely in england but certainly it was the dauphins interest to support the popular notion as he meant to use the services of joanna for if he were king already what was it that she could do for him beyond orleans and above all if he were king without a coronation and without the oil from the sacred ampulla what advantage was yet open to him by celerity above his competitor the english boy now was to be a race for a coronation he that should win that race carried the superstition of france along with him trouble us not lawyer with your quillets we are illegal blockheads so thoroughly without law that we dont know even if we have a right to be blockheads and our mind is made up that the first man drawn from the oven of coronation at rheims is the man that is baked into a king all others are counterfeits made of base indian meal damaged by seawater la pucelle before she could be allowed to practise as a warrior was put through her manual and platoon exercise as a juvenile pupil in divinity before six eminent men in wigs according to southey v book iii in the original edition of his joan of arc she appalld the doctors its not easy to do that but they had some reason to feel bothered as that surgeon would assuredly feel bothered who upon proceeding to dissect a subject should find the subject retaliating as a dissector upon himself especially if joanna ever made the speech to them which occupies v b iii it is a double impossibility st because a piracy from tindals christianity as old as the creation now a piracy parte post is common enough but a piracy parte ante and by three centuries would according to our old english phrase drive a coachandsix through any copyright act that man born of woman could frame dly it is quite contrary to the evidence on joannas trial for southeys joan of a dom cottle bristol tells the doctors amongst other secrets that she never in her life attended st mass nor d the sacramental table nor d confession heres a precious windfall for the doctors they by snaky tortuosities had hoped through the aid of a corkscrew which every d d or stp is said to carry in his pocket for the happiness of ultimately extracting from joanna a few grains of heretical powder or small shot which might have justified their singeing her a little and just at such a crisis expressly to justify their burning her to a cinder up gallops joanna with a brigade of guns unlimbers and serves them out with heretical grape and deistical roundshot enough to lay a kingdom under interdict any miracles to which joanna might treat the grim d ds after that would go to the wrong side of her little account in the clerical books joanna would be created a dr herself but not of divinity for in the joanna page of the ledger the entry would be miss joanna in acct with the church dr by sundry diabolic miracles she having publicly preached heresy shown herself a witch and even tried hard to corrupt the principles of six church pillars in the mean time all this deistical confession of joannas besides being suicidal for the interest of her cause is opposed to the depositions upon both trials the very best witness called from first to last deposes that joanna attended these rites of her church even too often was taxed with doing so and by blushing owned the charge as a fact though certainly not as a fault joanna was a girl of natural piety that saw god in forests and hills and fountains but did not the less seek him in chapels and consecrated oratories this peasant girl was selfeducated through her own natural meditativeness if the reader turns to that divine passage in paradise regained which milton has put into the mouth of our saviour when first entering the wilderness and musing upon the tendency of those great impulses growing within himself oh what a multitude of thoughts arise c he will have some notion of the vast reveries which brooded over the heart of joanna in early girlhood when the wings were budding that should carry her from orleans to rheims when the golden chariot was dimly revealing itself that should carry her from the kingdom of france delivered to the eternal kingdom it is not requisite for the honor of joanna nor is there in this place room to pursue her brief career of action that though wonderful forms the earthly part of her story the intellectual part is the saintly passion of her imprisonment trial and execution it is unfortunate therefore for southeys joan of arc which however should always be regarded as a juvenile effort that precisely when her real glory begins the poem ends but this limitation of the interest grew no doubt from the constraint inseparably attached to the law of epic unity joannas history bisects into two opposite hemispheres and both could not have been presented to the eye in one poem unless by sacrificing all unity of theme or else by involving the earlier half as a narrative episode in the latter this might have been done it might have been communicated to a fellowprisoner or a confessor by joanna herself in the same way that virgil has contrived to acquaint the reader through the heros mouth with earlier adventures that if told by the poet speaking in his own person would have destroyed the unity of his fable the romantic interest of the early and irrelate incidents last night of troy c is thrown as an affluent into the general river of the personal narrative whilst yet the capital current of the epos as unfolding ihe origin and incunabula of rome is not for a moment suffered to be modified by events so subordinate and so obliquely introduced it is sufficient as concerns this section of joannas life to say that she fulfilled to the height of her promises the restoration of the prostrate throne france had become a province of england and for the ruin of both if such a yoke could be maintained dreadful pecuniary exhaustion caused the english energy to droop and that critical opening la pucelle used with a corresponding felicity of audacity and suddenness that were in themselves portentous for introducing the wedge of french native resources for rekindling the national pride and for planting the dauphin once more upon his feet when joanna appeared he had been on the point of giving up the struggle with the english distressed as they were and of flying to the south of france she taught him to blush for such abject counsels she liberated orleans that great city so decisive by its fate for the issue of the war and then beleaguered by the english with an elaborate application of engineering skill unprecedented in europe entering the city after sunset on the th of april she sang mass on sunday may for the entire disappearance of the besieging force on the th of june she fought and gained over the english the decisive battle of patay on the th of july she took troyes by a coupdemain from a mixed garrison of english and burgundians on the th of that month she carried the dauphin into rheims on sunday the th she crowned him and there she rested from her labor of triumph what remained was to suffer all this forward movement was her own excepting one man the whole council was against her her enemies were all that drew power from earth her supporters were her own strong enthusiasm and the headlong contagion by which she carried this sublime frenzy into the hearts of women of soldiers and of all who lived by labor henceforwards she was thwarted and the worst error that she committed was to lend the sanction of her presence to counsels which she disapproved but she had accomplished the capital objects which her own visions had dictated these involved all the rest errors were now less important and doubtless it had now become more difficult for herself to pronounce authentically what were errors the noble girl had achieved as by a rapture of motion the capital end of clearing out a free space around her sovereign giving him the power to move his arms with effect and secondly the inappreciable end of winning for that sovereign what seemed to all france the heavenly ratification of his rights by crowning him with the ancient solemnities she had made it impossible for the english now to step before her they were caught in an irretrievable blunder owing partly to discord amongst the uncles of henry vi partly to a want of funds but partly to the very impossibility which they believed to press with tenfold force upon any french attempt to forestall theirs they laughed at such a thought and whilst they laughed she did it henceforth the single redress for the english of this capital oversight but which never could have redressed it effectually was to vitiate and taint the coronation of charles vii as the work of a witch that policy and not malice as m michelet is so happy to believe was the moving principle in the subsequent prosecution of joanna unless they unhinged the force of the first coronation in the popular mind by associating it with power given from hell they felt that the sceptre of the invader was broken but she the child that at nineteen had wrought wonders so great for france was she not elated did she not lose as men so often have lost all sobriety of mind when standing upon the pinnacl of successes so giddy let her enemies declare during the progress of her movement and in the centre of ferocious struggles she had manifested the temper of her feelings by the pity which she had every where expressed for the suffering enemy she forwarded to the english leaders a touching invitation to unite with the french as brothers in a common crusade against infidels thus opening the road for a soldierly retreat she interposed to protect the captive or the wounded she mourned over the excesses of her countrymen she threw herself off her horse to kneel by the dying english soldier and to comfort him with such ministrations physical or spiritual as his situation allowed nolebat says the evidence uti onso suo aut quemquam interficere she sheltered the english that invoked her aid in her own quarters she wept as she beheld stretched on the field of battle so many brave enemies that had died without confession and as regarded herself her elation expressed itself thus on the day when she had finished her work she wept for she knew that when her task was done her end must be approaching her aspirations pointed only to a place which seemed to her more than usually full of natural piety as one in which it would give her pleasure to die and she uttered between smiles and tears as a wish that inexpressibly fascinated her heart and yet was half fantastic a broken prayer that god would return her to the solitudes from which he had drawn her and suffer her to become a shepherdess once more it was a natural prayer because nature has laid a necessity upon every human heart to seek for rest and to shrink from torment yet again it was a halffantastic prayer because from childhood upwards visions that she had no power to mistrust and the voices which sounded in her ear for ever had long since persuaded her mind that for her no such prayer could be granted too well she felt that her mission must be worked out to the end and that the end was now at hand all went wrong from this time she herself had created the funds out of which the french restoration should grow but she was not suffered to witness their development or their prosperous application more than one military plan was entered upon which she did not approve but she still continued to expose her person as before severe wounds had not taught her caution and at length in a sortie from compeigne whether through treacherous collusion on the part of her own friends is doubtful to this day she was made prisoner by the burgundians and finally surrendered to the english now came her trial this trial moving of course under english influence was conducted in chief by the bishop of beauvais he was a frenchman sold to english interests and hoping by favor of the english leaders to reach the highest preferment bishop that art archbishop that shalt be cardinal that mayest be were the words that sounded continually in his ear and doubtless a whisper of visions still higher of a triple crown and feet upon the necks of kings sometimes stole into his heart m michelet is anxious to keep us in mind that this bishop was but an agent of the english true but it does not better the case for his countryman that being an accomplice in the crime making himself the leader in the persecution against the helpless girl he was willing to be all this in the spirit and with the conscious vileness of a catspaw never from the foundations of the earth was there such a trial as this if it were laid open in all its beauty of defence and all its hellishness of attack oh child of france shepherdess peasant girl trodden under foot by all around thee how i honor thy flashing intellect quick as gods lightning and true as that lightning to its mark that ran before france and laggard europe by many a century confounding the malice of the ensnarer and making dumb the oracles of falsehood is it not scandalous is it not humiliating to civilization that even at this day france exhibits the horrid spectacle of judges examining the prisoner against himself seducing him by fraud into treacherous conclusions against his own head using the terrors of their power for extorting confessions from the frailty of hope nay which is worse using the blandishments of condescension and snaky kindness for thawing into compliances of gratitude those whom they had failed to freeze into terror wicked judges barbarian jurisprudence that sitting in your own conceit on the summits of social wisdom have yet failed to learn the first principles of criminal justice sit ye humbly and with docility at the feet of this girl from domrmy that tore your webs of cruelty into shreds and dust would you examine me as a witness against myself was the question by which many times she defied their arts continually she showed that their interrogations were irrelevant to any business before the court or that entered into the ridiculous charges against her general questions were proposed to her on points of casuistical divinity twoedged questions which not one of themselves could have answered without on the one side landing himself in heresy as then interpreted or on the other in some presumptuous expression of selfesteem next came a wretched dominican that pressed her with an objection which if applied to the bible would tax every one of its miracles with unsoundness the monk had the excuse of never having read the bible m michelet has no such excuse and it makes one blush for him as a philosopher to find him describing such an argument as weighty whereas it is but a varied expression of rude mahometan metaphysics her answer to this if there were room to place the whole in a clear light was as shattering as it was rapid another thought to entrap her by asking what language the angelic visitors of her solitude had talked as though heavenly counsels could want polyglott interpreters for every word or that god needed language at all in whispering thoughts to a human heart then came a worse devil who asked her whether the archangel michael had appeared naked not comprehending the vile insinuation joanna whose poverty suggested to her simplicity that it might be the costliness or suitable robes which caused the demur asked them if they fancied god who clothed the flowers of the valleys unable to find raiment for his servants the answer of joanna moves a smile of tenderness but the disappointment of her judges makes one laugh horribly others succeeded by troops who upbraided her with leaving her father as if that greater father whom she believed herself to have been serving did not retain the power of dispensing with his own rules or had not said that for a less cause than martyrdom man and woman should leave both father and mother on easter sunday when the trial had been long proceeding the poor girl fell so ill as to cause a belief that she had been poisoned it was not poison nobody had any interest in hastening a death so certain m michelet whose sympathies with all feelings are so quick that one would gladly see them always as justly directed reads the case most truly joanna had a twofold malady she was visited by a paroxysm of the complaint called homesickness the cruel nature of her imprisonment and its length could not but point her solitary thoughts in darkness and in chains for chained she was to domrmy and the season which was the most heavenly period of the spring added stings to this yearning that was one of her maladies nostalgia as medicine calls it the other was weariness and exhaustion from daily combats with malice she saw that everybody hated her and thirsted for her blood nay many kindhearted creatures that would have pitied her profoundly as regarded all political charges had their natural feelings warped by the belief that she had dealings with fiendish powers she knew she was to die that was not the misery the misery was that this consummation could not be reached without so much intermediate strife as if she were contending for some chance where chance was none of happiness or were dreaming for a moment of escaping the inevitable why then did she contend knowing that she would reap nothing from answering her persecutors why did she not retire by silence from the superfluous contest it was because her quick and eager loyalty to truth would not suffer her to see it darkened by frauds which she could expose but others even of candid listeners perhaps could not it was through that imperishable grandeur of soul which taught her to submit meekly and without a struggle to her punishment but taught her not to submit no not for a moment to calumny as to facts or to misconstruction as to motives besides there were secretaries all around the court taking down her words that was meant for no good to her but the end does not always correspond to the meaning and joanna might say to herself these words that will be used against me tomorrow and the next day perhaps in some nobler generation may rise again for my justification yes joanna they are rising even now in paris and for more than justification woman sister there are some things which you do not execute as well as your brother man no nor ever will pardon me if i doubt whether you will ever produce a great poet from your choirs or a mozart or a phidias or a michael angelo or a great philosopher or a great scholar by which last is meant not one who depends simply on an infinite memory but also on an infinite and electrical power of combination bringing together from the four winds like the angel of the resurrection what else were dust from dead mens bones into the unity of breathing life if you can create yourselves into any of these great creators why have you not do not ask me to say otherwise because if you do you will lead me into temptation for i swore early in life never to utter a falsehood and above all a sycophantic falsehood and in the false homage of the modern press towards women there is horrible sycophancy it is as hollow most of it and it is as fleeting as is the love that lurks in uxoriousness yet if a woman asks me to tell a faleshood i have long made up my mind that on moral considerations i will and ought to do so whether it be for any purpose of glory to her or of screening her foibles for she does commit a few or of humbly as a vassal paying a peppercorn rent to her august privilege of caprice barring these cases i must adhere to my resolution of telling no fibs and i repeat therefore but not to be rude i repeat in latin excudent alii melis spirantia signa credo equidem vivos ducent de marmore vultus altius ascendent at tu caput eva memento sandalo ut infringas referenti oracula tanta yet sister woman though i cannot consent to find a mozart or a michael angelo in your sex until that day when you claim my promise as to falsehood cheerfully and with the love that burns in depths of admiration i acknowledge that you can do one thing as well as the best of us men a greater thing than even mozart is known to have done or michael angelo you can die grandly and as goddesses would die were goddesses mortal if any distant world which may be the case are so far ahead of us tellurians in optical resources as to see distinctly through their telescopes all that we do on earth what is the grandest sight to which we ever treat them st peters at rome do you fancy on easter sunday or luxor or perhaps the himalayas pooh pooh my friend suggest something better these are baubles to them they see in other worlds in their own far better toys of the same kind these take my word for it are nothing do you give it up the finest thing then we have to show them is a scaffold on the morning of execution i assure you there is a strong muster in those fair telescopic worlds on any such morning of those who happen to find themselves occupying the right hemisphere for a peep at us telescopes look up in the market on that morning and bear a monstrous premium for they cheat probably in those scientific worlds as well as we do how then if it be announced in some such telescopic world by those who make a livelihood of catching glimpses at our newspapers whose language they have long since deciphered that the poor victim in the mornings sacrifice is a woman how if it be published on that distant world that the sufferer wears upon her head in the eyes of many the garlands of martyrdom how if it should be some marie antoinette the widowed queen coming forward on the scaffold and presenting to the morning air her head turned gray prematurely by sorrow daughter of csars kneeling down humbly to kiss the guillotine as one that worships death how if it were the martyred wife of roland uttering impassioned truth truth odious to the rulers of her country with her expiring breath how if it were the noble charlotte corday that in the bloom of youth that with the loveliest of persons that with homage waiting upon her smiles wherever she turned her face to scatter them homage that followed those smiles as surely as the carols of birds after showers in spring follow the reappearing sun and the racing of sunbeams over the hills yet thought all these things cheaper than the dust upon her sandals in comparison of deliverance from hell for her dear suffering france ah these were spectacles indeed for those sympathizing people in distant worlds and some perhaps would suffer a sort of martyrdom themselves because they could not testify their wrath could not bear witness to the strength of love and to the fury of hatred that burned within them at such scenes could not gather into golden urns some of that glorious dust which rested in the catacombs of earth on the wednesday after trinity sunday in being then about nineteen years of age the maid of arc underwent her martyrdom she was conducted before midday guarded by eight hundred spearmen to a platform of prodigious height constructed of wooden billets supported by occasional walls of lath and plaster and traversed by hollow spaces in every direction for the creation of aircurrents the pile struck terror says m michelet by its height and as usual the english purpose in this is viewed as one of pure malignity but there are two ways of explaining all that it is probable that the purpose was merciful on the circumstances of the execution i shall not linger yet to mark the almost fatal felicity of m michelet in finding out whatever may injure the english name at a moment when every reader will be interested in joannas personal appearance it is really edifying to notice the ingenuity by which he draws into light from a dark corner a very unjust account of it and neglects though lying upon the high road a very pleasing one both are from english pens grafton a chronicler but little read being a stiffnecked john bull thought fit to say that no wonder joanna should be a virgin since her foule face was a satisfactory solution of that particular merit holinshead on the other hand a chronicler somewhat later every way more important and universally read has given a very pleasing testimony to the interesting character of joannas person and engaging manners neither of these men lived till the following century so that personally this evidence is none at all grafton sullenly and carelessly believed as he wished to believe holinshead took pains to inquire and reports undoubtedly the general impression of france but i cite the case as illustrating m michelets candor the circumstantial incidents of the execution unless with more space than i can now command i should be unwilling to relate i should fear to injure by imperfect report a martyrdom which to myself appears so unspeakably grand yet for a purpose pointing not at joanna but at m michelet viz to convince him that an englishman is capable of thinking more highly of la pucelle than even her admiring countryman i shall in parting allude to one or two traits in joannas demeanor on the scaffold and to one or two in that of the bystanders which authorize me in questioning an opinion of his upon this martyrs firmness the reader ought to be reminded that joanna darc was subjected to an unusually unfair trial of opinion any of the elder christian martyrs had not much to fear of personal rancor the martyr was chiefly regarded as the enemy of csar at times also where any knowledge of the christian faith and morals existed with the enmity that arises spontaneously in the worldly against the spiritual but the martyr though disloyal was not supposed to be therefore antinational and still less was individually hateful what was hated if anything belonged to his class not to himself separately now joanna if hated at all was hated personally and in rouen on national grounds hence there would be a certainty of calumny arising against her such as would not affect martyrs in general that being the case it would follow of necessity that some people would impute to her a willingness to recant no innocence could escape that now had she really testified this willingness on the scaffold it would have argued nothing at all but the weakness of a genial nature shrinking from the instant approach of torment and those will often pity that weakness most who in their own persons would yield to it least meantime there never was a calumny uttered that drew less support from the recorded circumstances it rests upon no positive testimony and it has a weight of contradicting testimony to stem and yet strange to say m michelet who at times seems to admire the maid of arc as much as i do is the one sole writer amongst her friends who lends some countenance to this odious slander his words are that if she did not utter this word recant with her lips she uttered it in her heart whether she said the word is uncertain but i affirm that she thought it now i affirm that she did not not in any sense of the word thought applicable to the case here is france calumniating la pucelle here is england defending her m michelet can only mean that on a priori principles every woman must be presumed liable to such a weakness that joanna was a woman ergo that she was liable to such a weakness that is he only supposes her to have uttered the word by an argument which presumes it impossible for anybody to have done otherwise i on the contrary throw the onus of the argument not on presumable tendencies of nature but on the known facts of that mornings execution as recorded by multitudes what else i demand than mere weight of metal absolute nobility of deportment broke the vast line of battle then arrayed against her what else but her meek saintly demeanor won from the enemies that till now had believed her a witch tears of rapturous admiration ten thousand men says m michelet himself ten thousand men wept and of these ten thousand the majority were political enemies knitted together by cords of superstition what else was it but her constancy united with her angelic gentleness that drove the fanatic english soldier who had sworn to throw a faggot on her scaffold as his tribute of abhorrence that did so that fulfilled his vow suddenly to turn away a penitent for life saying everywhere that he had seen a dove rising upon wings to heaven from the ashes where she had stood what else drove the executioner to kneel at every shrine for pardon to his share in the tragedy and if all this were insufficient then i cite the closing act of her life as valid on her behalf were all other testimonies against her the executioner had been directed to apply his torch from below he did so the fiery smoke rose upwards in billowing volumes a dominican monk was then standing almost at her side wrapt up in his sublime office he saw not the danger but still persisted in his prayers even then when the last enemy was racing up the fiery stairs to seize her even at that moment did this noblest of girls think only for him the one friend that would not forsake her and not for herself bidding him with her last breath to care for his own preservation but to leave her to god that girl whose latest breath ascended in this sublime expression of selfoblivion did not utter the word recant either with her lips or in her heart no she did not though one should rise from the dead to swear it bishop of beauvais thy victim died in fire upon a scaffold thou upon a down bed but for the departing minutes of life both are oftentimes alike at the farewell crisis when the gates of death are opening and flesh is resting from its struggles oftentimes the tortured and the torturer have the same truce from carnal torment both sink together into sleep together both sometimes kindle into dreams when the mortal mists were gathering fast upon you two bishop and shepherd girl when the pavilions of life were closing up their shadowy curtains about you let us try through the gigantic glooms to decipher the flying features of your separate visions the shepherd girl that had delivered france she from her dungeon she from her baiting at the stake she from her duel with fire as she entered her last dream saw domrmy saw the fountain of domrmy saw the pomp of forests in which her childhood had wandered that easter festival which man had denied to her languishing heart that resurrection of springtime which the darkness of dungeons had intercepted from her hungering after the glorious liberty of forests were by god given back into her hands as jewels that had been stolen from her by robbers with those perhaps for the minutes of dreams can stretch into ages was given back to her by god the bliss of childhood by special privilege for her might be created in this farewell dream a second childhood innocent as the first but not like that sad with the gloom of a fearful mission in the rear this mission had now been fulfilled the storm was weathered the skirts even of that mighty storm were drawing off the blood that she was to reckon for had been exacted the tears that she was to shed in secret had been paid to the last the hatred to herself in all eyes had been faced steadily had been suffered had been survived and in her last fight upon the scaffold she had triumphed gloriously victoriously she had tasted the stings of death for all except this comfort from her farewell dream she had died died amidst the tears of ten thousand enemies died amidst the drums and trumpets of armies died amidst peals redoubling upon peals volleys upon volleys from the saluting clarions of martyrs bishop of beauvais because the guiltburthened man is in dreams haunted and waylaid by the most frightful of his crimes and because upon that fluctuating mirror rising like the mocking mirrors of mirage in arabian deserts from the fens of death most of all are reflected the sweet countenances which the man has laid in ruins therefore i know bishop that you also entering your final dream saw domrmy that fountain of which the witnesses spoke so much showed itself to your eyes in pure morning dews but neither dews nor the holy dawn could cleanse away the bright spots of innocent blood upon its surface by the fountain bishop you saw a woman seated that hid her face but as you draw near the woman raises her wasted features would domrmy know them again for the features of her child ah but you know them bishop well oh mercy what a groan was that which the servants waiting outside the bishops dream at his bedside heard from his laboring heart as at this moment he turned away from the fountain and the woman seeking rest in the forests afar off yet not so to escape the woman whom once again he must behold before he dies in the forests to which he prays for pity will he find a respite what a tumult what a gathering of feet is there in glades where only wild deer should run armies and nations are assembling towering in the fluctuating crowd are phantoms that belong to departed hours there is the great english prince regent of france there is my lord of winchester the princely cardinal that died and made no sign there is the bishop of beauvais clinging to the shelter of thickets what building is that which hands so rapid are raising is it a martyrs scaffold will they burn the child of domrmy a second time no it is a tribunal that rises to the clouds and two nations stand around it waiting for a trial shall my lord of beauvais sit again upon the judgmentseat and again number the hours for the innocent ah no he is the prisoner at the bar already all is waiting the mighty audience is gathered the court is hurrying to their seats the witnesses are arrayed the trumpets are sounding the judge is going to take his place oh but this is sudden my lord have you no counsel counsel i have none in heaven above or on earth beneath counsellor there is none now that would take a brief from me all are silent is it indeed come to this alas the time is short the tumult is wondrous the crowd stretches away into infinity but yet i will search in it for somebody to take your brief i know of somebody that will be your counsel who is this that cometh from domrmy who is she that cometh in bloody coronation robes from rheims who is she that cometh with blackened flesh from walking the furnaces of rouen this is she the shepherd girl counsellor that had none for herself whom i choose bishop for yours she it is i engage that shall take my lords brief she it is bishop that would plead for you yes bishop she when heaven and earth are silent notes note arc modern france that should know a great deal better than myself insists that the name is not darc ie of arc but darc now it happens sometimes that if a person whose position guarantees his access to the best information will content himself with gloomy dogmatism striking the table with his fist and saying in a terrific voice it is so and theres an end of it one bows deferentially and submits but if unhappily for himself won by this docility he relents too amiably into reasons and arguments probably one raises an insurrection against him that may never be crushed for in the fields of logic one can skirmish perhaps as well as he had he confined himself to dogmatism he would have entrenched his position in darkness and have hidden his own vulnerable points but coming down to base reasons he lets in light and one sees where to plant the blows now the worshipful reason of modern france for disturbing the old received spelling is that jean hordal a descendant of la pucelles brother spelled the name darc in but what of that beside the chances that m hordal might be a gigantic blockhead it is notorious that what small matter of spelling providence had thought fit to disburse amongst man in the seventeenth century was all monopolized by printers in france much more so note those that share thy blood a collateral relative of joannas was subsequently ennobled by the title of du lys note jean m michelet asserts that there was a mystical meaning at that era in calling a child jean it implied a secret commendation of a child if not a dedication to st john the evangelist the beloved disciple the apostle of love and mysterious visions but really as the name was so exceedingly common few people will detect a mystery in calling a boy by the name of jack though it does seem mysterious to call a girl jack it may be less so in france where a beautiful practice has always prevailed of giving to a boy his mothers name preceded and strengthened by a male name as charles anne victor victoire in cases where a mothers memory has been unusually dear to a son this vocal memento of her locked into the circle of his own name gives to it the tenderness of a testamentary relique or a funeral ring i presume therefore that la pacelle must have borne the baptismal names of jeanne jean the latter with no reference to so sublime a person as st john but simply to some relative note and reminding one of that inscription so justly admired by paul richtor which a russian czarina placed on a guidepost near moscow this is the road that leads to constantinople note yes old very old phrase not as ignoramuses fancy a phrase recently minted by a repealer in ireland note our sisters are always rather uneasy when we say anything of them in latin or greek it is like giving sealed orders to a sea captain which he is not to open for his life till he comes into a certain latitude which latitude perhaps he never will come into and thus may miss the secret till he is going to the bottom generally i acknowledge that it is not polite before our female friends to cite a single word of latin without instantly translating it but in this particular case where i am only iterating a disagreeable truth they will please to recollect that the politeness lies in not translating however if they insist absolutely on knowing this very night before going to bed what it is that those illlooking lines contain i refer them to drydens virgil somewhere in the th book of the neid except as to the closing line and a half which contain a private suggestion of my own to discontented nymphs anxious to see the equilibrium of advantages reestablished between the two sexes note amongst the many ebullitions of m michelets fury against us poor english are four which will be likely to amuse the reader and they are the more conspicuous in collision with the justice which he sometimes does us and the very indignant admiration which under some aspects he grants to us our english literature he admires with some gnashing of teeth he pronounces it fine and sombre but i lament to add sceptical judaic satanic in a word antichristian that lord byron should figure as a member of this diabolical corporation will not surprise men it will surprise them to hear that milton is one of its satanic leaders many are the generous and eloquent frenchmen beside chateaubriand who have in the course of the last thirty years nobly suspended their own burning nationality in order to render a more rapturous homage at the feet of milton and some of them have raised milton almost to a level with angelic natures not one of them has thought of looking for him below the earth as to shakspeare m michelet detects in him a most extraordinary mares nest it is this he does not recollect to have seen the name of god in any part of his works on reading such words it is natural to rub ones eyes and suspect that all one has ever seen in this world may have been a pure ocular delusion in particular i begin myself to suspect that the word la gloire never occurs in any parisian journal the great english nation says m michelet has one immense profound vice to wit pride why really that may be true but we have a neighbor not absolutely clear of an immense profound vice as like ours in color and shape as cherry to cherry in short m michelet thinks us by fits and starts admirable only that we are detestable and he would adore some of our authors were it not that so intensely he could have wished to kick them m michelet thinks to lodge an arrow in our sides by a very odd remark upon thomas kempis which is that a man of any conceivable european blood a finlander suppose or a zantiote might have written tom only not an englishman whether an englishman could have forged tom must remain a matter of doubt unless the thing had been tried long ago that problem was intercepted for ever by toms perverseness in choosing to manufacture himself yet since nobody is better aware than m michelet that this very point of kempis having manufactured kempis is furiously and hopelessly litigated three or four nations claiming to have forged his work for him the shocking old doubt will raise its snaky head once more whether this forger who rests in so much darkness might not after all be of english blood tom it may be feared is known to modern english literature chiefly by an irreverent mention of his name in a line of peter pindars dr wolcot fifty years back where he is described as kempis tom who clearly shows the way to kingdom come few in these days can have read him unless in the methodist version of john wesley amongst those few however happens to be myself which arose from the accident of having when a boy of eleven received a copy of the de imitatione christi as a bequest from a relation who died very young from which cause and from the external prettiness of the book being a glasgow reprint by the celebrated foulis and gaily bound i was induced to look into it and finally read it many times over partly out of some sympathy which even in those days i had with its simplicity and devotional fervor but much more from the savage delight i found in laughing at toms latinity that i freely grant to m michelet is inimitable else as regards substance it strikes me that i could forge a better de imitatione myself but there is no knowing till one tries yet after all it is not certain whether the original was latin but however that may have been if it is possible that m micheleta can be accurate in saying that there are no less than sixty french versions not editions observe but separate versions existing of the de imitatione how prodigious must have been the adaptation of the book to the religious heart of the fifteenth century excepting the bible but excepting that only in protestant lands no book known to man has had the same distinction it is the most marvellous bibliographical fact on record footnote a if m michelet can be accurate however on consideration this statement does not depend on michelet the bibliographer barbier has absolutely specified sixty in a separate dissertation soixante traductions amongst those even that have not escaped the search the italian translations are said to be thirty as to mere editions not counting the early mss for half a century before printing was introduced those in latin amount to two thousand and those in french to one thousand meantime it is very clear to me that this astonishing popularity so entirely unparalleled in literature could not have existed except in roman catholic times nor subsequently have lingered in any protestant land it was the denial of scripture fountains to thirsty lands which made this slender rill of scripture truth so passionately welcome our english girls it seems are as faulty in one way as we english males in another none of us lads could have written the opera omnia of mr kempis neither could any of our lasses have assumed male attire like la pucelle but why because says michelet english girls and german think so much of an indecorum well that is a good fault generally speaking but m michelet ought to have remembered a fact in the martyrologies which justifies both parties the french heroine for doing and the general choir of english girls for not doing a female saint specially renowned in france had for a reason as weighty as joannas viz expressly to shield her modesty amongst men wore a male military harness that reason and that example authorized la pucelle but our english girls as a body have seldom any such reason and certainly no such saintly example to plead this excuses them yet still if it is indispensable to the national character that our young women should now and then trespass over the frontier of decorum it then becomes a patriotic duty in me to assure m michelet that we have such ardent females amongst us and in a long series some detected in naval hospitals when too sick to remember their disguise some on fields of battle multitudes never detected at all some only suspected and others discharged without noise by war offices and other absurd people in our navy both royal and commercial and generally from deep remembrances of slighted love women have sometimes served in disguise for many years taking contentedly their daily allowance of burgoo biscuit or cannon balls anything in short digestible or indigestible that it might please providence to send one thing at least is to their credit never any of these poor masks with their deep silent remembrances have been detected through murmuring or what is nautically understood by skulking so for once m michelet has an erratum to enter upon the flyleaf of his book in presentation copies but the last of these ebullitions is the most lively we english at orleans and after orleans which is not quite so extraordinary if all were told fled before the maid of arc yes says m michelet you did deny it if you can deny it my dear i dont mean to deny it running away in many cases is a thing so excellent that no philosopher would at times condescend to adopt any other step all of us nations in europe without one exception have shown our philosophy in that way at times even people qui ne se rendent pas have deigned both to run and to shout sauve qui pent at odd times of sunset though for my part i have no pleasure in recalling unpleasant remembrances to brave men and yet really being so philosophic they ought not to be unpleasant but the amusing feature in m michelets reproach is the way in which he improves and varies against us the charge of running as if he were singing a catch listen to him they showed their backs did these english hip hip hurrah three times three behind good walls they let themselves be taken hip hip nine times nine they ran as fast as their legs could carry them hurrah twentyseven times twentyseven they ran before a girl they did hurrah eightyone times eightyone this reminds one of criminal indictments on the old model in english courts where for fear the prisoner should escape the crown lawyer varied the charge perhaps through forty counts the law laid its guns so as to rake the accused at every possible angle whilst the indictment was reading he seemed a monster of crime in his own eyes and yet after all the poor fellow had but committed one offence and not always that nb not having the french original at hand i make my quotations from a friends copy of mr walter kellys translation which seems to me faithful spirited and idiomatically english liable in fact only to the single reproach of occasional provincialisms the english mailcoach or the glory of motion some twenty or more years before i matriculated at oxford mr palmer mp for bath had accomplished two things very hard to do on our little planet the earth however cheap they may happen to be held by the eccentric people in comets he had invented mailcoaches and he had married the daughter of a duke he was therefore just twice as great a man as galileo who certainly invented or discovered the satellites of jupiter those very next things extant to mailcoaches in the two capital points of speed and keeping time but who did not marry the daughter of a duke these mailcoaches as organized by mr palmer are entitled to a circumstantial notice from myself having had so large a share in developing the anarchies of my subsequent dreams an agency which they accomplished first through velocity at that time unprecedented they first revealed the glory of motion suggesting at the same time an undersense not unpleasurable of possible though indefinite danger secondly through grand effects for the eye between lamplight and the darkness upon solitary roads thirdly through animal beauty and power so often displayed in the class of horses selected for this mail service fourthly through the conscious presence of a central intellect that in the midst of vast distances of storms of darkness of night overruled all obstacles into one steady coperation in a national result to my own feeling this postoffice service recalled some mighty orchestra where a thousand instruments all disregarding each other and so far in danger of discord yet all obedient as slaves to the supreme baton of some great leader terminate in a perfection of harmony like that of heart veins and arteries in a healthy animal organization but finally that particular element in this whole combination which most impressed myself and through which it is that to this hour mr palmers mailcoach system tyrannizes by terror and terrific beauty over my dreams lay in the awful political mission which at that time it fulfilled the mailcoaches it was that distributed over the face of the land like the opening of apocalyptic vials the heartshaking news of trafalgar of salamanca of vittoria of waterloo these were the harvests that in the grandeur of their reaping redeemed the tears and blood in which they had been sown neither was the meanest peasant so much below the grandeur and the sorrow of the times as to confound these battles which were gradually moulding the destinies of christendom with the vulgar conflicts of ordinary warfare which are oftentimes but gladiatorial trials of national prowess the victories of england in this stupendous contest rose of themselves as natural te deums to heaven and it was felt by the thoughtful that such victories at such a crisis of general prostration were not more beneficial to ourselves than finally to france and to the nations of western and central europe through whose pusillanimity it was that the french domination had prospered the mailcoach as the national organ for publishing these mighty events became itself a spiritualized and glorified object to an impassioned heart and naturally in the oxford of that day all hearts were awakened there were perhaps of us gownsmen two thousand resident in oxford and dispersed through fiveandtwenty colleges in some of these the custom permitted the student to keep what are called short terms that is the four terms of michaelmas lent easter and act were kept severally by a residence in the aggregate of ninetyone days or thirteen weeks under this interrupted residence accordingly it was possible that a student might have a reason for going down to his home four times in the year this made eight journeys to and fro and as these homes lay dispersed through all the shires of the island and most of us disdained all coaches except his majestys mail no city out of london could pretend to so extensive a connection with mr palmers establishment as oxford naturally therefore it became a point of some interest with us whose journeys revolved every six weeks on an average to look a little into the executive details of the system with some of these mr palmer had no concern they rested upon byelaws not unreasonable enacted by postinghouses for their own benefit and upon others equally stern enacted by the inside passengers for the illustration of their own exclusiveness these last were of a nature to rouse our scorn from which the transition was not very long to mutiny up to this time it had been the fixed assumption of the four inside people as an old tradition of all public carriages from the reign of charles ii that they the illustrious quaternion constituted a porcelain variety of the human race whose dignity would have been compromised by exchanging one word of civility with the three miserable delf ware outsides even to have kicked an outsider might have been held to attaint the foot concerned in that operation so that perhaps it would have required an act of parliament to restore its purity of blood what words then could express the horror and the sense of treason in that case which had happened where all three outsides the trinity of pariahs made a vain attempt to sit down at the same breakfast table or dinner table with the consecrated four i myself witnessed such an attempt and on that occasion a benevolent old gentleman endeavored to soothe his three holy associates by suggesting that if the outsides were indicted for this criminal attempt at the next assizes the court would regard it as a case of lunacy or delirium tremens rather than of treason england owes much of her grandeur to the depth of the aristocratic element in her social composition i am not the man to laugh at it but sometimes it expressed itself in extravagant shapes the course taken with the infatuated outsiders in the particular attempt which i have noticed was that the waiter beckoning them away from the privileged sallemanger sang out this way my good men and then enticed them away off to the kitchen but that plan had not always answered sometimes though very rarely cases occurred where the intruders being stronger than usual or more vicious than usual resolutely refused to move and so far carried their point as to have a separate table arranged for themselves in a corner of the room yet if an indian screen could be found ample enough to plant them out from the very eyes of the high table or dais it then became possible to assume as a fiction of law that the three delf fellows after all were not present they could be ignored by the porcelain men under the maxim that objects not appearing and not existing are governed by the same logical construction such now being at that time the usages of mailcoaches what was to be done by us of young oxford we the most aristocratic of people who were addicted to the practice of looking down superciliously even upon the insides themselves as often very suspicious characters were we voluntarily to court indignities if our dress and bearing sheltered us generally from the suspicion of being raff the name at that period for snobs we really were such constructively by the place we assumed if we did not submit to the deep shadow of eclipse we entered at least the skirts of its penumbra and the analogy of theatres was urged against us where no man can complain of the annoyances incident to the pit or gallery having his instant remedy in paying the higher price of the boxes but the soundness of this analogy we disputed in the case of the theatre it cannot be pretended that the inferior situations have any separate attractions unless the pit suits the purpose of the dramatic reporter but the reporter or critic is a rarity for most people the sole benefit is in the price whereas on the contrary the outside of the mail had its own incommunicable advantages these we could not forego the higher price we should willingly have paid but that was connected with the condition of riding inside which was insufferable the air the freedom of prospect the proximity to the horses the elevation of seat these were what we desired but above all the certain anticipation of purchasing occasional opportunities of driving under coercion of this great practical difficulty we instituted a searching inquiry into the true quality and valuation of the different apartments about the mail we conducted this inquiry on metaphysical principles and it was ascertained satisfactorily that the roof of the coach which some had affected to call the attics and some the garrets was really the drawingroom and the box was the chief ottoman or sofa in that drawingroom whilst it appeared that the inside which had been traditionally regarded as the only room tenantable by gentlemen was in fact the coalcellar in disguise great wits jump the very same idea had not long before struck the celestial intellect of china amongst the presents carried out by our first embassy to that country was a statecoach it had been specially selected as a personal gift by george iii but the exact mode of using it was a mystery to pekin the ambassador indeed lord macartney had made some dim and imperfect explanations upon the point but as his excellency communicated these in a diplomatic whisper at the very moment of his departure the celestial mind was very feebly illuminated and it became necessary to call a cabinet council on the grand state question where was the emperor to sit the hammercloth happened to be unusually gorgeous and partly on that consideration but partly also because the box offered the most elevated seat and undeniably went foremost it was resolved by acclamation that the box was the imperial place and for the scoundrel who drove he might sit where he could find a perch the horses therefore being harnessed under a flourish of music and a salute of guns solemnly his imperial majesty ascended his new english throne having the first lord of the treasury on his right hand and the chief jester on his left pekin gloried in the spectacle and in the whole flowery people constructively present by representation there was but one discontented person which was the coachman this mutinous individual looking as blackhearted as he really was audaciously shouted where am i to sit but the privy council incensed by his disloyalty unanimously opened the door and kicked him into the inside he had all the inside places to himself but such is the rapacity of ambition that he was still dissatisfied i say he cried out in an extempore petition addressed to the emperor through the window how am i to catch hold of the reins any how was the answer dont trouble me man in my glory through the windows through the keyholes how you please finally this contumacious coachman lengthened the checkstrings into a sort of juryreins communicating with the horses with these he drove as steadily as may be supposed the emperor returned after the briefest of circuits he descended in great pomp from his throne with the severest resolution never to remount it a public thanksgiving was ordered for his majestys prosperous escape from the disease of a broken neck and the statecoach was dedicated for ever as a votive offering to the god fo fo whom the learned more accurately called fi fi a revolution of this same chinese character did young oxford of that era effect in the constitution of mailcoach society it was a perfect french revolution and we had good reason to say ca ira in fact it soon became too popular the public a well known character particularly disagreeable though slightly respectable and notorious for affecting the chief seats in synagogues had at first loudly opposed this revolution but when the opposition showed itself to be ineffectual our disagreeable friend went into it with headlong zeal at first it was a sort of race between us and as the public is usually above thirty say generally from thirty to fifty years old naturally we of young oxford that averaged about twenty had the advantage then the public took to bribing giving fees to horsekeepers c who hired out their persons as warmingpans on the boxseat that you know was shocking to our moral sensibilities come to bribery we observed and there is an end to all morality aristotles ciceros or anybodys and besides of what use was it for we bribed also and as our bribes to those of the public being demonstrated out of euclid to be as five shillings to sixpence here again young oxford had the advantage but the contest was ruinous to the principles of the stable establishment about the mails the whole corporation was constantly bribed rebribed and often surrebribed so that a horsekeeper ostler or helper was held by the philosophical at that time to be the most corrupt character in the nation there was an impression upon the public mind natural enough from the continually augmenting velocity of the mail but quite erroneous that an outside seat on this class of carriages was a post of danger on the contrary i maintained that if a man had become nervous from some gipsey prediction in his childhood allocating to a particular moon now approaching some unknown danger and he should inquire earnestly whither can i go for shelter is a prison the safest retreat or a lunatic hospital or the british museum i should have replied oh no ill tell you what to do take lodgings for the next forty days on the box of his majestys mail nobody can touch you there if it is by bills at ninety days after date that you are made unhappy if noters and protesters are the sort of wretches whose astrological shadows darken the house of life then note you what i vehemently protest viz that no matter though the sheriff in every county should be running after you with his posse touch a hair of your head he cannot whilst you keep house and have your legal domicile on the box of the mail its felony to stop the mail even the sheriff cannot do that and an extra no great matter if it grazes the sheriff touch of the whip to the leaders at any time guarantees your safety in fact a bedroom in a quiet house seems a safe enough retreat yet it is liable to its own notorious nuisances to robbers by night to rats to fire but the mail laughs at these terrors to robbers the answer is packed up and ready for delivery in the barrel of the guards blunderbuss rats again there are none about mailcoaches any more than snakes in van troils iceland except indeed now and then a parliamentary rat who always hides his shame in the coal cellar and as to fire i never knew but one in a mailcoach which was in the exeter mail and caused by an obstinate sailor bound to devonport jack making light of the law and the lawgiver that had set their faces against his offence insisted on taking up a forbidden seat in the rear of the roof from which he could exchange his own yarns with those of the guard no greater offence was then known to mailcoaches it was treason it was lsa majestas it was by tendency arson and the ashes of jacks pipe falling amongst the straw of the hinder boot containing the mailbags raised a flame which aided by the wind of our motion threatened a revolution in the republic of letters but even this left the sanctity of the box unviolated in dignified repose the coachman and myself sat on resting with benign composure upon our knowledge that the fire would have to burn its way through four inside passengers before it could reach ourselves with a quotation rather too trite i remarked to the coachman jam proximus ardet ucalegon but recollecting that the virgilian part of his education might have been neglected i interpreted so far as to say that perhaps at that moment the flames were catching hold of our worthy brother and nextdoor neighbor ucalegon the coachman said nothing but by his faint sceptical smile he seemed to be thinking that he knew better for that in fact ucalegon as it happened was not in the waybill no dignity is perfect which does not at some point ally itself with the indeterminate and mysterious the connection of the mail with the state and the executive government a connection obvious but yet not strictly defined gave to the whole mail establishment a grandeur and an official authority which did us service on the roads and invested us with seasonable terrors but perhaps these terrors were not the less impressive because their exact legal limits were imperfectly ascertained look at those turnpike gates with what deferential hurry with what an obedient start they fly open at our approach look at that long line of carts and carters ahead audaciously usurping the very crest of the road ah traitors they do not hear us as yet but as soon as the dreadful blast of our horn reaches them with the proclamation of our approach see with what frenzy of trepidation they fly to their horses heads and deprecate our wrath by the precipitation of their craneneck quarterings treason they feel to be their crime each individual carter feels himself under the ban of confiscation and attainder his blood is attainted through six generations and nothing is wanting but the headsman and his axe the block and the sawdust to close up the vista of his horrors what shall it be within benefit of clergy to delay the kings message on the high road to interrupt the great respirations ebb or flood of the national intercourse to endanger the safety of tidings running day and night between all nations and languages or can it be fancied amongst the weakest of men that the bodies of the criminals will be given up to their widows for christian burial now the doubts which were raised as to our powers did more to wrap them in terror by wrapping them in uncertainty than could have been effected by the sharpest definitions of the law from the quarter sessions we on our parts we the collective mail i mean did our utmost to exalt the idea of our privileges by the insolence with which we wielded them whether this insolence rested upon law that gave it a sanction or upon conscious power haughtily dispensing with that sanction equally it spoke from a potential station and the agent in each particular insolence of the moment was viewed reverentially as one having authority sometimes after breakfast his majestys mail would become frisky and in its difficult wheelings amongst the intricacies of early markets it would upset an apple cart a cart loaded with eggs c huge was the affliction and dismay awful was the smash though after all i believe the damage might be levied upon the hundred i as far as possible endeavored in such a case to represent the conscience and moral sensibilities of the mail and when wildernesses of eggs were lying poached under our horses hoofs then would i stretch forth my hands in sorrow saying in words too celebrated in those days from the false echoes of marengo ah wherefore have we not time to weep over you which was quite impossible for in fact we had not even time to laugh over them tied to postoffice time with an allowance in some cases of fifty minutes for eleven miles could the royal mail pretend to undertake the offices of sympathy and condolence could it be expected to provide tears for the accidents of the road if even it seemed to trample on humanity it did so i contended in discharge of its own more peremptory duties upholding the morality of the mail fortiori i upheld its rights i stretched to the uttermost its privilege of imperial precedency and astonished weak minds by the feudal powers which i hinted to be lurking constructively in the charters of this proud establishment once i remember being on the box of the holyhead mail between shrewsbury and oswestry when a tawdry thing from birmingham some tallyho or highflier all flaunting with green and gold came up alongside of us what a contrast to our royal simplicity of form and color is this plebeian wretch the single ornament on our dark ground of chocolate color was the mighty shield of the imperial arms but emblazoned in proportions as modest as a signetring bears to a seal of office even this was displayed only on a single panel whispering rather than proclaiming our relations to the state whilst the beast from birmingham had as much writing and painting on its sprawling flanks as would have puzzled a decipherer from the tombs of luxor for some time this birmingham machine ran along by our side a piece of familiarity that seemed to us sufficiently jacobinical but all at once a movement of the horses announced a desperate intention of leaving us behind do you see that i said to the coachman i see was his short answer he was awake yet he waited longer than seemed prudent for the horses of our audacious opponent had a disagreeable air of freshness and power but his motive was loyal his wish was that the birmingham conceit should be fullblown before he froze it when that seemed ripe he unloosed or to speak by a stronger image he sprang his known resources he slipped our royal horses like cheetas or hunting leopards after the affrighted game how they could retain such a reserve of fiery power after the work they had accomplished seemed hard to explain but on our side besides the physical superiority was a tower of strength namely the kings name which they upon the adverse faction wanted passing them without an effort as it seemed we threw them into the rear with so lengthening an interval between us as proved in itself the bitterest mockery of their presumption whilst our guard blew back a shattering blast of triumph that was really too painfully full of derision i mention this little incident for its connection with what followed a welshman sitting behind me asked if i had not felt my heart burn within me during the continuance of the race i said no because we were not racing with a mail so that no glory could be gained in fact it was sufficiently mortifying that such a birmingham thing should dare to challenge us the welshman replied that he didnt see that for that a cat might look at a king and a brummagem coach might lawfully race the holyhead mail race us perhaps i replied though even that has an air of sedition but not beat us this would have been treason and for its own sake i am glad that the tallyho was disappointed so dissatisfied did the welshman seem with this opinion that at last i was obliged to tell him a very fine story from one of our elder dramatists viz that once in some oriental region when the prince of all the land with his splendid court were flying their falcons a hawk suddenly flew at a majestic eagle and in defiance of the eagles prodigious advantages in sight also of all the astonished field sportsmen spectators and followers killed him on the spot the prince was struck with amazement at the unequal contest and with burning admiration for its unparalleled result he commanded that the hawk should be brought before him caressed the bird with enthusiasm and ordered that for the commemoration of his matchless courage a crown of gold should be solemnly placed on the hawks head but then that immediately after this coronation the bird should be led off to execution as the most valiant indeed of traitors but not the less a traitor that had dared to rise in rebellion against his liege lord the eagle now said i to the welshman how painful it would have been to you and me as men of refined feelings that this poor brute the tallyho in the impossible case of a victory over us should have been crowned with jewellery gold with birmingham ware or paste diamonds and then led off to instant execution the welshman doubted if that could be warranted by law and when i hinted at the th of edward iii chap for regulating the precedency of coaches as being probably the statute relied on for the capital punishment of such offences he replied drily that if the attempt to pass a mail was really treasonable it was a pity that the tallyho appeared to have so imperfect an acquaintance with law these were among the gaieties of my earliest and boyish acquaintance with mails but alike the gayest and the most terrific of my experiences rose again after years of slumber armed with preternatural power to shake my dreaming sensibilities sometimes as in the slight case of miss fanny on the bath road which i will immediately mention through some casual or capricious association with images originally gay yet opening at some stage of evolution into sudden capacities of horror sometimes through the more natural and fixed alliances with the sense of power so various lodged in the mail system the modern modes of travelling cannot compare with the mailcoach system in grandeur and power they boast of more velocity but not however as a consciousness but as a fact of our lifeless knowledge resting upon alien evidence as for instance because somebody says that we have gone fifty miles in the hour or upon the evidence of a result as that actually we find ourselves in york four hours after leaving london apart from such an assertion or such a result i am little aware of the pace but seated on the old mailcoach we needed no evidence out of ourselves to indicate the velocity on this system the word was non magna loquimur as upon railways but magna vivimus the vital experience of the glad animal sensibilities made doubts impossible on the question of our speed we heard our speed we saw it we felt it as a thrilling and this speed was not the product of blind insensate agencies that had no sympathy to give but was incarnated in the fiery eyeballs of an animal in his dilated nostril spasmodic muscles and echoing hoofs this speed was incarnated in the visible contagion amongst brutes of some impulse that radiating into their natures had yet its centre and beginning in man the sensibility of the horse uttering itself in the maniac light of his eye might be the last vibration of such a movement the glory of salamanca might be the first but the intervening link that connected them that spread the earthquake of the battle into the eyeball of the horse was the heart of man kindling in the rapture of the fiery strife and then propagating its own tumults by motions and gestures to the sympathies more or less dim in his servant the horse but now on the new system of travelling iron tubes and boilers have disconnected mans heart from the ministers of his locomotion nile nor trafalgar has power any more to raise an extra bubble in a steamkettle the galvanic cycle is broken up for ever mans imperial nature no longer sends itself forward through the electric sensibility of the horse the interagencies are gone in the mode of communication between the horse and his master out of which grew so many aspects of sublimity under accidents of mists that hid or sudden blazes that revealed of mobs that agitated or midnight solitudes that awed tidings fitted to convulse all nations must henceforwards travel by culinary process and the trumpet that once announced from afar the laurelled mail heartshaking when heard screaming on the wind and advancing through the darkness to every village or solitary house on its route has now given way for ever to the potwallopings of the boiler thus have perished multiform openings for sublime effects for interesting personal communications for revelations of impressive faces that could not have offered themselves amongst the hurried and fluctuating groups of a railway station the gatherings of gazers about a mailcoach had one centre and acknowledged only one interest but the crowds attending at a railway station have as little unity as running water and own as many centres as there are separate carriages in the train how else for example than as a constant watcher for the dawn and for the london mail that in summer months entered about dawn into the lawny thickets of marlborough forest couldst thou sweet fanny of the bath road have become known to myself yet fanny as the loveliest young woman for face and person that perhaps in my whole life i have beheld merited the station which even her i could not willingly have spared yet thirtyfive years later she holds in my dreams and though by an accident of fanciful caprice she brought along with her into those dreams a troop of dreadful creatures fabulous and not fabulous that were more abominable to a human heart than fanny and the dawn were delightful miss fanny of the bath road strictly speaking lived at a miles distance from that road but came so continually to meet the mail that i on my frequent transits rarely missed her and naturally connected her name with the great thoroughfare where i saw her i do not exactly know but i believe with some burthen of commissions to be executed in bath her own residence being probably the centre to which these commissions gathered the mail coachman who wore the royal livery being one amongst the privileged few happened to be fannys grandfather a good man he was that loved his beautiful granddaughter and loving her wisely was vigilant over her deportment in any case where young oxford might happen to be concerned was i then vain enough to imagine that i myself individually could fall within the line of his terrors certainly not as regarded any physical pretensions that i could plead for fanny as a chance passenger from her own neighborhood once told me counted in her train a hundred and ninetynine professed admirers if not open aspirants to her favor and probably not one of the whole brigade but excelled myself in personal advantages ulysses even with the unfair advantage of his accursed bow could hardly have undertaken that amount of suitors so the danger might have seemed slight only that woman is universally aristocratic it is amongst her nobilities of heart that she is so now the aristocratic distinctions in my favor might easily with miss fanny have compensated my physical deficiencies did i then make love to fanny why yes mais oui donc as much love as one can make whilst the mail is changing horses a process which ten years later did not occupy above eighty seconds but then viz about waterloo it occupied five times eighty now four hundred seconds offer a field quite ample enough for whispering into a young womans ear a great deal of truth and by way of parenthesis some trifle of falsehood grandpapa did right therefore to watch me and yet as happens too often to the grandpapas of earth in a contest with the admirers of granddaughters how vainly would he have watched me had i meditated any evil whispers to fanny she it is my belief would have protected herself against any mans evil suggestions but he as the result showed could not have intercepted the opportunities for such suggestions yet he was still active he was still blooming blooming he was as fanny herself say all our praises why should lords no thats not the line say all our roses why should girls engross the coachman showed rosy blossoms on his face deeper even than his granddaughters his being drawn from the ale cask fannys from youth and innocence and from the fountains of the dawn but in spite of his blooming face some infirmities he had and one particularly i am very sure no more than one in which he too much resembled a crocodile this lay in a monstrous inaptitude for turning round the crocodile i presume owes that inaptitude to the absurd length of his back but in our grandpapa it arose rather from the absurd breadth of his back combined probably with some growing stiffness in his legs now upon this crocodile infirmity of his i planted an easy opportunity for tendering my homage to miss fanny in defiance of all his honorable vigilance no sooner had he presented to us his mighty jovian back what a field for displaying to mankind his royal scarlet whilst inspecting professionally the buckles the straps and the silver turrets of his harness than i raised miss fannys hand to my lips and by the mixed tenderness and respectfulness of my manner caused her easily to understand how happy it would have made me to rank upon her list as no or in which case a few casualties amongst her lovers and observe they hanged liberally in those days might have promoted me speedily to the top of the tree as on the other hand with how much loyalty of submission i acquiesced in her allotment supposing that she had seen reason to plant me in the very rearward of her favor as no it must not be supposed that i allowed any trace of jest or even of playfulness to mingle with these expressions of my admiration that would have been insulting to her and would have been false as regarded my own feelings in fact the utter shadowyness of our relations to each other even after our meetings through seven or eight years had been very numerous but of necessity had been very brief being entirely on mailcoach allowance timid in reality by the general postoffice and watched by a crocodile belonging to the antepenultimate generation left it easy for me to do a thing which few people ever can have done viz to make love for seven years at the same time to be as sincere as ever creature was and yet never to compromise myself by overtures that might have been foolish as regarded my own interests or misleading as regarded hers most truly i loved this beautiful and ingenuous girl and had it not been for the bath and bristol mail heaven only knows what might have come of it people talk of being over head and ears in love now the mail was the cause that i sank only over ears in love which you know still left a trifle of brain to overlook the whole conduct of the affair i have mentioned the case at all for the sake of a dreadful result from it in after years of dreaming but it seems ex abundanti to yield this moral viz that as in england the idiot and the halfwit are held to be under the guardianship of chancery so the man making love who is often but a variety of the same imbecile class ought to be made a ward of the general postoffice whose severe course of timing and periodical interruption might intercept many a foolish declaration such as lays a solid foundation for fifty years repentance ah reader when i look back upon those days it seems to me that all things change or perish even thunder and lightning it pains me to say are not the thunder and lightning which i seem to remember about the time of waterloo roses i fear are degenerating and without a red revolution must come to the dust the fannies of our island though this i say with reluctance are not improving and the bath road is notoriously superannuated mr waterton tells me that the crocodile does not change that a cayman in fact or an alligator is just as good for riding upon as he was in the time of the pharaohs that may be but the reason is that the crocodile does not live fast he is a slow coach i believe it is generally understood amongst naturalists that the crocodile is a blockhead it is my own impression that the pharaohs were also blockheads now as the pharaohs and the crocodile domineered over egyptian society this accounts for a singular mistake that prevailed on the nile the crocodile made the ridiculous blunder of supposing man to be meant chiefly for his own eating man taking a different view of the subject naturally met that mistake by another he viewed the crocodile as a thing sometimes to worship but always to run away from and this continued until mr waterton changed the relations between the animals the mode of escaping from the reptile he showed to be not by running away but by leaping on its back booted and spurred the two animals had misunderstood each other the use of the crocodile has now been cleared up it is to be ridden and the use of man is that he may improve the health of the crocodile by riding him a foxhunting before breakfast and it is pretty certain that any crocodile who has been regularly hunted through the season and is master of the weight he carries will take a sixbarred gate now as well as ever he would have done in the infancy of the pyramids perhaps therefore the crocodile does not change but all things else do even the shadow of the pyramids grows less and often the restoration in vision of fanny and the bath road makes me too pathetically sensible of that truth out of the darkness if i happen to call up the image of fanny from thirtyfive years back arises suddenly a rose in june or if i think for an instant of the rose in june up rises the heavenly face of fanny one after the other like the antiphonies in the choral service rises fanny and the rose in june then back again the rose in june and fanny then come both together as in a chorus roses and fannies fannies and roses without end thick as blossoms in paradise then comes a venerable crocodile in a royal livery of scarlet and gold or in a coat with sixteen capes and the crocodile is driving fourinhand from the box of the bath mail and suddenly we upon the mail are pulled up by a mighty dial sculptured with the hours and with the dreadful legend of too late then all at once we are arrived at marlborough forest amongst the lovely households of the roedeer these retire into the dewy thickets the thickets are rich with roses the roses call up as ever the sweet countenance of fanny who being the granddaughter of a crocodile awakens a dreadful host of wild semilegendary animals griffins dragons basilisks sphinxes till at length the whole vision of fighting images crowds into one towering armorial shield a vast emblazonry of human charities and human loveliness that have perished but quartered heraldically with unutterable horrors of monstrous and demoniac natures whilst over all rises as a surmounting crest one fair female hand with the forefinger pointing in sweet sorrowful admonition upwards to heaven and having power which without experience i never could have believed to awaken the pathos that kills in the very bosom of the horrors that madden the grief that gnaws at the heart together with the monstrous creations of darkness that shock the belief and make dizzy the reason of man this is the peculiarity that i wish the reader to notice as having first been made known to me for a possibility by this early vision of fanny on the bath road the peculiarity consisted in the confluence of two different keys though apparently repelling each other into the music and governing principles of the same dream horror such as possesses the maniac and yet by momentary transitions grief such as may be supposed to possess the dying mother when leaving her infant children to the mercies of the cruel usually and perhaps always in an unshaken nervous system these two modes of misery exclude each other here first they met in horrid reconciliation there was also a separate peculiarity in the quality of the horror this was afterwards developed into far more revolting complexities of misery and incomprehensible darkness and perhaps i am wrong in ascribing any value as a causative agency to this particular case on the bath road possibly it furnished merely an occasion that accidentally introduced a mode of horrors certain to any rate to have grown up with or without the bath road from more advanced stages of the nervous derangement yet as the cubs of tigers or leopards when domesticated have been observed to suffer a sudden development of their latent ferocity under too eager an appeal to their playfulness the gaieties of sport in them being too closely connected with the fiery brightness of their murderous instincts so i have remarked that the caprices the gay arabesques and the lovely floral luxuriations of dreams betray a shocking tendency to pass into finer maniacal splendors that gaiety for instance for such as first it was in the dreaming faculty by which one principal point of resemblance to a crocodile in the mailcoachman was soon made to clothe him with the form of a crocodile and yet was blended with accessory circumstances derived from his human functions passed rapidly into a further development no longer gay or playful but terrific the most terrific that besieges dreams viz the horrid inoculation upon each other of incompatible natures this horror has always been secretly felt by man it was felt even under pagan forms of religion which offered a very feeble and also a very limited gamut for giving expression to the human capacities of sublimity or of horror we read it in the fearful composition of the sphinx the dragon again is the snake inoculated upon the scorpion the basilisk unites the mysterious malice of the evil eye unintentional on the part of the unhappy agent with the intentional venom of some other malignant natures but these horrid complexities of evil agency are but objectively horrid they inflict the horror suitable to their compound nature but there is no insinuation that they feel that horror heraldry is so full of these fantastic creatures that in some zoologies we find a separate chapter or a supplement dedicated to what is denominated heraldic zoology and why not for these hideous creatures however visionary have a real traditionary ground in medieval belief sincere and partly reasonable though adulterating with mendacity blundering credulity and intense superstition but the dreamhorror which i speak of is far more frightful the dreamer finds housed within himself occupying as it were some separate chamber in his brain holding perhaps from that station a secret and detestable commerce with his own heart some horrid alien nature what if it were his own nature repeated still if the duality were distinctly perceptible even that even this mere numerical double of his own consciousness might be a curse too mighty to be sustained but how if the alien nature contradicts his own fights with it perplexes and confounds it how again if not one alien nature but two but three but four but five are introduced within what once he thought the inviolable sanctuary of himself these however are horrors from the kingdoms of anarchy and darkness which by their very intensity challenge the sanctity of concealment and gloomily retire from exposition yet it was necessary to mention them because the first introduction to such appearances whether causal or merely casual lay in the heraldic monsters which monsters were themselves introduced though playfully by the transfigured coachman of the bath mail going down with victory but the grandest chapter of our experience within the whole mailcoach service was on those occasions when we went down from london with the news of victory a period of about ten years stretched from trafalgar to waterloo the second and third years of which period and were comparatively sterile but the rest from to inclusively furnished a long succession of victories the least of which in a contest of that portentous nature had an inappreciable value of position partly for its absolute interference with the plans of our enemy but still more from its keeping alive in central europe the sense of a deepseated vulnerability in france even to tease the coasts of our enemy to mortify them by continual blockades to insult them by capturing if it were but a baubling schooner under the eyes of their arrogant armies repeated from time to time a sullen proclamation of power lodged in a quarter to which the hopes of christendom turned in secret how much more loudly must this proclamation have spoken in the audacity of having bearded the elite of their troops and having beaten them in pitched battles five years of life it was worth paying down for the privilege of an outside place on a mailcoach when carrying down the first tidings of any such event and it is to be noted that from our insular situation and the multitude of our frigates disposable for the rapid transmission of intelligence rarely did any unauthorized rumor steal away a prelibation from the aroma of the regular dispatches the government official news was generally the first news from eight pm to fifteen or twenty minutes later imagine the mails assembled on parade in lombard street where at that time was seated the general postoffice in what exact strength we mustered i do not remember but from the length of each separate attelage we filled the street though a long one and though we were drawn up in double file on any night the spectacle was beautiful the absolute perfection of all the appointments about the carriages and the harness and the magnificence of the horses were what might first have fixed the attention every carriage on every morning in the year was taken down to an inspector for examination wheels axles linchpins pole glasses c were all critically probed and tested every part of every carriage had been cleaned every horse had been groomed with as much rigor as if they belonged to a private gentleman and that part of the spectacle offered itself always but the night before us is a night of victory and behold to the ordinary display what a heartshaking addition horses men carriages all are dressed in laurels and flowers oak leaves and ribbons the guards who are his majestys servants and the coachmen who are within the privilege of the postoffice wear the royal liveries of course and as it is summer for all the land victories were won in summer they wear on this fine evening these liveries exposed to view without any covering of upper coats such a costume and the elaborate arrangement of the laurels in their hats dilated their hearts by giving to them openly an official connection with the great news in which already they have the general interest of patriotism that great national sentiment surmounts and quells all sense of ordinary distinctions those passengers who happen to be gentlemen are now hardly to be distinguished as such except by dress the usual reserve of their manner in speaking to the attendants has on this night melted away one heart one pride one glory connects every man by the transcendent bond of his english blood the spectators who are numerous beyond precedent express their sympathy with these fervent feelings by continual hurrahs every moment are shouted aloud by the postoffice servants the great ancestral names of cities known to history through a thousand years lincoln winchester portsmouth gloucester oxford bristol manchester york newcastle edinburgh perth glasgow expressing the grandeur of the empire by the antiquity of its towns and the grandeur of the mail establishment by the diffusive radiation of its separate missions every moment you hear the thunder of lids locked down upon the mailbags that sound to each individual mail is the signal for drawing off which process is the finest part of the entire spectacle then come the horses into play horses can these be horses that unless powerfully reined in would bound off with the action and gestures of leopards what stir what sealike ferment what a thundering of wheels what a trampling of horses what farewell cheers what redoubling peals of brotherly congratulation connecting the name of the particular mail liverpool for ever with the name of the particular victory badajoz for ever or salamanca for ever the halfslumbering consciousness that all night long and all the next day perhaps for even a longer period many of these mails like fire racing along a train of gunpowder will be kindling at every instant new successions of burning joy has an obscure effect of multiplying the victory itself by multiplying to the imagination into infinity the stages of its progressive diffusion a fiery arrow seems to be let loose which from that moment is destined to travel almost without intermission westwards for three hundred miles northwards for six hundred and the sympathy of our lombard street friends at parting is exalted a hundred fold by a sort of visionary sympathy with the approaching sympathies yet unborn which we are going to evoke liberated from the embarrassments of the city and issuing into the broad uncrowded avenues of the northern suburbs we begin to enter upon our natural pace of ten miles an hour in the broad light of the summer evening the sun perhaps only just at the point of setting we are seen from every story of every house heads of every age crowd to the windows young and old understand the language of our victorious symbols and rolling volleys of sympathizing cheers run along behind and before our course the beggar rearing himself against the wall forgets his lameness real or assumed thinks not of his whining trade but stands erect with bold exulting smiles as we pass him the victory has healed him and says be thou whole women and children from garrets alike and cellars look down or look up with loving eyes upon our gay ribbons and our martial laurels sometimes kiss their hands sometimes hang out as signals of affection pocket handkerchiefs aprons dusters anything that lies ready to their hands on the london side of barnet to which we draw near within a few minutes after nine observe that private carriage which is approaching us the weather being so warm the glasses are all down and one may read as on the stage of a theatre everything that goes on within the carriage it contains three ladies one likely to be mama and two of seventeen or eighteen who are probably her daughters what lovely animation what beautiful unpremeditated pantomime explaining to us every syllable that passes in these ingenuous girls by the sudden start and raising of the hands on first discovering our laurelled equipage by the sudden movement and appeal to the elder lady from both of them and by the heightened color on their animated countenances we can almost hear them saying see see look at their laurels oh mama there has been a great battle in spain and it has been a great victory in a moment we are on the point of passing them we passengers i on the box and the two on the roof behind me raise our hats the coachman makes his professional salute with the whip the guard even though punctilious on the matter of his dignity as an officer under the crown touches his hat the ladies move to us in return with a winning graciousness of gesture all smile on each side in a way that nobody could misunderstand and that nothing short of a grand national sympathy could so instantaneously prompt will these ladies say that we are nothing to them oh no they will not say that they cannot deny they do not deny that for this night they are our sisters gentle or simple scholar or illiterate servant for twelve hours to come we on the outside have the honor to be their brothers those poor women again who stop to gaze upon us with delight at the entrance of barnet and seem by their air of weariness to be returning from labor do you mean to say that they are washerwomen and charwomen oh my poor friend you are quite mistaken they are nothing of the kind i assure you they stand in a higher rank for this one night they feel themselves by birthright to be daughters of england and answer to no humbler title every joy however even rapturous joy such is the sad law of earth may carry with it grief or fear of grief to some three miles beyond barnet we see approaching us another private carriage nearly repeating the circumstances of the former case here also the glasses are all down here also is an elderly lady seated but the two amiable daughters are missing for the single young person sitting by the ladys side seems to be an attendant so i judge from her dress and her air of respectful reserve the lady is in mourning and her countenance expresses sorrow at first she does not look up so that i believe she is not aware of our approach until she hears the measured beating of our horses hoofs then she raises her eyes to settle them painfully on our triumphal equipage our decorations explain the case to her at once but she beholds them with apparent anxiety or even with terror some time before this i finding it difficult to hit a flying mark when embarrassed by the coachmans person and reins intervening had given to the guard a courier evening paper containing the gazette for the next carriage that might pass accordingly he tossed it in so folded that the huge capitals expressing some such legend as glorious victory might catch the eye at once to see the paper however at all interpreted as it was by our ensigns of triumph explained everything and if the guard were right in thinking the lady to have received it with a gesture of horror it could not be doubtful that she had suffered some deep personal affliction in connection with this spanish war here now was the case of one who having formerly suffered might erroneously perhaps be distressing herself with anticipations of another similar suffering that same night and hardly three hours later occurred the reverse case a poor woman who too probably would find herself in a day or two to have suffered the heaviest of afflictions by the battle blindly allowed herself to express an exultation so unmeasured in the news and its details as gave to her the appearance which amongst celtic highlanders is called fey this was at some little town i forget what where we happened to change horses near midnight some fair or wake had kept the people up out of their beds we saw many lights moving about as we drew near and perhaps the most impressive scene on our route was our reception at this place the flashing of torches and the beautiful radiance of blue lights technically bengal lights upon the heads of our horses the fine effect of such a showery and ghostly illumination falling upon flowers and glittering laurels whilst all around the massy darkness seemed to invest us with walls of impenetrable blackness together with the prodigious enthusiasm of the people composed a picture at once scenical and affecting as we staid for three or four minutes i alighted and immediately from a dismantled stall in the street where perhaps she had been presiding at some part of the evening advanced eagerly a middleaged woman the sight of my newspaper it was that had drawn her attention upon myself the victory which we were carrying down to the provinces on this occasion was the imperfect one of talavera i told her the main outline of the battle but her agitation though not the agitation of fear but of exultation rather and enthusiasm had been so conspicuous when listening and when first applying for information that i could not but ask her if she had not some relation in the peninsular army oh yes her only son was there in what regiment he was a trooper in the d dragoons my heart sank within me as she made that answer this sublime regiment which an englishman should never mention without raising his hat to their memory had made the most memorable and effective charge recorded in military annals they leaped their horses over a trench where they could into it and with the result of death or mutilation when they could not what proportion cleared the trench is nowhere stated those who did closed up and went down upon the enemy with such divinity of fervor i use the word divinity by design the inspiration of god must have prompted this movement to those whom even then he was calling to his presence that two results followed as regarded the enemy this d dragoons not i believe originally three hundred and fifty strong paralyzed a french column six thousand strong then ascending the hill and fixed the gaze of the whole french army as regarded themselves the d were supposed at first to have been all but annihilated but eventually i believe not so many as one in four survived and this then was the regiment a regiment already for some hours known to myself and all london as stretched by a large majority upon one bloody aceldama in which the young trooper served whose mother was now talking with myself in a spirit of such hopeful enthusiasm did i tell her the truth had i the heart to break up her dreams no i said to myself tomorrow or the next day she will hear the worst for this night wherefore should she not sleep in peace after tomorrow the chances are too many that peace will forsake her pillow this brief respite let her owe this to my gift and my forbearance but if i told her not of the bloody price that had been paid there was no reason for suppressing the contributions from her sons regiment to the service and glory of the day for the very few words that i had time for speaking i governed myself accordingly i showed her not the funeral banners under which the noble regiment was sleeping i lifted not the overshadowing laurels from the bloody trench in which horse and rider lay mangled together but i told her how these dear children of england privates and officers had leaped their horses over all obstacles as gaily as hunters to the mornings chase i told her how they rode their horses into the mists of death saying to myself but not saying to her and laid down their young lives for thee o mother england as willingly poured out their noble blood as cheerfully as ever after a long days sport when infants they had rested their wearied heads upon their mothers knees or had sunk to sleep in her arms it is singular that she seemed to have no fears even after this knowledge that the d dragoons had been conspicuously engaged for her sons safety but so much was she enraptured by the knowledge that his regiment and therefore he had rendered eminent service in the trying conflict a service which had actually made them the foremost topic of conversation in london that in the mere simplicity of her fervent nature she threw her arms round my neck and poor woman kissed me notes note

general impression was that this splendid costume belonged of right to the mailcoachmen as their professional dress but that was an error to the guard it did belong as a matter of course and was essential as an official warrant and a means of instant identification for his person in the discharge of his important public duties but the coachman and especially if his place in the series did not

unicorn the kraken the seaserpent are all perhaps zoological facts the unicorn for instance so far from being a lie is rather too true for simply as a monokeras he is found in the himalaya in africa and elsewhere rather too often for the peace of what in scotland would be called the intending traveller that which really is a lie in the account of the unicorn viz his legendary rivalship with the lion which lie may god preserve in preserving the mighty imperial shield that embalms it cannot be more destructive to the zoological pretensions of the unicorn than are to the same pretensions in the lion our many popular crazes about his goodness and magnanimity or the old fancy adopted by spenser and noticed by so many among our elder poets of his graciousness to maiden innocence the wretch is the basest and most cowardly among the forest tribes nor has the sublime courage of the english bulldog ever been so memorably exhibited as in his hopeless fight at warwick with the cowardly and cruel lion called wallace another of the traditional creatures still doubtful is the mermaid upon which southey once remarked to me that if it had been differently named as suppose a merape nobody would have questioned its existence any more than that of seacows sealions c the mermaid has been discredited by her human name and her legendary human habits if she would not coquette so much with melancholy sailors and brush her hair so assiduously upon solitary rocks she would be carried on our books for as honest a reality as decent a female as many that are assessed to the poorrates note audacity such the french accounted it and it has struck me that soult would not have been so popular in london at the period of her present majestys coronation or in manchester on occasion of his visit to that town if they had been aware of the insolence with which he spoke of us in notes written at intervals from the field of waterloo as though it had been mere felony in our army to look a french one in the face he said more than once here are the english we have them they are caught en flagrant delit yet no man should have known us better no man had drunk deeper from the cup of humiliation than soult had in the north of portugal during the flight from an english army and subsequently at albuera in the bloodiest of recorded battles note three hundred of necessity this scale of measurement to an american if he happens to be a thoughtless man must sound ludicrous accordingly i remember a case in which an american writer indulges himself in the luxury of a little lying by ascribing to an englishman a pompous account of the thames constructed entirely upon american ideas of grandeur and concluding in something like these terms and sir arriving at london this mighty father of rivers attains a breadth of at least two furlongs having in its winding course traversed the astonishing distance of one hundred and seventy miles and this the candid american thinks it fair to contrast with the scale of the mississippi now it is hardly worth while to answer a pure falsehood gravely else one might say that no englishman out of bedlam ever thought of looking in an island for the rivers of a continent nor consequently could have thought of looking for the peculiar grandeur of the thames in the length of its course or in the extent of soil which it drains yet if he had been so absurd the american might have recollected that a river not to be compared with the thames even as to volume of water viz the tiber has contrived to make itself heard of in this world for twentyfive centuries to an extent not reached nor likely to be reached very soon by any river however corpulent of his own land the glory of the thames is measured by the density of the population to which it ministers by the commerce which it supports by the grandeur of the empire in which though far from the largest it is the most influential stream upon some such scale and not by a transfer of columbian standards is the course of our english mails to be valued the american may fancy the effect of his own valuations to our english ears by supposing the case of a siberian glorifying his country in these terms these rascals sir in france and england cannot march half a mile in any direction without finding a house where food can be had and lodging whereas such is the noble desolation of our magnificent country that in many a direction for a thousand miles i will engage a dog shall not find shelter from a snowstorm nor a wren find an apology for breakfast the vision of sudden death the reader is to understand this present paper in its two sections of the vision c and the dreamfugue as connected with a previous paper on the english mailcoach the ultimate object was the dreamfugue as an attempt to wrestle with the utmost efforts of music in dealing with a colossal form of impassioned horror the vision of sudden death contains the mailcoach incident which did really occur and did really suggest the variations of the dream here taken up by the fugue as well as other variations not now recorded confluent with these impressions from the terrific experience on the manchester and glasgow mail were other and more general impressions derived from long familiarity with the english mail as developed in the former paper impressions for instance of animal beauty and power of rapid motion at that time unprecedented of connection with the government and public business of a great nation but above all of connection with the national victories at an unexampled crisis the mail being the privileged organ for publishing and dispersing all news of that kind from this function of the mail arises naturally the introduction of waterloo into the fourth variation of the fogue for the mail itself having been carried into the dreams by the incident in the vision naturally all the accessory circumstances of pomp and grandeur investing this national carriage followed in the train of the principal image what is to be thought of sudden death it is remarkable that in different conditions of society it has been variously regarded as the consummation of an earthly career most fervently to be desired and on the other hand as that consummation which is most of all to be deprecated csar the dictator at his last dinner party coena and the very evening before his assassination being questioned as to the mode of death which in his opinion might seem the most eligible replied that which should be most sudden on the other hand the divine litany of our english church when breathing forth supplications as if in some representative character for the whole human race prostrate before god places such a death in the very van of horrors from lightning and tempest from plague pestilence and famine from battle and murder and from sudden death good lord deliver us sudden death is here made to crown the climax in a grand ascent of calamities it is the last of curses and yet by the noblest of romans it was treated as the first of blessings in that difference most readers will see little more than the difference between christianity and paganism but there i hesitate the christian church may be right in its estimate of sudden death and it is a natural feeling though after all it may also be an infirm one to wish for a quiet dismissal from life as that which seems most reconcilable with meditation with penitential retrospects and with the humilities of farewell prayer there does not however occur to me any direct scriptural warrant for this earnest petition of the english litany it seems rather a petition indulged to human infirmity than exacted from human piety and however that may be two remarks suggest themselves as prudent restraints upon a doctrine which else may wander and has wandered into an uncharitable superstition the first is this that many people are likely to exaggerate the horror of a sudden death i mean the objective horror to him who contemplates such a death not the subjective horror to him who suffers it from the false disposition to lay a stress upon words or acts simply because by an accident they have become words or acts if a man dies for instance by some sudden death when he happens to be intoxicated such a death is falsely regarded with peculiar horror as though the intoxication were suddenly exalted into a blasphemy but that is unphilosophic the man was or he was not habitually a drunkard if not if his intoxication were a solitary accident there can be no reason at all for allowing special emphasis to this act simply because through misfortune it became his final act nor on the other hand if it were no accident but one of his habitual transgressions will it be the more habitual or the more a transgression because some sudden calamity surprising him has caused this habitual transgression to be also a final one could the man have had any reason even dimly to foresee his own sudden death there would have been a new feature in his act of intemperance a feature of presumption and irreverence as in one that by possibility felt himself drawing near to the presence of god but this is no part of the case supposed and the only new element in the mans act is not any element of extra immorality but simply of extra misfortune the other remark has reference to the meaning of the word sudden and it is a strong illustration of the duty which for ever calls us to the stern valuation of words that very possibly cesar and the christian church do not differ in the way supposed that is do not differ by any difference of doctrine as between pagan and christian views of the moral temper appropriate to death but that they are contemplating different cases both contemplate a violent death a greek biathanatos death that is greek biaios but the difference is that the roman by the word sudden means an unlingering death whereas the christian litany by sudden means a death without warning consequently without any available summons to religious preparation the poor mutineer who kneels down to gather into his heart the bullets from twelve firelocks of his pitying comrades dies by a most sudden death in csars sense one shock one mighty spasm one possibly not one groan and all is over but in the sense of the litany his death is far from sudden his offence originally his imprisonment his trial the interval between his sentence and its execution having all furnished him with separate warnings of his fate having all summoned him to meet it with solemn preparation meantime whatever may be thought of a sudden death as a mere variety in the modes of dying where death in some shape is inevitable a question which equally in the roman and the christian sense will be variously answered according to each mans variety of temperament certainly upon one aspect of sudden death there can be no opening for doubt that of all agonies incident to man it is the most frightful that of all martyrdoms it is the most freezing to human sensibilities namely where it surprises a man under circumstances which offer or which seem to offer some hurried and inappreciable chance of evading it any effort by which such an evasion can be accomplished must be as sudden as the danger which it affronts even that even the sickening necessity for hurrying in extremity where all hurry seems destined to be vain selfbaffled and where the dreadful knell of too late is already sounding in the ears by anticipation even that anguish is liable to a hideous exasperation in one particular case namely where the agonising appeal is made not exclusively to the instinct of selfpreservation but to the conscience on behalf of another life besides your own accidentally cast upon your protection to fail to collapse in a service merely your own might seem comparatively venial though in fact it is far from venial but to fail in a case where providence has suddenly thrown into your hands the final interests of another of a fellowcreature shuddering between the gates of life and death this to a man of apprehensive conscience would mingle the misery of an atrocious criminality with the misery of a bloody calamity the man is called upon too probably to die but to die at the very moment when by any momentary collapse he is selfdenounced as a murderer he had but the twinkling of an eye for his effort and that effort might at the best have been unavailing but from this shadow of a chance small or great how if he has recoiled by a treasonable lchet the effort might have been without hope but to have risen to the level of that effort would have rescued him though not from dying yet from dying as a traitor to his duties the situation here contemplated exposes a dreadful ulcer lurking far down in the depths of human nature it is not that men generally are summoned to face such awful trials but potentially and in shadowy outline such a trial is moving subterraneously in perhaps all mens natures muttering under ground in one world to be realized perhaps in some other upon the secret mirror of our dreams such a trial is darkly projected at intervals perhaps to every one of us that dream so familiar to childhood of meeting a lion and from languishing prostration in hope and vital energy that constant sequel of lying down before him publishes the secret frailty of human nature reveals its deepseated pariah falsehood to itself records its abysmal treachery perhaps not one of us escapes that dream perhaps as by some sorrowful doom of man that dream repeats for every one of us through every generation the original temptation in eden every one of us in this dream has a bait offered to the infirm places of his own individual will once again a snare is made ready for leading him into captivity to a luxury of ruin again as in aboriginal paradise the man falls from innocence once again by infinite iteration the ancient earth groans to god through her secret caves over the weakness of her child nature from her seat sighing through all her works again gives signs of woe that all is lost and again the counter sigh is repeated to the sorrowing heavens of the endless rebellion against god many people think that one man the patriarch of our race could not in his single person execute this rebellion for all his race perhaps they are wrong but even if not perhaps in the world of dreams every one of us ratifies for himself the original act our english rite of confirmation by which in years of awakened reason we take upon us the engagements contracted for us in our slumbering infancy how sublime a rite is that the little postern gate through which the baby in its cradle had been silently placed for a time within the glory of gods countenance suddenly rises to the clouds as a triumphal arch through which with banners displayed and martial pomps we make our second entry as crusading soldiers militant for god by personal choice and by sacramental oath each man says in effect lo i rebaptise myself and that which once was sworn on my behalf now i swear for myself even so in dreams perhaps under some secret conflict of the midnight sleeper lighted up to the consciousness at the time but darkened to the memory as soon as all is finished each several child of our mysterious race completes for himself the aboriginal fall as i drew near to the manchester post office i found that it was considerably past midnight but to my great relief as it was important for me to be in westmorland by the morning i saw by the huge saucer eyes of the mail blazing through the gloom of overhanging houses that my chance was not yet lost past the time it was but by some luck very unusual in my experience the mail was not even yet ready to start i ascended to my seat on the box where my cloak was still lying as it had lain at the bridgewater arms i had left it there in imitation of a nautical discoverer who leaves a bit of bunting on the shore of his discovery by way of warning off the ground the whole human race and signalising to the christian and the heathen worlds with his best compliments that he has planted his throne for ever upon that virgin soil henceforward claiming the jus dominii to the top of the atmosphere above it and also the right of driving shafts to the centre of the earth below it so that all people found after this warning either aloft in the atmosphere or in the shafts or squatting on the soil will be treated as trespassers that is decapitated by their very faithful and obedient servant the owner of the said bunting possibly my cloak might not have been respected and the jus gentium might have been cruelly violated in my person for in the dark people commit deeds of darkness gas being a great ally of morality but it so happened that on this night there was no other outside passenger and the crime which else was but too probable missed fire for want of a criminal by the way i may as well mention at this point since a circumstantial accuracy is essential to the effect of my narrative that there was no other person of any description whatever about the mail the guard the coachman and myself being allowed for except only one a horrid creature of the class known to the world as insiders but whom young oxford called sometimes trojans in opposition to our grecian selves and sometimes vermin a turkish effendi who piques himself on good breeding will never mention by name a pig yet it is but too often that he has reason to mention this animal since constantly in the streets of stamboul he has his trousers deranged or polluted by this vile creature running between his legs but under any excess of hurry he is always careful out of respect to the company he is dining with to suppress the odious name and to call the wretch that other creature as though all animal life beside formed one group and this odious beast to whom as chrysippus observed salt serves as an apology for a soul formed another and alien group on the outside of creation now i who am an english effendi that think myself to understand goodbreeding as well as any son of othman beg my readers pardon for having mentioned an insider by his gross natural name i shall do so no more and if i should have occasion to glance at so painful a subject i shall always call him that other creature let us hope however that no such distressing occasion will arise but by the way an occasion arises at this moment for the reader will be sure to ask when we come to the story was this other creature present he was not or more correctly perhaps it was not we dropped the creature or the creature by natural imbecility dropped itself within the first ten miles from manchester in the latter case i wish to make a philosophic remark of a moral tendency when i die or when the reader dies and by repute suppose of fever it will never be known whether we died in reality of the fever or of the doctor but this other creature in the case of dropping out of the coach will enjoy a coroners inquest consequently he will enjoy an epitaph for i insist upon it that the verdict of a coroners jury makes the best of epitaphs it is brief so that the public all find time to read it is pithy so that the surviving friends if any can survive such a loss remember it without fatigue it is upon oath so that rascals and dr johnsons cannot pick holes in it died through the visitation of intense stupidity by impinging on a moonlight night against the off hind wheel of the glasgow mail deodand upon the said wheel twopence what a simple lapidary inscription nobody much in the wrong but an offwheel and with few acquaintances and if it were but rendered into choice latin though there would be a little bother in finding a ciceronian word for offwheel marcellus himself that great master of sepulchral eloquence could not show a better why i call this little remark moral is from the compensation it points out here by the supposition is that other creature on the one side the beast of the world and he or it gets an epitaph you and i on the contrary the pride of our friends get none but why linger on the subject of vermin having mounted the box i took a small quantity of laudanum having already travelled two hundred and fifty miles viz from a point seventy miles beyond london upon a simple breakfast in the taking of laudanum there was nothing extraordinary but by accident it drew upon me the special attention of my assessor on the box the coachman and in that there was nothing extraordinary but by accident and with great delight it drew my attention to the fact that this coachman was a monster in point of size and that he had but one eye in fact he had been foretold by virgil as monstrum horrendum informe ingens cui lumen adempium he answered in every point a monster he was dreadful shapeless huge who had lost an eye but why should that delight me had he been one of the calendars in the arabian nights and had paid down his eye as the price of his criminal curiosity what right had i to exult in his misfortune i did not exult i delighted in no mans punishment though it were even merited but these personal distinctions identified in an instant an old friend of mine whom i had known in the south for some years as the most masterly of mailcoachmen he was the man in all europe that could best have undertaken to drive sixinhand full gallop over al sirat that famous bridge of mahomet across the bottomless gulf backing himself against the prophet and twenty such fellows i used to call him cyclops mastigophorus cyclops the whipbearer until i observed that his skill made whips useless except to fetch off an impertinent fly from a leaders head upon which i changed his grecian name to cyclops diphrlates cyclops the charioteer i and others known to me studied under him the diphrelatic art excuse reader a word too elegant to be pedantic and also take this remark from me as a gage damiti that no word ever was or can be pedantic which by supporting a distinction supports the accuracy of logic or which fills up a chasm for the understanding as a pupil though i paid extra fees i cannot say that i stood high in his esteem it showed his dogged honesty though observe not his discernment that he could not see my merits perhaps we ought to excuse his absurdity in this particular by remembering his want of an eye that made him blind to my merits irritating as this blindness was surely it could not be envy he always courted my conversation in which art i certainly had the whiphand of him on this occasion great joy was at our meeting but what was cyclops doing here had the medical men recommended northern air or how i collected from such explanations as he volunteered that he had an interest at stake in a suitatlaw pending at lancaster so that probably he had got himself transferred to this station for the purpose of connecting with his professional pursuits an instant readiness for the calls of his lawsuit meantime what are we stopping for surely weve been waiting long enough oh this procrastinating mail and oh this procrastinating postoffice cant they take a lesson upon that subject from me some people have called me procrastinating now you are witness reader that i was in time for them but can they lay their hands on their hearts and say that they were in time for me i during my life have often had to wait for the postoffice the postoffice never waited a minute for me what are they about the guard tells me that there is a large extra accumulation of foreign mails this night owing to irregularities caused by war and by the packet service when as yet nothing is done by steam for an extra hour it seems the postoffice has been engaged in threshing out the pure wheaten correspondence of glasgow and winnowing it from the chaff of all baser intermediate towns we can hear the flails going at this moment but at last all is finished sound your horn guard manchester good bye weve lost an hour by your criminal conduct at the postoffice which however though i do not mean to part with a serviceable ground of complaint and one which really is such for the horses to me secretly is an advantage since it compels us to recover this last hour amongst the next eight or nine off we are at last and at eleven miles an hour and at first i detect no changes in the energy or in the skill of cyclops from manchester to kendal which virtually though not in law is the capital of westmoreland were at this time seven stages of eleven miles each the first five of these dated from manchester terminated in lancaster which was therefore fiftyfive miles north of manchester and the same distance exactly from liverpool the first three terminated in preston called by way of distinction from other towns of that name proud preston at which place it was that the separate roads from liverpool and from manchester to the north became confluent within these first three stages lay the foundation the progress and termination of our nights adventure during the first stage i found out that cyclops was mortal he was liable to the shocking affection of sleep a thing which i had never previously suspected if a man is addicted to the vicious habit of sleeping all the skill in aurigation of apollo himself with the horses of aurora to execute the motions of his will avail him nothing oh cyclops i exclaimed more than once cyclops my friend thou art mortal thou snorest through this first eleven miles however he betrayed his infirmity which i grieve to say he shared with the whole pagan pantheon only by short stretches on waking up he made an apology for himself which instead of mending the matter laid an ominous foundation for coming disasters the summer assizes were now proceeding at lancaster in consequence of which for three nights and three days he had not lain down in a bed during the day he was waiting for his uncertain summons as a witness on the trial in which he was interested or he was drinking with the other witnesses under the vigilant surveillance of the attorneys during the night or that part of it when the least temptations existed to conviviality he was driving throughout the second stage he grew more and more drowsy in the second mile of the third stage he surrendered himself finally and without a struggle to his perilous temptation all his past resistance had but deepened the weight of this final oppression seven atmospheres of sleep seemed resting upon him and to consummate the case our worthy guard after singing love amongst the roses for the fiftieth or sixtieth time without any invitation from cyclops or myself and without applause for his poor labors had moodily resigned himself to slumber not so deep doubtless as the coachmans but deep enough for mischief and having probably no similar excuse and thus at last about ten miles from preston i found myself left in charge of his majestys london and glasgow mail then running about eleven miles an hour what made this negligence less criminal than else it must have been thought was the condition of the roads at night during the assizes at that time all the law business of populous liverpool and of populous manchester with its vast cincture of populous rural districts was called up by ancient usage to the tribunal of lilliputian lancaster to break up this old traditional usage required a conflict with powerful established interests a large system of new arrangements and a new parliamentary statute as things were at present twice in the year so vast a body of business rolled northwards from the southern quarter of the county that a fortnight at least occupied the severe exertions of two judges for its dispatch the consequence of this was that every horse available for such a service along the whole line of road was exhausted in carrying down the multitudes of people who were parties to the different suits by sunset therefore it usually happened that through utter exhaustion amongst men and horses the roads were all silent except exhaustion in the vast adjacent county of york from a contested election nothing like it was ordinarily witnessed in england on this occasion the usual silence and solitude prevailed along the road not a hoof nor a wheel was to be heard and to strengthen this false luxurious confidence in the noiseless roads it happened also that the night was one of peculiar solemnity and peace i myself though slightly alive to the possibilities of peril had so far yielded to the influence of the mighty calm as to sink into a profound reverie the month was august in which lay my own birthday a festival to every thoughtful man suggesting solemn and often sighborn thoughts the county was my own native county upon which in its southern section more than upon any equal area known to man past or present had descended the original curse of labour in its heaviest form not mastering the bodies of men only as of slaves or criminals in mines but working through the fiery will upon no equal space of earth was or ever had been the same energy of human power put forth daily at this particular season also of the assizes that dreadful hurricane of flight and pursuit as it might have seemed to a stranger that swept to and from lancaster all day long hunting the county up and down and regularly subsiding about sunset united with the permanent distinction of lancashire as the very metropolis and citadel of labour to point the thoughts pathetically upon that counter vision of rest of saintly repose from strife and sorrow towards which as to their secret haven the profounder aspirations of mans heart are continually travelling obliquely we were nearing the sea upon our left which also must under the present circumstances be repeating the general state of halcyon repose the sea the atmosphere the light bore an orchestral part in this universal lull moonlight in the first timid tremblings of the dawn were now blending and the blendings were brought into a still more exquisite state of unity by a slight silvery mist motionless and dreamy that covered the woods and fields but with a veil of equable transparency except the feet of our own horses which running on a sandy margin of the road made little disturbance there was no sound abroad in the clouds and on the earth prevailed the same majestic peace and in spite of all that the villain of a schoolmaster has done for the ruin of our sublimer thoughts which are the thoughts of our infancy we still believe in no such nonsense as a limited atmosphere whatever we may swear with our false feigning lips in our faithful hearts we still believe and must for ever believe in fields of air traversing the total gulf between earth and the central heavens still in the confidence of children that tread without fear every chamber in their fathers house and to whom no door is closed we in that sabbatic vision which sometimes is revealed for an hour upon nights like this ascend with easy steps from the sorrowstricken fields of earth upwards to the sandals of god footnote sighborn i owe the suggestion of this word to an obscure remembrance of a beautiful phrase in giraldus gambrensis viz suspirios cogilationes suddenly from thoughts like these i was awakened to a sullen sound as of some motion on the distant road it stole upon the air for a moment i listened in awe but then it died away once roused however i could not but observe with alarm the quickened motion of our horses ten years experience had made my eye learned in the valuing of motion and i saw that we were now running thirteen miles an hour i pretend to no presence of mind on the contrary my fear is that i am miserably and shamefully deficient in that quality as regards action the palsy of doubt and distraction hangs like some guilty weight of dark unfathomed remembrances upon my energies when the signal is flying for action but on the other hand this accursed gift i have as regards thought that in the first step towards the possibility of a misfortune i see its total evolution in the radix i see too certainly and too instantly its entire expansion in the first syllable of the dreadful sentence i read already the last it was not that i feared for ourselves what could injure us our bulk and impetus charmed us against peril in any collision and i had rode through too many hundreds of perils that were frightful to approach that were matter of laughter as we looked back upon them for any anxiety to rest upon our interests the mail was not built i felt assured nor bespoke that could betray me who trusted to its protection but any carriage that we could meet would be frail and light in comparison of ourselves and i remarked this ominous accident of our situation we were on the wrong side of the road but then the other party if other there was might also be on the wrong side and two wrongs might make a right that was not likely the same motive which had drawn us to the righthand side of the road viz the soft beaten sand as contrasted with the paved centre would prove attractive to others our lamps still lighted would give the impression of vigilance on our part and every creature that met us would rely upon us for quartering all this and if the separate links of the anticipation had been a thousand times more i saw not discursively or by effort but as by one flash of horrid intuition footnote quartering this is the technical word and i presume derived from the french carlayer to evade a rut or any obstacle under this steady though rapid anticipation of the evil which might be gathering ahead ah reader what a sullen mystery of fear what a sigh of woe seemed to steal upon the air as again the faroff sound of a wheel was heard a whisper it was a whisper from perhaps four miles off secretly announcing a ruin that being foreseen was not the less inevitable what could be done who was it that could do it to check the stormflight of these maniacal horses what could i not seize the reins from the grasp of the slumbering coachman you reader think that it would have been in your power to do so and i quarrel not with your estimate of yourself but from the way in which the coachmans hand was viced between his upper and lower thigh this was impossible the guard subsequently found it impossible after this danger had passed not the grasp only but also the position of this polyphemus made the attempt impossible you still think otherwise see then that bronze equestrian statue the cruel rider has kept the bit in his horses mouth for two centuries unbridle him for a minute if you please and wash his mouth with water or stay reader unhorse me that marble emperor knock me those marble feet from those marble stirrups of charlemagne the sounds ahead strengthened and were now too clearly the sounds of wheels who and what could it be was it industry in a taxed cart was it youthful gaiety in a gig whoever it was something must be attempted to warn them upon the other party rests the active responsibility but upon us and woe is me that us was my single self rest the responsibility of warning yet how should this be accomplished might i not seize the guards horn already on the first thought i was making my way over the roof to the guards seat but this from the foreign mails being piled upon the roof was a difficult and even dangerous attempt to one cramped by nearly three hundred miles of outside travelling and fortunately before i had lost much time in the attempt our frantic horses swept round an angle of the road which opened upon us the stage where the collision must be accomplished the parties that seemed summoned to the trial and the impossibility of saving them by any communication with the guard before us lay an avenue straight as an arrow six hundred yards perhaps in length and the umbrageous trees which rose in a regular line from either side meeting high overhead gave to it the character of a cathedral aisle these trees lent a deeper solemnity to the early light but there was still light enough to perceive at the further end of this gothic aisle a light reedy gig in which were seated a young man and by his side a young lady ah young sir what are you about if it is necessary that you should whisper your communications to this young lady though really i see nobody at this hour and on this solitary road likely to overhear your conversation is it therefore necessary that you should carry your lips forward to hers the little carriage is creeping on at one mile an hour and the parties within it being thus tenderly engaged are naturally bending down their heads between them and eternity to all human calculation there is but a minute and a half what is it that i shall do strange it is and to a mere auditor of the tale might seem laughable that i should need a suggestion from the iliad to prompt the sole recourse that remained but so it was suddenly i remembered the shout of achilles and its effect but could i pretend to shout like the son of peleus aided by pallas no certainly but then i needed not the shout that should alarm all asia militant a shout would suffice such as should carry terror into the hearts of two thoughtless young people and one gig horse i shouted and the young man heard me not a second time i shouted and now he heard me for now he raised his head here then all had been done that by me could be done more on my part was not possible mine had been the first step the second was for the young man the third was for god if said i the stranger is a brave man and if indeed he loves the young girl at his side or loving her not if he feels the obligation pressing upon every man worthy to be called a man of doing his utmost for a woman confided to his protection he will at least make some effort to save her if that fails he will not perish the more or by a death more cruel for having made it and he will die as a brave man should with his face to the danger and with his arm about the woman that he sought in vain to save but if he makes no effort shrinking without a struggle from his duty he himself will not the less certainly perish for this baseness of poltroonery he will die no less and why not wherefore should we grieve that there is one craven less in the world no let him perish without a pitying thought of ours wasted upon him and in that case all our grief will be reserved for the fate of the helpless girl who now upon the least shadow of failure in him must by the fiercest of translations must without time for a prayer must within seventy seconds stand before the judgmentseat of god but craven he was not sudden had been the call upon him and sudden was his answer to the call he saw he heard he comprehended the ruin that was coming down already its gloomy shadow darkened above him and already he was measuring his strength to deal with it ah what a vulgar thing does courage seem when we see nations buying it and selling it for a shilling a day ah what a sublime thing does courage seem when some fearful crisis on the great deeps of life carries a man as if running before a hurricane up to the giddy crest of some mountainous wave from which accordingly as he chooses his course he describes two courses and a voice says to him audibly this way lies hope take the other way and mourn for ever yet even then amidst the raving of the seas and the frenzy of the danger the man is able to confront his situation is able to retire for a moment into solitude with god and to seek all his counsel from him for seven seconds it might be of his seventy the stranger settled his countenance steadfastly upon us as if to search and value every element in the conflict before him for five seconds more he sate immovably like one that mused on some great purpose for five he sate with eyes upraised like one that prayed in sorrow under some extremity of doubt for wisdom to guide him towards the better choice then suddenly he rose stood upright and by a sudden strain upon the reins raising his horses forefeet from the ground he slewed him round on the pivot of his hind legs so as to plant the little equipage in a position nearly at right angles to ours thus far his condition was not improved except as a first step had been taken towards the possibility of a second if no more were done nothing was done for the little carriage still occupied the very centre of our path though in an altered direction yet even now it may not be too late fifteen of the twenty seconds may still be unexhausted and one almighty bound forward may avail to clear the ground hurry then hurry for the flying moments they hurry oh hurry hurry my brave young man for the cruel hoofs of our horses they also hurry fast are the flying moments faster are the hoofs of our horses fear not for him if human energy can suffice faithful was he that drove to his terrific duty faithful was the horse to his command one blow one impulse given with voice and hand by the stranger one rush from the horse one bound as if in the act of rising to a fence landed the docile creatures forefeet upon the crown or arching centre of the road the larger half of the little equipage had then cleared our overtowering shadow that was evident even to my own agitated sight but it mattered little that one wreck should float off in safety if upon the wreck that perished were embarked the human freightage the rear part of the carriage was that certainly beyond the line of absolute ruin what power could answer the question glance of eye thought of man wing of angel which of these had speed enough to sweep between the question and the answer and divide the one from the other light does not tread upon the steps of light more indivisibly than did our allconquering arrival upon the escaping efforts of the gig that must the young man have felt too plainly his back was now turned to us not by sight could he any longer communicate with the peril but by the dreadful rattle of our harness too truly had his ear been instructed that all was finished as regarded any further effort of his already in resignation he had rested from his struggle and perhaps in his heart he was whispering father which art above do thou finish in heaven what i on earth have attempted we ran past them faster than ever millrace in our inexorable flight oh raving of hurricanes that must have sounded in their young ears at the moment of our transit either with the swinglebar or with the haunch of our near leader we had struck the offwheel of the little gig which stood rather obliquely and not quite so far advanced as to be accurately parallel with the near wheel the blow from the fury of our passage resounded terrifically i rose in horror to look upon the ruins we might have caused from my elevated station i looked down and looked back upon the scene which in a moment told its tale and wrote all its records on my heart for ever the horse was planted immovably with his forefeet upon the paved crest of the central road he of the whole party was alone untouched by the passion of death the little cany carriage partly perhaps from the dreadful torsion of the wheels in its recent movement partly from the thundering blow we had given to it as if it sympathized with human horror was all alive with tremblings and shiverings the young man sat like a rock he stirred not at all but his was the steadiness of agitation frozen into rest by horror as yet he dared not to look round for he knew that if anything remained to do by him it could no longer be done and as yet he knew not for certain if their safety were accomplished but the lady but the lady oh heavens will that spectacle ever depart from my dreams as she rose and sank upon her seat sank and rose threw up her arms wildly to heaven clutched at some visionary object in the air fainting praying raving despairing figure to yourself reader the elements of the case suffer me to recall before your mind the circumstances of the unparalleled situation from the silence and deep peace of this saintly summer night from the pathetic blending of this sweet moonlight dawnlight dreamlight from the manly tenderness of this flattering whispering murmuring love suddenly as from the woods and fields suddenly as from the chambers of the air opening in revelation suddenly as from the ground yawning at her feet leaped upon her with the flashing of cataracts death the crowned phantom with all the equipage of his terrors and the tiger roar of his voice the moments were numbered in the twinkling of an eye our flying horses had carried us to the termination of the umbrageous aisle at right angles we wheeled into our former direction the turn of the road carried the scene out of my eyes in an instant and swept it into my dreams for ever dreamfugue on the above theme of sudden death whence the sound of instruments that made melodious chime was heard of harp and organ and who movd their stops and chords was seen his volant touch instinct through all proportions low and high fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue par lost b xl tumultuosissimamente passion of sudden death that once in youth i read and interpreted by the shadows of thy averted signs rapture of panic taking the shape which amongst tombs in churches i have seen of woman bursting her sepulchral bonds of womans ionic form bending forward from the ruins of her grave with arching foot with eyes upraised with clasped adoring hands waiting watching trembling praying for the trumpets call to rise from dust for ever ah vision too fearful of shuddering humanity on the brink of abysses vision that didst start back that didst reel away like a shrivelling scroll from before the wrath of fire racing on the wings of the wind epilepsy so brief of horror wherefore is it that thou canst not die passing so suddenly into darkness wherefore is it that still thou sheddest thy sad funeral blights upon the gorgeous mosaics of dreams fragment of music too stern heard once and heard no more what aileth thee that thy deep rolling chords come up at intervals through all the worlds of sleep and after thirty years have lost no element of horror footnote averted signs i read the course and changes of the ladys agony in the succession of her involuntary gestures but let it be remembered that i read all this from the rear never once catching the ladys full face and even her profile imperfectly lo it is summer almighty summer the everlasting gates of life and summer are thrown open wide and on the ocean tranquil and verdant as a savanna the unknown lady from the dreadful vision and i myself are floating she upon a fairy pinnace and i upon an english threedecker but both of us are wooing gales of festal happiness within the domain of our common country within that ancient watery park within that pathless chase where england takes her pleasure as a huntress through winter and summer and which stretches from the rising to the setting sun ah what a wilderness of floral beauty was hidden or was suddenly revealed upon the tropic islands through which the pinnace moved and upon her deck what a bevy of human flowers young women how lovely young men how noble that were dancing together and slowly drifting towards us amidst music and incense amidst blossoms from forests and gorgeous corymbi from vintages amidst natural caroling and the echoes of sweet girlish laughter slowly the pinnace nears us gaily she hails us and slowly she disappears beneath the shadow of our mighty bows but then as at some signal from heaven the music and the carols and the sweet echoing of girlish laughter all are hushed what evil has smitten the pinnace meeting or overtaken her did ruin to our friends couch within our own dreadful shadow was our shadow the shadow of death i looked over the bow for an answer and behold the pinnace was dismantled the revel and the revellers were found no more the glory of the vintage was dust and the forest was left without a witness to its beauty upon the seas but where and i turned to our own crew where are the lovely women that danced beneath the awning of flowers and clustering corymbi whither have fled the noble young men that danced with them answer there was none but suddenly the man at the masthead whose countenance darkened with alarm cried out sail on the weather beam down she comes upon us in seventy seconds she will founder i looked to the weather side and the summer had departed the sea was rocking and shaken with gathering wrath upon its surface sate mighty mists which grouped themselves into arches and long cathedral aisles down one of these with the fiery pace of a quarrel from a crossbow ran a frigate right athwart our course are they mad some voice exclaimed from our deck are they blind do they woo their ruin but in a moment as she was close upon us some impulse of a heady current or sudden vortex gave a wheeling bias to her course and off she forged without a shock as she ran past us high aloft amongst the shrouds stood the lady of the pinnace the deeps opened ahead in malice to receive her towering surges of foam ran after her the billows were fierce to catch her but far away she was borne into desert spaces of the sea whilst still by sight i followed her as she ran before the howling gale chased by angry seabirds and by maddening billows still i saw her as at the moment when she ran past us amongst the shrouds with her white draperies streaming before the wind there she stood with hair dishevelled one hand clutched amongst the tackling rising sinking fluttering trembling praying there for leagues i saw her as she stood raising at intervals one hand to heaven amidst the fiery crests of the pursuing waves and the raving of the storm until at last upon a sound from afar of malicious laughter and mockery all was hidden for ever in driving showers and afterwards but when i know not and how i know not sweet funeral bells from some incalculable distance wailing over the dead that die before the dawn awakened me as i slept in a boat moored to some familiar shore the morning twilight even then was breaking and by the dusky revelations which it spread i saw a girl adorned with a garland of white roses about her head for some great festival running along the solitary strand with extremity of haste her running was the running of panic and often she looked back as to some dreadful enemy in the rear but when i leaped ashore and followed on her steps to warn her of a peril in front alas from me she fled as from another peril and vainly i shouted to her of quicksands that lay ahead faster and faster she ran round a promontory of rocks she wheeled out of sight in an instant i also wheeled round it but only to see the treacherous sands gathering above her head already her person was buried only the fair young head and the diadem of white roses around it were still visible to the pitying heavens and last of all was visible one marble arm i saw by the early twilight this fair young head as it was sinking down to darkness saw this marble arm as it rose above her head and her treacherous grave tossing faultering rising clutching as at some false deceiving hand stretched out from the clouds saw this marble arm uttering her dying hope and then her dying despair the head the diadem the arm these all had sunk at last over these also the cruel quicksand had closed and no memorial of the fair young girl remained on earth except my own solitary tears and the funeral bells from the desert seas that rising again more softly sang a requiem over the grave of the buried child and over her blighted dawn i sate and wept in secret the tears that men have ever given to the memory of those that died before the dawn and by the treachery of earth our mother but the tears and funeral bells were hushed suddenly by a shout as of many nations and by a roar as from some great kings artillery advancing rapidly along the valleys and heard afar by its echoes among the mountains hush i said as i bent my ear earthwards to listen hush this either is the very anarchy of strife or else and then i listened more profoundly and said as i raised my head or else oh heavens it is victory that swallows up all strife immediately in trance i was carried over land and sea to some distant kingdom and placed upon a triumphal car amongst companions crowned with laurel the darkness of gathering midnight brooding over all the land hid from us the mighty crowds that were weaving restlessly about our carriage as a centre we heard them but we saw them not tidings had arrived within an hour of a grandeur that measured itself against centuries too full of pathos they were too full of joy that acknowledged no fountain but god to utter themselves by other language than by tears by restles anthems by reverberations rising from every choir of the gloria in excelsis these tidings we that sate upon the laurelled car had it for our privilege to publish amongst all nations and already by signs audible through the darkness by snortings and tramplings our angry horses that knew no fear of fleshly weariness upbraided us with delay wherefore was it that we delayed we waited for a secret word that should bear witness to the hope of nations as now accomplished for ever at midnight the secret word arrived which word was waterloo and recovered christendom the dreadful word shone by its own light before us it went high above our leaders heads it rode and spread a golden light over the paths which we traversed every city at the presence of the secret word threw open its gates to receive us the rivers were silent as we crossed all the infinite forests as we ran along their margins shivered in homage to the secret word and the darkness comprehended it two hours after midnight we reached a mighty minster its gates which rose to the clouds were closed but when the dreadful word that rode before us reached them with its golden light silently they moved back upon their hinges and at a flying gallop our equipage entered the grand aisle of the cathedral headlong was our pace and at every altar in the little chapels and oratories to the right hand and left of our course the lamps dying or sickening kindled anew in sympathy with the secret word that was flying past forty leagues we might have run in the cathedral and as yet no strength of morning light had reached us when we saw before us the arial galleries of the organ and the choir every pinnacle of the fretwork every station of advantage amongst the traceries was crested by whiterobed choristers that sang deliverance that wept no more tears as once their fathers had wept but at intervals that sang together to the generations saying chaunt the deliverers praise in every tongue and receiving answers from afar such as once in heaven and earth were sung and of their chaunting was no end of our headlong pace was neither pause nor remission thus as we ran like torrents thus as we swept with bridal rapture over the campo santo of the cathedral graves suddenly we became aware of a vast necropolis rising upon the faroff horizon a city of sepulchres built within the saintly cathedral for the warrior dead that rested from their feuds on earth of purple granite was the necropolis yet in the first minute it lay like a purple stain upon the horizon so mighty was the distance in the second minute it trembled through many changes growing into terraces and towers of wondrous altitude so mighty was the pace in the third minute already with our dreadful gallop we were entering its suburbs vast sarcophagi rose on every side having towers and turrets that upon the limits of the central aisle strode forward with haughty intrusion that ran back with mighty shadows into answering recesses every sarcophagus showed many basreliefs basreliefs of battles basreliefs of battlefields of battles from forgotten ages of battles from yesterday of battlefields that long since nature had healed and reconciled to herself with the sweet oblivion of flowers of battlefields that were yet angry and crimson with carnage where the terraces ran there did we run where the towers curved there did we curve with the flight of swallows our horses swept round every angle like rivers in flood wheeling round headlands like hurricanes that side into the secrets of forests faster than ever light unwove the mazes of darkness our flying equipage carried earthly passions kindled warrior instincts amongst the dust that lay around us dust oftentimes of our noble fathers that had slept in god from crci to trafalgar and now had we reached the last sarcophagus now were we abreast of the last basrelief already had we recovered the arrowlike flight of the illimitable central aisle when coming up this aisle to meet us we beheld a female infant that rode in a carriage as frail as flowers the mists which went before her hid the fawns that drew her but could not hide the shells and tropic flowers with which she played but could not hide the lovely smiles by which she uttered her trust in the mighty cathedral and in the cherubim that looked down upon her from the topmast shafts of its pillars face to face she was meeting us face to face she rode as if danger there were none oh baby i exclaimed shalt thou be the ransom for waterloo must we that carry tidings of great joy to every people be messengers of ruin to thee in horror i rose at the thought but then also in horror at the thought rose one that was sculptured on the basrelief a dying trumpeter solemnly from the field of battle he rose to his feet and unslinging his stony trumpet carried it in his dying anguish to his stony lips sounding once and yet once again proclamation that in thy ears oh baby must have spoken from the battlements of death immediately deep shadows fell between us and aboriginal silence the choir had ceased to sing the hoofs of our horses the rattling of our harness alarmed the graves no more by horror the basrelief had been unlocked into life by horror we that were so full of life we men and our horses with their fiery forelegs rising in mid air to their everlasting gallop were frozen to a basrelief then a third time the trumpet sounded the seals were taken off all pulses life and the frenzy of life tore into their channels again again the choir burst forth in sunny grandeur as from the muffling of storms and darkness again the thunderings of our horses carried temptation into the graves one cry burst from our lips as the clouds drawing off from the aisle showed it empty before us whither has the infant fled is the young child caught up to god lo afar off in a vast recess rose three mighty windows to the clouds and on a level with their summits at height insuperable to man rose an altar of purest alabaster on its eastern face was trembling a crimson glory whence came that was it from the reddening dawn that now streamed through the windows was it from the crimson robes of the martyrs that were painted on the windows was it from the bloody basreliefs of earth whencesoever it were there within that crimson radiance suddenly appeared a female head and then a female figure it was the child now grown up to womans height clinging to the horns of the altar there she stood sinking rising trembling fainting raving despairing and behind the volume of incense that night and day streamed upwards from the altar was seen the fiery font and dimly was descried the outline of the dreadful being that should baptize her with the baptism of death but by her side was kneeling her better angel that hid his face with wings that wept and pleaded for her that prayed when she could not that fought with heaven by tears for her deliverance which also as he raised his immortal countenance from his wings i saw by the glory in his eye that he had won at last footnote campo santo it is probable that most of my readers will be acquainted with the history of the campo santo at pisa composed of earth brought from jerusalem for a bed of sanctity as the highest prize which the noble piety of crusaders could ask or imagine there is another campo santo at naples formed however i presume on the example given by pisa possibly the idea may have been more extensively copied to readers who are unacquainted with england or who being english are yet unacquainted with the cathedral cities of england it may be right to mention that the graves withinside the cathedrals often form a flat pavement over which carriages and horses might roll and perhaps a boyish remembrance of one particular cathedral across which i had seen passengers walk and burdens carried may have assisted my dream then rose the agitation spreading through the infinite cathedral to its agony then was completed the passion of the mighty fugue the golden tubes of the organ which as yet had but sobbed and muttered at intervals gleaming amongst clouds and surges of incense threw up as from fountains unfathomable columns of heartshattering music choir and antichoir were filling fast with unknown voices thou also dying trumpeter with thy love that was victorious and thy anguish that was finishing didst enter the tumult trumpet and echo farewell love and farewell anguish rang through the dreadful sanctus we that spread flight before us heard the tumult as of flight mustering behind us in fear we looked round for the unknown steps that in flight or in pursuit were gathering upon our own who were these that followed the faces which no man could count whence were they oh darkness of the grave i exclaimed that from the crimson altar and from the fiery font wert visited with secret light that wert searched by the effulgence in the angels eye were these indeed thy children pomps of life that from the burials of centuries rose again to the voice of perfect joy could it be ye that had wrapped me in the reflux of panic what ailed me that i should fear when the triumphs of earth were advancing ah pariah heart within me that couldst never hear the sound of joy without sullen whispers of treachery in ambush that from six years old didst never hear the promise of perfect love without seeing aloft amongst the stars fingers as of a mans hand writing the secret legend ashes to ashes dust to dust wherefore shouldst thou not fear though all men should rejoice lo as i looked back for seventy leagues through the mighty cathedral and saw the quick and the dead that sang together to god together that sang to the generations of man ah raving as of torrents that opened on every side trepidation as of female and infant steps that fled ah rushing as of wings that chase but i heard a voice from heaven which said let there be no reflux of panic let there be no more fear and no more sudden death cover them with joy as the tides cover the shore that heard the children of the choir that heard the children of the grave all the hosts of jubilation made ready to move like armies that ride in pursuit they moved with one step us that with laurelled heads were passing from the cathedral through its eastern gates they overtook and as with a garment they wrapped us round with thunders that overpowered our own as brothers we moved together to the skies we rose to the dawn that advanced to the stars that fled rendering thanks to god in the highest that having hid his face through one generation behind thick clouds of war once again was ascending was ascending from waterloo in the visions of peace rendering thanks for thee young girl whom having overshadowed with his ineffable passion of death suddenly did god relent suffered thy angel to turn aside his arm and even in thee sister unknown shown to me for a moment only to be hidden for ever found an occasion to glorify his goodness a thousand times amongst the phantoms of sleep has he shown thee to me standing before the golden dawn and ready to enter its gates with the dreadful word going before thee with the armies of the grave behind thee shown thee to me sinking rising fluttering fainting but then suddenly reconciled adoring a thousand times has he followed thee in the worlds of sleep through storms through desert seas through the darkness of quicksands through fugues and the persecution of fugues through dreams and the dreadful resurrections that are in dreams only that at the last with one motion of his victorious arm he might record and emblazon the endless resurrections of his love dinner real and reputed great misconceptions have always prevailed about the roman dinner dinner coena was the only meal which the romans as a nation took it was no accident but arose out of their whole social economy this we shall show by running through the history of a roman day ridentem dicere verum quid vetat and the course of this review will expose one or two important truths in ancient political economy which have been wholly overlooked with the lark it was that the roman rose not that the earliest lark rises so early in latium as the earliest lark in england that is during summer but then on the other hand neither does it ever rise so late the roman citizen was stirring with the dawn which allowing for the shorter longestday and longer shortestday of rome you may call about four in summer about seven in winter why did he do this because he went to bed at a very early hour but why did he do that by backing in this way we shall surely back into the very well of truth always if it is possible let us have the pourquoi of the pourquoi the roman went to bed early for two special reasons st because in rome which had been built for a martial destiny every habit of life had reference to the usages of war every citizen if he were not a mere proletarian animal kept at the public cost held himself a sort of soldierelect the more noble he was the more was his liability to military service in short all rome and at all times was consciously in procinct now it was a principle of ancient warfare that every hour of daylight had a triple worth if valued against hours of darkness that was one reason a reason suggested by the understanding but there was a second reason far more remarkable and this was a reason dictated by a blind necessity it is an important fact that this planet on which we live this little industrious earth of ours has developed her wealth by slow stages of increase she was far from being the rich little globe in csars days that she is at present the earth in our days is incalculably richer as a whole than in the time of charlemagne at that time she was richer by many a million of acres than in the era of augustus in that augustan era we descry a clear belt of cultivation averaging about six hundred miles in depth running in a ringfence about the mediterranean this belt and no more was in decent cultivation beyond that belt there was only a wild indian cultivation at present what a difference we have that very belt but much richer all things considered quatis quandis than in the roman era the reader must not look to single cases as that of egypt or other parts of africa but take the whole collectively on that scheme of valuation we have the old roman belt the mediterranean riband not much tarnished and we have all the rest of europe to boot or speaking in scholars language as a lucro ponamus we say nothing of remoter gains such being the case our mother the earth being as a whole so incomparably poorer could not in the pagan era support the expense of maintaining great empires in cold latitudes her purse would not reach that cost wherever she undertook in those early ages to rear man in great abundance it must be where nature would consent to work in partnership with herself where warmth was to be had for nothing where clothes were not so entirely indispensable but that a ragged fellow might still keep himself warm where slight shelter might serve and where the soil if not absolutely richer in reversionary wealth was more easily cultured nature must come forward liberally and take a number of shares in every new jointstock concern before it could move man therefore went to bed early in those ages simply because his worthy mother earth could not afford him candles she good old lady or good young lady for geologists know not whether she is in that stage of her progress which corresponds to gray hairs or to infancy or to a certain age she good lady would certainly have shuddered to hear any of her nations asking for candles candles she would have said who ever heard of such a thing and with so much excellent daylight running to waste as i have provided gratis what will the wretches want next the daylight furnished gratis was certainly neat and undeniable in its quality and quite sufficient for all purposes that were honest seneca even in his own luxurious period called those men lucifug and by other ugly names who lived chiefly by candlelight none but rich and luxurious men nay even amongst these none but idlers did live much by candlelight an immense majority of men in rome never lighted a candle unless sometimes in the early dawn and this custom of rome was the custom also of all nations that lived round the great pond of the mediterranean in athens egypt palestine asia minor everywhere the ancients went to bed like good boys from seven to nine oclock the turks and other people who have succeeded to the stations and the habits of the ancients do so at this day the roman therefore who saw no joke in sitting round a table in the dark went off to bed as the darkness began everybody did so old numa pompilius himself was obliged to trundle off in the dusk tarquinius might be a very superb fellow but we doubt whether he ever saw a farthing rushlight and though it may be thought that plots and conspiracies would flourish in such a city of darkness it is to be considered that the conspirators themselves had no more candles than honest men both parties were in the dark being up then and stirring not long after the lark what mischief did the roman go about first nowadays he would have taken a pipe or a cigar but alas for the ignorance of the poor heathen creatures they had neither one nor the other in this point we must tax our mother earth with being really too stingy in the case of the candles we approve of her parsimony much mischief is brewed by candlelight but it was coming it too strong to allow no tobacco many a wild fellow in rome your gracchi syllas catilines would not have played h and tommy in the way they did if they could have soothed their angry stomachs with a cigar a pipe has intercepted many an evil scheme but the thing is past helping now at rome you must do as they does at rome so after shaving supposing the age of the barbati to be passed what is the first business that our roman will undertake forty to one he is a poor man born to look upwards to his fellowmen and not to look down upon anybody but slaves he goes therefore to the palace of some grandee some topsawyer of the senatorian order this great man for all his greatness has turned out even sooner than himself for he also has had no candles and no cigars and he well knows that before the sun looks into his portals all his halls will be overflowing and buzzing with the matin susurrus of courtiers the mane salutantes it is as much as his popularity is worth to absent himself or to keep people waiting but surely the reader may think this poor man he might keep waiting no he might not for though poor being a citizen he is a gentleman that was the consequence of keeping slaves wherever there is a class of slaves he that enjoys the jus suffragii no matter how poor is a gentleman the true latin word for a gentleman is ingentius a freeman and the son of a freeman yet even here there were distinctions under the emperors the courtiers were divided into two classes with respect to the superior class it was said of the sovereign that he saw them videbat with respect to the other that he was seen videbatur even plutarch mentions it as a common boast in his times greek aemas eiden ho basileus csar is in the habit of seeing me or as a common plea for evading a suit greek ora mallon i am sorry to say he is more inclined to look upon others and this usage derived itself mark that well from the republican era the aulic spirit was propagated by the empire but from a republican root having paid his court you will suppose that our friend comes home to breakfast not at all no such discovery as breakfast had then been made breakfast was not invented for many centuries after that we have always admired and always shall admire as the very best of all human stories charles lambs account of the origin of roast pig in china ching ping it seems had suffered his fathers house to be burned down the outhouses were burned along with the house and in one of these the pigs by accident were roasted to a turn memorable were the results for all future china and future civilization ping who like all china beside had hitherto eaten his pig raw now for the first time tasted it in a state of torrefaction of course he made his peace with his father by a part tradition says a leg of the new dish the father was so astounded with the discovery that he burned his house down once a year for the sake of coming at an annual banquet of roast pig a curious prying sort of fellow one chang pang got to know of this he also burned down a house with a pig in it and had his eyes opened the secret was ill kept the discovery spread many great conversions were made houses were blazing in every part of the celestial empire the insurance offices took the matter up one chong pong detected in the very act of shutting up a pig in his drawingroom and then firing a train was indicted on a charge of arson the chief justice of pekin on that occasion requested an officer of the court to hand him a piece of the roast pig the corpus delicti for pure curiosity led him to taste but within two days after it was observed that his lordships townhouse was burned down in short all china apostatized to the new faith and it was not until some centuries had passed that a great genius arose who established the second era in the history of roast pig by showing that it could be had without burning down a house no such genius had yet arisen in rome breakfast was not suspected no prophecy no type of breakfast had been published in fact it took as much time and research to arrive at that great discovery as at the copernican system true it is reader that you have heard of such a word as jentaculum and your dictionary translates that old heathen word by the christian word breakfast but dictionaries one and all are dull deceivers between jentaculum and breakfast the differences are as wide as between a horsechestnut and chestnut horse differences in the time when in the place where in the manner how but preeminently in the thing which galen is a good authority upon such a subject since if like other pagans he ate no breakfast himself in some sense he may be called the cause of breakfast to other men by treating of those things which could safely be taken upon an empty stomach as to the time he like many other authors says peri tritaen ae to makroteron peri tetartaen about the third or at farthest about the fourth hour and so exact is he that he assumes the day to lie exactly between six and six oclock and to be divided into thirteen equal portions so the time will be a few minutes before nine or a few minutes before ten in the forenoon that seems fair enough but it is not time in respect to its location that we are so much concerned with as time in respect to its duration now heaps of authorities take it for granted that you are not to sit down you are to stand and as to the place that any place will do any corner of the forum says galen any corner that you fancy which is like referring a man for his salle manger to westminster hall or fleet street augustus in a letter still surviving tells us that he jentabat or took his jentaculum in his carriage now in a wheel carriage in essedo now in a litter or palanquin in lectic this careless and disorderly way as to time and place and other circumstances of haste sufficiently indicate the quality of the meal you are to expect already you are sagacious of your quarry from so far not that we would presume excellent reader to liken you to death or to insinuate that you are a grim feature but would it not make a saint grim to hear of such preparations for the morning meal and then to hear of such consummations as panis siccus dry bread or if the learned reader thinks it will taste better in greek greek artos xaeros and what may this word dry happen to mean does it mean stale bread says salmasius shall we suppose says he in querulous words molli et recenti opponi and from that antithesis conclude it to be durum et non recens coctum eoque sicciorem hard and stale and for that reason the more arid not quite so bad as that we hope or again siccum pro biscocto ut hodie vocamus sumemus by hodie salmasius means amongst his countrymen of france where biscoctus is verbatim reproduced in the word bis twice cuit baked whence our own biscuit biscuit might do very well could we be sure that it was cabin biscuit but salmasius argues that in this case he takes it to mean buccellatum qui est panis nauticus that is the ship companys biscuit broken with a sledgehammer in greek for the benefit again of the learned reader it is termed greek dipuros indicating that it has passed twice under the action of fire well you say no matter if it had passed fifty times and through the fires of moloch only let us have this biscuit such as it is in good faith then fasting reader you are not likely to see much more than you have seen it is a very barmecide feast we do assure you this same jentaculum at which abstinence and patience are much more exercised than the teeth faith and hope are the chief graces cultivated together with that species of the magnificum which is founded on the ignotum even this biscuit was allowed in the most limited quantities for which reason it is that the greeks called this apology for a a meal by the name of greek bouchismos a word formed as many words were in the postaugustan ages from a latin word viz buccea a mouthful not literally such but so much as a polished man could allow himself to put into his mouth at once we took a mouthful says sir william waller the parliamentary general took a mouthful paid our reckoning mounted and were off but there sir william means by his plausible mouthful something very much beyond either nine or nineteen ordinary quantities of that denomination whereas the roman jentaculum was literally such and accordingly one of the varieties under which the ancient vocabularies express this model of evanescent quantities is gustatio a mere tasting and again it is called by another variety gustus a mere taste whence by the usual suppression of the s comes the french word for a collation or luncheon viz gouter speaking of his uncle pliny the younger says post solem plerumque lavabatur deinde gustabat dormiebat minimum mox quasi alio die studebat in coen tempus after taking the air he bathed after that he broke his fast on a bit of biscuit and took a very slight siesta which done as if awaking to a new day he set in regularly to his studies and pursued them to dinnertime gustabat here meant that nondescript meal which arose at rome when jentaculum and prandium were fused into one and that only a taste or mouthful of biscuit as we shall show farther on possibly however most excellent reader like some epicurean traveller who in crossing the alps finds himself weatherbound at st bernards on ashwednesday you surmise a remedy you descry some opening from the loopholes of retreat through which a few delicacies might be insinuated to spread verdure on this arid desert of biscuit casuistry can do much a dead hand at casuistry has often proved more than a match for lent with all his quarantines but sorry we are to say that in this case no relief is hinted at in any ancient author a grape or two not a bunch of grapes a raisin or two a date an olive these are the whole amount of relief which the chancery of the roman kitchen granted in such cases all things here hang together and prove each other the time the place the mode the thing well might man eat standing or eat in public such a trifle as this go home to such a breakfast as this you would as soon think of ordering a cloth to be laid in order to eat a peach or of asking a friend to join you in an orange no man makes two bites of a cherry so let us pass on to the other stages of the day only in taking leave of this morning stage throw your eyes back with us christian reader upon this truly heathen meal fit for idolatrous dogs like your greeks and your romans survey through the vista of ages that thricecursed biscuit with half a fig perhaps by way of garnish and a huge hammer by its side to secure the certainty of mastication by previous comminution then turn your eyes to a christian breakfast hot rolls eggs coffee beef but down down rebellious visions we need say no more you reader like ourselves will breathe a malediction on the classical era and thank your stars for making you a romanticist every morning we thank ours for keeping us back and reserving us to an age in which breakfast had been already invented in the words of ovid we say prisca juvent alios ego me nunc denique natum gratulor hc tas moribus apta meis our friend the roman cit has therefore thus far in his progress through life obtained no breakfast if he ever contemplated an idea so frantic but it occurs to you our faithful reader that perhaps he will not always be thus unhappy we could bring waggonloads of sentiments greek as well as roman which prove more clearly than the most eminent pikestaff that as the wheel of fortune revolves simply out of the fact that it has carried a man downwards it must subsequently carry him upwards no matter what dislike that wheel or any of its spokes may bear to that man non si male nunc sit et olim sic erit and that if a man through the madness of his nation misses coffee and hot rolls at nine he may easily run into a leg of mutton at twelve true it is he may do so truth is commendable and we will not deny that a man may sometimes by losing a breakfast gain a dinner such things have been in various ages and will be again but not at rome there are reasons against it we have heard of men who consider life under the idea of a wilderness dry as a remainder biscuit after a voyage and who consider a day under the idea of a little life life is the macrocosm or world at large day is the microcosm or world in miniature consequently if life is a wilderness then day as a little life is a little wilderness and this wilderness can be safely traversed only by having relays of fountains or stages for refreshment such stages they conceive are found in the several meals which providence has stationed at due intervals through the day whenever the perverseness of man does not break the chain or derange the order of succession these are the anchors by which man rides in that billowy ocean between morning and night the first anchor viz breakfast having given way in rome the more need there is that he should pull up by the second and that is often reputed to be dinner and as your dictionary good reader translated breakfast by that vain word jentaculum so doubtless it will translate dinner by that still vainer word prandium sincerely we hope that your own dinner on this day and through all time coming may have a better root in fact and substance than this most visionary of all baseless things the roman prandium of which we shall presently show you that the most approved translation is moonshine reader we are not jesting here in the very spirit of serious truth we assure you that the delusion about jentaculum is even exceeded by this other delusion about prandium salmasius himself for whom a natural prejudice of place and time partially obscured the truth admits however that prandium was a meal which the ancients rarely took his very words are raro prandebant veteres now judge for yourself of the good sense which is shown in translating by the word dinner which must of necessity mean the chief meal a roman word which represents a fancy meal a meal of caprice a meal which few people took at this moment what is the single point of agreement between the noon meal of the english laborer and the evening meal of the english gentleman what is the single circumstance common to both which causes us to denominate them by the common name of dinner it is that in both we recognize the principal meal of the day the meal upon which is thrown the onus of the days support in everything else they are as wide asunder as the poles but they agree in this one point of their function is it credible that to represent such a meal amongst ourselves we select a roman word so notoriously expressing a mere shadow a pure apology that very few people ever tasted it nobody sate down to it not many washed their hands after it and gradually the very name of it became interchangeable with another name implying the slightest possible act of trying or sipping post larationem sine mens prandium says seneca post quod non sunt lavand manus that is after bathing i take a prandium without sitting down to table and such a prandium as brings after itself no need of washing the hands no moonshine as little soils the hands as it oppresses the stomach reader we as well as pliny had an uncle an east indian uncle doubtless you have such an uncle everybody has an indian uncle generally such a person is rather yellow rather yellow to quote canning versus lord durham that is the chief fault with his physics but as to his morals he is universally a man of princely aspirations and habits he is not always so orientally rich as he is reputed but he is always orientally munificent call upon him at any hour from two to five he insists on your taking tiffin and such a tiffin the english corresponding term is luncheon but how meagre a shadow is the european meal to its glowing asiatic cousin still gloriously as tiffin shines does anybody imagine that it is a vicarious dinner or ever meant to be the substitute of dinner wait till eight and you will have your eyes opened on that subject so of the roman prandium had it been as luxurious as it was simple still it was always viewed as something meant only to stay the stomach as a prologue to something beyond the prandium was far enough from giving the feeblest idea of the english luncheon yet it stood in the same relation to the roman day now to englishmen that meal scarcely exists and were it not for women whose delicacy of organization does not allow them to fast so long as men would probably be abolished it is singular in this as in other points how nearly england and ancient rome approximate we all know how hard it is to tempt a man generally into spoiling his appetite by eating before dinner the same dislike of violating what they called the integrity of the appetite integram famem existed at rome every man who knows anything of latin critically sees the connection of the word integer with in and tetigi integer means what is intact unviolated by touch cicero when protesting against spoiling his appetite for dinner by tasting anything beforehand says integram famem ad coenam afferam i shall bring to dinner an appetite untampered with nay so much stress did the romans lay on maintaining this primitive state of the appetite undisturbed that any prelusions with either jentaculum or prandium were said by a very strong phrase indeed polluere famem to pollute the sanctity of the appetite the appetite was regarded as a holy vestal flame soaring upwards towards dinner throughout the day if undebauched it tended to its natural consummation in coena expired like a phoenix to rise again out of its own ashes on this theory to which language had accommodated itself the two prelusive meals of nine oclock am and of one pm so far from being ratified by the public sense and adopted into the economy of the day were regarded gloomily as gross irregularities enormities debauchers of the natural instinct and in so far as they thwarted that instinct lessened it or depraved it were universally held to be full of pollution and finally to profane a motion of nature such was the language but we guess what is passing in the readers mind he thinks that all this proves the prandium to have been a meal of little account and in very many cases absolutely unknown but still he thinks all this might happen to the english dinner that might be neglected supper might be generally preferred and nevertheless dinner would be as truly entitled to the name of dinner as before many a student neglects his dinner enthusiasm in any pursuit must often have extinguished appetite for all of us many a time and oft did this happen to sir isaac newton evidence is on record that such a deponent at eight oclock am found sir isaac with one stocking on one off at two said deponent called him to dinner being interrogated whether sir isaac had pulled on the minus stocking or gartered the plus stocking witness replied that he had not being asked if sir isaac came to dinner replied that he did not being again asked at sunset did you look in on sir isaac witness replied i did and now upon your conscience sir by the virtue of your oath in what state were the stockings ans in statu quo ante bellum it seems sir isaac had fought through that whole battle of a long day so trying a campaign to many people be had traversed that whole sandy zaarah without calling or needing to call at one of those fountains stages or mansiones by which according to our former explanation providence has relieved the continuity of arid soil which else disfigures that long dreary level this happens to all but was dinner not dinner and did supper become dinner because sir isaac newton ate nothing at the first and threw the whole days support upon the last no you will say a rule is not defeated by one casual deviation nor by one persons constant deviation everybody else was still dining at two though sir isaac might not and sir isaac himself on most days no more deferred his dinner beyond two than he sate with one stocking off but what if everybody sir isaac included had deferred his substantial meal until night and taken a slight refection only at two the question put does really represent the very case which has happened with us in england in a large part of london took a meal at two pm and another at seven or eight pm in a large part of london is still doing the very same thing taking one meal at two and another at seven or eight but the names are entirely changed the two oclock meal used to be called dinner and is now called luncheon the eight oclock meal used to be called supper and is now called dinner now the question is easily solved because upon reviewing the idea of dinner we soon perceive that time has little or no connection with it since both in england and france dinner has travelled like the hand of a clock through every hour between ten am and ten pm we have a list well attested of every successive hour between these limits having been the known established hour for the royal dinnertable within the last three hundred and fifty years time therefore vanishes from the equation it is a quantity as regularly exterminated as in any algebraic problem the true elements of the idea are evidently these that dinner is that meal no matter when taken which is the principal meal ie the meal on which the days support is thrown that it is the meal of hospitality that it is the meal with reference to both nos and in which animal food predominates that it is that meal which upon necessity arising for the abolition of all but one would naturally offer itself as that one apply these four tests to prandium how could that meal answer to the first test as the days support which few people touched how could that meal answer to the second test as the meal of hospitality at which nobody sate down how could that meal answer to the third test as the meal of animal food which consisted exclusively and notoriously of bread or to the fourth test of the meal entitled to survive the abolition of the rest which was itself abolished at all times in practice tried therefore by every test prandium vanishes but we have something further to communicate about this same prandium i it came to pass by a very natural association of feeling that prandium and jentuculum in the latter centuries of rome were generally confounded this result was inevitable both professed the same basis both came in the morning both were fictions hence they were confounded that fact speaks for itself breakfast and luncheon never could have been confounded but who would be at the pains of distinguishing two shadows in a gamblinghouse of that class where you are at liberty to sit down to a splendid banquet anxiety probably prevents your sitting down at all but if you do the same cause prevents your noticing what you eat so of the two pseudo meals of rome they came in the very midst of the roman business viz from nine am to two pm nobody could give his mind to them had they been of better quality there lay one cause of their vagueness viz in their position another cause was the common basis of both bread was so notoriously the predominating feature in each of these prelusive banquets that all foreigners at rome who communicated with romans through the greek language knew both the one and the other by the name of greek artositos or the bread repast originally this name had been restricted to the earlier meal but a distinction without a difference could not sustain itself and both alike disguised their emptiness under this pompous quadrisyllable in the identity of substance therefore lay a second ground of confusion and then thirdly even as to the time which had ever been the sole real distinction there arose from accident a tendency to converge for it happened that while some had jentaculum but no prandium others had prandium but no jentaculum a third party had both a fourth party by much the largest had neither out of which varieties who would think that a nonentity could cut up into so many somethings arose a fifth party of compromisers who because they could not afford a regular coena and yet were hospitably disposed fused the two ideas into one and so because the usual time for the idea of a breakfast was nine to ten and for the idea of a luncheon twelve to one compromised the rival pretensions by what diplomatists call a mezzo termine bisecting the time at eleven and melting the two ideas into one but by thus merging the separate times of each they abolished the sole real difference that had ever divided them losing that they lost all perhaps as two negatives make one affirmative it may be thought that two layers of moonshine might coalesce into one pancake and two barmecide banquets might compose one poached egg of that the company were the best judges but probably as a rump and dozen in our land of wagers is construed with a very liberal latitude as to the materials so martials invitation to take bread with him at eleven might be understood by the greek sunetoi as significant of something better than greek artositos otherwise in good truth moonshine and turnout at eleven am would be even worse than tea and turnout at eight pm which the fervida juventus of young england so loudly detests but however that might be in this convergement of the several frontiers and the confusion that ensued one cannot wonder that whilst the two bladders collapsed into one idea they actually expanded into four names two latin and two greek gustus and gustatio greek geusis and greek geusma which all alike express the merely tentative or exploratory act of a prgustator or professional taster in a kings household what if applied to a fluid we should denominate sipping at last by so many steps all in one direction things had come to such a pass the two prelusive meals of the roman morning each for itself separately vague from the beginning had so communicated and interfused their several and joint vaguenesses that at last no man knew or cared to know what any other man included in his idea of either how much or how little and you might as well have hunted in the woods of ethiopia for prester john or fixed the parish of the everlasting jew as have attempted to say what jentaculum might be or what prandium only one thing was clear what they were not neither was or wished to be anything that people cared for they were both empty shadows but shadows as they were we find from cicero that they had a power of polluting and profaning better things than themselves we presume that no rational man will henceforth look for dinner that great idea according to dr johnson that sacred idea according to cicero in a bag of moonshine on one side or a bag of pollution on the other prandium so far from being what our foolish dictionaries pretend dinner itself never in its palmiest days was more or other than a miserable attempt at being luncheon it was a conatus what physiologists call a nisus a struggle in a very ambitious spark or scintilla to kindle into a fire this nisus went on for some centuries but finally issued in smoke if prandium had worked out his ambition had the great stream of tendency accomplished all his wishes prandium never could have been more than a very indifferent luncheon but now ii we have to offer another fact ruinous to our dictionaries on another ground various circumstances have disguised the truth but a truth it is that prandium in its very origin and incunabula never was a meal known to the roman culina in that court it was never recognized except as an alien it had no original domicile in the city of rome it was a vot casfrensis a word and an idea purely martial and pointing to martial necessities amongst the new ideas proclaimed to the recruit this was one look for no coenu no regular dinner with us resign these unwarlike notions it is true that even war has its respites in these it would be possible to have our roman coena with all its equipage of ministrations such luxury untunes the mind for doing and suffering let us voluntarily renounce it that when a necessity of renouncing it arrives we may not feel it among the hardships of war from the day when you enter the gates of the camp reconcile yourself tyro to a new fashion of meal to what in camp dialect we call prandium this prandium this essentially military meal was taken standing by way of symbolizing the necessity of being always ready for the enemy hence the posture in which it was taken at rome the very counterpole to the luxurious posture of dinner a writer of the third century a period from which the romans naturally looked back upon everything connected with their own early habits and with the same kind of interest as we extend to our alfred separated from us as romulus from them by just a thousand years in speaking of prandium says quod dictum est parandium ab eo quod milites ad bellum paret isidorus again says proprie apud veteres prandium vocatum fuisse oinnem militum cibum ante pugnam ie that properly speaking amongst our ancestors every military meal taken before battle was termed prandium according to isidore the proposition is reciprocating viz that as every prandium was a military meal so every military meal was called prandium but in fact the reason of that is apparent whether in the camp or the city the early romans had probably but one meal in a day that is true of many a man amongst ourselves by choice it is true also to our knowledge of some horse regiments in our service and may be of all this meal was called coena or dinner in the city prandium in camps in the city it would always be tending to one fixed hour in the camp innumerable accidents of war would make it very uncertain on this account it would be an established rule to celebrate the daily meal at noon if nothing hindered not that a later hour would not have been preferred had the choice been free but it was better to have a certainty at a bad hour than by waiting for a better hour to make it an uncertainty for it was a camp proverb pransus paratus armed with his daily meal the soldier is ready for service it was not however that all meals as isidore imagined were indiscriminately called prandium but that the one sole meal of the day by accidents of war might and did revolve through all hours of the day the first introduction of this military meal into rome itself would be through the honorable pedantry of old centurions c delighting like the trunnions c of our navy to keep up in peaceful life some image or memorial of their past experience so wild so full of peril excitement and romance as roman warfare must have been in those ages many nonmilitary people for healths sake many as an excuse for eating early many by way of interposing some refreshment between the stages of forensic business would adopt this hurried and informal meal many would wish to see their sons adopting such a meal as a training for foreign service in particular and for temperance in general it would also be maintained by a solemn and very interesting commemoration of this camp repast in rome this commemoration because it has been grossly misunderstood by salmasius whose error arose from not marking the true point of a particular antithesis and still more because it is a distinct confirmation of all we have said as to the military nature of prandium we shall detach from the series of our illustrations by placing it in a separate paragraph on a set day the officers of the army were invited by csar to a banquet it was a circumstance expressly noticed in the invitation by the proper officers of the palace that the banquet was not a coena but a prandium what followed in consequence why that all the guests sate down in full military accoutrement whereas observes the historian had it been a coena the officers would have unbelted their swords for he adds even in csars presence the officers lay aside their swords the word prandium in short converted the palace into the imperial tent and csar was no longer a civil emperor and princeps senats but became a commanderinchief amongst a council of his staff all belted and plumed and in full military fig on this principle we come to understand why it is that whenever the latin poets speak of an army as taking food the word used is always prandens and pransus and when the word used is prandens then always it is an army that is concerned thus juvenal in a wellknown satire credimus altos desiccasse amnes epotaque ftumina medo prandente not coenante observe you might as well talk of an army taking tea and toast nor is that word ever applied to armies it is true that the converse is not so rigorously observed nor ought it from the explanations already given though no soldier dined coenabat yet the citizen sometimes adopted the camp usage and took a prandium but generally the poets use the word merely to mark the time of day in that most humorous appeal of perseus cur quis non prandeat hoc est is this a sufficient reason for losing ones prandium he was obliged to say prandium because no exhibitions ever could cause a man to lose his coenia since none were displayed at a time of day when anybody in rome would have attended just as in alluding to a parliamentary speech notoriously delivered at midnight an english satirist must have said is this a speech to furnish an argument for leaving ones bed not as what stood foremost in his regard but as the only thing that could be lost at the time of night on this principle also viz by going back to the military origin of prandium we gain the interpretation of all the peculiarities attached to it viz its early hour its being taken in a standing posture in the open air the humble quality of its materials bread and biscuit the main articles of military fare in all these circumstances of the meal we read most legibly written the exotic and military character of the meal thus we have brought down our roman friend to noonday or even one hour later than noon and to this moment the poor man has had nothing to eat for supposing him to be not impransus and supposing him jentsse beside yet it is evident we hope that neither one nor the other means more than what it was often called viz greek bouchismos or in plain english a mouthful how long do we intend to keep him waiting reader he will dine at three or supposing dinner put off to the latest at four dinner was never known to be later than the tenth hour in rome which in summer would be past five but for a far greater proportion of days would be near four in rome except for one or two of the emperors whom the mere business attached to their unhappy station kept sometimes dinnerless till six and so entirely was a roman the creature of ceremony that a national mourning would probably have been celebrated and the sad augurs would have been called in to expiate the prodigy had the general dinner lingered beyond four but meantime what has our friend been about since perhaps six or seven in the morning after paying his little homage to his patronus in what way has he fought with the great enemy time since then why reader this illustrates one of the most interesting features in the roman character the roman was the idlest of men man and boy he was an idler in the land he called himself and his pals rerum dominos gentemque togatam the gentry that wore the toga yes and a pretty affair that toga was just figure to yourself reader the picture of a hardworking man with horny hands like our hedgers ditchers weavers porters c setting to work on the highroad in that vast sweeping toga filling with a strong gale like the mainsail of a frigate conceive the roars with which this magnificent figure would be received into the bosom of a poorhouse detachment sent out to attack the stones on some new line of road or a fatigue party of dustmen sent upon secret service had there been nothing left as a memorial of the romans but that one relic their immeasurable toga we should have known that they were born and bred to idleness in fact except in war the roman never did anything at all but sun himself ut se apricaret was the final cause of peace in his opinion in literal truth that he might make an apricot of himself the public rations at all times supported the poorest inhabitant of rome if he were a citizen hence it was that hadrian was so astonished with the spectacle of alexandria civitas opulenta fcunda in qua nemo vivat otiosus here first he saw the spectacle of a vast city second only to rome where every man had something to do podagrosi quod agant habent habent cci quod faciant ne chiragrici those with gout in the fingers apud eos otiosi vivunt no poor rates levied upon the rest of the world for the benefit of their own paupers were there distributed gratis the prodigious spectacle so it seemed to hadrian was exhibited in alexandria of all men earning their bread in the sweat of their brow in rome only and at one time in some of the grecian states it was the very meaning of citizen that he could vote and be idle in these circumstances where the whole sum of lifes duties amounted to voting all the business a man could have was to attend the public assemblies electioneering or factious these and any judicial trial public or private that might happen to interest him for the persons concerned or for the questions amused him through the morning that is from eight till one he might also extract some diversion from the column or pillars of certain porticoes to which they pasted advertisements these affiches must have been numerous for all the girls in rome who lost a trinket or a pet bird or a lapdog took this mode of angling in the great ocean of the public for the missing articles but all this time we take for granted that there were no shows in a course of exhibition either the dreadful ones of the amphitheatre or the bloodless ones of the circus if there were then that became the business of all romans and it was a business which would have occupied him from daylight until the light began to fail here we see another effect from the scarcity of artificial light amongst the ancients these magnificent shows went on by daylight but how incomparably greater would have been the splendor by lamplight what a gigantic conception eighty thousand human faces all revealed under one blaze of lamplight lord bacon saw the mighty advantage of candlelight for the pomps and glories of this world but the poverty of the earth was the ultimate cause that the pagan shows proceeded by day not that the masters of the world who rained arabian odors and perfumed waters of the most costly description from a thousand fountains simply to cool the summer heats would have regarded the expense of light cedar and other odorous woods burning upon vast altars together with every variety of fragrant torch would have created light enough to shed a new day over the distant adriatic however as there are no public spectacles we will suppose and the courts or political meetings if not closed altogether by superstition would at any rate be closed in the ordinary course by twelve or one oclock nothing remains for him to do before returning home except perhaps to attend the palstra or some public recitation of a poem written by a friend but in any case to attend the public baths for these the time varied and many people have thought it tyrannical in some of the csars that they imposed restraints on the time open for the baths some for instance would not suffer them to open at all before two and in any case if you were later than four or five in summer you would have to pay a fine which most effectually cleaned out the baths of all raff since it was a sum that john quires could not have produced to save his life but it should be considered that the emperor was the steward of the public resources for maintaining the baths in fuel oil attendance repairs we are prepared to show on a fitting occasion that every fourth person amongst the citizens bathed daily and noncitizens of course paid an extra sum now the population of rome was far larger than has ever been hinted at except by lipsius but certain it is that during the long peace of the first csars and after the annonaria prorisio that great pledge of popularity to a roman prince had been increased by the corn tribute from the nile the roman population took an immense lurch ahead the subsequent increase of baths whilst no old ones were neglected proves that decisively and as citizenship expanded by means of the easy terms on which it could be had so did the bathers multiply the population of rome in the century after augustus was far greater than during that era and this still acting as a vortex to the rest of the world may have been one great motive with constantine for transferring the capital eastwards in reality for breaking up one monster capital into two of more manageable dimensions two oclock was often the earliest hour at which the public baths were opened but in martials time a man could go without blushing salv fronte at eleven though even then two oclock was the meridian hour for the great uproar of splashing and swimming and larking in the endless baths of endless rome and now at last bathing finished and the exercises of the palstra at halfpast two or three our friend finds his way home not again to leave it for that day he is now a new man refreshed oiled with perfumes his dust washed off by hot water and ready for enjoyment these were the things that determined the time for dinner had there been no other proof that coena was the roman dinner this is an ample one now first the roman was fit for dinner in a condition of luxurious ease business ever that days load of anxiety laid aside his cuticle as he delighted to talk cleansed and polished nothing more to do or to think of until the next morning he might now go and dine and get drunk with a safe conscience besides if he does not get dinner now when will he get it for most demonstrably he has taken nothing yet which comes near in value to that basin of soup which many of ourselves take at the roman hour of bathing no we have kept our man fasting as yet it is to be hoped that something is coming at last it does come dinner the great meal of coena the meal sacred to hospitality and genial pleasure comes now to fill up the rest of the day until light fails altogether many people are of opinion that the romans only understood what the capabilities of dinner were it is certain that they were the first great people that discovered the true secret and meaning of dinner the great office which it fulfils and which we in england are now so generally acting on barbarous nations and none were in that respect more barbarous than our own ancestors made this capital blunder the brutes if you asked them what was the use of dinner what it was meant for stared at you and replied as a horse would reply if you put the same question about his provender that it was to give him strength for finishing his work therefore if you point your telescope back to antiquity about twelve or one oclock in the daytime you will descry our most worthy ancestors all eating for their very lives eating as dogs eat viz in bodily fear that some other dog will come and take their dinner away what swelling of the veins in the temples see boswells natural history of dr johnson at dinner what intense and rapid deglutition what odious clatter of knives and plates what silence of the human voice what gravity what fury in the libidinous eyes with which they contemplate the dishes positively it was an indecent spectacle to see dr johnson at dinner but above all what maniacal haste and hurry as if the fiend were waiting with redhot pincers to lay hold of the hindermost oh reader do you recognize in this abominable picture your respected ancestors and ours excuse us for saying what monsters we have a right to call our own ancestors monsters and if so we must have the same right over yours for dr southey has shown plainly in the doctor that every man having four grand parents in the second stage of ascent each of whom having four therefore sixteen in the third and so on long before you get to the conquest every man and woman then living in england will be wanted to make up the sum of my separate ancestors consequently you must take your ancestors out of the very same fund or if you are too proud for that you must go without ancestors so that your ancestors being clearly mine i have a right in law to call the whole kit of them monsters quod erat demonstrandum really and upon our honor it makes one for the moment ashamed of ones descent one would wish to disinherit onesself backwards and as sheridan says in the rivals to cut the connection wordsworth has an admirable picture in peter bell of a snug party in a parlor removed into limbus patrum for their offences in the flesh cramming as they on earth were crammd all sipping wine all sipping tea but as you by their faces see all silent and all d d how well does that one word describe those venerable ancestral dinners all silent contrast this infernal silence of voice and fury of eye with the risus amabilis the festivity the social kindness the music the wine the dulcis insania of a roman coena we mentioned four tests for determining what meal is and what is not dinner we may now add a fifth viz the spirit of festal joy and elegant enjoyment of anxiety laid aside and of honorable social pleasure put on like a marriage garment and what caused the difference between our ancestors and the romans simply this the error of interposing dinner in the middle of business thus courting all the breezes of angry feeling that may happen to blow from the business yet to come instead of finishing absolutely closing the account with this worlds troubles before you sit down that unhappy interpolation ruined all dinner was an ugly little parenthesis between two still uglier clauses of a teetotally ugly sentence whereas with us their enlightened posterity to whom they have the honor to be ancestors dinner is a great reaction there lies our conception of the matter it grew out of the very excess of the evil when business was moderate dinner was allowed to divide and bisect it when it swelled into that vast strife and agony as one may call it that boils along the tortured streets of modern london or other capitals men began to see the necessity of an adequate counterforce to push against this overwhelming torrent and thus maintain the equilibrium were it not for the soft relief of a six oclock dinner the gentle manner succeeding to the boisterous hubbub of the day the soft glowing lights the wine the intellectual conversation life in london is now come to such a pass that in two years all nerves would sink before it but for this periodic reaction the modern business which draws so cruelly on the brain and so little on the hands would overthrow that organ in all but those of coarse organization dinner it is meaning by dinner the whole complexity of attendant circumstances which saves the modern brainworking men from going mad this revolution as to dinner was the greatest in virtue and value ever accomplished in fact those are always the most operative revolutions which are brought about through social or domestic changes a nation must be barbarous neither could it have much intellectual business which dined in the morning they could not be at ease in the morning so much must be granted every day has its separate quantum its dose as the doctrinists of rent phrase it of anxiety that could not be digested so soon as noon no man will say it he therefore who dined at noon was willing to sit down squalid as he was with his dress unchanged his cares not washed off and what follows from that why that to him to such a canine or cynical specimen of the genus homo dinner existed only as a physical event a mere animal relief a mere carnal enjoyment for what we demand did this fleshly creature differ from the carrion crow or the kite or the vulture or the cormorant a french judge in an action upon a wager laid it down in law that man only had a bouche all other animals had a gueule only with regard to the horse in consideration of his beauty nobility use and in honor of the respect with which man regarded him by the courtesy of christendom he might be allowed to have a bouche and his reproach of brutality if not taken away might thus be hidden but surely of the rabid animal who is caught dining at noonday the homo ferus who affronts the meridian sun like thyestes and atreus by his inhuman meals we are by parity of reason entitled to say that he has a maw so has miltons death but nothing resembling stomach and to this vile man a philosopher would say go away sir and come back to me two or three centuries hence when you have learned to be a reasonable creature and to make that physicointellectual thing out of dinner which it was meant to be and is capable of becoming in henry viis time the court dined at eleven in the forenoon but even that hour was considered so shockingly late in the french court that louis xii actually had his gray hairs brought down with sorrow to the grave by changing his regular hour of halfpast nine for eleven in gallantry to his young english bride he fell a victim to late hours in the forenoon in cromwells time they dined at one pm one century and a half had carried them on by two hours doubtless old cooks and scullions wondered what the world would come to next our french neighbors were in the same predicament but they far surpassed us in veneration for the meal they actually dated from it dinner constituted the great era of the day lapres diner is almost the sole date which you find in cardinal de retzs memoirs of the fronde dinner was their hegira dinner was their line in traversing the ocean of day they crossed the equator when they dined our english revolution came next it made some little difference we have heard people say in church and state but its great effects were perceived in dinner people now dined at two so dined addison for his last thirty years so dined pope who was coeval with the revolution through his entire life precisely as the rebellion of arose did people but observe very great people advance to four pm philosophers who watch the semina rerum and the first symptoms of change had perceived this alteration singing in the upper air like a coming storm some little time before about the year pope complains to a friend of lady suffolks dining so late as four young people may bear those things he observes but as to himself now turned of fifty if such doings went on if lady suffolk would adopt such strange hours he must really absent himself from marble hill lady suffolk had a right to please herself he himself loved her but if she would persist all which remained for a decayed poet was respectfully to cut his stick and retire whether pope ever put up with four oclock dinners again we have vainly sought to fathom some things advance continuously like a flood or a fire which always make an end of a eat and digest it before they go on to b other things advance per saltum they do not silently cancer their way onwards but lie as still as a snake after they have made some notable conquest then when unobserved they make themselves up for mischief and take a flying bound onwards thus advanced dinner and by these fits got into the territory of evening and ever as it made a motion onwards it found the nation more civilized else the change would not have been effected and raised them to a still higher civilization the next relay on that line of road the next repeating frigate is cowper in his poem on conversation he speaks of four oclock as still the elegant hour for dinner the hour for the lautiores and the lepidi homines now this was written about or a little earlier perhaps therefore just one generation after popes lady suffolk but then cowper was living amongst the rural gentry not in high life yet again cowper was nearly connected by blood with the eminent whig house of cowper and acknowledged as a kinsman about twentyfive years after this we may take oxford as a good exponent of the national advance as a magnificent body of foundations endowed by kings and resorted to by the flower of the national youth oxford is always elegant and even splendid in her habits yet on the other hand as a grave seat of learning and feeling the weight of her position in the commonwealth she is slow to move she is inert as she should be having the functions of resistance assigned to her against the popular instinct of movement now in oxford about there was a general move in the dinner hour those colleges who dined at three of which there were still several now dined at four those who had dined at four now translated their hour to five these continued good general hours but still amongst the more intellectual orders till about waterloo after that era six which had been somewhat of a gala hour was promoted to the fixed station of dinnertime in ordinary and there perhaps it will rest through centuries for a more festal dinner seven eight nine ten have all been in requisition since then but we have not yet heard of any mans dining later than pm except in that single classical instance so well remembered from our father joe of an irishman who must have dined much later than ten because his servant protested when others were enforcing the dignity of their masters by the lateness of their dinner hours that his master dined tomorrow were the romans not as barbarous as our own ancestors at one time most certainly they were in their primitive ages they took their coena at noon that was before they had laid aside their barbarism before they shaved it was during their barbarism and in consequence of their barbarism that they timed their coena thus unseasonably and this is made evident by the fact that so long as they erred in the hour they erred in the attending circumstances at this period they had no music at dinner no festal graces and no reposing upon sofas they sate bolt upright in chairs and were as grave as our ancestors as rabid and doubtless as furiously in haste with us the revolution has been equally complex we do not indeed adopt the luxurious attitude of semirecumbency our climate makes that less requisite and moreover the romans had no knives and forks which could scarcely be used in that posture they ate with their fingers from dishes already cut up whence the peculiar force of senecas post quod non sunt lavand manus but exactly in proportion as our dinner has advanced towards evening have we and has that advanced in circumstances of elegance of taste of intellectual value that by itself would be much infinite would be the gain for any people that it had ceased to be brutal animal fleshly ceased to regard the chief meal of the day as a ministration only to an animal necessity that they had raised it to a far higher standard associated it with social and humanizing feelings with manners with graces both moral and intellectual moral in the selfrestraint intellectual in the fact notorious to all men that the chief arenas for the easy display of intellectual power are at our dinner tables but dinner has now even a greater function than this as the fervor of our days business increases dinner is continually more needed in its office of a great reaction we repeat that at this moment but for the daily relief of dinner the brain of all men who mix in the strife of capitals would be unhinged and thrown off its centre if we should suppose the case of a nation taking three equidistant meals all of the same material and the same quantity all milk for instance it would be impossible for thomas aquinas himself to say which was or was not dinner the case would be that of the roman ancile which dropped from the skies to prevent its ever being stolen the priests made eleven facsimiles of it that the thief seeing the hopelessness of distinguishing the true one might let all alone and the result was that in the next generation nobody could point to the true one but our dinner the roman coena is distinguished from the rest by far more than the hour it is distinguished by great functions and by still greater capacities it is most beneficial it may become more so in saying this we point to the lighter graces of music and conversation more varied by which the roman coena was chiefly distinguished from our dinner we are far from agreeing with mr croly that the roman meal was more intellectual than ours on the contrary ours is the more intellectual by much we have far greater knowledge far greater means for making it such in fact the fault of our meal is that it is too intellectual of too severe a character too political too much tending in many hands to disquisition reciprocation of question and answer variety of topics shifting of topics are points not sufficiently cultivated in all else we assent to the following passage from mr crolys eloquent salathiel if an ancient roman could start from his slumber into the midst of european life he must look with scorn on its absence of grace elegance and fancy but it is in its festivity and most of all in its banquets that he would feel the incurable barbarism of the gothic blood contrasted with the fine displays that made the table of the roman noble a picture and threw over the indulgence of appetite the colors of the imagination with what eyes must he contemplate the tasteless and commonplace dress the coarse attendants the meagre ornament the want of mirth music and intellectual interest the whole heavy machinery that converts the feast into the mere drudgery of devouring thus far the reader knows already that we dissent violently and by looking back he will see a picture of our ancestors at dinner in which they rehearse the very part in relation to ourselves that mr croly supposes all moderns to rehearse in relation to the romans but in the rest of the beautiful description the positive though not the comparative part we must all concur the guests before me were fifty or sixty splendidly dressed men they were in fact titus and his staff then occupied with the siege of jerusalem attended by a crowd of domestics attired with scarcely less splendor for no man thought of coming to the banquet in the robes of ordinary life the embroidered couches themselves striking objects allowed the ease of position at once delightful in the relaxing climates of the south and capable of combining with every grace of the human figure at a slight distance the table loaded with plate glittering under a profusion of lamps and surrounded by couches thus covered by rich draperies was like a central source of light radiating in broad shafts of every brilliant hue the wealth of the patricians and their intercourse with the greeks made them masters of the first performances of the arts copies of the most famous statues and groups of sculpture in the precious metals trophies of victories models of temples were mingled with vases of flowers and lighted perfumes finally covering and closing all was a vast scarlet canopy which combined the groups beneath to the eye and threw the whole into the form that a painter would love mr croly then goes on to insist on the intellectual embellishments of the roman dinner their variety their grace their adaptation to a festive purpose the truth is our english imagination more profound than the roman is also more gloomy less gay less riante that accounts for our want of the gorgeous trictinium with its scarlet draperies and for many other differences both to the eye and to the understanding but both we and the romans agree in the main point we both discovered the true purpose which dinner might serve to throw the grace of intellectual enjoyment over an animal necessity to relieve and antagonize the toil of brain incident to high forms of social life our object has been to point the eye to this fact to show uses imperfectly suspected in a recurring accident of life to show a steady tendency to that consummation by holding up as in a mirror together with occasional glimpses of hidden corners in history the corresponding revolution silently going on in a great people of antiquity notes note in procinct miltons translation somewhere in the paradise regained of the technical phrase in procinctu note geologists know not observe reader we are not at all questioning the scriptural chronology of the earth as a habitation for man for on the prehuman earth scripture is silent not upon the six thousand years does our doubt revolve but upon a very different thing viz to what age in man these six thousand years correspond by analogy in a planet in man the sixtieth part is a very venerable age but as to a planet as to our little earth instead of arguing dotage six thousand years may have scarcely carried her beyond babyhood some people think she is cutting her first teeth some think her in her teens but seriously it is a very interesting problem do the sixty centuries of our earth imply youth maturity or dotage note everywhere the ancients went to bed like good boys from seven to nine oclock as we are perfectly serious we must beg the reader who fancies any joke in all this to consider what an immense difference it must have made to the earth considered as a steward of her own resourceswhether great nations in a period when their resources were so feebly developed did or did not for many centuries require candles and we may add fire the five heads of human expenditure are food shelter clothing fuel light all were pitched on a lower scale in the pagan era and the two last were almost banished from ancient housekeeping what a great relief this must have been to our good mother the earth who at first was obliged to request of her children that they would settle round the mediterranean she could not even afford them water unless they would come and fetch it themselves out of a common tank or cistern note the manesalutantes there can be no doubt that the levees of modern princes and ministers have been inherited from this ancient usage of rome one which belonged to rome republican as well as rome imperial the fiction in our modern practice is that we wait upon the lev or rising of the prince in france at one era this fiction was realized the courtiers did really attend the kings dressing and as to the queen even up to the revolution marie antoinette almost from necessity gave audience at her toilette note or again siccum pro biscodo ut hodie vocamus sumemus it is odd enough that a scholar so complete as salmasius whom nothing ever escapes should have overlooked so obvious an alternative as that of siccus meaning without opsonium scotic without kitchen note the whole amount of relief from which it appears how grossly locke see his education was deceived in fancying that augustus practised any remarkable abstinence in taking only a bit of bread and a raisin or two by way of luncheon augustus did no more than most people did secondly he abstained only with a view to dinner and thirdly for this dinner he never waited longer than up to four oclock note mansiones the halts of the roman legions the stationary places of repose which divided the marches were so called note the everlasting jew the german name for what we english call the wandering jew the german imagination has been most struck with the duration of the mans life and his unhappy sanctity from death the english by the unrestingness of the mans life his incapacity of repose note immeasurable toga it is very true that in the time of augustus the toga had disappeared amongst the lowest plebs and greatly augustus was shocked at that spectacle it is a very curious fact in itself especially as expounding the main cause of the civil wars mere poverty and the absence of bribery from rome whilst all popular competition for offices drooped can alone explain this remarkable revolution of dress note that boys in the prtexta did not bathe in the public baths is certain and most unquestionably that is the meaning of the expression in juvenal so much disputed nisi qui nondum re lavantur by s he means the ahenum a common name for the public bath which was made of copper in our navy the coppers is a name for the boilers nobody believes in such tales except children is the meaning this one exclusion cut off three eighths of the roman males note his young english bride the case of an old man or one reputed old marrying a very girlish wife is always too much for the gravity of history and rather than lose the joke the historian prudently disguises the age which after all was little above fifty and the very persons who insist on the late dinner as the proximate cause of death elsewhere insinuate something else not so decorously expressed it is odd that this amiable prince so memorable as having been a martyr to late dining at eleven am was the same person who is so equally memorable for the noble answer about a king of france not remembering the wrongs of a duke of orleans note took their coena at noon and by the way in order to show how little coena had to do with any evening hour though in any age but that of our fathers four in the afternoon would never have been thought an evening hour in the sense implied by supper the roman gourmands and bons vivants continued through the very last ages of rome to take their coena when more than usually sumptuous at noon this indeed all people did occasionally just as we sometimes give a dinner even now so early as four pm under the name of a dejeuner la fourchette those who took their coena so early as this were said de die coenare to begin dining from high day just as the line in horace ut jugulent homines surgunt de nocte latrones does not mean that the robbers rise when others are going to bed viz at nightfall but at midnight for says one of the three best scholars of this earth de die de nocte mean from that hour which was most fully most intensely day or night viz the centre the meridian this one fact is surely a clencher as to the question whether coena meant dinner or supper
