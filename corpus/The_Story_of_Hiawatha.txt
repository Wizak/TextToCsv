give me of your roots o tamarack take my bait o king of fishes he began his mystic dances held by unseen hands but sinking and each figure had a meaning hurled the pine cones down upon him westward westward hiawatha sailed into the fiery sunset the story of hiawatha i the peacepipe long ago when our cities were pleasant woodlands and the white man was far beyond the seas the great manito god of all the indians descended to the earth from the red crags of the great red pipestone quarry he gazed upon the country that he ruled and a silver river gushed from his footprints and turned to gold as it met the morning sun the great manito stooped to gather some of the red stone of the quarry and molded it with giant fingers into a mighty pipebowl he plucked a reed from the river bank for a pipestem filled the pipe with the bark of the willow breathed upon the forest until the great boughs chafed together into flame and there alone upon the mountains he smoked the pipe of peace the smoke rose high and slowly in the air far above the tops of the tallest pinetrees it rose in a thin blue line so that all the nations might see and hasten at the summons of the great manito and the smoke as it rose grew thicker and purer and whiter rolling and unfolding in the air until it glistened like a great white fleecy cloud that touched the top of heaven the indians saw it from the valley of wyoming and from tuscaloosa and the faroff rocky mountains and their prophets said come and obey the summons of the great manito who calls the tribes of men to council over the prairies down the rivers through the forests from north and south and east and west the red men hastened to approach the smokecloud there were delawares and dacotahs and choctaws and comanches and pawnees and blackfeet and shoshonies all the tribes of indians in the world and one and all they gathered at the pipestone quarry where the great manito stood and waited for them and the great manito saw that they glared at one another angrily and he stretched his right hand over them and said my children i have given you a happy land where you may fish and hunt i have filled the rivers with the trout and sturgeon there are wild fowl in the lakes and marshes there are bears in the forest and bison on the prairie now listen to my warning for i am weary of your endless quarrels i will send a prophet to you who shall guide you and teach you and share your sufferings obey him and all will be well with you disobey him and you shall be scattered like the autumn leaves wash the warpaint and the bloodstains from your bodies mould the red stone of the quarry into peacepipes and smoke with me the pipe of peace and brotherhood that shall last forever the tones of his deep voice died away and the indians broke their weapons and bathed in the sparkling river they took the red stone of the quarry and made peacepipes and gathered in a circle and while they smoked the great manito grew taller and mightier and lighter until he drifted on the smoke high above the clouds into the heavens ii the four winds in the faroff kingdom of wabasso the country of the northwind where the fierce blasts howl among the gorges and the mountains are like flint the year round mishe mokwa the huge bear had his cave years had passed since the great manito had spoken to the tribes of men and his words of warning were forgotten by the indians the smoke of his peacepipe had been blown away by the four winds and the red men smeared their bodies with new warpaint as they had done in days of old but brave as they were none of them dared to hunt the monster bear who was the terror of the nations of the earth he would rise from his winter sleep and bring the fear of death into the villages and he would come like a great shadow in the night to kill and to destroy year by year the great bear became bolder and year by year the number of his victims had increased until the mighty mudjekeewis bravest of all the early indians grew into manhood although mudjekeewis was so strong that all his enemies were afraid of him he did not love the warpath for he alone remembered the warning of the great manito and as he wished to be a hero and yet to do no harm to his fellow men he decided to hunt and kill the great bear of the mountains and to take the magic belt of shining shells called wampum that the great bear wore about his neck mudjekeewis told this to the indians and one and all they shouted honor be to mudjekeewis for a weapon he took a huge warclub made of rock and the trunk of a tough young pine and all alone he went into the northland to the home of mishe mokwa many days he hunted for the great bear knew of his coming and the monsters savage heart felt fear for the first time but at last after a long search mudjekeewis heard a sound like faroff thunder that rose and fell and rose again until the echoes all around were rumbling and he knew the sound to be the heavy breathing of the giant bear who slept softly mudjekeewis stole upon him the great bear was sprawled upon the mountain so huge that his forequarters rose above the tallest boulders and on his rough and wrinkled hide the belt of wampum shone like a string of jewels still he slept and mudjekeewis almost frightened by the long red talons and the mighty arms and forepaws of the monster drew the shining wampum softly over the closed eyes and over the grim muzzle of the bear whose heavy breathing was hot upon his hands then mudjekeewis gripped his club and swung it high above his head shouting his warcry in a terrible voice and he struck the great bear on the forehead a blow that would have split the rocks on which the monster slept the great bear rose and staggered forward but his senses reeled and his legs trembled beneath him stunned he sat upon his haunches and from his mighty chest and throat came a little whimpering cry like the crying of a woman mudjekeewis laughed at the great bear and raising his warclub once again he broke the great bears skull as ice is broken in winter he put on the belt of wampum and returned to his own people who were proud of him and cried out with one voice that the westwind should be given him to rule thenceforth he was known as kabeyun father of the winds and ruler of the air kabeyun had three sons to whom he gave the three remaining winds of heaven to wabun he gave the steady eastwind fresh and damp with the air of the ocean to the lazy shawondasee he gave the scented breezes of the south and to the cruel kabibonokka he gave the icy gusts and stormblasts of the northland wabun the young and beautiful ruled the morning and would fly from hill to hill and plain to plain awakening the world when he came with the dew of early dawn upon his shoulders the wild fowl would splash amid the marshes and the lakes and rivers wrinkle into life the squirrels would begin to chatter in the treetops the moose would crash through the thicket and the smoke would rise from a thousand wigwams and yet although the birds never sang so gayly as when wabun was in the air and the flowers never smelled so sweet as when wabun blew upon their petals he was not happy for he lived alone in heaven but one morning when he sprang from the cloud bank where he had lain through the night and when he was passing over a yet unawakened village wabun saw a maiden picking rushes from the brink of a river and as he passed above her she looked up with eyes as blue as two blue lakes every morning she waited for him by the river bank and wabun loved the beautiful maiden so he came down to earth and he wooed her wrapped her in his robe of crimson till he changed her to a star and he bore her high into the heavens there they may be seen always together wabun and the pure bright star he loves the star of morning but his brother the fierce and cruel kabibonokka lived among the eternal ice caves and the snowdrifts of the north he would whisk away the leaves in autumn and send the sleet through the naked forest he would drive the wild fowl swiftly to the south and rush through the woods after them roaring and rattling the branches he would bind the lakes and rivers in the keenest hardest ice and make them hum and sing beneath him as he whirled along beneath the stars and he would cause great floes and icebergs to creak and groan and grind together in agony of cold once kabibonokka was rushing southward after the departing wild fowl when he saw a figure on the frozen moorland it was shingebis the diver who had stayed in the country of the northwind long after his tribe had gone away and shingebis was making ready to pass the winter there in spite of kabibonokka and his gusty anger he was dragging strings of fish to his winter lodge enough to last him until spring should set the rivers free and fill the air once more with wild fowl and the waters with returning salmon what did shingebis care for the anger of kabibonokka he had four great logs to burn as firewood one for each moon of the winter and he stretched himself before the blazing fire and ate and laughed and sang as merrily as if the sun were warm and bright without his cheery wigwam ho cried kabibonokka i will rush upon him i will shake his lodge to pieces i will scatter his bright fire and drive him far to the south and in the night kabibonokka piled the snowdrifts high about the lodge of shingebis and shook the lodgepole and wailed around the smokeflue until the flames flared and the ashes were scattered on the floor but shingebis cared not at all he merely turned the log until it burned more brightly and laughed and sang as he had done before only a little louder o kabibonokka you are but my fellowmortal i will freeze him with my bitter breath roared kabibonokka i will turn him to a block of ice and he burst into the lodge of shingebis but although shingebis knew by the sudden coldness on his back that kabibonokka stood beside him he did not even turn his head but blew upon the embers struck the coals and made the sparks flicker up the smokeflue while he laughed and sang over and over again o kabibonokka you are but my fellowmortal drops of sweat trickled down kabibonokkas forehead and his limbs grew hot and moist and commenced to melt away from his snowsprinkled locks the water dripped as from the melting icicles in spring and the steam rose from his shoulders he rushed from the lodge and howled upon the moorland for he could not bear the heat and the merry laughter and the singing of shingebis the diver come out and wrestle with me cried kabibonokka come and meet me face to face upon the moorland and he stamped upon the ice and made it thicker breathed upon the snow and made it harder raged upon the frozen marshes against shingebis and the warm merry fire that had driven him away then shingebis the diver left his lodge and all the warmth and light that was in it and he wrestled all night long on the marshes with kabibonokka until the northwinds frozen grasp became more feeble and his strength was gone and kabibonokka rose from the fight and fled from shingebis far away into the very heart of his frozen kingdom in the north shawondasee the lazy one ruler of the southwind had his kingdom in the land of warmth and pleasure of the sunlit tropics the smoke of his pipe would fill the air with a dreamy haze that caused the grapes and melons to swell into delicious ripeness he breathed upon the fields until they yielded rich tobacco he dropped soft and starry blossoms on the meadows and filled the shaded woods with the singing of a hundred different birds how the wild rose and the shy arbutus and the lily sweet and languid loved the idle shawondasee how the frostweary and withered earth would melt and mellow at his sunny touch happy shawondasee in all his life he had a single sorrow just one sleepy little sting of pain he had seen a maiden clad in purest green with hair as yellow as the bright breast of the oriole and she stood and nodded at him from the prairie toward the north but shawondasee although he loved the brighthaired maiden and longed for her until he filled the air with sighs of tenderness was so lazy and listless that he never sought to win her love never did he rouse himself and tell her of his passion but he stayed far to the southward and murmured half asleep among the palmtrees as he dreamed of the bright maiden one morning when he awoke and gazed as usual toward the north he saw that the beautiful golden hair of the maiden had become as white as snow and shawondasee cried out in his sorrow ah my brother of the northwind you have robbed me of my treasure you have stolen the brighthaired maiden and have wooed her with your stories of the northland and shawondasee wandered through the air sighing with passion until lo and behold the maiden disappeared foolish shawondasee it was no maiden that you longed for it was the prairie dandelion and you puffed her away forever with your useless sighing iii hiawathas childhood no doubt you will wonder what the stories of the four winds have to do with hiawatha and why he has not been spoken of before but soon you will see that if you had not read these stories you could not understand how the life of hiawatha was different from that of any other indian and hiawatha had been chosen by the great manito to be the leader of the red men to share their troubles and to teach them so of course there were a great many things that took place before he was born that have to be remembered when we think of him in the full moon long ago the beautiful nokomis was swinging in a swing of grapevines and playing with her women when one of them who had always wished to do her harm cut the swing and let nokomis fall to earth as she fell she was so fair and bright that she seemed to be a star flashing downward through the air and the indians all cried out see a star is dropping to the meadow there on the meadow among the blossoms and the grasses a daughter was born to nokomis and she called her daughter wenonah and her daughter who was born beneath the clear moon and the bright stars of heaven grew into a maiden sweeter than the lilies of the prairie lovelier than the moonlight and purer than the light of any star wenonah was so beautiful that the westwind the mighty westwind mudjekeewis came and whispered tenderly into her ear until she loved him but the westwind did not love wenonah long he went away to his kingdom on the mountains and after he had gone wenonah had a son whom she named hiawatha the child of the westwind but wenonah was so sad because the westwind had deserted her that she died soon after hiawatha was born and the infant hiawatha without father or mother was taken to nokomis wigwam which stood beside a broad and shining lake called the bigseawater there he lived and was nursed by his grandmother nokomis who sang to him and rocked him in his cradle when he cried nokomis would say to him hush or the naked bear will get thee and when he awoke in the night she taught him all about the stars and showed him the spirits that we call the northern lights dance the deathdance far in the north on the summer evenings little hiawatha would hear the pinetrees whisper to one another and the water lapping in the lake and he would see the fireflies twinkle in the twilight and when he saw the moon and all the dark spots on it he asked nokomis what they were and she told him that a very angry warrior had once seized his grandmother and thrown her up into the sky at midnight right up to the moon said nokomis and that is her body that you see there when hiawatha saw the rainbow with the sun shining on it he said what is that nokomis and nokomis answered saying that is the heaven of the flowers where all the flowers that fade on the earth blossom once again and when hiawatha heard the owls hooting through the night he asked nokomis what are those and nokomis answered those are the owls and the owlets talking to each other in their native language then hiawatha learned the language of all the birds of the air all about their nests how they learned to fly and where they went in winter and he learned so much that he could talk to them just as if he were a bird himself he learned the language of all the beasts of the forest and they told him all their secrets the beavers showed him how they built their houses the squirrels took him to the places where they hid their acorns and the rabbits told him why they were so timid hiawatha talked with all the animals that he met and he called them hiawathas brothers nokomis had a friend called iagoo the boaster because he told so many stories about great deeds that he had never done and this iagoo once made a bow for hiawatha and said to him take this bow and go into the forest hunting kill a fine roebuck and bring us back his horns so hiawatha went into the forest all alone with his bow and arrows and because he knew the language of the wild things he could tell what all the birds and animals were saying to him do not shoot us hiawatha said the robins and the squirrels scrambled in fright up the trunks of the trees coughing and chattering do not shoot us hiawatha but for once hiawatha did not care or even hear what the birds and beasts were saying to him at last he saw the tracks of the red deer and he followed them to the river bank where he hid among the bushes and waited until two antlers rose above the thicket and a fine buck stepped out into the path and snuffed the wind hiawathas heart beat quickly and he rose to one knee and aimed his arrow twang went the bowstring and the buck leaped high into the air and fell down dead with the arrow in his heart hiawatha dragged the buck that he had killed back to the wigwam of nokomis and nokomis and iagoo were much pleased from the buckskin they made a fine cloak for hiawatha they hung up the antlers in the wigwam and invited everybody in the village to a feast of deers flesh and the indians all came and feasted and called hiawatha strong heart iv hiawatha and mudjekeewis the years passed and hiawatha grew from a child into a strong and active man he was so wise that the old men knew far less than he and often asked him for advice and he was such a fine hunter that he never missed his aim he was so swift of foot that he could shoot an arrow and catch it in its flight or let it fall behind him he was so strong that he could shoot ten arrows up into the air and the last of them would leave his bow before the first had fallen to the ground he had magic mittens made of deerskin and when he wore them on his hands he could break the rocks with them and grind the pieces into powder he had magic moccasins also shoes made of deerskin that he tied about his feet and when he put on these he could take a mile at every step hiawatha thought a great deal about his father mudjekeewis and often plagued nokomis with questions about him until at last she told hiawatha how his mother had loved mudjekeewis who left her to die of sorrow and hiawatha was so angry when he heard the story that his heart felt like a coal of fire he said to nokomis i will talk with mudjekeewis my father and to find him i will go to the land of the sunset where he has his kingdom so hiawatha dressed himself for travel and armed himself with bow and a warclub took his magic mittens and his magic moccasins and set out all alone to travel to the kingdom of the westwind and although nokomis called after him and begged him to turn back he would not listen to her but went away into the forest for days and days he traveled he passed the mississippi river he crossed the prairies where the buffaloes were herding and when he came to the rocky mountains where the panther and the grizzly bear have their homes he reached the land of the sunset and the kingdom of the westwind there he found his father mudjekeewis when hiawatha saw his father he was as nearly afraid as he had ever been in his life for his fathers cloudy hair tossed and waved in the air and flashed like the star we call the comet trailing long streams of fire through the sky but when mudjekeewis saw what a strong and handsome man his son had grown to be he was proud and happy for he knew that hiawatha had all of his own early strength and all the beauty of the dead wenonah welcome my son said mudjekeewis to the kingdom of the westwind i have waited for you many years and have grown very lonely and mudjekeewis and hiawatha talked long together but all the while hiawatha was thinking of his dead mother and the wrong that had been done to her and he became more and more angry he hid his anger however and listened to what mudjekeewis told him and mudjekeewis boasted of his own early bravery and of his body that was so tough that nobody could do him any harm can nothing hurt you asked hiawatha and mudjekeewis said nothing but the black rock yonder then he smiled at hiawatha and said is there anything that can harm you my son and hiawatha who did not wish mudjekeewis to know that nothing in the world could do him injury told him that only the bulrush had such power then they talked about other things of hiawathas brothers who ruled the winds wabun and shawondasee and kabibonokka and about the beautiful wenonah hiawathas mother and hiawatha cried out then in fury father though you be you killed wenonah and he struck with his magic mittens the black rock broke it into pieces and threw them at mudjekeewis but mudjekeewis blew them back with his breath and remembering what hiawatha had said about the bulrushes he tore them up from the mud roots and all and used them as a whip to lash his son thus began the fearful fight between hiawatha and his father mudjekeewis the eagle left his nest and circled in the air above them as they fought the bulrush bent and waved like a tall tree in a storm and great pieces of the black rock crashed upon the earth three days the fight continued and mudjekeewis was driven back back to the end of the world where the sun drops down into the empty places every evening stop cried mudjekeewis stop hiawatha you cannot kill me i have put you to this trial to learn how brave you are now i will give you a great prize go back to your home and people and kill all the monsters and all the giants and the serpents as i killed the great bear when i was young and at last when death draws near you and his awful eyes glare on you from the darkness i will give you a part of my kingdom and you shall be ruler of the northwest wind then the battle ended long ago among the mountains and if you do not believe this story go there and see for yourself that the bulrush grows by the ponds and rivers and that the pieces of the black rock are scattered all through the valleys where they fell after hiawatha had thrown them at his father hiawatha started homeward with all the anger taken from his heart only once upon his way he stopped and bought the heads of arrows from an old arrowmaker who lived in the land of the indians called dacotahs the old arrowmaker had a daughter whose laugh was as musical as the voice of the waterfall by which she lived and hiawatha named her by the name of the rushing waterfall minnehaha laughing water when he reached his native village all he told to nokomis was of the battle with his father of the arrows and the lovely maiden minnehaha he did not say a word v hiawathas fasting the time came when hiawatha felt that he must show the tribes of indians that he would do them some great service and he went alone into the forest to fast and pray and see if he could not learn how to help his fellowmen and make them happy in the forest he built a wigwam where nobody might disturb him and he went without food for seven nights and seven days the first day he walked in the forest and when he saw the hare leap into the thicket and the deer dart away at his approach he was very sad because he knew that if the animals of the forest should die or go and hide where the indians could not hunt them the indians would starve for want of food must our lives depend on the hare and on the red deer asked hiawatha and he prayed to the great manito to tell him of some food that the indians might always be able to find when they were hungry the next day hiawatha walked by the bank of the river and saw the wild rice growing and the blueberries and the wild strawberries and the grapevine that filled the air with pleasant odors and he knew that when cold winter came all this fruit would wither and the indians would have no more of it to eat again he prayed to the great manito to tell him of some food that the indians might enjoy in winter and summer in autumn and in spring the third day that hiawatha fasted he was too weak to walk about the forest and he sat by the shore of the lake and watched the yellow perch darting about in the sunny water far out in the middle of the lake he saw nahma the big sturgeon leap into the air with a shower of spray and fall back into the water with a crash and every now and then the pike would chase a school of minnows into the shallow water at the edges of the lake and dart among them like an arrow and hiawatha thought of how a hot summer might dry up the lakes and rivers and kill the fish or drive them into such deep water that nobody could catch them and he called out to the great manito asking a third time for some food that the indians could store away and use when there was no game in the forest and no fruit on the river banks or in the fields and no fish in any of the lakes and rivers on the fourth day that hiawatha fasted he was so weak from hunger that he could not even go out and sit beside the lake but lay on his back in his wigwam and watched the rising sun burn away the mist and he looked up into the blue sky wondering if the great manito had heard his prayers and would tell him of this food that he wished so much to find and just as the sun was sinking down behind the hills hiawatha saw a young man with golden hair coming through the forest toward his wigwam and the young man wore a wonderful dress of the brightest green with silky yellow fringes and gay tassels that waved behind him in the wind the young man walked right into hiawathas wigwam and said hiawatha my name is mondamin and i have been sent by the great manito to tell you that he has heard your prayers and will give you the food that you wish to find but you must work hard and suffer a great deal before this food is given you and you must now come out of your wigwam and wrestle with me in the forest then hiawatha rose from his bed of leaves and branches but he was so weak that it was all he could do to follow mondamin from the wigwam he wrestled with mondamin and as soon as he touched him his strength began to return they wrestled for a long time and at last mondamin said it is enough you have wrestled bravely hiawatha tomorrow i will come again and wrestle with you he vanished and hiawatha could not tell whether he had sunk into the ground or disappeared into the air illustration dead he lay there in the sunset page on the next day when the sun was setting mondamin came again to wrestle with hiawatha and the day after that he came also and they wrestled even longer than before then mondamin smiled at hiawatha and said to him three times o hiawatha you have bravely wrestled with me tomorrow i shall wrestle with you once again and you will overcome me and throw me to the earth and i shall seem to be dead then when i am lying still and limp on the ground do you take off my gay clothes and bury me where we have wrestled and you must make the ground above the place where i am buried soft and light and take good care that weeds do not grow there and that ravens do not come there to disturb me until at last i rise again from the ground more beautiful than ever true to his word mondamin came at sunset of the next day and he and hiawatha wrestled together for the last time they wrestled after evening had come upon them until at last hiawatha threw mondamin to the ground who lay there as if dead then hiawatha took off all the gay green clothes that mondamin wore and he buried mondamin and made the ground soft and light above the grave just as he had been told to do he kept the weeds from growing in the ground and kept the ravens from coming to the place until at last he saw a tiny little green leaf sticking up out of the grave the little leaf grew into a large plant taller than hiawatha himself and the plant had wonderful green leaves and silky yellow fringes and gay tassels that waved behind it in the wind it is mondamin cried out hiawatha and he called nokomis and iagoo to see the wonderful plant that was to be the food that he had prayed for to the great manito they waited until autumn had turned the leaves to yellow and made the tender kernels hard and shiny and then they stripped the husks and gathered the ears of the wonderful indian corn all the indians for miles around had a great feast and were happy because they knew that with a little care they would have corn to eat in winter and in summer in autumn and in spring vi hiawathas friends hiawatha had two good friends whom he had chosen from all other indians to be with him always and whom he loved more than any living men they were chibiabos the sweetest singer and kwasind the strongest man in the world and they told to hiawatha all their secrets as he told his to them best of all hiawatha loved the brave and beautiful chibiabos who was such a wonderful musician that when he sang people flocked from villages far and near to listen to him and even the animals and birds left their dens and nests to hear chibiabos sang so sweetly that the brook would pause in its course and murmur to him asking him to teach its waves to sing his songs and to flow as softly as his words flowed when he was singing the envious bluebird begged chibiabos to teach it songs as wild and wonderful as his own the robin tried to learn his notes of gladness and the lonely bird of night the whippoorwill longed to sing as chibiabos sang when he was sad he could imitate all the noises of the woodland and make them sound even sweeter than they really were and by his singing he could force the indians to laugh or cry or dance just as he chose the mighty kwasind was also much beloved by hiawatha who believed that next to wonderful songs and love and wisdom great strength was the finest thing in the world and the closest to perfect goodness and never in all the years that men have lived upon the earth has there been another man so strong as kwasind when he was a boy kwasind did not fish or play with other children but seemed very dull and dreamy and his father and mother thought that they were bringing up a fool lazy kwasind his mother said to him you never help me with my work in the summer you roam through the fields and forests doing nothing and now that it is winter you sit beside the fire like an old woman and leave me to break the ice for fishing and to draw the nets alone go out and wring them now where they are freezing with the water that is in them hang them up to dry in the sunshine and show that you are worth the food that you eat and the clothes you wear on your back without a word kwasind rose from the ashes where he was sitting left the lodge and found the nets dripping and freezing fast he wrung them like a wisp of straw but his fingers were so strong that he broke them in a hundred different places and his strength was so great that he could not help breaking the nets any more than if they were tender cobwebs lazy kwasind his father said to him you never help me in my hunting as other young men help their fathers you break every bow you touch and you snap every arrow that you draw yet you shall come with me and bring home from the forest what i kill they went down to a deep and narrow valley by the side of a little brook where the tracks of bison and of deer showed plainly in the mud and at last they came to a place where the trunks of heavy trees were piled like a stone wall across the valley we must go back said kwasinds father we can never scale those logs they are packed so tightly that no woodchuck could get through them and not even a squirrel could climb over the top and the old man sat down to smoke and rest and wonder what they were going to do but before he had finished his pipe the way lay clear for the strong kwasind had lifted the logs as if they were light lances and had hurled them crashing into the depths of the forest lazy kwasind shouted the young men as they ran their races and played their games upon the meadows why do you stay idle while we strive with one another leave the rock that you are leaning on and join us come and wrestle with us and see who can pitch the quoit the farthest kwasind did not say a word in answer to them but rose and slowly turned to the huge rock on which he had been leaning he gripped it with both hands tore it from the ground and pitched it right into the swift pauwating river where you can still see it in the summer months as it towers high above the current once as kwasind with his companions was sailing down the foaming rapids of the pauwating he saw a beaver in the water ahmeek the king of beavers who was struggling against the savage current without a word kwasind leaped into the water and chased the beaver in and out among the whirlpools he followed the beaver among the islands dove after him to the bottom of the river and stayed under water so long that his companions believed him dead and cried out alas we shall see kwasind no more he is drowned in the whirlpool but kwasinds head showed at last above the water and he swam ashore carrying the king of beavers dead upon his shoulders these were the sort of men that hiawatha chose to be his friends vii hiawathas sailing once hiawatha was sitting alone beside the swift and mighty river taquamenaw and he longed for a canoe with which he might explore the river from bank to bank and learn to know all its rapids and its shallows and hiawatha set about building himself a canoe such as he needed and he called upon the forest to give him aid give me your bark o birch tree cried hiawatha i will build me a light canoe for sailing that shall float upon the river like a yellow leaf in autumn lay aside your cloak o birch tree for the summer time is coming and the birch tree sighed and rustled in the breeze murmuring sadly take my cloak o hiawatha with his knife hiawatha cut around the trunk of the birchtree just beneath the branches until the sap came oozing forth and he also cut the bark around the treetrunk just above the roots he slashed the bark from top to bottom raised it with wooden wedges and stripped it from the trunk of the tree without a crack in all its golden surface give me your boughs o cedar cried hiawatha give me your strong and pliant branches to make my canoe firmer and tougher beneath me through all the branches of the cedar there swept a noise as if somebody were crying with horror but the tree at last bent downward and whispered take my boughs o hiawatha he cut down the boughs of the cedar and made them into a framework with the shape of two bows bent together and he covered this framework with the rich and yellow bark give me your roots o larch tree cried hiawatha to bind the ends of my canoe together that the water may not enter and the river may not wet me the larchtree shivered in the air and touched hiawathas forehead with its tassels sighing take them take them as he tore the fibres from the earth with the tough roots he sewed the ends of his canoe together and bound the bark tightly to the framework and his canoe became light and graceful in shape he took the balsam and pitch of the firtree and smeared the seams so that no water might ooze in and he asked for the quills of kagh the hedgehog to make a necklace and two stars for his canoe thus did hiawatha build his birch canoe and all the life and magic of the forest was held in it for it had all the lightness of the bark of the birchtree all the toughness of the boughs of the cedar and it danced and floated on the river as lightly as a yellow leaf hiawatha did not have any paddles for his canoe and he needed none for he could guide it by merely wishing that it should turn to the right or to the left the canoe would move in whatever direction he chose and would glide over the water swiftly or slowly just as he desired all hiawatha had to do was to sit still and think where he cared to have it take him never was there such a wonderful craft before then hiawatha called to kwasind and asked for help in clearing away all the sunken logs and all the rocks and sandbars in the riverbed and he and kwasind traveled down the whole length of the river kwasind swam and dove like a beaver tugging at sunken logs scooping out the sandbars with his hands kicking the boulders out of the stream and digging away all the snags and tangles they went back and forth and up and down the river kwasind working just as hard as he was able and hiawatha showing him where he could find new logs and rocks and sandbars to remove until together they made the channel safe and regular all the way from where the river rose among the mountains in little springs to where it emptied a wide and rolling sheet of water into the bay of taquamenaw viii hiawathas fishing in his wonderful canoe hiawatha sailed over the shining bigseawater to go fishing and to catch with his fishingline made of cedar no other than the very king of fishes nahma the big sturgeon all alone hiawatha sailed over the lake but on the bow of his canoe sat a squirrel frisking and chattering at the thought of all the wonderful sport that he was going to see through the calm clear water hiawatha saw the fishes swimming to and fro first he saw the yellow perch that shone like a sunbeam then he saw the crawfish moving along the sandy bottom of the lake and at last he saw a great blue shape that swept the sand floor with its mighty tail and waved its huge fins lazily backward and forward and hiawatha knew that this monster was nahma the sturgeon king of all the fishes take my bait shouted hiawatha dropping his line of cedar into the calm water come up and take my bait o nahma king of fishes but the great fish did not move although hiawatha shouted to him over and over again at last however nahma began to grow tired of the endless shouting and he said to maskenozha the pike take the bait of this rude fellow hiawatha and break his line hiawatha felt the fishingline tighten with a snap and as he pulled it in maskenozha the pike tugged so hard that the canoe stood almost on end with the squirrel perched on the top but when hiawatha saw what fish it was that had taken his bait he was full of scorn and shouted shame upon you you are not the king of fishes you are only the pike maskenozha and the pike let go of hiawathas line and sank back to the bottom very much ashamed then nahma said to the sunfish ugudwash take hiawathas bait and break his line i am tired of his shouting and his boasting and the sunfish rose up through the water like a great white moon it seized hiawathas line and struggled so that the canoe made a whirlpool in the water and rocked until the waves it made splashed upon the beaches at the rim of the lake but when hiawatha saw the fish he was very angry and shouted out again oh shame upon you you are the sunfish ugudwash and you come when i call for nahma king of fishes and the sunfish let go of hiawathas line and sank to the bottom where he hid among the lily stems then nahma the great sturgeon heard hiawatha shouting at him once again and furious he rose with a swirl to the top of the water leaped in the air scattering the spray on every side and opening his huge jaws he made a rush at the canoe and swallowed hiawatha canoe and all into the dark cave of nahmas giant maw hiawatha in his canoe plunged headlong as a log rushes down a roaring river in the springtime at first he was frightened for it was so inky black that he could not see his hand before his face but at last he felt a great heart beating in the darkness and he clenched his fist and struck the giant heart with all his strength as he struck it he felt nahma tremble all over and he heard the water gurgle as the great fish rushed through it trying to breathe and hiawatha struck the mighty heart yet another heavy blow then he dragged his canoe crosswise so that he might not be thrown from the belly of the great fish and be drowned in the swirling water where nahma was fighting for life and the little squirrel helped hiawatha drag his canoe into safety and tugged and pulled bravely at hiawathas side hiawatha was grateful to the little squirrel and told him that for a reward the boys should always call him adjidaumo which means tailintheair and the little squirrel was much pleased at last everything became quiet and nahma the great sturgeon lay dead and drifted on the surface of the water to the shore where hiawatha heard him grate upon the pebbles there was a great screaming and flapping of wings outside and finally a gleam of light shone to the place where hiawatha was sitting and he could see the glittering eyes of the seagulls who had crawled into the open mouth of nahma and were peering down his gullet hiawatha called out to them o my brothers the seagulls i have killed the great king of fishes nahma the sturgeon scratch and tear with your beaks and claws until the opening becomes wider and you can set me free from this dark prison do this and men shall always call you kayoshk the seagulls the noble scratchers the seagulls set to work with a will and scratched and tore at nahmas ribs until there was an opening wide enough for hiawatha and the squirrel to step through and to drag the canoe out after them hiawatha called nokomis pointed to the body of the sturgeon and said see nokomis i have killed nahma the king of fishes and the seagulls feed upon him you must not drive them away for they saved me from great danger but when they fly back to their nests at sunset do you bring your pots and kettles and make from nahmas flesh enough oil to last us through the winter nokomis waited until sunset when the seagulls had flown back to their homes in the marshes and she set to work with all her pots and kettles to make yellow oil from the flesh of nahma she worked all night long until the sun rose again and the seagulls came back screeching and screaming for their breakfast and for three days and three nights the seagulls and nokomis took turns in stripping the greasy flesh of nahma from his ribs until nothing was left then the seagulls flew away for good and all nokomis poured her oil into great jars and on the sand was only the bare skeleton of nahma who had once been the biggest and the strongest fish that ever swam ix hiawatha and the pearlfeather once nokomis was standing with hiawatha beside her upon the shore of the bigseawater watching the sunset and she pointed to the west and said to hiawatha there is the dwelling of the pearlfeather the great wizard who is guarded by the fiery snakes that coil and play together in the black pitchwater you can see them now and hiawatha beheld the fiery snakes twist and wriggle in the black water and coil and uncoil themselves in play nokomis went on the great wizard killed my father who had come down from the moon to find me he killed him by wicked spells and by sly cunning and now he sends the rank mist of marshes and the deadly fog that brings sickness and death among our people take your bow hiawatha said nokomis and your warclub and your magic mittens take the oil of the sturgeon nahma so that your canoe may glide easily through the sticky black pitchwater and go and kill this great wizard save our people from the fever that he breathes at them across the marshes and punish him for my fathers death swiftly hiawatha took his warclub and his arrows and his magic mittens launched his birch canoe upon the water and cried o birch canoe leap forward where you see the snakes that play in the black pitchwater leap forward swiftly o my birch canoe while i sing my warsong and the canoe darted forward like a live thing until it reached the spot where the fiery serpents were sporting in the water out of my way o serpents cried hiawatha out of my way and let me go to fight with pearlfeather the awful wizard but the serpents only hissed and answered go back coward go back to old nokomis faintheart then hiawatha took his bow and sent his arrows singing among the serpents and at every shot one of them was killed until they all lay dead upon the water onward my birch canoe cried hiawatha onward to the home of the great wizard and the canoe darted forward once again it was a strange strange place that hiawatha had entered with his birch canoe the water was as black as ink and on the shores of the lake dead men lit fires that twinkled in the darkness like the eyes of a wicked old witch awful shrieks and whistling echoed over the water and the heron flapped about the marshes to tell all the evil beings who lived there that hiawatha was coming to fight with the great wizard hiawatha sailed over this dismal lake all night long and at last when the sun rose he saw on the shore in front of him the wigwam of the great magician pearlfeather the canoe darted ahead faster and faster until it grated on the beach and hiawatha fitted an arrow to his bowstring and sent it hissing into the open doorway of the wigwam come out and fight me pearlfeather cried hiawatha come out and fight me if you dare then pearlfeather stepped out of his wigwam and stood in the open before hiawatha he was painted red and yellow and blue and was terrible to see in his hand was a heavy warclub and he wore a shirt of shining wampum that would keep out an arrow and break the force of any blow well do i know you hiawatha shouted pearlfeather in a deep and awful voice go back to nokomis coward that you are for if you stay here i will kill you as i killed her father words are not as sharp as arrows answered hiawatha bending his bow then began a battle even more terrible than the one among the mountains when hiawatha fought with mudjekeewis and it lasted all one summers day for hiawathas arrows could not pierce pearlfeathers shirt of wampum and he could not break it with the blows of his magic mittens at sunset hiawatha was so weary that he leaned on his bow to rest his heavy warclub was broken his magic mittens were torn to pieces and he had only three arrows left alas sighed hiawatha the great magician is too strong for me suddenly from the branches of the tree nearest him he heard the woodpecker calling to him hiawatha hiawatha said the woodpecker aim your arrows at the tuft of hair on pearlfeathers head aim them at the roots of his long black hair for there alone can you do him any harm just then pearlfeather stooped to pick up a big stone to throw at hiawatha who bent his bow and struck pearlfeather with an arrow right on the top of the head pearlfeather staggered forward like a wounded buffalo twang went the bowstring again and the wizards knees trembled beneath him for the second arrow had struck in the same spot as the first and had made the wound much deeper a third arrow followed swiftly and pearlfeather saw the eyes of death glare at him from the darkness and he fell forward on his face right at the feet of hiawatha and lay there dead then hiawatha called the woodpecker to him and as a mark of gratitude he stained the tuft of feathers on the woodpeckers head with the blood of the dead pearlfeather and the woodpecker wears his tuft of bloodred feathers to this day hiawatha took the shirt of wampum from the dead wizard as a sign of victory and from pearlfeathers wigwam he carried all the skins and furs and arrows that he could find and they were many he loaded his canoe with them and sped homeward over the pitchwater past the dead bodies of the fiery serpents until he saw chibiabos and kwasind and nokomis waiting for him on the shore all the indians assembled and gave a feast in hiawathas honor and they sang and danced for joy because the great wizard would never again send sickness and death among them and hiawatha took the red crest of the woodpecker to decorate his pipe for he knew that to the woodpecker his victory was due x hiawathas wooing woman is to man as the cord is to the bow thought hiawatha she bends him yet obeys him she draws him yet she follows each is useless without the other hiawatha was dreaming of the lovely maiden minnehaha whom he had seen in the country of the dacotahs do not wed a stranger hiawatha warned the old nokomis do not search in the east or in the west to win a bride take a maid of your own people for the homely daughter of a neighbor is like the pleasant fire on the hearthstone while the stranger is cold and distant like the starlight or the light of the pale moon but hiawatha only smiled and answered dear nokomis the fire on the hearthstone is indeed pleasant and warm but i love the starlight and the moonlight better do not bring home an idle woman said old nokomis bring not home a maiden who is unskilled with the needle and will neither cook nor sew and hiawatha answered good nokomis in the land of the dacotahs lives the daughter of an arrowmaker and she is the most beautiful of all the women in the world her name is minnehaha and i will bring her home to do your bidding and to be your firelight your moonlight and your starlight all in one ah hiawatha warned nokomis bring not home a maid of the dacotahs the dacotahs are fierce and cruel and there is often war between our tribe and theirs hiawatha laughed and answered i will wed a maid of the dacotahs and old wars shall be forgotten in a new and lasting peace that shall make the two tribes friends forevermore for this alone would i wed the lovely laughing water if there were no other reason hiawatha left his wigwam for the home of the old arrowmaker and he ran through the forest as lightly as the wind until he heard the clear voice of the falls of minnehaha at the sunny edges of the forest a herd of deer were feeding and they did not see the swiftfooted runner until he sent a hissing arrow among them that killed a roebuck without pausing hiawatha caught up the deer and swung it to his shoulder running forward until he came to the home of the aged arrowmaker the old man was sitting in the doorway of his wigwam and at his side were all his tools and all the arrows he was making at his side also was the lovely minnehaha weaving mats of reeds and waterrushes and the old man and the young maiden sat together in the pleasant contrast of age and youth the one thinking of the past the other dreaming of the future the old man was thinking of the days when with such arrows as he now was making he had killed deer and bison and had shot the wild goose on the wing he remembered the great warparties that came to buy his arrows and how they could not fight unless he had arrowheads to sell alas such days were over he thought sadly and no such splendid warriors were left on earth the maiden was dreaming of a tall handsome hunter who had come one morning when the year was young to purchase arrows of her father he had rested in their wigwam lingered and looked back as he was leaving and her father had praised his courage and his wisdom would the hunter ever come again in search of arrows thought the lovely minnehaha and the rushes she was weaving lay unfingered in her lap just then they heard a rustle and swift footsteps in the thicket and hiawatha with the deer upon his shoulders and a glow upon his cheek and forehead stood before them in the sunlight welcome hiawatha said the old arrowmaker in a grave but friendly tone and minnehahas light voice echoed the deep one of her father saying welcome hiawatha together the old arrowmaker and hiawatha entered the wigwam and minnehaha laid aside her mat of rushes and brought them food and drink in vessels of earth and bowls of basswood yet she did not say a word while she was serving them but listened as if in a dream to what hiawatha told her father about nokomis and chibiabos and the strong man kwasind and the happiness and peace of his own people the ojibways hiawatha finished his words by saying very slowly that this peace may always be among us and our tribes become as brothers to each other give me the hand of your daughter minnehaha the loveliest of women illustration pleasant was the journey homeward page the aged arrowmaker paused before he answered looked proudly at hiawatha and lovingly at his daughter and then said you may have her if she wishes it speak minnehaha and let us know your will the lovely minnehaha seemed more beautiful than ever as she looked first at hiawatha and then at her old father softly she took the seat beside hiawatha blushing as she answered i will follow you my husband thus did hiawatha win the daughter of the ancient arrowmaker together he and his bride left the wigwam hand in hand and went away over the meadows while the old arrowmaker with shaded eyes gazed after them and called out sadly goodbye minnehaha goodbye my lovely daughter they walked together through the sunlit forest and all the birds and animals gazed at them from among the leaves and branches when they came to swift rivers hiawatha lifted minnehaha and carried her across and in his strong arms she seemed lighter than a willowleaf or the plume upon his headgear at night he cleared away the thicket and built a lodge of branches he made a bed of hemlock boughs and kindled a fire of pinecones before the doorway and adjidaumo the squirrel climbed down from his nest and kept watch while the two lovers slept in their lodge beneath the stars xi hiawathas wedding feast a great feast was prepared by hiawatha to celebrate his wedding that the feast might be one of joy and gladness the sweet singer chibiabos sang his lovesongs that it might be merry the handsome paupukkeewis danced his liveliest dances and to make the wedding guests even more content iagoo the great boaster told them a wonderful story oh but it was a splendid feast that nokomis prepared at the bidding of hiawatha she sent messengers with willowwands through all the village as a sign that all ojibways were invited and the wedding guests wore their very brightest garments rich fur robes and wampumbelts beads of many colors paint and feathers and gay tassels all the bowls at the feast were made of white and shining basswood all the spoons were made of bison horn as black as ink and polished until the black was as bright as silver and the indians feasted on the flesh of the sturgeon and the pike on buffalo marrow and the hump of the bison and the haunch of the red deer they ate pounded meat called pemican and the wild rice that grew by the riverbank and goldenyellow cakes of indian corn it was a feast indeed but the kind host hiawatha did not take a mouthful of all this tempting food neither did minnehaha nor nokomis but all three waited on their guests and served them carefully until their wants were generously satisfied when all had finished old nokomis filled from an ample otter pouch the red stone pipes with fragrant tobacco of the south and when the blue smoke was rising freely she said o paupukkeewis dance your merry beggars dance to please us so the time may pass more pleasantly and our guests may be more gay paupukkeewis rose and stood amid the guests he wore a white shirt of doeskin fringed with ermine and covered with beads of wampum he wore deerskin leggings also fringed with ermine and with quills of kagh the hedgehog on his feet were buckskin moccasins richly embroidered and red foxes tails to flourish while he danced were fastened to the heels a snowy plume of swans down floated over his head and he carried a gay fan in one hand and a pipe with tassels in the other all the warriors disliked paupukkeewis and called him coward and idler but he cared not at all because he was so handsome that all the women and the maidens loved him to the sound of drums and flutes and singing voices paupukkeewis now began the dance of beggars first he danced with slow steps and stately motion in and out of the shadows and the sunshine gliding like a panther among the pinetrees but his steps became faster and faster and wilder and wilder until the wind and dust swept around him as he danced time after time he leaped over the heads of the assembled guests and rushed around the wigwam and at last he sped along the shore of the bigseawater stamping on the sand and tossing it furiously in the air until the wind had become a whirlwind and the sand was blown in great drifts like snowdrifts all over the shore there they have stayed until this day the great sand hills of the nagow wudjoo when the beggars dance was over paupukkeewis returned and sat down laughing among the guests and fanned himself as calmly as if he had not stirred from his seat while all the guests cried out sing to us chibiabos sing your love songs and hiawatha and nokomis said yes sing chibiabos that our guests may enjoy themselves all the more and our feast may pass more gayly chibiabos rose and his wonderful voice swelled all the echoes of the forest until the streams paused in their courses and the listening beavers came to the surface of the water so that they might hear he sang so sweetly that his voice caused the pinetrees to quiver as if a wind were passing through them and strange sounds seemed to run along the earth all the indians were spellbound by his singing and sat as if they had been turned to stone even the smoke ceased to rise from their pipes while chibiabos sang but when he had ended they shouted with joy and praised him in loud voices iagoo the mighty boaster alone did not join in the roar of praise for he was jealous of chibiabos and longed to tell one of his great stories to the indians when iagoo heard of any adventure he always told of a greater one that had happened to himself and to listen to him you would think that nobody was such a mighty hunter and nobody was such a valiant fighter as he if you would only believe him you would learn nobody had ever shot an arrow half so far as he had that nobody could run so fast or dive so deep or leap so high and that nobody in the wide world had ever seen so many wonders as the brave great and wonderful iagoo this was the reason that his name had become a byword among the indians and whenever a hunter spoke too highly of his own deeds or a warrior talked too much of what he had done in battle his hearers shouted see iagoo is among us but it was iagoo who had carved the cradle of hiawatha long ago and who had taught him how to make his bow and arrows and as he sat at the feast old and ugly but very eager to tell of his adventures nokomis said to him good iagoo tell us some wonderful story so that our feast may be more merry and iagoo answered like a flash you shall hear the most wonderful story that has ever been heard since men have lived upon the earth you shall hear the strange and marvelous tale of osseo and his father king of the evening star xii the son of the evening star see the star of evening cried iagoo see how it shines like a bead of wampum on the robes of the great spirit gaze on it and listen to the story of osseo long ago in the days when the heavens were nearer to the earth than they are now and when the spirits and gods were better known to all men there lived a hunter in the northland who had ten daughters young and beautiful and as tall as willowwands oweenee the youngest of these was proud and wayward but even fairer than her sisters when the brave and wealthy warriors came as suitors each of the ten sisters had many offers and all except oweenee were quickly married but oweenee laughed at her handsome lovers and sent them all away then she married poor ugly old osseo who was bowed down with age weak with coughing and twisted and wrinkled like the roots of an oaktree for she saw that the spirit of osseo was far more beautiful than were the painted figures of her handsome lovers all the suitors whom she had refused to marry and they were many came and pointed at her with jeers and laughter and made fun of her and of her husband but she said to them i care not for your feathers and your wampum i am happy with osseo it happened that the sisters were all invited to a great feast and they were walking together through the forest followed by old osseo and the fair oweenee but while all the others chatted gayly these two walked in silence osseo often stopped to gaze at the star of evening and at last the others heard him murmur oh pity me pity me my father he is praying to his father said the eldest sister what a shame that the old man does not stumble in the path and break his neck and the others all laughed so heartily at the wicked joke that the forest rang with merriment on their way through the thicket lay a hollow oak that had been uprooted by a storm and when osseo saw it he gave a cry of anguish and leaped into the mighty tree he went in an old man ugly and bent and hideous with wrinkles he came out a splendid youth straight as an arrow handsome and very strong but osseo was not happy in the change that had come over him indeed he was more sorrowful than ever before because at the same instant that he recovered his lost youth oweenee was changed into a tottering old woman wasted and worn and ugly as a witch and her nine hardhearted sisters and their husbands laughed long and loud until the forest echoed once again with their wicked merriment osseo however did not turn from oweenee in her trouble but took her brown and withered hand called her sweetheart and soothed her with kind words until they came to the lodge in the forest where the feast was being given they sat down to the feast and all were joyous except osseo who would taste neither food nor drink but sat as if in a dream looking first at the changed oweenee then upward at the sky all at once he heard a voice come out of the empty air and say to him osseo my son the spells that bound you are now broken and the evil charms that made you old and withered before your time have all been wished away taste the food before you for it is blessed and will change you to a spirit your bowls and your kettles shall be changed to silver and to wampum and shine like scarlet shells and gleam like the firelight and all the men and women but oweenee shall be changed to birds the voice osseo heard was taken by the others for the voice of the whippoorwill singing far off in the lonely forest and they did not hear a word of what was said but a sudden tremor ran through the lodge where they sat feasting and they felt it rise in the air high up above the treetops into the starlight the wooden dishes were changed into scarlet shells the earthen kettles were changed into silver bowls and the bark of the roof glittered like the backs of gorgeous beetles then osseo saw that the nine beautiful sisters of oweenee and their husbands were changed into all sorts of different birds there were jays and thrushes and magpies and blackbirds and they flew about the lodge and sang and twittered in many different keys only oweenee was not changed but remained as wrinkled and old and ugly as before and osseo in his disappointment gave a cry of anguish such as he had uttered by the oak tree when lo and behold all oweenees former youth and loveliness returned to her the old womans staff on which she had been leaning became a glittering silver feather and her tattered dress was changed into a snowy robe of softest ermine the wigwam trembled once again and floated through the sky until at last it alighted on the evening star as gently as thistledown drops to the water and the ruler of the evening star the father of osseo came forward to greet his son my son he said hang the cage of birds that you bring with you at the doorway of my wigwam and then do you and oweenee enter and osseo and oweenee did as they were told entered the wigwam and listened to the words of osseos father i have had pity on you my osseo he began i have given back to you your youth and beauty and i have changed into birds the sisters of oweenee and their husbands because they laughed at you and could not see that your spirit was beautiful when you were an ugly old man only oweenee knew your heart but you must take heed for in the little star that you see yonder lives an evil spirit the wabeno and it is he who has brought all this sorrow upon you take care that you never stand in the light of that evil star its gleams are used by the wabeno as his arrows and he sits there hating all the world and darting forth his poisonous beams of baleful light to injure all who stray within his reach for many years osseo and his father and oweenee lived happily together upon the evening star oweenee bore a son to osseo and the boy had beauty and courage osseo to please his son made little bows and arrows for him and when the boy had learned to shoot osseo opened the door of the silver birdcage and let out all the birds they darted through the air singing for joy at their freedom until the boy bent his bow and struck one of them with a fatal arrow so that the bird fell wounded at his feet but when it touched the ground the bird underwent a great change and there lay at the boys feet a beautiful young woman with the arrow in her breast as soon as her blood dripped upon the sacred evening star all the magical charms that osseos father had used to keep his son and oweenee with him in the happy dwelling far above the earth were broken and the boy hunter with his bow and arrow felt himself held by unseen hands but sinking downward through the blue sky and the empty air until he rested on a green and grassy island in the bigseawater falling and fluttering after him came all the bright birds and the lodge with osseo and oweenee in it sailed lightly downward and landed on the island when the bright birds touched the earth another change came over them and they became men and women once again as they were before only they remained so small in size so tiny that they were called the little people the pukwudjies and on summer nights when the stars shone brightly above them they would dance hand in hand about the island and sometimes in the starlight they dance there even now when the story was finished iagoo looked about him at the assembled guests and added very solemnly there are many great men at whom their own people often scoff and jeer let these people take warning from the story of osseo so that they too may not be changed to birds for laughing at their betters and the wedding guests all whispered to each other i wonder if he means himself and us then chibiabos sang another sweet and tender lovesong and the guests all went away leaving hiawatha alone and happy with minnehaha xiii blessing the cornfields many were the pleasant days that followed the wedding of minnehaha and hiawatha all the tribes were at peace with one another and the hunters roved wherever they chose built their birch canoes hunted and fished and trapped the beaver without once hearing the warcry or the hiss of a hostile arrow the women made sugar from the sap of the mapletrees gathered the wild rice and dressed the skins of the deer and beaver while all around the peaceful village waved green and sunny fields of corn once when the corn was being planted by the women the wise and thoughtful hiawatha said to minnehaha tonight you shall bless the cornfields and draw around them a magic circle to keep out the mildew and the insects in the night when everybody is asleep and none can hear you or see you rise from your bed lay aside your clothes and walk in the darkness around the fields of corn that you have planted do this and the fields shall be more fruitful and the magic circle of your footsteps cannot be crossed by either worm or insect for the dragonfly and the spider and the grasshopper and the caterpillar all will know that you have walked around the cornfields and they will not dare to enter while hiawatha spoke kahgahgee king of the ravens sat with his band of black robbers in the treetops near at hand and they laughed so loud at the words of hiawatha that the treetops shook and rattled kaw shouted the ravens listen to the wise man hear the plots of hiawatha we will fly over the magic circle and eat just as much corn as we can hold when night had fallen dark and black over the fields and woodlands and when all the indians were sleeping fast minnehaha rose from her bed of branches laid aside her garments and walked safely among the cornfields drawing the magic circle of her light footsteps closely around them no one but the midnight saw her and no one but the whippoorwill heard the panting of her bosom for the darkness wrapped its cloak closely about her as she walked and the dragonfly and the grasshopper the spider and the caterpillar all knew that they could not cross the magic circle of minnehahas footsteps when the morning came however kahgahgee gathered about him all his black and rascally crew of ravens and jays and crows and blackbirds shrieking with laughter and with harsh cries and raucous clamor they all left the treetops and flapped eagerly down upon the cornfields kaw kaw they shrieked we will dig up the corn from the soft earth and we will eat all we can hold in spite of minnehaha and her foolish circle but hiawatha had overheard the ravens as they laughed at him from among the treetops he had risen before daybreak and had covered the cornfields with snares and at that moment he was hiding in the woods until all the evil birds should alight on the fields and begin their wicked feast they came with a rush of wings and hungry cries settled down upon the cornfields and began to dig and delve and scratch in the earth for the corn that had been planted there and with all their skill and cunning they did not see that anything was amiss until their claws were caught in hiawathas snares and they were helpless then hiawatha left his hidingplace among the bushes and strode toward the captive ravens and his appearance was so awful that the bravest of them hopped and shrieked and flapped their wings in terror he walked among them and killed them to the right and left in tens and twenties without mercy and he hung their dead bodies on poles to serve as scarecrows and to frighten away all other thieves and robbers from the sacred fields of corn only one of the ravens was spared by hiawatha and that was kahgahgee the ruler of them all hiawatha tied him with a string and fastened him to the ridgepole of his wigwam saying kahgahgee you are the cause of all this mischief and i am going to hold you as a warning to all the ravens left alive if they light upon the cornfields and begin again their wicked thieving i will kill you and hang your body on a pole as an example and hiawatha left kahgahgee tied fast to the ridgepole of the wigwam hopping and tugging angrily at his string and croaking in vain for his friends to come and set him free the summer passed and all the air became warm and soft with the haze of early autumn the corn had grown tall and yellow and the ears were almost bursting from their sheaths when old nokomis said to minnehaha let us gather the harvest and strip the ripe ears of all their husks and tassels and minnehaha and nokomis went through the village calling on the women and the maidens and the young men to come forth and help them with the husking of the corn all together they went to the cornfields and the old men and the warriors sat in the shade at the edges of the forest and smoked and looked on in approval while the young men and maidens stripped the ears of corn and laughed and sang merrily over their labor whenever a youth or a maiden found a crooked ear they all laughed even louder and crept about the cornfields like weak old men bent almost double with age but when some lucky maiden found a bloodred ear in the husking they all cried out ah nushka you shall have a sweetheart and the old men nodded in approval as they smoked beneath the pinetrees xiv picturewriting in those days the indians had no way of writing down what they thought and could only tell each other their messages and their dreams and wisdom by spoken words the deeds of hunters and the thoughts of wise men were remembered for a little while but soon were talked about less often and when the old men died there were none left who could tell about what had happened in the past the graveposts had no marks on them nor were the indians able to tell who were buried in the graves all they knew was that some one of their own tribe some former wise man or hunter or some beautiful maiden of other days lay buried there and hiawatha was much troubled that the indians did not know the graves of their own fathers and could not tell the men who should come after them about the wonderful things that had taken place long before they were born hiawatha spent many days alone in the deep forest trying to invent some way by which the indians could always know what had happened in the past and thereby tell secrets to each other and send messages without the risk of having them forgotten by the messenger and after a great deal of thought hiawatha discovered one of the finest things in all the wide world a secret that has changed the lives of all indians since his time he took his different colored paints and began to draw strange figures on the bark of the birchtree and every figure had some meaning that the red men would always remember for the great manito god of all the indians hiawatha painted the picture of an egg with different colored points toward the north and the south the east and the west to show that the great spirit was watching over all the world and could be found everywhere at once for the evil spirit hiawatha painted the picture of a great serpent to show that the evil spirit was as deadly and wicked and treacherous as any snake that crawled in the green marsh grass for life and death hiawatha drew two round spots and painted one of them white and the other black the white one was meant for life because white is clear and fair to look upon the black was meant for death because black is hideous and dark and hiawatha painted the sun and the moon and all the stars of heaven and he painted forests and mountains lakes and rivers animals and birds for the earth he drew a straight line like the line of the horizon and for the sky he drew a curved line like a bow he filled in the space between with white paint that was to mean the white light of day he painted a point at each side one for sunrise and the other for sunset and he drew a number of little stars to represent the night and hiawatha drew all sorts of pictures of men and wigwams and bows and arrows and canoes each with its own meaning until he had drawn different figures for the different thoughts of men he called the indians to come and see what he had painted and he said to them look and learn the meaning of these different figures go and paint upon the graves of those whom you remember some mark that will always show who it is that lies there buried and the indians painted on the graveposts of the graves they had not yet forgotten figures of bear and reindeer and turtles and cranes and beavers each one of them invented some sign by which he might always know his dead and from these signs many of the indians have been remembered to this day on their birch canoes the indians drew many different shapes and the brightest of them all was the figure of love it was painted in deep scarlet because scarlet is the strongest of all colors and the color meant i am greater than all others for the indians believed that love was mightier than life or death and more dangerous than either war or hunting other figures were also painted there and by looking at the pictures drawn by an indian you could tell who he was and what family he came from and whether he was stern and cruel or loving and kindhearted for the indians were apt to paint the things they thought about the most many were the gifts that hiawatha gave his people but when he taught them how to paint their thoughts he gave them a better gift than any other xv hiawathas lamentation when hiawatha lived there were many evil spirits on the earth and these evil spirits were very jealous of the friendship between hiawatha and chibiabos if we can only get this chibiabos in our power they plotted we will kill him and when he is dead hiawatha cannot do so much good to all the tribes of men for chibiabos helps him like a brother and together they are much too strong for us the evil spirits joined to destroy both chibiabos and hiawatha and they laid many traps and thought of many schemes to catch the two friends off their guard hiawatha was so wise that he knew of all this plotting and he often said to chibiabos o my brother stay with me always for together the evil spirits cannot do us any harm but chibiabos was young and heedless and he did not fear the evil spirits he laughed at hiawatha and said to him harm and evil never come near me my hiawatha have no fear on my account but hiawatha only shook his head and feared all the more because chibiabos feared so little once in the winter time when the bigseawater was covered with ice and snow chibiabos was hunting a buck with antlers and the buck ran right across the frozen lake wild with excitement of hunting chibiabos followed him and ran far out from shore upon the treacherous ice where the evil spirits were waiting for him when they saw that he was far enough from land they broke the ice and chibiabos fell with a crash and a splash into the freezing water of the lake even then he might have saved himself and climbed out upon the ice but the strong cruel watergod the god of the dacotahs wrapped his cold wet arms around the body of chibiabos and dragged him down down through the dark black water to the bottom there the watergod buried him beneath the mud and sand so that his dead body might not rise to the surface and the evil spirits danced for joy at the death of chibiabos we have killed him they shouted gleefully to one another we have killed the sweetest singer in the world and the dearest friend of hiawatha from the headlands on the shore hiawatha had seen chibiabos plunge into the lake and he heard the wicked shouting of the evil spirits he gave such a cry of sorrow that the forest trembled and the wolves on the prairie raised their heads to listen and then howled in answer while the hoarse thunder stirred itself among the mountains and awakened all the echoes to his cry then hiawatha smeared his face with black paint the color of sorrow and of death he covered his head with his robe and sat for seven long weeks in his wigwam grieving for the murdered chibiabos and the firtrees sadly waved their dark green branches to and fro above his head and sighed as mournfully as hiawatha spring came and all the birds and animals and even the rivulets and flowers and grasses looked in vain for the dead chibiabos the bluebird sang a song of sorrow from the treetops the robin echoed it from the silence of the thicket and the whippoorwill took up the sad refrain at night and wailed it far and wide through all the woodland chibiabos chibiabos murmured every living thing and all the echoes sighed in answer until the whole world seemed to mourn for the lost singer then the wise men of the tribes the medicinemen the men of magic came to hiawatha as he sat in sorrow in his hut and they walked before him in a grave procession to drive the sadness from his heart each of them carried a pouch of healing made of beaverskin or lynx or otter and filled with roots and herbs of wonderful power to cure all diseases and to drive the evil spirits of grief from the heart and from the mind to and fro they walked until hiawatha uncovered his head washed the black paint from his face and followed the wise men to the sacred lodge that they had built beside his own wigwam there they gave to hiawatha a marvelous drink made of spearmint and yarrow and all sorts of strange and different roots and when he had drunk of this they began a wild and mystic dance beating on the small drums that they carried and shaking their pouches of healing in the face of hiawatha hiauha they shouted in strange voices wayhaway we can cure you hiawatha we can make you strong and they shook their medicine pouches over hiawathas head and continued beating on their hollow drums as they circled wildly around him again and again all at once the sorrow left hiawathas heart as the ice is swept from a river in the springtime and like a man awakening from evil dreams he felt that he was healed and he gazed about him where the medicinemen were still dancing they were trying to summon chibiabos from his grave deep down in the sandy bottom of the bigseawater for the watergod had buried him so deep that his spirit could not go into the land of dead men but was still in his drowned body struggling to free itself and the magic of the wise men was so strong that chibiabos rose body and all and stood on the bottom of the lake listening to them then the dead man floated to the shore climbed out upon the bank and made his way swiftly and silently through the forest to the doorway of the wigwam where the medicinemen were singing when he shook the curtain of the doorway and peered in upon them they would not let him enter but gave him through an opening in the door a burning torch and told him to light a fire in the land of spirits so that all who died might see it and find their way thither and they made chibiabos ruler in the kingdom of the dead he left the doorway of the wigwam and vanished in the forest and the wise men watched the twinkling of his torch until it disappeared they saw that the branches did not move as he passed and that the dead leaves and the grass did not even bend or rustle beneath his footsteps and they looked at one another much afraid because such sights are not good for living men to see four days chibiabos traveled down the pathway of the dead and for his food he ate the dead mans strawberry he saw many other dead men struggling under heavy burdens of food and skins and wampum that their friends had given them to use in the land of spirits and they groaned beneath their burdens he passed them all crossed the sad dark river of death upon the swinging log that floats there and at last he came to the lake of silver and was carried in the stone canoe over the water to the islands of the blessed where he rules all ghosts and shadows when he had disappeared in the dark forest hiawatha left the sacred lodge and wandered eastward and westward teaching men the use of roots and herbs and the cure of all disorders and thus was first made known to the indians the sacred knowledge of caring for the sick xvi paupukkeewis you remember how paupukkeewis danced the beggars dance at hiawathas wedding and how in his wild leaping and whirling at the edges of the bigseawater he tossed up the mighty sand dunes of the nagow wudjoo and you remember also how the warriors all disliked paupukkeewis and called him an idler and coward for they knew his heart was bad within him only the women cared for paupukkeewis and the women were deceived by his handsome face and his costly dresses one morning paupukkeewis came in search of adventures to the village and found all the young men gathered in the wigwam of iagoo listening to the wonderful stories that old iagoo always told when any one would hear him he was telling how ojeeg the summermaker climbed up to the sky and made a hole in heaven that let out all the warm and pleasant weather of the summer months he was describing how the otter tried it first and how the beaver and the lynx and badger also tried it all of them climbing to the top of the highest mountain and hitting their heads against the sky they cracked it but they could not break it said iagoo and then ojeeg the weasel came and the wolverine helped him to make ready for the trial ojeeg climbed to the top of the mountain and the wolverine went with him the wolverine crouched down like a grasshopper on the mountain top with his legs all drawn up beneath him like a squirrel or a cricket and he leaped as hard as he was able at the sky the first time he leaped said iagoo the sky bent above him as the ice in rivers when the water rises beneath it in the springtime the second time he leaped the sky cracked open and he could see the light of heaven shining through and the third time he leaped crash the sky broke into bits above him and he disappeared in heaven followed closely by the valiant weasel who tumbled into heaven after him and has been called the summermaker ever since hark you cried paupukkeewis bursting through the open doorway of the wigwam i am tired of all this talk and i am tired of hiawathas endless wisdom listen to me and you shall learn something more interesting than old iagoos stories watch and i will teach you all a splendid game from his pouch he drew forth all the pieces used in the game of bowl and counters there were thirteen in all and nine were painted white on one side and red on the other while four were made of brass one side polished and the other painted black on nine of the thirteen pieces were painted pictures of men or ducks or serpents and paupukkeewis shook them all together in a wooden bowl and tossed them out explaining that the score was counted great or little according to the way the pictures and the colors fell upon the ground curious eyes stared at him as he shook and tossed and counted up the pieces until the indians were drawn into the game one after one and they sat there playing for prizes of weapons and fur robes and wampum through the rest of the day and through the night until the sun rose once again by that time the clever lucky paupukkeewis had won everything they owned deerskin shirts wampum pipes ermine robes and all sorts of weapons and he chuckled to himself then the crafty paupukkeewis said to them my wigwam is lonely and i want a companion in my wanderings i want a slave i will risk all the wampum and the fur robes everything that i have won against the nephew of iagoo that young man who is standing yonder but if i win again he shall be my slave for life done cried iagoo his eyes glowing like coals beneath his shaggy brows and he seized the bowl and shook it fiercely throwing out the pieces on the ground paupukkeewis counted took the bowl and threw in his turn and his throw was far more lucky than that of old iagoo the game is mine cried paupukkeewis smiling as he rose and looked about him and heaped all the robes and feathers and wampum and weapons in the arms of iagoos nephew now a slave carry them to my wigwam yonder said paupukkeewis and wait there until i have need of you and he left the tent followed by the angry glances of all the other players who had lost all their fine furs and wampum belts and even the pipes they had been smoking paupukkeewis strolled through the sunny morning singing to himself for his new wealth made him very happy and he soon reached the farthest wigwam of the village which was the home of hiawatha nobody was there only kahgahgee the raven tied to the ridgepole screamed and flapped his wings watching paupukkeewis with glaring eyes all are gone said paupukkeewis thinking of new mischief as he spoke all are gone and they have left the lodge for me to do with as i choose he seized the raven by the neck and whirled him around in the air like a rattle until the bird was strangled and he left kahgahgees dead body dangling from the ridgepole as an insult to hiawatha then he went inside and threw everything into the wildest disorder piling together all the kettles and bowls and all the skins and buffalorobes that he could find as an insult to minnehaha and to nokomis and he ran off through the forest whistling and singing much pleased with what he had done he climbed the rocks that overlooked the bigseawater and rested lazily upon his back gazing up into the sky and listening to the splash of the waves on the beaches far beneath the seagulls fluttered about him in great flocks very curious to know what he was doing and before they could get out of his way he had killed them by tens and twenties and had thrown the dead bodies over the cliff down to the beaches one of the seagulls who was perched on a crag above shouted out it is paupukkeewis and he is killing us by the hundred fly quickly and send a message to our brother hasten and bring the news to hiawatha xvii the hunting of paupukkeewis when hiawatha heard of the mischief that paupukkeewis had worked among the gulls he was very angry indeed but when he discovered the wrecked wigwam and the dead body of the raven and heard how paupukkeewis had despoiled iagoo and his friends of their robes and pipes and wampum he swore that he would kill paupukkeewis with his own hand the world is not so wide but i will find him cried out hiawatha the way is not so rough but i will reach him with my anger and with several hunters hiawatha set out upon the trail of paupukkeewis they followed it to the crags where he had killed the gulls but by that time paupukkeewis was far away among the lowlands and turning back he saw his pursuers on the mountain and waved his arms to mock them hiawatha shouted at him from the mountain top the world is not so rough and wide but i shall catch you paupukkeewis hide where you will but i shall find you out and paupukkeewis sped forward like an antelope for hiawathas words had made him suddenly afraid he rushed through the forest until he came to a little stream that had overflowed its banks and there he saw a dam made by the beavers paupukkeewis stood on the dam and called and the king of beavers ahmeek rose to the surface of the water to find out who the stranger might be ahmeek my friend said paupukkeewis the water is very cool and pleasant let me dive in and stay with you awhile change me into a beaver like yourself so that i may rest with you in your lodge beneath the water wait awhile said ahmeek looking at him cautiously i must ask the other beavers and he sank beneath the water like a stone paupukkeewis thought he could hear hiawatha and the hunters crashing through the forest and he waded out upon the dam calling to the beavers until one head after another popped up out of the water and all the beavers in the pond were looking at him your dwelling is very pleasant my friends said paupukkeewis in an entreating voice cannot you change me also into a beaver yes said ahmeek let yourself slide down into the water and you shall become as we are paupukkeewis slid down into the water and his deerskin shirt and moccasins and leggings became black and shiny his fringes drew together into a clump and became a broad black tail his teeth became sharp and long whiskers sprouted out from his cheeks he was changed into a beaver make me large he said as he swam about the pond make me ten times larger than the other beavers and ahmeek said yes when you enter our lodge beneath the water you shall be ten times as large as any one of us they sank down through the water and paupukkeewis saw great stores of food upon the bottom they entered the lodge and came up inside of it above the surface of the water and the lodge was divided into large rooms with ledges on which the beavers slept there they made paupukkeewis ten times larger than any other beaver and they said to him thenceforth you shall rule over all the rest of us and be our king but paupukkeewis had not been sitting long upon the throne of the beavers when he heard the voice of the beaver watchman call out from among the waterlilies hiawatha hiawatha there was a shout and a noise of rending branches and the water sucked out of the beavers lodge and left it high and dry their dam was broken the hunters jumped on the roof of the lodge and broke a great hole in it through which the sunlight streamed as the beavers scuttled away through their doorway to seek safety in deeper water but paupukkeewis was so big and so puffed up with heavy feeding and the pride of being a king that he could not crawl through the doorway with the others but was helpless before the hunters hiawatha looked through the roof and cried ah paupukkeewis i know you in spite of your disguise i said that you could not escape me and hiawatha and his hunters beat paupukkeewis with their heavy clubs until the beavers skull was broken into pieces six tall hunters bore the body of the beaver homeward and it was so heavy that they had to carry it slung from poles and branches that rested on their shoulders but within the dead body paupukkeewis still lived and thought and felt exactly as a man and at last with great effort he gathered himself together left the beavers body and assuming once more his own form he vanished in the forest hiawatha saw the figure as it stole away amid the shadows of the pinetrees and with a shout he leaped to his feet and gave chase with all his hunters who followed the flying paupukkeewis as the rain follows the wind the hunted man all breathless and worn out came to a large lake in the middle of the forest and there he saw the wild geese that we call the brant swimming and diving among the waterlilies and enjoying themselves upon the water o my brothers called paupukkeewis change me to a brant with shining feathers and two strong wings to carry me wherever i will go and make me ten times larger than any of you at once they changed him into a huge brant ten times larger than the others and with loud cries and a clamor of wings they rose in the air and flew high up into the sunlight as they flew they said to paupukkeewis take care that you do not look downward as you fly or something strange and terrible will happen to you but suddenly they heard a sound of shouting far beneath them and paupukkeewis who recognized the voice of iagoo and the tones of hiawatha forgot the warning about looking downward and drew in his long black neck to gaze upon the distant village the swift wind that was blowing behind him caught his mighty tailfeathers tipped him over and paupukkeewis struggling in vain to get his balance fell through the clear air like a heavy stone he heard the shouting of the people grow louder and louder he saw the brant become little specks in the air above him and plunging downward the great goose struck the ground with a heavy sullen thud and lay there dead but paupukkeewis still lived in the crushed body of the giant bird and he swiftly took his own form again and rushed along the shore of the bigseawater with hiawatha close upon his heels and hiawatha shouted at him as they ran the world is not so rough and wide but i shall catch you paupukkeewis hide where you will but i shall reach you with my anger and he was so close to paupukkeewis that he shot out his right hand to seize him by the shoulder paupukkeewis spun around in a circle whirled the dust into the air and leaped into a hollow oak tree where he changed himself into a serpent and came gliding out among the roots hiawatha broke the tree to pieces with a blow of his magic mittens but there was no paupukkeewis inside of it and hiawatha saw him once again in his own form running like the wind along the beach they ran until they came to the painted sandstone rocks where the old man of the mountain has his home and the old man opened the doorway of the rocks and gave paupukkeewis a hidingplace in the gloomy caverns underneath the mountains shutting the rock doorway with a heavy crash as hiawatha threw himself upon it with his magic mittens hiawatha knocked great holes in the rocks crying out in tones of thunder open open i am hiawatha but the old man of the mountain did not answer then hiawatha raised his hands to the heavens and implored the lightning and the thunder to come to his aid and break the rocks of sandstone into fragments and the lightning and the thunder came snarling and rumbling over the bigseawater at the call of hiawatha together hiawatha and the lightning split the rock doorway into fragments and the thunder boomed among the caverns shouting where is paupukkeewis paupukkeewis lay dead among the caves of sandstone killed by hiawatha and the lightning and thunder this time he was dead indeed crushed by the rocks that had fallen upon him and killed in his own form so he might never rise again hiawatha took the ghost of paupukkeewis and changed it into a great eagle that wheels and circles in the air to this day screaming from the mountain peaks and gliding in great slants over deep and empty valleys in winter when the wind whirled the snow in drifts and eddies around the wigwams the indians would say to one another there is paupukkeewis come from the mountains to dance once more among the villages and when we see great hills of sifted snow heaped high and white by winter wind we may think of paupukkeewis and his dance among the sand dunes xviii the death of kwasind the name and fame of kwasind the strong man had spread among all tribes of indians and in all the world there was nobody who dared to wrestle or to strive with this mighty friend of hiawatha but the little pigmy people the mischievous pukwudjies plotted against kwasind for they were very much afraid of him and thought he would destroy them if this great fellow goes on breaking whatever he touches tearing things to pieces and filling the whole world with wonder at his deeds what will happen to us cried the little people what will become of the pukwudjies he will step on us as if we were mushrooms he will drive us into the water and give our bodies to the wicked neebanawbaigs to be eaten and all the little people plotted to murder the cruel and wicked dangerous heartless kwasind there was one secret about kwasind that nobody on earth knew except himself and the clever little people all his strength and all his weakness came from the crown of his head nowhere but on the crown of his head could any weapon do him harm and even there nothing would hurt him except the blue seedcone that grows upon the firtree the little people had discovered this by their great skill in magic and they gathered together the blue cones of the firtree and piled them in great heaps upon the red rock ledges that overhung the river taquamenaw there they sat and waited until kwasind should pass by in his canoe it was a hot summer afternoon when kwasind the strong man in his birch canoe came floating slowly down the taquamenaw the air was very still and very warm the insects buzzed and hummed above the silent water and the locust sang from the dry sweetsmelling bushes on the shore in kwasinds ears there was a drowsy murmur and he felt the spirits of sleep beat upon his forehead with their soft little warclubs at the first blow his head nodded with slumber at the second blow his paddle trailed motionless in the water and at the third his eyes closed and he went fast asleep sitting bolt upright in his canoe the warm air quivered on the water the midges and the gnats sang in tiny voices and the locust once more struck up his shrill tune from the river bank when the sentinels of the little people went scampering down the beach calling out shrilly that kwasind was sound asleep in his canoe and drifting nearer and nearer to the fatal red rocks that overhung the river and all the little people climbed the rocks and peered down upon the water waiting until kwasind should pass beneath at last the canoe swung sideways around a bend in the river and came drifting down the slowmoving current as lightly as an alderleaf and the little people moved the fircones nearer to the edge and crouched there waiting death to kwasind they shouted in little voices as the canoe glided underneath the rocks death to kwasind and they rained down showers of blue fircones right on the defenseless head of the sleeping giant as a great boulder is tipped into a stream kwasind tottered sideways from his canoe struck the water with a sullen plunge that tossed the spray high in the air and the waters closed above him with a mighty sob bottom upward his canoe drifted down the river and nothing was seen or heard of kwasind from that day to this but his memory lived long among the indians who would tell their children of his great feats of strength and show to them the boulder that kwasind had pitched into the swift pauwating river when he was little more than a boy when the gales of winter tossed the pinetrees and roared among the branches until they groaned and split with a terrible noise of rending wood the indians would say to one another as they sat in their warm wigwams and listened to the wind shake the forest to its roots there goes kwasind gathering his firewood and in the country where he lived near the bigseawater there are still many marks of his great strength that will show to any who care to see what a mighty man this kwasind was xix the ghosts the vulture never drops from the heavens to seize his prey upon the desert but some other vulture views his plunge and follows swiftly other vultures see the second and in a few minutes their victim finds a row of them before him and the air dark with their wings just so do troubles come upon human beings not one at a time but together until the unhappy man or woman finds the air as black as midnight with their shadows and in this way did troubles pursue the unfortunate hiawatha first chibiabos died murdered by the evil spirits then kwasind was killed as he drifted down the stream asleep in his canoe and then in the dark winter when the ice had bound the rivers and the trees were naked in the bitter air another sorrow came upon hiawatha but before it came he had a strange adventure and from this he knew that he would be forced to undergo some mighty trial one black wintry evening after the sun had set nokomis and minnehaha were sitting together in their wigwam waiting for hiawatha to return from the hunt when they heard light and measured footsteps on the snow and the curtain that hung in the doorway of their lodge was slowly lifted two shadowy figures entered two women who seemed strangers in the village and without a word they took their seats in the darkest corner of the wigwam and crouched there silently and sadly shivering with cold their faces were very white their clothes were thin and torn and they would not answer anything that nokomis or minnehaha said to them was it the wind blowing down the smokeflue or was it the hooting of the owl that made both minnehaha and nokomis think that they heard a voice come out of the darkness and say to them these are dead people that sit before you and share your fire they are ghosts from the land of the hereafter who have come to haunt you at all events they thought that such a voice cried out to them and they were very much afraid when hiawatha entered fresh from hunting and laid the red deer he had been carrying at the feet of minnehaha never before did hiawatha appear so handsome and minnehaha thought him even nobler than when he came to woo her by the waterfall in the land of the dacotahs turning hiawatha saw the two strange guests who had not said a word when he had entered but crouched silently in the darkest corner of the wigwam with their hoods drawn over their white faces only their eyes gleamed like dull coals as they gazed upon the firelight but hiawatha did not ask a single question although he wondered greatly and he set about preparing the deer for their evening meal when the meat was ready the two guests still without saying a word sprang like wolves from their corners seized upon the choicest parts the white fat that hiawatha had saved for minnehaha and retreated with their portions back to the shadow of their corner and although hiawatha and minnehaha and nokomis were amazed by the strange actions of their guests they did not show it by word or look but acted as if nothing had happened only minnehaha found time to whisper to hiawatha they are famished let them eat of what they will many days passed and the two strange women still sat cowering in their corner of the wigwam but at night when everybody slept they went out into the gloomy forest and brought back wood and pinecones for the fire whenever hiawatha returned from hunting or fishing and the evening meal had been prepared they would leap from their dark corner seize the very choicest portions that had been set aside for minnehaha and without any question being asked them or any blame for their strange conduct they would flit back into the darkest shadow and devour their food like hungry wolves never once did nokomis or minnehaha or hiawatha reprove them by a single word or look preferring to endure the insult rather than to break in any way the law of hospitality and the sacred custom of freegiving and through it all the pale sad women never said a word one night however hiawatha lay awake watching the embers of the fire when he heard loud groans and sobbing and saw the two strange guests sitting bolt upright on their couches weeping bitterly and hiawatha asked them o my guests why is it that you are so unhappy and weep together in the middle of the night has old nokomis or minnehaha wronged you in any way or failed to treat you with proper courtesy the two women left off weeping and answered in low and gentle voices hiawatha we are spirits we are the souls of those who once lived here on earth and we have come from the kingdom of chibiabos to warn you every cry of sorrow for the dead is heard in the land of spirits and calls back those of us for whom you mourn we are much saddened by this useless sorrow and we have come from the blessed islands to ask you to tell all your people what we say do not vex our ears with weeping and do not lay upon our graves so many robes and kettles and wampumbelts for the spirits find these a heavy burden only give us food to carry with us on our journey and see that a fire is lighted for us on the four nights following our death for the journey to the land of spirits takes four days and four nights and the cheerful firelight saves us from groping in the darkness now farewell hiawatha we have put you to a great trial and have found you brave and noble do not fail in the greater trial and the harder struggle that you will shortly have to suffer their voices died away and sudden darkness filled the wigwam hiawatha heard the rustle of their garments as they passed him saw a gleam of starlight as they lifted the curtain from the doorway and when he rekindled the fire he found that the pale sad women his strange guests had disappeared xx the famine oh the cruel and bitter winter that followed the ice on the rivers and lakes became thicker and harder than ever before the snow on the fields and in the forests was so deep that the indians could hardly force their way out of their buried wigwams no game ran through the frozen thickets no birds flew among the trees in the level snow the starving hunters could not find a single track of deer or rabbit and the corn in the village became less and less until it was all gone then the children began to cry with hunger the women went about with faces pinched and drawn and the men drew their belts tighter day by day at night the stars in the heavens seemed to glare like the eyes of famished wolves and the cold wind moaned among the trees as if the very air were suffering from want it was an evil time when the famine was at its worst two more strange guests came to the wigwam of hiawatha nor did they linger at the doorway and wait to be invited in they entered without a word and with sunken eyes they gazed at minnehaha and one of them said in a hollow voice look on me my name is famine and the other one cried out i am fever the lovely minnehaha shivered when she saw them and a great chill came over her she lay down on her bed and hid her face and as the wicked guests continued to gaze she felt first burning heat then icy coldness dart like arrows through her body hiawatha rushed into the forest to find some food for minnehaha and to drive away the awful visitors but the forest was bleak and empty and there was no food to be had ah great manito cried out hiawatha give me food for my dying minnehaha before the fever and famine tear her from me forever but the great manito did not answer and the silent forest only murmured dully echoing the words of hiawatha with his bow and arrows he strode for miles through the deserted woods where he had once led his young bride homeward from the land of the dacotahs but now no animals peeped at him from amid the tree trunks and there was no cheerful fluttering and singing from the branches everything was deathly silent muffled in a mighty cloak of snow illustration seven long days and nights he sat there page while he was searching in vain for food the two dark figures in the wigwam drew closer and closer to minnehaha until they crouched at either side of her bed of branches and one of them said in hollow tones my name is famine and the other cried out i am fever and they leaned over the bed and fixed their sunken eyes on minnehaha and nokomis could not frighten them away hark said minnehaha as the fever gazed upon her i hear a rushing and a roaring i hear the falls of minnehaha calling to me from the land of the dacotahs no my child said nokomis it is nothing but the wind of night that blows amid the pine trees look said minnehaha as the fever drew still closer to her bed i see my father standing in his doorway i see him beckoning to me from his wigwam ah no my child said nokomis sadly it is nothing but the smoke of our fire curling upward to the smokeflue oh said minnehaha i see the eyes of death glaring at me in the darkness i feel his icy fingers clasping mine hiawatha hiawatha the wretched hiawatha miles away in the dark forest heard minnehaha cry to him and he hurried homeward with a sinking heart but before he reached his wigwam he heard the voice of nokomis wailing through the night what a sight met his eyes as he burst into his dreary lodge nokomis was rocking sadly to and fro moaning and weeping and minnehaha lay cold and dead upon her bed of branches hiawatha gave such a cry of sorrow that the forest shuddered and groaned and even the stars in heaven trembled then he sat down at the feet of minnehaha and covered his face with both his hands seven days and nights he sat there without moving or speaking and he did not know whether it was night or day at last he rose and wrapped minnehaha in her softest robes of ermine and they made a grave for her in the snow beneath the hemlock trees four nights they kindled a fire on her grave so that her soul might have cheerful light upon its journey to the blessed islands and hiawatha watched from the doorway of his wigwam to see that the fire was burning brightly so she might never be left in darkness and he said farewell my minnehaha my heart is buried with you and before long my task here will be finished and i will join you in the blessed islands soon i shall follow in your footsteps to the land of hereafter xxi the white mans foot in a lodge built close beside a frozen river sat an old man whose hair was whiter than the whitest snow and he shook and trembled as he sat there hearing nothing but the gale that raged outside and seeing nothing but the flakes of snow that leaped and whirled about his chilly wigwam all the coals of his fire were covered with white ashes and the fire itself was dying away unheeded when a bright youth with red blood in his cheeks walked lightly through the open doorway on his head was a crown of fresh and sweetsmelling grasses his lips were curved in a beautiful smile and he carried in his hand a bunch of flowers that filled the lodge with the fragrance of the wildwood ah my son said the old man it does my old eyes good to gaze upon you take a seat beside my fire and we will pass the night together tell me of your travels and your strange adventures and let me tell you of all the wonderful deeds that i have done the old man drew a peacepipe from his pouch filled it with willowbark and handed it to the beautiful young stranger who smoked in silence while he listened to the old mans words when i blow my breath about me said the old man the water becomes as hard as stone and the rivers cannot move when i breathe upon the meadows and the woodlands answered the young stranger with a sunny smile the flowers rise like magic and the rivers with a song go rushing on again when i shake my long white hair said the old man scowling the land is buried with snow and the leaves all fade away and fall to earth when i raise my voice the ground becomes like flint the wild fowl fly away and the wild beasts of the forest hide for fear when i shake my flowing ringlets said the young man with a light laugh the warm rain falls on the hills and fields and the wild geese and the heron come back to the marshes homeward flies the swallow and the robin and the bluebird sing for joy wherever i go the woodlands ring with music and the meadows become blue with violets while they were speaking the great sun leaped up above the horizon and shot his beams of orange gold through the doorway of the wigwam the air became warm and pleasant and in the light of morning the young stranger saw the icy face of the old man and knew that he had spent the night with peboan the winter from the old mans eyes the tears were running in two streams the water was dripping from his hair and his body shrank until it vanished into the ground and on the hearthstone where the old mans fire had been smoking blossomed the earliest flower of springtime thus did the young stranger spring come back again and drive away the icy chill of that dreadful winter of famine and death to the northward passed the wild swans calling to one another and the bluebirds and the pigeons and the robins sang in the thicket until the grieving hiawatha heard their voices and went forth from his gloomy wigwam to gaze up into the warm blue sky from his wanderings in the east returned iagoo the great boaster full of stories more wonderful than any that he had ever told and the people laughed as they listened to him saying cold and famine have not harmed iagoo he is just the same as ever and has seen more wonders in his travels than the great manito himself i have seen a water greater than the bigseawater cried iagoo much greater and over it came a huge canoe with large white wings that carried it along it cant be true cried all the indians laughing at iagoo we dont believe one word of what you say from the canoe went on iagoo came thunder and lightning and a hundred warriors landed on the beach their faces were painted white and there was hair upon their chins what lies you tell us shouted all the people do not think that we believe you hiawatha only did not join in the roar of laughter that iagoos words called forth from all the men and women and children who were listening what he tells is true said hiawatha i have seen it all in a dream i have seen the great canoe of the whitefaced people come sailing from the land of sunrise i have seen these people moving swiftly westward under the guidance of the great manito until the fires of their wigwams smoked in all the valleys while their canoes rushed over all the lakes and rivers let us welcome them said hiawatha let us give them of our best and call them brothers for the great manito has sent them and they come to do his bidding then i had another vision hiawatha went on sadly i saw our people fighting with one another forgetful of the warning of the great manito and the forests where we hunted and the rivers where we fished and trapped the beaver knew our faces and our voices no more for our people were scattered like the autumn leaves until no indians were left upon the earth and when his voice died away the indians all sat in silence and looked at one another with a sudden fear xxii hiawathas departure on the shore of the bigseawater in the sunny morning hiawatha stood in the doorway of his wigwam gazing out over the shining lake the sky was bright and blue above him the pebbles sparkled on the beaches and the still water reflected the great pinetrees of the forest every trace of sorrow was gone from hiawathas face and with a smile of joy he lifted his open hands toward the blazing sun to shade his eyes he was watching something that floated far out on the water some image which he could not plainly see but which was drawing nearer and nearer to the village at last he saw that it was a birch canoe with paddles flashing as they rose and fell and in it came the whitefaced people from the land of sunrise led by a bearded chief in a black robe who wore a cross upon his breast the canoe grated on the pebbles and hiawatha with his hands stretched outward as a sign of friendship called to them in welcome the sun is fair to look upon o strangers cried out hiawatha our town waits for you in peace and the doors of all our wigwams stand open to receive you our tobacco never was so sweet and pleasant and our waving cornfields never seemed so beautiful to behold as this morning when you visit us from faroff lands and the chief of the strange people the bearded man in the black robe answered stammering a little for the language of the indians was strange to him may the peace of christ be with you and your people hiawatha then the noblehearted hiawatha led them to his wigwam where he seated them on skins of bison and ermine while nokomis brought them water in cups of birchbark and food in bowls of polished basswood and when they were done with eating peacepipes were filled with willowbark and lighted for them to smoke all the warriors and old men and the magicians of the village came to welcome the great strangers and they sat around the doorway of hiawathas wigwam in a large circle smoking their pipes and waiting for the strangers to come forth and to speak to them the blackrobed chief went out of the wigwam and greeted all the indians while they said to him o brother it is well that you have come so far to see us then the bearded man in the black robe commenced to speak showing them the cross that he wore upon his breast and he told them about christ and the virgin mary and how the wicked tribe the jews had taken christ and crucified him long ago and the indians smoked on in silence listening to his words it is well they said when he had finished we will think upon your words of wisdom we are pleased then they rose and went home to their wigwams where they told the young men and women all about the strangers who had been sent by the great manito and in hiawathas lodge the strangers weary from their journey and the summer heat stretched themselves upon the robes of ermine and went fast asleep slowly a coolness fell upon the air and the rays of sunset gilded every thicket of the forest when hiawatha rose from his seat and whispered to nokomis saying o nokomis i am going on a long journey to the land of sunset and the home of the northwest wind see that no harm comes to these guests whom i leave here in your care see that fear and danger or want of food and shelter never come near them in the lodge of hiawatha forth went hiawatha into the village and he bade farewell to all the warriors and to all the young men saying to them my people i am going on a distant journey and many winters will have passed before i come once more among you listen to the truth my guests will tell you for the great manito has sent them and i leave them in your care and now farewell cried hiawatha on the shore of the bigseawater for the last time hiawatha launched his birch canoe pushed it out from among the rushes and whispered to it westward westward it darted forward like an arrow and the rays of the setting sun shot a long and fiery pathway over the smooth waters of the lake down this path of light sailed hiawatha in his birch canoe right into the flaming sunset and the indians on the shore saw him moving on and on until he became a tiny speck against the splendor of the clouds with a final lift and fall his canoe rose upon a sunbeam and as it disappeared within the crimson sky the indians all cried out farewell farewell o hiawatha and the trees in the forest the waves on the edges of the lake and every living creature that ran or swam or flew took up the cry farewell hiawatha for hiawatha had disappeared forever in the kingdom of the northwest wind and the islands of the blessed the song of hiawatha introduction should you ask me whence these stories whence these legends and traditions with the odors of the forest with the dew and damp of meadows with the curling smoke of wigwams with the rushing of great rivers with their

land of the ojibways from the land of the dacotahs from the mountains moors and fenlands where the heron the shuhshuhgah feeds among the reeds and rushes i repeat them as i heard them from the lips of nawadaha the musician the sweetsinger should you ask where nawadaha found these songs so wild and wayward found these legends and traditions i should answer i should tell you in the birdsnests of the forest in the lodges of the beaver in the hoofprints of the bison in the eyry of the eagle all the wildfowl sang them to him in the moorlands and the fenlands in the melancholy marshes chetowaik the plover sang them mahng the loon the wildgoose wawa the blue heron the shuhshuhgah and the grouse the mushkodasa if still further you should ask me saying who was nawadaha tell us of this nawadaha i should answer your inquiries straightway in such words as follow in the vale of tawasentha in the green and silent valley by the pleasant watercourses dwelt the singer nawadaha round about the indian village spread the meadows and the cornfields and beyond them stood the forest stood the groves of singing pinetrees green in summer white in winter ever sighing ever singing and the pleasant watercourses you could trace them through the valley by the rushing in the springtime by the alders in the summer by the white fog in the autumn by the black line in the winter and beside them dwelt the singer in the vale of tawasentha in the green and silent valley there he sang of hiawatha sang the song of hiawatha sang his wondrous birth and being how he prayed and how he fasted how he lived and toiled and suffered that the tribes of men might prosper that he might advance his people ye who love the haunts of nature love the sunshine of the meadow love the shadow of the forest love the wind among the branches and the rainshower and the snowstorm and the rushing of great rivers through their palisades of pinetrees and the thunder in the mountains whose innumerable echoes flap like eagles in their eyries listen to these wild traditions to this song of hiawatha ye who love a nations legends love the ballads of a people that like voices from afar off call to us to pause and listen speak in tones so plain and childlike scarcely can the ear distinguish whether they are sung or spoken listen to this indian legend to this song of hiawatha ye whose hearts are fresh and simple who have faith in god and nature who believe that in all ages every human heart is human that in even savage bosoms there are longings yearnings strivings for the good they comprehend not that the feeble hands and helpless groping blindly in the darkness touch gods right hand in that darkness and are lifted up and strengthened listen to this simple story to this song of hiawatha ye who sometimes in your rambles through the green lanes of the country where the tangled barberrybushes hang their tufts of crimson berries over stone walls gray with mosses pause by some neglected graveyard for a while to muse and ponder on a halfeffaced inscription written with little skill of songcraft homely phrases but each letter full of hope and yet of heartbreak full of all the tender pathos of the here and the hereafter stay and read this rude inscription read this song of hiawatha the song of hiawatha i the peacepipe on the mountains of the prairie on the great red pipestone quarry gitche manito the mighty he the master of life descending on the red crags of the quarry stood erect and called the nations called the tribes of men together from his footprints flowed a river leaped into the light of morning oer the precipice plunging downward gleamed like ishkoodah the comet and the spirit stooping earthward with his finger on the meadow traced a winding pathway for it saying to it run in this way from the red stone of the quarry with his hand he broke a fragment molded it into a pipehead shaped and fashioned it with figures from the margin of the river took a long reed for a pipestem with its dark green leaves upon it filled the pipe with bark of willow with the bark of the red willow breathed upon the neighboring forest made its great boughs chafe together till in flame they burst and kindled and erect upon the mountains gitche manito the mighty smoked the calumet the peacepipe as a signal to the nations and the smoke rose slowly slowly through the tranquil air of morning first a single line of darkness then a denser bluer vapor then a snowwhite cloud unfolding like the treetops of the forest ever rising rising rising till it touched the top of heaven till it broke against the heaven and rolled outward all around it from the vale of tawasentha from the valley of wyoming from the groves of tuscaloosa from the faroff rocky mountains from the northern lakes and rivers all the tribes beheld the signal saw the distant smoke ascending the pukwana of the peacepipe and the prophets of the nations said behold it the pukwana by this signal from afar off bending like a wand of willow waving like a hand that beckons gitche manito the mighty calls the tribes of men together calls the warriors to his council down the rivers oer the prairies came the warriors of the nations came the delawares and mohawks came the choctaws and comanches came the shoshonies and blackfeet came the pawnees and omahas came the mandans and dacotahs came the hurons and ojibways all the warriors drawn together by the signal of the peacepipe to the mountains of the prairie to the great red pipestone quarry and they stood there on the meadow with their weapons and their wargear painted like the leaves of autumn painted like the sky of morning wildly glaring at each other in their faces stern defiance in their hearts the feuds of ages the hereditary hatred the ancestral thirst of vengeance gitche manito the mighty the creator of the nations looked upon them with compassion with paternal love and pity looked upon their wrath and wrangling but as quarrels among children but as feuds and fights of children over them he stretched his right hand to subdue their stubborn natures to allay their thirst and fever by the shadow of his right hand spake to them with voice majestic as the sound of faroff waters falling into deep abysses warning chiding spake in this wise o my children my poor children listen to the words of wisdom listen to the words of warning from the lips of the great spirit from the master of life who made you i have given you lands to hunt in i have given you streams to fish in i have given you bear and bison i have given you roe and reindeer i have given you brant and beaver filled the marshes full of wildfowl filled the rivers full of fishes why then are you not contented why then will you hunt each other i am weary of your quarrels weary of your wars and bloodshed weary of your prayers for vengeance of your wranglings and dissensions all your strength is in your union all your danger is in discord therefore be at peace henceforward and as brothers live together i will send a prophet to you a deliverer of the nations who shall guide you and shall teach you who shall toil and suffer with you if you listen to his counsels you will multiply and prosper if his warnings pass unheeded you will fade away and perish bathe now in the stream before you wash the warpaint from your faces wash the bloodstains from your fingers bury your warclubs and your weapons break the red stone from this quarry mold and make it into peacepipes take the reeds that grow beside you deck them with your brightest feathers smoke the calumet together and as brothers live henceforward then upon the ground the warriors threw their cloaks and shirts of deerskin threw their weapons and their wargear leaped into the rushing river washed the warpaint from their faces clear above them flowed the water clear and limpid from the footprints of the master of life descending dark below them flowed the water soiled and stained with streaks of crimson as if blood were mingled with it from the river came the warriors clean and washed from all their warpaint on the banks their clubs they buried buried all their warlike weapons gitche manito the mighty the great spirit the creator smiled upon his helpless children and in silence all the warriors broke the red stone of the quarry smoothed and formed it into peacepipes broke the long reeds by the river decked them with their brightest feathers and departed each one homeward while the master of life ascending through the opening of cloudcurtains through the doorways of the heaven vanished from before their faces in the smoke that rolled around him the pukwana of the peacepipe ii the four winds honor be to mudjekeewis cried the warriors cried the old men when he came in triumph homeward with the sacred belt of wampum from the regions of the northwind from the kingdom of wabasso from the land of the white rabbit he had stolen the belt of wampum from the neck of mishemokwa from the great bear of the mountains from the terror of the nations as he lay asleep and cumbrous on the summit of the mountains like a rock with mosses on it spotted brown and gray with mosses silently he stole upon him till the red nails of the monster almost touched him almost scared him till the hot breath of his nostrils warmed the hands of mudjekeewis as he drew the belt of wampum over the round ears that heard not over the small eyes that saw not over the long nose and nostrils the black muzzle of the nostrils out of which the heavy breathing warmed the hands of mudjekeewis then he swung aloft his warclub shouted loud and long his warcry smote the mighty mishemokwa in the middle of the forehead right between the eyes he smote him with the heavy blow bewildered rose the great bear of the mountains but his knees beneath him trembled and he whimpered like a woman as he reeled and staggered forward as he sat upon his haunches and the mighty mudjekeewis standing fearlessly before him taunted him in loud derision spake disdainfully in this wise hark you bear you are a coward and no brave as you pretended else you would not cry and whimper like a miserable woman bear you know our tribes are hostile long have been at war together now you find that we are strongest you go sneaking in the forest you go hiding in the mountains had you conquered me in battle not a groan would i have uttered but you bear sit here and whimper and disgrace your tribe by crying like a wretched shaugodaya like a cowardly old woman then again he raised his warclub smote again the mishemokwa in the middle of his forehead broke his skull as ice is broken when one goes to fish in winter thus was slain the mishemokwa he the great bear of the mountains he the terror of the nations honor be to mudjekeewis with a shout exclaimed the people honor be to mudjekeewis henceforth he shall be the westwind and hereafter and forever shall he hold supreme dominion over all the winds of heaven call him no more mudjekeewis call him kabeyun the westwind thus was mudjekeewis chosen father of the winds of heaven for himself he kept the westwind gave the others to his children unto wabun gave the eastwind gave the south to shawondasee and the northwind wild and cruel to the fierce kabibonokka young and beautiful was wabun he it was who brought the morning he it was whose silver arrows chased the dark oer hill and valley he it was whose cheeks were painted with the brightest streaks of crimson and whose voice awoke the village called the deer and called the hunter lonely in the sky was wabun though the birds sang gayly to him though the wildflowers of the meadow filled the air with odors for him though the forests and the rivers sang and shouted at his coming still his heart was sad within him for he was alone in heaven but one morning gazing earthward while the village still was sleeping and the fog lay on the river like a ghost that goes at sunrise he beheld a maiden walking all alone upon a meadow gathering waterflags and rushes by a river in the meadow every morning gazing earthward still the first thing he beheld there was her blue eyes looking at him two blue lakes among the rushes and he loved the lonely maiden who thus waited for his coming for they both were solitary she on earth and he in heaven and he wooed her with caresses wooed her with his smile of sunshine with his flattering words he wooed her with his sighing and his singing gentlest whispers in the branches softest music sweetest odors till he drew her to his bosom folded in his robes of crimson till into a star he changed her trembling still upon his bosom and forever in the heavens they are seen together walking wabun and the wabunannung wabun and the star of morning but the fierce kabibonokka had his dwelling among icebergs in the everlasting snowdrifts in the kingdom of wabasso in the land of the white rabbit he it was whose hand in autumn painted all the trees with scarlet stained the leaves with red and yellow he it was who sent the snowflakes sifting hissing through the forest froze the ponds the lakes the rivers drove the loon and seagull southward drove the cormorant and curlew to their nests of sedge and seatang in the realms of shawondasee once the fierce kabibonokka issued from his lodge of snowdrifts from his home among the icebergs and his hair with snow besprinkled streamed behind him like a river like a black and wintry river as he howled and hurried southward over frozen lakes and moorlands there among the reeds and rushes found he shingebis the diver trailing strings of fish behind him oer the frozen fens and moorlands lingering still among the moorlands though his tribe had long departed to the land of shawondasee cried the fierce kabibonokka who is this that dares to brave me dares to stay in my dominions when the wawa has departed when the wildgoose has gone southward and the heron the shuhshuhgah long ago departed southward i will go into his wigwam i will put his smouldering fire out and at night kabibonokka to the lodge came wild and wailing heaped the snow in drifts about it shouted down into the smokeflue shook the lodgepoles in his fury flapped the curtain of the doorway shingebis the diver feared not shingebis the diver cared not four great logs had he for firewood one for each moon of the winter and for food the fishes served him by his blazing fire he sat there warm and merry eating laughing singing o kabibonokka you are but my fellowmortal then kabibonokka entered and though shingebis the diver felt his presence by the coldness felt his icy breath upon him still he did not cease his singing still he did not leave his laughing only turned the log a little only made the fire burn brighter made the sparks fly up the smokeflue from kabibonokkas forehead from his snowbesprinkled tresses drops of sweat fell fast and heavy making dints upon the ashes as along the eves of lodges as from drooping boughs of hemlock drips the melting snow in springtime making hollows in the snowdrifts till at last he rose defeated could not bear the heat and laughter could not bear the merry singing but rushed headlong through the doorway stamped upon the crusted snowdrifts stamped upon the lakes and rivers made the snow upon them harder made the ice upon them thicker challenged shingebis the diver to come forth and wrestle with him to come forth and wrestle naked on the frozen fens and moorlands forth went shingebis the diver wrestled all night with the northwind wrestled naked on the moorlands with the fierce kabibonokka till his panting breath grew fainter till his frozen grasp grew feebler till he reeled and staggered backward and retreated baffled beaten to the kingdom of wabasso to the land of the white rabbit hearing still the gusty laughter hearing shingebis the diver singing o kabibonokka you are but my fellowmortal shawondasee fat and lazy had his dwelling far to southward in the drowsy dreamy sunshine in the neverending summer he it was who sent the woodbirds sent the opechee the robin sent the blue bird the owaissa sent the shawshaw sent the swallow sent the wildgoose wawa northward sent the melons and tobacco and the grapes in purple clusters from his pipe the smoke ascending filled the sky with haze and vapor filled the air with dreamy softness gave a twinkle to the water touched the rugged hills with smoothness brought the tender indian summer to the melancholy northland in the dreary moon of snowshoes listless careless shawondasee in his life he had one shadow in his heart one sorrow had he once as he was gazing northward far away upon a prairie he beheld a maiden standing saw a tall and slender maiden all alone upon a prairie brightest green were all her garments and her hair was like the sunshine day by day he gazed upon her day by day he sighed with passion day by day his heart within him grew more hot with love and longing for the maid with yellow tresses but he was too fat and lazy to bestir himself and woo her yes too indolent and easy to pursue her and persuade her so he only gazed upon her only sat and sighed with passion for the maiden of the prairie till one morning looking northward he beheld her yellow tresses changed and covered oer with whiteness covered as with whitest snowflakes ah my brother from the northland from the kingdom of wabasso from the land of the white rabbit you have stolen the maiden from me you have laid your hand upon her you have wooed and won my maiden with your stories of the northland thus the wretched shawondasee breathed into the air his sorrow and the southwind oer the prairie wandered warm with sighs of passion with the sighs of shawondasee till the air seemed full of snowflakes full of thistledown the prairie and the maid with hair like sunshine vanished from his sight forever never more did shawondasee see the maid with yellow tresses poor deluded shawondasee twas no woman that you gazed at twas no maiden that you sighed for twas the prairie dandelion that through all the dreamy summer you had gazed at with such longing you had sighed for with such passion and had puffed away forever blown into the air with sighing ah deluded shawondasee thus the four winds were divided thus the sons of mudjekeewis had their stations in the heavens at the corners of the heavens for himself the westwind only kept the mighty mudjekeewis iii hiawathas childhood downward through the evening twilight in the days that are forgotten in the unremembered ages from the full moon fell nokomis fell the beautiful nokomis she a wife but not a mother she was sporting with her women swinging in a swing of grapevines when her rival the rejected full of jealousy and hatred cut the leafy swing asunder cut in twain the twisted grapevines and nokomis fell affrighted downward through the evening twilight on the muskoday the meadow on the prairie full of blossoms see a star falls said the people from the sky a star is falling there among the ferns and mosses there among the prairie lilies on the muskoday the meadow in the moonlight and the starlight fair nokomis bore a daughter and she called her name wenonah as the firstborn of her daughters and the daughter of nokomis grew up like the prairie lilies grew a tall and slender maiden with the beauty of the moonlight with the beauty of the starlight and nokomis warned her often saying oft and oft repeating o beware of mudjekeewis of the westwind mudjekeewis listen not to what he tells you lie not down upon the meadow stoop not down among the lilies lest the westwind come and harm you but she heeded not the warning heeded not those words of wisdom and the westwind came at evening walking lightly oer the prairie whispering to the leaves and blossoms bending low the flowers and grasses found the beautiful wenonah lying there among the lilies wooed her with his words of sweetness wooed her with his soft caresses till she bore a son in sorrow bore a son of love and sorrow thus was born my hiawatha thus was born the child of wonder but the daughter of nokomis hiawathas gentle mother in her anguish died deserted by the westwind false and faithless by the heartless mudjekeewis for her daughter long and loudly wailed and wept the sad nokomis o that i were dead she murmured o that i were dead as thou art no more work and no more weeping wahonowin wahonowin by the shores of gitche gumee by the shining bigseawater stood the wigwam of nokomis daughter of the moon nokomis dark behind it rose the forest rose the black and gloomy pinetrees rose the firs with cones upon them bright before it beat the water beat the clear and sunny water beat the shining bigseawater there the wrinkled old nokomis nursed the little hiawatha rocked him in his linden cradle bedded soft in moss and rushes safely bound with reindeer sinews stilled his fretful wail by saying hush the naked bear will get thee lulled him into slumber singing ewayea my little owlet who is this that lights the wigwam with his great eyes lights the wigwam ewayea my little owlet many things nokomis taught him of the stars that shine in heaven showed him ishkoodah the comet ishkoodah with fiery tresses showed the deathdance of the spirits warriors with their plumes and warclubs flaring far away to northward in the frosty nights of winter showed the broad white road in heaven pathway of the ghosts the shadows running straight across the heavens crowded with the ghosts the shadows at the door on summer evenings sat the little hiawatha heard the whispering of the pinetrees heard the lapping of the water sounds of music words of wonder minnewawa said the pinetrees mudway aushka said the water saw the firefly wahwahtaysee flitting through the dusk of evening with the twinkle of its candle lighting up the brakes and bushes and he sang the song of children sang the song nokomis taught him wahwahtaysee little firefly little flitting whitefire insect little dancing whitefire creature light me with your little candle ere upon my bed i lay me ere in sleep i close my eyelids saw the moon rise from the water rippling rounding from the water saw the flecks and shadows on it whispered what is that nokomis and the good nokomis answered once a warrior very angry seized his grandmother and threw her up into the sky at midnight right against the moon he threw her tis her body that you see there saw the rainbow in the heaven in the eastern sky the rainbow whispered what is that nokomis and the good nokomis answered tis the heaven of flowers you see there all the wildflowers of the forest all the lilies of the prairie when on earth they fade and perish blossom in that heaven above us when he heard the owls at midnight hooting laughing in the forest what is that he cried in terror what is that he said nokomis and the good nokomis answered that is but the owl and owlet talking in their native language talking scolding at each other then the little hiawatha learned of every bird its language learned their names and all their secrets how they built their nests in summer where they hid themselves in winter talked with them wheneer he met them called them hiawathas chickens of all beasts he learned the language learned their names and all their secrets how the beavers built their lodges where the squirrels hid their acorns how the reindeer ran so swiftly why the rabbit was so timid talked with them wheneer he met them called them hiawathas brothers then iagoo the great boaster he the marvellous storyteller he the traveller and the talker he the friend of old nokomis made a bow for hiawatha from a branch of ash he made it from an oakbough made the arrows tipped with flint and winged with feathers and the cord he made of deerskin then he said to hiawatha go my son into the forest where the red deer herd together kill for us a famous roebuck kill for us a deer with antlers forth into the forest straightway all alone walked hiawatha proudly with his bow and arrows and the birds sang round him oer him do not shoot us hiawatha sang the opechee the robin sang the bluebird the owaissa do not shoot us hiawatha up the oaktree close beside him sprang the squirrel adjidaumo in and out among the branches coughed and chattered from the oaktree laughed and said between his laughing do not shoot me hiawatha and the rabbit from his pathway leaped aside and at a distance sat erect upon his haunches half in fear and half in frolic saying to the little hunter do not shoot me hiawatha but he heeded not nor heard them for his thoughts were with the red deer on their tracks his eyes were fastened leading downward to the river to the ford across the river and as one in slumber walked he hidden in the alderbushes there he waited till the deer came till he saw two antlers lifted saw two eyes look from the thicket saw two nostrils point to windward and a deer came down the pathway flecked with leafy light and shadow and his heart within him fluttered trembled like the leaves above him like the birchleaf palpitated as the deer came down the pathway then upon one knee uprising hiawatha aimed an arrow scarce a twig moved with his motion scarce a leaf was stirred or rustled but the wary roebuck started stamped with all his hoofs together listened with one foot uplifted leaped as if to meet the arrow ah the singing fatal arrow like a wasp it buzzed and stung him dead he lay there in the forest by the ford across the river beat his timid heart no longer but the heart of hiawatha throbbed and shouted and exulted as he bore the red deer homeward and iagoo and nokomis hailed his coming with applauses from the red deers hide nokomis made a cloak for hiawatha from the red deers flesh nokomis made a banquet in his honor all the village came and feasted all the guests praised hiawatha called him strongheart soangetaha called him loonheart mahngotaysee iv hiawatha and mudjekeewis out of childhood into manhood now had grown my hiawatha skilled in all the craft of hunters learned in all the lore of old men in all youthful sports and pastimes in all manly arts and labors swift of foot was hiawatha he could shoot an arrow from him and run forward with such fleetness that the arrow fell behind him strong of arm was hiawatha he could shoot ten arrows upward shoot them with such strength and swiftness that the tenth had left the bowstring ere the first to earth had fallen he had mittens minjekahwun magic mittens made of deerskin when upon his hands he wore them he could smite the rocks asunder he could grind them into powder he had moccasins enchanted magic moccasins of deerskin when he bound them round his ankles when upon his feet he tied them at each stride a mile he measured much he questioned old nokomis of his father mudjekeewis learned from her the fatal secret of the beauty of his mother of the falsehood of his father and his heart was hot within him like a living coal his heart was then he said to old nokomis i will go to mudjekeewis see how fares it with my father at the doorways of the westwind at the portals of the sunset from his lodge went hiawatha dressed for travel armed for hunting dressed in deerskin shirt and leggings richly wrought with quills and wampum on his head his eagle feathers round his waist his belt of wampum in his hand his bow of ashwood strung with sinews of the reindeer in his quiver oaken arrows tipped with jasper winged with feathers with his mittens minjekahwun with his moccasins enchanted warning said the old nokomis go not forth o hiawatha to the kingdom of the westwind to the realms of mudjekeewis lest he harm you with his magic lest he kill you with his cunning but the fearless hiawatha heeded not her womans warning forth he strode into the forest at each stride a mile he measured lurid seemed the sky above him lurid seemed the earth beneath him hot and close the air around him filled with smoke and fiery vapors as of burning woods and prairies for his heart was hot within him like a living coal his heart was so he journeyed westward westward left the fleetest deer behind him left the antelope and bison crossed the rushing escanaba crossed the mighty mississippi passed the mountains of the prairie passed the land of crows and foxes passed the dwellings of the blackfeet came unto the rocky mountains to the kingdom of the westwind where upon the gusty summits sat the ancient mudjekeewis ruler of the winds of heaven filled with awe was hiawatha at the aspect of his father on the air about him wildly tossed and streamed the cloudy tresses gleamed like drifting snow his tresses glared like ishkoodah the comet like the star with fiery tresses filled with joy was mudjekeewis when he looked on hiawatha saw his youth rise up before him in the face of hiawatha saw the beauty of wenonah from the grave rise up before him welcome said he hiawatha to the kingdom of the westwind long have i been waiting for you youth is lovely age is lonely youth is fiery age is frosty you bring back the days departed you bring back my youth of passion and the beautiful wenonah many days they talked together questioned listened waited answered much the mighty mudjekeewis boasted of his ancient prowess of his perilous adventures his indomitable courage his invulnerable body patiently sat hiawatha listening to his fathers boasting with a smile he sat and listened uttered neither threat nor menace neither word nor look betrayed him but his heart was hot within him like a living coal his heart was then he said o mudjekeewis is there nothing that can harm you nothing that you are afraid of and the mighty mudjekeewis grand and gracious in his boasting answered saying there is nothing nothing but the black rock yonder nothing but the fatal wawbeek and he looked at hiawatha with a wise look and benignant with a countenance paternal looked with pride upon the beauty of his tall and graceful figure saying o my hiawatha is there anything can harm you anything you are afraid of but the wary hiawatha paused awhile as if uncertain held his peace as if resolving and then answered there is nothing nothing but the bulrush yonder nothing but the great apukwa and as mudjekeewis rising stretched his hand to pluck the bulrush hiawatha cried in terror cried in welldissembled terror kago kago do not touch it ah kaween said mudjekeewis no indeed i will not touch it then they talked of other matters first of hiawathas brothers first of wabun of the eastwind of the southwind shawondasee of the north kabibonokka then of hiawathas mother of the beautiful wenonah of her birth upon the meadow of her death as old nokomis had remembered and related and he cried o mudjekeewis it was you who killed wenonah took her young life and her beauty broke the lily of the prairie trampled it beneath your footsteps you confess it you confess it and the mighty mudjekeewis tossed his gray hairs to the westwind bowed his hoary head in anguish with a silent nod assented then up started hiawatha and with threatening look and gesture laid his hand upon the black rock on the fatal wawbeek laid it with his mittens minjekahwun rent the jutting crag asunder smote and crushed it into fragments hurled them madly at his father the remorseful mudjekeewis for his heart was hot within him like a living coal his heart was but the ruler of the westwind blew the fragments backward from him with the breathing of his nostrils with the tempest of his anger blew them back at his assailant seized the bulrush the apukwa dragged it with its roots and fibres from the margin of the meadow from its ooze the giant bulrush long and loud laughed hiawatha then began the deadly conflict hand to hand among the mountains from his eyry screamed the eagle the keneu the great wareagle sat upon the crags around them wheeling flapped his wings above them like a tall tree in the tempest bent and lashed the giant bulrush and in masses huge and heavy crashing fell the fatal wawbeek till the earth shook with the tumult and confusion of the battle and the air was full of shoutings and the thunder of the mountains starting answered baimwawa back retreated mudjekeewis rushing westward oer the mountains stumbling westward down the mountains three whole days retreated fighting still pursued by hiawatha to the doorways of the westwind to the portals of the sunset to the earths remotest border where into the empty spaces sinks the sun as a flamingo drops into her nest at nightfall in the melancholy marshes hold at length cried mudjekeewis hold my son my hiawatha tis impossible to kill me for you cannot kill the immortal i have put you to this trial but to know and prove your courage now receive the prize of valor go back to your home and people live among them toil among them cleanse the earth from all that harms it clear the fishinggrounds and rivers slay all monsters and magicians all the giants the wendigoes all the serpents the kenabeeks as i slew the mishemokwa slew the great bear of the mountains and at last when death draws near you when the awful eyes of pauguk glare upon you in the darkness i will share my kingdom with you ruler shall you be henceforward of the northwestwind keewaydin of the homewind the keewaydin thus was fought that famous battle in the dreadful days of shahshah in the days long since departed in the kingdom of the westwind still the hunter sees its traces scattered far oer hill and valley sees the giant bulrush growing by the ponds and watercourses sees the masses of the wawbeek lying still in every valley homeward now went hiawatha pleasant was the landscape round him pleasant was the air above him for the bitterness of anger had departed wholly from him from his brain the thought of vengeance from his heart the burning fever only once his pace he slackened only once he paused or halted paused to purchase heads of arrows of the ancient arrowmaker in the land of the dacotahs where the falls of minnehaha flash and gleam among the oaktrees laugh and leap into the valley there the ancient arrowmaker made his arrowheads of sandstone arrowheads of chalcedony arrowheads of flint and jasper smoothed and sharpened at the edges hard and polished keen and costly with him dwelt his darkeyed daughter wayward as the minnehaha with her moods of shade and sunshine eyes that smiled and frowned alternate feet as rapid as the river tresses flowing like the water and as musical a laughter and he named her from the river from the waterfall he named her minnehaha laughing water was it then for heads of arrows arrowheads of chalcedony arrowheads of flint and jasper that my hiawatha halted in the land of the dacotahs was it not to see the maiden see the face of laughing water peeping from behind the curtain hear the rustling of her garments from behind the waving curtain as one sees the minnehaha gleaming glancing through the branches as one hears the laughing water from behind its screen of branches who shall say what thoughts and visions fill the fiery brains of young men who shall say what dreams of beauty filled the heart of hiawatha all he told to old nokomis when he reached the lodge at sunset was the meeting with his father was the fight with mudjekeewis not a word he said of arrows not a word of laughing water v hiawathas fasting you shall hear how hiawatha prayed and fasted in the forest not for greater skill in hunting not for greater craft in fishing not for triumphs in the battle and renown among the warriors but for profit of the people for advantage of the nations first he built a lodge for fasting built a wigwam in the forest by the shining bigseawater in the blithe and pleasant springtime in the moon of leaves he built it and with dreams and visions many seven whole days and nights he fasted on the first day of his fasting through the leafy woods he wandered saw the deer start from the thicket saw the rabbit in his burrow heard the pheasant bena drumming heard the squirrel adjidaumo rattling in his hoard of acorns saw the pigeon the omeme building nests among the pinetrees and in flocks the wild goose wawa flying to the fenlands northward whirring wailing far above him master of life he cried desponding must our lives depend on these things on the next day of his fasting by the rivers brink he wandered through the muskoday the meadow saw the wild rice mahnomonee saw the blueberry meenahga and the strawberry odahmin and the gooseberry shahbomin and the grapevine bemahgut trailing oer the alderbranches filling all the air with fragrance master of life he cried desponding must our lives depend on these things on the third day of his fasting by the lake he sat and pondered by the still transparent water saw the sturgeon nahma leaping scattering drops like beads of wampum saw the yellow perch the sahwa like a sunbeam in the water saw the pike the maskenozha and the herring okahahwis and the shawgashee the crawfish master of life he cried desponding must our lives depend on these things on the fourth day of his fasting in his lodge he lay exhausted from his couch of leaves and branches gazing with halfopen eyelids full of shadowy dreams and visions on the dizzy swimming landscape on the gleaming of the water on the splendor of the sunset and he saw a youth approaching dressed in garments green and yellow coming through the purple twilight through the splendor of the sunset plumes of green bent oer his forehead and his hair was soft and golden standing at the open doorway long he looked at hiawatha looked with pity and compassion on his wasted form and features and in accents like the sighing of the southwind in the treetops said he o my hiawatha all your prayers are heard in heaven for you pray not like the others not for greater skill in hunting not for greater craft in fishing not for triumph in the battle nor renown among the warriors but for profit of the people for advantage of the nations from the master of life descending i the friend of man mondamin come to warn you and instruct you how by struggle and by labor you shall gain what you have prayed for rise up from your bed of branches rise o youth and wrestle with me faint with famine hiawatha started from his bed of branches from the twilight of his wigwam forth into the bush of sunset came and wrestled with mondamin at his touch he felt new courage throbbing in his brain and bosom felt new life and hope and vigor run through every nerve and fibre so they wrestled there together in the glory of the sunset and the more they strove and struggled stronger still grew hiawatha till the darkness fell around them and the heron the shuhshuhgah from her haunts among the fenlands gave a cry of lamentation gave a scream of pain and famine tis enough then said mondamin smiling upon hiawatha but tomorrow when the sun sets i will come again to try you and he vanished and was seen not whether sinking as the rain sinks whether rising as the mists rise hiawatha saw not knew not only saw that he had vanished leaving him alone and fainting with the misty lake below him and the reeling stars above him on the morrow and the next day when the sun through heaven descending like a red and burning cinder from the hearth of the great spirit fell into the western waters came mondamin for the trial for the strife with hiawatha came as silent as the dew comes from the empty air appearing into empty air returning taking shape when earth it touches but invisible to all men in its coming and its going thrice they wrestled there together in the glory of the sunset till the darkness fell around them till the heron the shuhshuhgah from her haunts among the fenlands uttered her loud cry of famine and mondamin paused to listen tall and beautiful he stood there in his garments green and yellow to and fro his plumes above him waved and nodded with his breathing and the sweat of the encounter stood like drops of dew upon him and he cried o hiawatha bravely have you wrestled with me thrice have wrestled stoutly with me and the master of life who sees us he will give to you the triumph then he smiled and said tomorrow is the last day of your conflict is the last day of your fasting you will conquer and oercome me make a bed for me to lie in where the rain may fall upon me where the sun may come and warm me strip these garments green and yellow strip this nodding plumage from me lay me in the earth and make it soft and loose and light above me let no hand disturb my slumber let no weed nor worm molest me let not kahgahgee the raven come to haunt me and molest me only come yourself to watch me till i wake and start and quicken till i leap into the sunshine and thus saying he departed peacefully slept hiawatha but he heard the wawonaissa heard the whippoorwill complaining perched upon his lonely wigwam heard the rushing sebowisha heard the rivulet rippling near him talking to the darksome forest heard the sighing of the branches as they lifted and subsided at the passing of the nightwind heard them as one hears in slumber faroff murmurs dreamy whispers peacefully slept hiawatha on the morrow came nokomis on the seventh day of his fasting came with food for hiawatha came imploring and bewailing lest his hunger should oercome him lest his fasting should be fatal but he tasted not and touched not only said to her nokomis wait until the sun is setting till the darkness falls around us till the heron the shuhshuhgah crying from the desolate marshes tells us that the day is ended homeward weeping went nokomis sorrowing for her hiawatha fearing lest his strength should fail him lest his fasting should be fatal he meanwhile sat weary waiting for the coming of mondamin till the shadows pointing eastward lengthened over field and forest till the sun dropped from the heaven floating on the waters westward as a red leaf in the autumn falls and floats upon the water falls and sinks into its bosom and behold the young mondamin with his soft and shining tresses with his garments green and yellow with his long and glossy plumage stood and beckoned at the doorway and as one in slumber walking pale and haggard but undaunted from the wigwam hiawatha came and wrestled with mondamin round about him spun the landscape sky and forest reeled together and his strong heart leaped within him as the sturgeon leaps and struggles in a net to break its meshes like a ring of fire around him blazed and flared the red horizon and a hundred suns seemed looking at the combat of the wrestlers suddenly upon the greensward all alone stood hiawatha panting with his wild exertion palpitating with the struggle and before him breathless lifeless lay the youth with hair disheveled plumage torn and garments tattered dead he lay there in the sunset and victorious hiawatha made the grave as he commanded stripped the garments from mondamin stripped his tattered plumage from him laid him in the earth and made it soft and loose and light above him and the heron the shuhshuhgah from the melancholy moorlands gave a cry of lamentation gave a cry of pain and anguish homeward then went hiawatha to the lodge of old nokomis and the seven days of his fasting were accomplished and completed but the place was not forgotten where he wrestled with mondamin nor forgotten nor neglected was the grave where lay mondamin sleeping in the rain and sunshine where his scattered plumes and garments faded in the rain and sunshine day by day did hiawatha go to wait and watch beside it kept the dark mold soft above it kept it clean from weeds and insects drove away with scoffs and shoutings kahgahgee the king of ravens till at length a small green feather from the earth shot slowly upward then another and another and before the summer ended stood the maize in all its beauty with its shining robes about it and its long soft yellow tresses and in rapture hiawatha cried aloud it is mondamin yes the friend of man mondamin then he called to old nokomis and iagoo the great boaster showed them where the maize was growing told them of his wondrous vision of his wrestling and his triumph of this new gift to the nations which should be their food forever and still later when the autumn changed the long green leaves to yellow and the soft and juicy kernels grew like wampum hard and yellow then the ripened ears he gathered stripped the withered husks from off them as he once had stripped the wrestler gave the first feast of mondamin and made known unto the people this new gift of the great spirit vi hiawathas friends two good friends had hiawatha singled out from all the others bound to him in closest union and to whom he gave the right hand of his heart in joy and sorrow chibiabos the musician and the very strong man kwasind straight between them ran the pathway never grew the grass upon it singing birds that utter falsehoods storytellers mischiefmakers found no eager ear to listen could not breed illwill between them for they kept each others counsel spake with naked hearts together pondering much and much contriving how the tribes of men might prosper most beloved by hiawatha was the gentle chibiabos he the best of all musicians he the sweetest of all singers beautiful and childlike was he brave as man is soft as woman pliant as a wand of willow stately as a deer with antlers when he sang the village listened all the warriors gathered round him all the women came to hear him now he stirred their souls to passion now he melted them to pity from the hollow reeds he fashioned flutes so musical and mellow that the brook the sebowisha ceased to murmur in the woodland that the woodbirds ceased from singing and the squirrel adjidaumo ceased his chatter in the oaktree and the rabbit the wabasso sat upright to look and listen yes the brook the sebowisha pausing said o chibiabos teach my waves to flow in music softly as your words in singing yes the bluebird the owaissa envious said o chibiabos teach me tones as wild and wayward teach me songs as full of frenzy yes the opechee the robin joyous said o chibiabos teach me songs as full of gladness and the whippoorwill wawonaissa sobbing said o chibiabos teach me tones as melancholy teach me songs as full of sadness all the many sounds of nature borrowed sweetness from his singing all the hearts of men were softened by the pathos of his music for he sang of peace and freedom sang of beauty love and longing sang of death and life undying in the islands of the blessed in the kingdom of ponemah in the land of the hereafter very dear to hiawatha was the gentle chibiabos he the best of all musicians he the sweetest of all singers for his gentleness he loved him and the magic of his singing dear too unto hiawatha was the very strong man kwasind he the strongest of all mortals he the mightiest among many for his very strength he loved him for his strength allied to goodness idle in his youth was kwasind very listless dull and dreamy never played with other children never fished and never hunted not like other children was he but they saw that much he fasted much his manito entreated much besought his guardian spirit lazy kwasind said his mother in my work you never help me in the summer you are roaming idly in the fields and forests in the winter you are cowering oer the firebrands in the wigwam in the coldest days of winter i must break the ice for fishing with my nets you never help me at the door my nets are hanging dripping freezing with the water go and wring them yenadizze go and dry them in the sunshine slowly from the ashes kwasind rose but made no angry answer from the lodge went forth in silence took the nets that hung together dripping freezing at the doorway like a wisp of straw he wrung them like a wisp of straw he broke them could not wring them without breaking such the strength was in his fingers lazy kwasind said his father in the hunt you never help me every bow you touch is broken snapped asunder every arrow yet come with me to the forest you shall bring the hunting homeward down a narrow pass they wandered where a brooklet led them onward where the trail of deer and bison marked the soft mud on the margin till they found all further passage shut against them barred securely by the trunks of trees uprooted lying lengthwise lying crosswise and forbidding further passage we must go back said the old man oer these logs we cannot clamber not a woodchuck could get through them not a squirrel clamber oer them and straightway his pipe he lighted and sat down to smoke and ponder but before his pipe was finished lo the path was cleared before him all the trunks had kwasind lifted to the right hand to the left hand shot the pinetrees swift as arrows hurled the cedars light as lances lazy kwasind said the young men as they sported in the meadow why stand idly looking at us leaning on the rock behind you come and wrestle with the others let us pitch the quoit together lazy kwasind made no answer to their challenge made no answer only rose and slowly turning seized the huge rock in his fingers tore it from its deep foundation poised it in the air a moment pitched it sheer into the river sheer into the swift pauwating where it still is seen in summer once as down that foaming river down the rapids of pauwating kwasind sailed with his companions in the stream he saw a beaver saw ahmeek the king of beavers struggling with the rushing currents rising sinking in the water without speaking without pausing kwasind leaped into the river plunged beneath the bubbling surface through the whirlpools chased the beaver followed him among the islands stayed so long beneath the water that his terrified companions cried alas goodbye to kwasind we shall never more see kwasind but he reappeared triumphant and upon his shining shoulders brought the beaver dead and dripping brought the king of all the beavers and these two as i have told you were the friends of hiawatha chibiabos the musician and the very strong man kwasind long they lived in peace together spake with naked hearts together pondering much and much contriving how the tribes of men might prosper vii hiawathas sailing give me of your bark o birchtree of your yellow bark o birchtree growing by the rushing river tall and stately in the valley i a light canoe will build me build a swift cheemaun for sailing that shall float upon the river like a yellow leaf in autumn like a yellow waterlily lay aside your cloak o birchtree lay aside your whiteskin wrapper for the summertime is coming and the sun is warm in heaven and you need no whiteskin wrapper thus aloud cried hiawatha in the solitary forest by the rushing taquamenaw when the birds were singing gayly in the moon of leaves were singing and the sun from sleep awaking started up and said behold me gheezis the great sun behold me illustration give me of your roots o tamarack page and the tree with all its branches rustled in the breeze of morning saying with a sigh of patience take my cloak o hiawatha with his knife the tree he girdled just beneath its lowest branches just above the roots he cut it till the sap came oozing outward down the trunk from top to bottom sheer he cleft the bark asunder with a wooden wedge he raised it stripped it from the trunk unbroken give me of your boughs o cedar of your strong and pliant branches my canoe to make more steady make more strong and firm beneath me through the summit of the cedar went a sound a cry of horror went a murmur of resistance but it whispered bending downward take my boughs o hiawatha down he hewed the boughs of cedar shaped them straightway to a framework like two bows he formed and shaped them like two bended bows together give me of your roots o tamarack of your fibrous roots o larchtree my canoe to bind together so to bind the ends together that the water may not enter that the river may not wet me and the larch with all its fibres shivered in the air of morning touched his forehead with its tassels said with one long sigh of sorrow take them all o hiawatha from the earth he tore the fibres tore the tough roots of the larchtree closely sewed the bark together bound it closely to the framework give me of your balm o firtree of your balsam and your resin so to close the seams together that the water may not enter that the river may not wet me and the firtree tall and sombre sobbed through all its robes of darkness rattled like a shore with pebbles answered wailing answered weeping take my balm o hiawatha and he took the tears of balsam took the resin of the firtree smeared therewith each seam and fissure made each crevice safe from water give me of your quills o hedgehog all your quills o kagh the hedgehog i will make a necklace of them make a girdle for my beauty and two stars to deck her bosom from a hollow tree the hedgehog with his sleepy eyes looked at him shot his shining quills like arrows saying with a drowsy murmur through the tangle of his whiskers take my quills o hiawatha from the ground the quills he gathered all the little shining arrows stained them red and blue and yellow with the juice of roots and berries into his canoe he wrought them round its waist a shining girdle round its bows a gleaming necklace on its breast two stars resplendent thus the birch canoe was builded in the valley by the river in the bosom of the forest and the forests life was in it all its mystery and its magic all the lightness of the birchtree all the toughness of the cedar all the larchs supple sinews and it floated on the river like a yellow leaf in autumn like a yellow waterlily paddles none had hiawatha paddles none he had or needed for his thoughts as paddles served him and his wishes served to guide him swift or slow at will he glided veered to right or left at pleasure then he called aloud to kwasind to his friend the strong man kwasind saying help me clear this river of its sunken logs and sandbars straight into the river kwasind plunged as if he were an otter dived as if he were a beaver stood up to his waist in water to his armpits in the river swam and shouted in the river tugged at sunken logs and branches with his hands he scooped the sandbars with his feet the ooze and tangle and thus sailed my hiawatha down the rushing taquamenaw sailed through all its bends and windings sailed through all its deeps and shallows while his friend the strong man kwasind swam the deeps the shallows waded up and down the river went they in and out among its islands cleared its bed of root and sandbar dragged the dead trees from its channel made its passage safe and certain made a pathway for the people from its springs among the mountains to the water of pauwating to the bay of taquamenaw viii hiawathas fishing forth upon the gitche gumee on the shining bigseawater with his fishingline of cedar of the twisted bark of cedar forth to catch the sturgeon nahma mishenahma king of fishes in his birch canoe exulting all alone went hiawatha through the clear transparent water he could see the fishes swimming far down in the depths below him see the yellow perch the sahwa like a sunbeam in the water see the shawgashee the crawfish like a spider on the bottom on the white and sandy bottom at the stern sat hiawatha with his fishingline of cedar in his plumes the breeze of morning played as in the hemlock branches on the bows with tail erected sat the squirrel adjidaumo in his fur the breeze of morning played as in the prairie grasses on the white sand of the bottom lay the monster mishenahma lay the sturgeon king of fishes through his gills he breathed the water with his fins he fanned and winnowed with his tail he swept the sandfloor there he lay in all his armor on each side a shield to guard him plates of bone upon his forehead down his sides and back and shoulders illustration take my bait o king of fishes page plates of bone with spines projecting painted was he with his warpaints stripes of yellow red and azure spots of brown and spots of sable and he lay there on the bottom fanning with his fins of purple as above him hiawatha in his birch canoe came sailing with his fishingline of cedar take my bait cried hiawatha down into the depths beneath him take my bait o sturgeon nahma come up from below the water let us see which is the stronger and he dropped his line of cedar through the clear transparent water waited vainly for an answer long sat waiting for an answer and repeating loud and louder take my bait o king of fishes quiet lay the sturgeon nahma fanning slowly in the water looking up at hiawatha listening to his call and clamor his unnecessary tumult till he wearied of the shouting and he said to the kenozha to the pike the maskenozha take the bait of this rude fellow break the line of hiawatha in his fingers hiawatha felt the loose line jerk and tighten as he drew it in it tugged so that the birch canoe stood endwise like a birch log in the water with the squirrel adjidaumo perched and frisking on the summit full of scorn was hiawatha when he saw the fish rise upward saw the pike the maskenozha coming nearer nearer to him and he shouted through the water esa esa shame upon you you are but the pike kenozha you are not the fish i wanted you are not the king of fishes reeling downward to the bottom sank the pike in great confusion and the mighty sturgeon nahma said to ugudwash the sunfish take the bait of this great boaster break the line of hiawatha slowly upward wavering gleaming like a white moon in the water rose the ugudwash the sunfish seized the line of hiawatha swung with all his weight upon it made a whirlpool in the water whirled the birch canoe in circles round and round in gurgling eddies till the circles in the water reached the faroff sandy beaches till the waterflags and rushes nodded on the distant margins but when hiawatha saw him slowly rising through the water lifting his great disc of whiteness loud he shouted in derision esa esa shame upon you you are ugudwash the sunfish you are not the fish i wanted you are not the king of fishes wavering downward white and ghastly sank the ugudwash the sunfish and again the sturgeon nahma heard the shout of hiawatha heard his challenge of defiance the unnecessary tumult ringing far across the water from the white sand of the bottom up he rose with angry gesture quivering in each nerve and fibre clashing all his plates of armor gleaming bright with all his warpaint in his wrath he darted upward flashing leaped into the sunshine opened his great jaws and swallowed both canoe and hiawatha down into that darksome cavern plunged the headlong hiawatha as a log on some black river shoots and plunges down the rapids found himself in utter darkness groped about in helpless wonder till he felt a great heart beating throbbing in that utter darkness and he smote it in his anger with his fist the heart of nahma felt the mighty king of fishes shudder through each nerve and fibre heard the water gurgle round him as he leaped and staggered through it sick at heart and faint and weary crosswise then did hiawatha drag his birchcanoe for safety lest from out the jaws of nahma in the turmoil and confusion forth he might be hurled and perish and the squirrel adjidaumo frisked and chattered very gayly toiled and tugged with hiawatha till the labor was completed then said hiawatha to him o my little friend the squirrel bravely have you toiled to help me take the thanks of hiawatha and the name which now he gives you for hereafter and forever boys shall call you adjidaumo tailinair the boys shall call you and again the sturgeon nahma gasped and quivered in the water then was still and drifted landward till he grated on the pebbles till the listening hiawatha heard him grate upon the margin felt him strand upon the pebbles knew that nahma king of fishes lay there dead upon the margin then he heard a clang and flapping as of many wings assembling heard a screaming and confusion as of birds of prey contending saw a gleam of light above him shining through the ribs of nahma saw the glittering eyes of seagulls of kayoshk the seagulls peering gazing at him through the opening heard them saying to each other tis our brother hiawatha and he shouted from below them cried exulting from the caverns o ye seagulls o my brothers i have slain the sturgeon nahma make the rifts a little larger with your claws the openings widen set me free from this dark prison and henceforward and forever men shall speak of your achievements calling you kayoshk the seagulls yes kayoshk the noble scratchers and the wild and clamorous seagulls toiled with beak and claws together made the rifts and openings wider in the mighty ribs of nahma and from peril and from prison from the body of the sturgeon from the peril of the water was released my hiawatha he was standing near his wigwam on the margin of the water and he called to old nokomis called and beckoned to nokomis pointed to the sturgeon nahma lying lifeless on the pebbles with the seagulls feeding on him i have slain the mishenahma slain the king of fishes said he look the seagulls feed upon him yes my friends kayoshk the seagulls drive them not away nokomis they have saved me from great peril in the body of the sturgeon wait until their meal is ended till their craws are full with feasting till they homeward fly at sunset to their nests among the marshes then bring all your pots and kettles and make oil for us in winter and she waited till the sun set till the pallid moon the nightsun rose above the tranquil water till kayoshk the sated seagulls from their banquet rose with clamor and across the fiery sunset winged their way to faroff islands to their nests among the rushes to his sleep went hiawatha and nokomis to her labor toiling patient in the moonlight till the sun and moon changed places till the sky was red with sunrise and kayoshk the hungry seagulls came back from the reedy islands clamorous for their morning banquet three whole days and nights alternate old nokomis and the seagulls stripped the oily flesh of nahma till the waves washed through the ribbones till the seagulls came no longer and upon the sands lay nothing but the skeleton of nahma ix hiawatha and the pearlfeather on the shores of gitche gumee of the shining bigseawater stood nokomis the old woman pointing with her finger westward oer the water pointing westward to the purple clouds of sunset fiercely the red sun descending burned his way along the heavens set the sky on fire behind him as warparties when retreating burn the prairies on their wartrail and the moon the nightsun eastward suddenly starting from his ambush followed fast those bloody footprints followed in that fiery wartrail with its glare upon his features and nokomis the old woman pointing with her finger westward spake these words to hiawatha yonder dwells the great pearlfeather megissogwon the magician manito of wealth and wampum guarded by his fiery serpents guarded by the black pitchwater you can see his fiery serpents the kenabeek the great serpents coiling playing in the water you can see the black pitchwater stretching far away beyond them to the purple clouds of sunset he it was who slew my father by his wicked wiles and cunning when he from the moon descended when he came on earth to seek me he the mightiest of magicians sends the fever from the marshes sends the pestilential vapors sends the poisonous exhalations sends the white fog from the fenlands sends disease and death among us take your bow o hiawatha take your arrows jasperheaded take your warclub puggawaugun and your mittens minjekahwun and your birchcanoe for sailing and the oil of mishenahma so to smear its sides that swiftly you may pass the black pitchwater slay this merciless magician save the people from the fever that he breathes across the fenlands and avenge my fathers murder straightway then my hiawatha armed himself with all his wargear launched his birchcanoe for sailing with his palm its sides he patted said with glee cheemaun my darling o my birchcanoe leap forward where you see the fiery serpents where you see the black pitchwater forward leaped cheemaun exulting and the noble hiawatha sang his warsong wild and woeful and above him the wareagle the keneu the great wareagle master of all fowls with feathers screamed and hurtled through the heavens soon he reached the fiery serpents the kenabeek the great serpents lying huge upon the water sparkling rippling in the water lying coiled across the passage with their blazing crests uplifted breathing fiery fogs and vapors so that none could pass beyond them but the fearless hiawatha cried aloud and spake in this wise let me pass my way kenabeek let me go upon my journey and they answered hissing fiercely with their fiery breath made answer back go back o shaugodaya back to old nokomis faintheart then the angry hiawatha raised his mighty bow of ashtree seized his arrows jasperheaded shot them fast among the serpents every twanging of the bowstring was a warcry and a deathcry every whizzing of an arrow was a deathsong of kenabeek weltering in the bloody water dead lay all the fiery serpents and among them hiawatha harmless sailed and cried exulting onward o cheemaun my darling onward to the black pitchwater then he took the oil of nahma and the bows and sides anointed smeared them well with oil that swiftly he might pass the black pitchwater all night long he sailed upon it sailed upon that sluggish water covered with its mould of ages black with rotting waterrushes rank with flags and leaves of lilies stagnant lifeless dreary dismal lighted by the shimmering moonlight and by willothewisps illumined fires by ghosts of dead men kindled in their weary nightencampments all the air was white with moonlight all the water black with shadow and around him the suggema the mosquito sang their warsong and the fireflies wahwahtaysee waved their torches to mislead him and the bullfrog the dahinda thrust his head into the moonlight fixed his yellow eyes upon him sobbed and sank beneath the surface and anon a thousand whistles answered over all the fenlands and the heron the shuhshuhgah far off on the reedy margin heralded the heros coming westward thus fared hiawatha toward the realm of megissogwon towards the land of the pearlfeather till the level moon stared at him in his face stared pale and haggard till the sun was hot behind him till it burned upon his shoulders and before him on the upland he could see the shining wigwam of the manito of wampum of the mightiest of magicians then once more cheemaun he patted to his birchcanoe said onward and it stirred in all its fibres and with one great bound of triumph leaped across the water lilies leaped through tangled flags and rushes and upon the beach beyond them dryshod landed hiawatha straight he took his bow of ashtree one end on the sand he rested with his knee he pressed the middle stretched the faithful bowstring tighter took an arrow jasperheaded shot it at the shining wigwam sent it singing as a herald as a bearer of his message of his challenge loud and lofty come forth from your lodge pearlfeather hiawatha waits your coming straightway from the shining wigwam came the mighty megissogwon tall of stature broad of shoulder dark and terrible in aspect clad from head to foot in wampum armed with all his warlike weapons painted like the sky of morning streaked with crimson blue and yellow crested with great eaglefeathers streaming upward streaming outward well i know you hiawatha cried he in a voice of thunder in a tone of loud derision hasten back o shaugodaya hasten back among the women back to old nokomis faintheart i will slay you as you stand there as of old i slew her father but my hiawatha answered nothing daunted fearing nothing big words do not smite like war clubs boastful breath is not a bowstring taunts are not so sharp as arrows deeds are better things than words are actions mightier than boastings then began the greatest battle that the sun had ever looked on that the warbirds ever witnessed all a summers day it lasted from the sunrise to the sunset for the shafts of hiawatha harmless hit the shirt of wampum harmless fell the blows he dealt it with his mittens minjekahwun harmless fell the heavy warclub it could dash the rocks asunder but it could not break the meshes of that magic shirt of wampum till at sunset hiawatha leaning on his bow of ashtree wounded weary and desponding with his mighty warclub broken with his mittens torn and tattered and three useless arrows only paused to rest beneath a pinetree from whose branches trailed the mosses and whose trunk was coated over with the deadmans moccasinleather with the fungus white and yellow suddenly from the boughs above him sang the mama the woodpecker aim your arrows hiawatha at the head of megissogwon strike the tuft of hair upon it at their roots the long black tresses there alone can he be wounded winged with feathers tipped with jasper swift flew hiawathas arrow just as megissogwon stooping raised a heavy stone to throw it full upon the crown it struck him at the roots of his long tresses and he reeled and staggered forward plunging like a wounded bison yes like pezhekee the bison when the snow is on the prairie swifter flew the second arrow in the pathway of the other piercing deeper than the other wounding sorer than the other and the knees of megissogwon shook like windy reeds beneath him bent and trembled like the rushes but the third and latest arrow swiftest flew and wounded sorest and the mighty megissogwon saw the fiery eyes of pauguk saw the eyes of death glare at him heard his voice call in the darkness at the feet of hiawatha lifeless lay the great pearlfeather lay the mightiest of magicians then the grateful hiawatha called the mama the woodpecker from his perch among the branches of the melancholy pinetree and in honor of his service stained with blood the tuft of feathers on the little head of mama even to this day he wears it wears the tuft of crimson feathers as a symbol of his service then he stripped the shirt of wampum from the back of megissogwon as a trophy of the battle as a signal of his conquest on the shore he left the body half on land and half in water in the sand his feet were buried and his face was in the water and above him wheeled and clamored the keneu the great wareagle sailing round in narrower circles hovering nearer nearer nearer from the wigwam hiawatha bore the wealth of megissogwon all his wealth of skins and wampum furs of bison and of beaver furs of sable and of ermine wampum belts and strings and pouches quivers wrought with beads of wampum filled with arrows silverheaded homeward then he sailed exulting homeward through the black pitchwater homeward through the weltering serpents with the trophies of the battle with a shout and song of triumph on the shore stood old nokomis on the shore stood chibiabos and the very strong man kwasind waiting for the heros coming listening to his song of triumph and the people of the village welcomed him with songs and dances made a joyous feast and shouted honor be to hiawatha he has slain the great pearlfeather slain the mightiest of magicians him who sent the fiery fever sent the white fog from the fenlands sent disease and death among us ever dear to hiawatha was the memory of mama and in token of his friendship as a mark of his remembrance he adorned and decked his pipestem with the crimson tuft of feathers with the bloodred crest of mama but the wealth of megissogwon all the trophies of the battle he divided with his people shared it equally among them x hiawathas wooing as unto the bow the cord is so unto the man is woman though she bends him she obeys him though she draws him yet she follows useless each without the other thus the youthful hiawatha said within himself and pondered much perplexed by various feelings listless longing hoping fearing dreaming still of minnehaha of the lovely laughing water in the land of the dacotahs wed a maiden of your people warning said the old nokomis go not eastward go not westward for a stranger whom we know not like a fire upon the hearthstone is a neighbors homely daughter like the starlight or the moonlight is the handsomest of strangers thus dissuading spake nokomis and my hiawatha answered only this dear old nokomis very pleasant is the firelight but i like the starlight better better do i like the moonlight gravely then said old nokomis bring not here an idle maiden bring not here a useless woman hands unskilful feet unwilling bring a wife with nimble fingers heart and hand that move together feet that run on willing errands smiling answered hiawatha in the land of the dacotahs lives the arrowmakers daughter minnehaha laughing water handsomest of all the women i will bring her to your wigwam she shall run upon your errands be your starlight moonlight firelight be the sunlight of my people still dissuading said nokomis bring not to my lodge a stranger from the land of the dacotahs very fierce are the dacotahs often is there war between us there are feuds yet unforgotten wounds that ache and still may open laughing answered hiawatha for that reason if no other would i wed the fair dacotah that our tribes might be united that old feuds might be forgotten and old wounds be healed forever thus departed hiawatha to the land of the dacotahs to the land of handsome women striding over moor and meadow through interminable forests through uninterrupted silence with his moccasins of magic at each stride a mile he measured yet the way seemed long before him and his heart outran his footsteps and he journeyed without resting till he heard the cataracts thunder heard the falls of minnehaha calling to him through the silence pleasant is the sound he murmured pleasant is the voice that calls me on the outskirts of the forest twixt the shadow and the sunshine herds of fallow deer were feeding but they saw not hiawatha to his bow he whispered fail not to his arrow whispered swerve not sent it singing on its errand to the red heart of the roebuck threw the deer across his shoulder and sped forward without pausing at the doorway of his wigwam sat the ancient arrowmaker in the land of the dacotahs making arrowheads of jasper arrowheads of chalcedony at his side in all her beauty sat the lovely minnehaha sat his daughter laughing water plaiting mats of flags and rushes of the past the old mans thoughts were and the maidens of the future he was thinking as he sat there of the days when with such arrows he had struck the deer and bison on the muskoday the meadow shot the wild goose flying southward on the wing the clamorous wawa thinking of the great warparties how they came to buy his arrows could not fight without his arrows ah no more such noble warriors could be found on earth as they were now the men were all like women only used their tongues for weapons she was thinking of a hunter from another tribe and country young and tall and very handsome who one morning in the springtime came to buy her fathers arrows sat and rested in the wigwam lingered long about the doorway looking back as he departed she had heard her father praise him praise his courage and his wisdom would he come again for arrows to the falls of minnehaha on the mat her hands lay idle and her eyes were very dreamy through their thoughts they heard a footstep heard a rustling in the branches and with glowing cheek and forehead with the deer upon his shoulders suddenly from out the woodlands hiawatha stood before them straight the ancient arrowmaker looked up gravely from his labor laid aside the unfinished arrow bade him enter at the doorway saying as he rose to meet him hiawatha you are welcome at the feet of laughing water hiawatha laid his burden threw the red deer from his shoulders and the maiden looked up at him looked up from her mat of rushes said with gentle look and accent you are welcome hiawatha very spacious was the wigwam made of deerskin dressed and whitened with the gods of the dacotahs drawn and painted on its curtains and so tall the doorway hardly hiawatha stooped to enter hardly touched his eaglefeathers as he entered at the doorway then uprose the laughing water from the ground fair minnehaha laid aside her mat unfinished brought forth food and set before them water brought them from the brooklet gave them food in earthen vessels gave them drink in bowls of basswood listened while the guest was speaking listened while her father answered but not once her lips she opened not a single word she uttered yes as in a dream she listened to the words of hiawatha as he talked of old nokomis who had nursed him in his childhood as he told of his companions chibiabos the musician and the very strong man kwasind and of happiness and plenty in the land of the ojibways in the pleasant land and peaceful after many years of warfare many years of strife and bloodshed there is peace between the ojibways and the tribes of the dacotahs thus continued hiawatha and then added speaking slowly that this peace may last forever and our hands be clasped more closely and our hearts be more united give me as my wife this maiden minnehaha laughing water loveliest of dacotah women and the ancient arrowmaker paused a moment ere he answered smoked a little while in silence looked at hiawatha proudly fondly looked at laughing water and made answer very gravely yes if minnehaha wishes let your heart speak minnehaha and the lovely laughing water seemed more lovely as she stood there neither willing nor reluctant as she went to hiawatha softly took the seat beside him while she said and blushed to say it i will follow you my husband this was hiawathas wooing thus it was he won the daughter of the ancient arrowmaker in the land of the dacotahs from the wigwam he departed leading with him laughing water hand in hand they went together through the woodland and the meadow left the old man standing lonely at the doorway of his wigwam heard the falls of minnehaha calling to them from the distance crying to them from afar off fare thee well o minnehaha and the ancient arrowmaker turned again unto his labor sat down by his sunny doorway murmuring to himself and saying thus it is our daughters leave us those we love and those who love us just when they have learned to help us when we are old and lean upon them comes a youth with flaunting feathers with his flute of reeds a stranger wanders piping through the village beckons to the fairest maiden and she follows where he leads her leaving all things for the stranger pleasant was the journey homeward through interminable forests over meadow over mountain over river hill and hollow short it seemed to hiawatha though they journeyed very slowly though his pace he checked and slackened to the steps of laughing water over wide and rushing rivers in his arms he bore the maiden light he thought her as a feather as the plume upon his headgear cleared the tangled pathway for her bent aside the swaying branches made at night a lodge of branches and a bed with boughs of hemlock and a fire before the doorway with the dry cones of the pinetree all the traveling winds went with them oer the meadow through the forest all the stars of night looked at them watched with sleepless eyes their slumber from his ambush in the oaktree peeped the squirrel adjidaumo watched with eager eyes the lovers and the rabbit the wabasso scampered from the path before them peering peeping from his burrow sat erect upon his haunches watched with curious eyes the lovers pleasant was the journey homeward all the birds sang loud and sweetly songs of happiness and heartsease sang the bluebird the owaissa happy are you hiawatha having such a wife to love you sang the opechee the robin happy are you laughing water having such a noble husband from the sky the sun benignant looked upon them through the branches saying to them o my children love is sunshine hate is shadow life is checkered shade and sunshine rule by love o hiawatha from the sky the moon looked at them filled the lodge with mystic splendors whispered to them o my children day is restless night is quiet man imperious woman feeble half is mine although i follow rule by patience laughing water thus it was they journeyed homeward thus it was that hiawatha to the lodge of old nokomis brought the moonlight starlight firelight brought the sunshine of his people minnehaha laughing water handsomest of all the women in the land of the dacotahs in the land of handsome women xi hiawathas wedding

the feast nokomis made at hiawathas wedding all the bowls were made of basswood white and polished very smoothly all the spoons of horn of bison black and polished very smoothly she had sent through all the village messengers with wands of willow as a sign of invitation as a token of the feasting and the wedding guests assembled clad in all their richest raiment robes of fur and belts of wampum splendid with their paint and plumage beautiful with beads and tassels first they ate the sturgeon nahma and the pike the maskenozha caught and cooked by old nokomis then on pemican they feasted pemican and buffalo marrow haunch of deer and hump of bison yellow cakes of the mondamin and the wild rice of the river but the gracious hiawatha and the lovely laughing water and the careful old nokomis tasted not the food before them only waited on the others only served their guests in silence and when all the guests had finished old nokomis brisk and busy from an ample pouch of otter filled the redstone pipes for smoking with tobacco from the southland mixed with bark of the red willow and with herbs and leaves of fragrance then she said o paupukkeewis dance for us your merry dances dance the beggars dance to please us that the feast may be more joyous that the time may pass more gayly and our guests be more contented then the handsome paupukkeewis he the idle yenadizze he the merry mischiefmaker whom the people called the stormfool rose among the guests assembled skilled was he in sports and pastimes in the merry dance of snowshoes in the play of quoits and ballplay skilled was he in games of hazard in all games of skill and hazard pugasaing the bowl and counters kuntassoo the game of plumstones though the warriors called him faintheart called him coward

white and soft and fringed with ermine all inwrought with beads of wampum he was dressed in deerskin leggings fringed with hedgehog quills and ermine and in moccasins of buckskin thick with quills and beads embroidered on his head were plumes of swans down on his heels were tails of foxes in one hand a fan of feathers illustration he began his mystic dances page and a pipe was in the other barred with streaks of red and yellow streaks of blue and bright vermilion shone the face of paupukkeewis from his forehead fell his tresses smooth and parted like a womans shining bright with oil and plaited hung with braids of scented grasses as among the guests assembled to the sound of flutes and singing to the sound of drums and voices rose the handsome paupukkeewis and began his mystic dances first he danced a solemn measure very slow in step and gesture in and out among the pinetrees through the shadows and the sunshine treading softly like a panther then more swiftly and still swifter whirling spinning round in circles leaping oer the guests assembled eddying round and round the wigwam till the leaves went whirling with him till the dust and wind together swept in eddies round about him then along the sandy margin of the lake the bigseawater on he sped with frenzied gestures stamped upon the sand and tossed it wildly in the air around him till the wind became a whirlwind till the sand was blown and sifted like great snowdrifts oer the landscape heaping all the shores with sand dunes sand hills of the nagow wudjoo thus the merry paupukkeewis danced his beggars dance to please them and returning sat down laughing there among the guests assembled sat and fanned himself serenely with his fan of turkeyfeathers then they said to chibiabos to the friend of hiawatha to the

more contented and the gentle chibiabos sang in accents sweet and tender sang in tones of deep emotion songs of love and songs of longing looking still at hiawatha looking at fair laughing water sang he softly sang in this wise onaway awake beloved thou the wildflower of the forest thou the wildbird of the prairie thou with eyes so soft and fawnlike if thou only lookest at me i am happy i am happy as the lilies of the prairie when they feel the dew upon them sweet thy breath is as the fragrance of the wildflowers in the morning as their fragrance is at evening in the moon when leaves are falling does not all the blood within me leap to meet thee leap to meet thee as the springs to meet the sunshine in the moon when nights are brightest onaway my heart sings to thee sings with joy when thou art near me as the sighing singing branches in the pleasant moon of strawberries when thou art not pleased beloved then my heart is sad and darkened as the shining river darkens when the clouds drop shadows on it when thou smilest my beloved then my troubled heart is brightened as in sunshine gleam the ripples that the cold wind makes in rivers smiles the earth and smile the waters smile the cloudless skies above us but i lose the way of smiling when thou art no longer near me i myself myself behold me blood of my beating heart behold me o awake awake beloved onaway awake beloved thus the gentle chibiabos sang his song of love and longing and iagoo the great boaster he the marvelous storyteller he the friend of old nokomis jealous of the sweet musician jealous of the applause they gave him saw in all the eyes around him saw in all their looks and gestures that the wedding guests assembled longed to hear his pleasant stories his immeasurable falsehoods very boastful was iagoo never heard he an adventure but himself had met a greater never any deed of daring but himself had done a bolder never any marvelous story but himself could tell a stranger would you listen to his boasting would you only give him credence no one ever shot an arrow half so far and high as he had ever caught so many fishes ever killed so many reindeer ever trapped so many beavers none could run so fast as he could none could dive so deep as he could none could swim so far as he could none had made so many journeys none had seen so many wonders as this wonderful iagoo as this marvelous storyteller thus his name became a byword and a jest among the people and wheneer a boastful hunter praised his own address too highly or a warrior home returning talked too much of his achievements all his hearers cried iagoo heres iagoo come among us he it was who carved the cradle of the little hiawatha carved its framework out of linden bound it strong with reindeer sinew he it was who taught him later how to make his bows and arrows how to make the bows of ashtree and the arrows of the oaktree so among the guests assembled at my hiawathas wedding sat iagoo old and ugly sat the marvelous storyteller and they said o good iagoo tell us now a tale of wonder tell us of some strange adventure that the feast may be more joyous that the time may pass more gayly and our guests be more contented and iagoo answered straightway you shall hear a tale of wonder you shall hear the strange adventures of osseo the magician from the evening star descended xii the son of the evening star can it be the sun descending oer the level plain of water or the red swan floating flying wounded by the magic arrow staining all the waves with crimson with the crimson of its lifeblood filling all the air with splendor with the splendor of its plumage yes it is the sun descending sinking down into the water all the sky is stained with purple all the water flushed with crimson no it is the red swan floating diving down beneath the water to the sky its wings are lifted with its blood the waves are reddened over it the star of evening melts and trembles through the purple hangs suspended in the twilight no it is a bead of wampum on the robes of the great spirit as he passes through the twilight walks in silence through the heavens this with joy beheld iagoo and he said in haste behold it see the sacred star of evening you shall hear a tale of wonder hear the story of osseo son of the evening star osseo once in days no more remembered ages nearer the beginning when the heavens were closer to us and the gods were more familiar in the northland lived a hunter with ten young and comely daughters tall and lithe as wands of willow only oweenee the youngest she the willful and the wayward she the silent dreamy maiden was the fairest of the sisters all these women married warriors married brave and haughty husbands only oweenee the youngest laughed and flouted all her lovers all her young and handsome suitors and then married old osseo old osseo poor and ugly broken with age and weak with coughing always coughing like a squirrel ah but beautiful within him was the spirit of osseo from the evening star descended star of evening star of woman star of tenderness and passion all its fire was in his bosom all its beauty in his spirit all its mystery in his being all its splendor in his language and her lovers the rejected handsome men with belts of wampum handsome men with paint and feathers pointed at her in derision followed her with jest and laughter but she said i care not for you care not for your belts of wampum care not for your paint and feathers i am happy with osseo once to some great feast invited through the damp and dusk of evening walked together the ten sisters walked together with their husbands slowly followed old osseo with fair oweenee beside him all the others chatted gayly these two only walked in silence at the western sky osseo gazed intent as if imploring often stopped and gazed imploring at the trembling star of evening at the tender star of woman and they heard him murmur softly ah showain nemeshin nosa pity pity me my father listen said the eldest sister he is praying to his father what a pity that the old man does not stumble in the pathway does not break his neck by falling and they laughed till all the forest rang with their unseemly laughter on their pathway through the woodlands lay an oak by storms uprooted lay the great trunk of an oaktree buried half in leaves and mosses mouldering crumbling huge and hollow and osseo when he saw it gave a shout a cry of anguish leaped into its yawning cavern at one end went in an old man wasted wrinkled old and ugly from the other came a young man tall and straight and strong and handsome thus osseo was transfigured thus restored to youth and beauty but alas for good osseo and for oweenee the faithful strangely too was she transfigured changed into a weak old woman with a staff she tottered onward wasted wrinkled old and ugly and the sisters and their husbands laughed until the echoing forest rang with their unseemly laughter but osseo turned not from her walked with slower step beside her took her hand as brown and withered as an oakleaf is in winter called her sweetheart nenemoosha soothed her with soft words of kindness till they reached the lodge of feasting till they sat down in the wigwam sacred to the star of evening to the tender star of woman wrapt in visions lost in dreaming at the banquet sat osseo all were merry all were happy all were joyous but osseo neither food nor drink he tasted neither did he speak nor listen but as one bewildered sat he looking dreamily and sadly first at oweenee then upward at the gleaming sky above them then a voice was heard a whisper coming from the starry distance coming from the empty vastness low and musical and tender and the voice said o osseo o my son my best beloved broken are the spells that bound you all the charms of the magicians all the magic powers of evil come to me ascend osseo taste the food that stands before you it is blessed and enchanted it has magic virtues in it it will change you to a spirit all your bowls and all your kettles shall be wood and clay no longer but the bowls be changed to wampum and the kettles shall be silver they shall shine like shells of scarlet like the fire shall gleam and glimmer and the women shall no longer bear the dreary doom of labor but be changed to birds and glisten with the beauty of the starlight painted with the dusky splendors of the skies and clouds of evening what osseo heard as whispers what as words he comprehended was but music to the others music as of birds afar off of the whippoorwill afar off of the lonely wawonaissa singing in the darksome forest then the lodge began to tremble straight began to shake and tremble and they felt it rising rising slowly through the air ascending from the darkness of the treetops forth into the dewy starlight till it passed the topmost branches and behold the wooden dishes all were changed to shells of scarlet and behold the earthen kettles all were changed to bowls of silver and the roofpoles of the wigwam were as glittering rods of silver and the roof of bark upon them as the shining shards of beetles then osseo gazed around him and he saw the nine fair sisters all the sisters and their husbands changed to birds of various plumage some were jays and some were magpies others thrushes others blackbirds and they hopped and sang and twittered pecked and fluttered all their feathers strutted in their shining plumage and their tails like fans unfolded only oweenee the youngest was not changed but sat in silence wasted wrinkled old and ugly looking sadly at the others till osseo gazing upward gave another cry of anguish such a cry as he had uttered by the oaktree in the forest then returned her youth and beauty and her soiled and tattered garments were transformed to robes of ermine and her staff became a feather yes a shining silver feather and again the wigwam trembled swayed and rushed through airy currents through transparent cloud and vapor and amid celestial splendors on the evening star alighted as a snowflake falls on snowflake as a leaf drops on a river as the thistledown on water forth with cheerful words of welcome came the father of osseo he with radiant locks of silver he with eyes serene and tender and he said my son osseo hang the cage of birds you bring there hang the cage with rods of silver and the birds with glistening feathers at the doorway of my wigwam at the door he hung the birdcage and they entered in and gladly listened to osseos father ruler of the star of evening as he said o my osseo i have had compassion on you given you back your youth and beauty into birds of various plumage changed your sisters and their husbands changed them thus because they mocked you in the figure of the old man in that aspect sad and wrinkled could not see your heart of passion could not see your youth immortal only oweenee the faithful saw your naked heart and loved you in the lodge that glimmers yonder in the little star that twinkles through the vapors on the left hand lives the envious evil spirit the wabeno the magician who transformed you to an old man take heed lest his beams fall on you for the rays he darts around him are the power of his enchantment are the arrows that he uses many years in peace and quiet on the peaceful star of evening dwelt osseo with his father many years in song and flutter at the doorway of the wigwam hung the cage with rods of silver and fair oweenee the faithful bore a son unto osseo with the beauty of his mother with the courage of his father and the boy grew up and prospered and osseo to delight him made him little bows and arrows opened the great cage of silver and let loose his aunts and uncles all those birds with glossy feathers for his little son to shoot at round and round they wheeled and darted filled the evening star with music with their songs of joy and freedom filled the evening star with splendor with the fluttering of their plumage till the boy the little hunter bent his bow and shot an arrow shot a swift and fatal arrow and a bird with shining feathers at his feet fell wounded sorely but o wondrous transformation twas no bird he saw before him twas a beautiful young woman with the arrow in her bosom when her blood fell on the planet on the sacred star of evening broken was the spell of magic powerless was the strange enchantment and the youth the fearless bowman suddenly felt himself descending held by unseen hands but sinking downward through the empty spaces downward through the clouds and vapors till he rested on an island on an island green and grassy yonder in the bigseawater after him he saw descending all the birds with shining feathers fluttering falling wafted downward like the painted leaves of autumn and the lodge with poles of silver with its roof like wings of beetles like the shining shards of beetles by the winds of heaven uplifted slowly sank upon the island bringing back the good osseo bringing oweenee the faithful illustration he was held by unseen hands but sinking page then the birds again transfigured reassumed the shape of mortals took their shape but not their stature they remained as little people like the pygmies the pukwudjies and on pleasant nights of summer when the evening star was shining hand in hand they danced together on the islands craggy headlands on the sandbeach low and level still their glittering lodge is seen there on the tranquil summer evenings and upon the shore the fisher sometimes hears their happy voices sees them dancing in the starlight when the story was completed when the wondrous tale was ended looking round upon his listeners solemnly iagoo added there are great men i have known such whom their people understand not whom they even make a jest of scoff and jeer at in derision from the story of osseo let them learn the fate of jesters all the wedding guests delighted listened to the marvelous story listened laughing and applauding and they whispered to each other does he mean himself i wonder and are we the aunts and uncles then again sang chibiabos sang a song of love and longing in those accents sweet and tender in those tones of pensive sadness sang a maidens lamentation for her lover her algonquin when i think of my beloved ah me think of my beloved when my heart is thinking of him o my sweetheart my algonquin ah me when i parted from him round my neck he hung the wampum as a pledge the snowwhite wampum o my sweetheart my algonquin i will go with you he whispered ah me to your native country let me go with you he whispered o my sweetheart my algonquin far away away i answered very far away i answered ah me is my native country o my sweetheart my algonquin when i looked back to behold him where we parted to behold him after me he still was gazing o my sweetheart my algonquin by the tree he still was standing by the fallen tree was standing that had dropped into the water o my sweetheart my algonquin when i think of my beloved ah me think of my beloved when my heart is thinking of him o my sweetheart my algonquin such was hiawathas wedding such the dance of paupukkeewis such the story of iagoo such the songs of chibiabos thus the wedding banquet ended and the wedding guests departed leaving hiawatha happy with the night and minnehaha xiii blessing the cornfields sing o song of hiawatha of the happy days that followed in the land of the ojibways in the pleasant land and peaceful sing the mysteries of mondamin sing the blessings of the cornfields buried was the bloody hatchet buried was the dreadful warclub buried were all warlike weapons and the warcry was forgotten there was peace among the nations unmolested roved the hunters built the birch canoe for sailing caught the fish in lake and river shot the deer and trapped the beaver unmolested worked the women made their sugar from the maple gathered wild rice in the meadows dressed the skins of deer and beaver all around the happy village stood the maizefields green and shining waved the green plumes of mondamin waved his soft and sunny tresses filling all the land with plenty twas the women who in springtime planted the broad fields and fruitful buried in the earth mondamin twas the women who in autumn stripped the yellow husks of harvest stripped the garments from mondamin even as hiawatha taught them once when all the maize was planted hiawatha wise and thoughtful spake and said to minnehaha to his wife the laughing water you shall bless tonight the cornfields draw a magic circle round them to protect them from destruction blast of mildew blight of insect wagemin the thief of cornfields paimosaid who steals the maizeear in the night when all is silence in the night when all is darkness when the spirit of sleep nepahwin shuts the doors of all the wigwams so that not an ear can hear you so that not an eye can see you rise up from your bed in silence lay aside your garments wholly walk around the fields you planted round the borders of the cornfields covered by your tresses only robed with darkness as a garment thus the fields shall be more fruitful and the passing of your footsteps draw a magic circle round them so that neither blight nor mildew neither burrowing worm nor insect shall pass oer the magic circle not the dragonfly kwoneshe nor the spider subbekashe nor the grasshopper pahpukkeena nor the mighty caterpillar waymukkwana with the bearskin king of all the caterpillars on the treetops near the cornfields sat the hungry crows and ravens kahgahgee the king of ravens with his band of black marauders and they laughed at hiawatha till the treetops shook with laughter with their melancholy laughter at the words of hiawatha hear him said they hear the wise man hear the plots of hiawatha when the noiseless night descended broad and dark oer field and forest when the mournful wawonaissa sorrowing sang among the hemlocks and the spirit of sleep nepahwin shut the doors of all the wigwams from her bed rose laughing water laid aside her garments wholly and with darkness clothed and guarded unashamed and unaffrighted walked securely round the cornfields drew the sacred magic circle of her footprints round the cornfields no one but the midnight only saw her beauty in the darkness no one but the wawonaissa heard the panting of her bosom guskewau the darkness wrapped her closely in his sacred mantle so that none might see her beauty so that none might boast i saw her on the morrow as the day dawned kahgahgee the king of ravens gathered all his black marauders crows and blackbirds jays and ravens clamorous on the dusky treetops and descended fast and fearless on the fields of hiawatha on the grave of the mondamin we will drag mondamin said they from the grave where he is buried spite of all the magic circles laughing water draws around it spite of all the sacred footprints minnehaha stamps upon it but the wary hiawatha ever thoughtful careful watchful had oerheard the scornful laughter when they mocked him from the treetops kaw he said my friends the ravens kahgahgee my king of ravens i will teach you all a lesson that shall not be soon forgotten he had risen before the daybreak he had spread oer all the cornfields snares to catch the black marauders and was lying now in ambush in the neighboring grove of pinetrees waiting for the crows and blackbirds waiting for the jays and ravens soon they came with caw and clamor rush of wings and cry of voices to their work of devastation settling down upon the cornfields delving deep with beak and talon for the body of mondamin and with all their craft and cunning all their skill in wiles of warfare they perceived no danger near them till their claws became entangled till they found themselves imprisoned in the snares of hiawatha from his place of ambush came he striding terrible among them and so awful was his aspect that the bravest quailed with terror without mercy he destroyed them right and left by tens and twenties and their wretched lifeless bodies hung aloft on poles for scarecrows round the consecrated cornfields as a signal of his vengeance as a warning to marauders only kahgahgee the leader kahgahgee the king of ravens he alone was spared among them as a hostage for his people with his prisonerstring he bound him led him captive to his wigwam tied him fast with cords of elmbark to the ridgepole of his wigwam kahgahgee my raven said he you the leader of the robbers you the plotter of this mischief the contriver of this outrage i will keep you i will hold you as a hostage for your people as a pledge of good behavior and he left him grim and sulky sitting in the morning sunshine on the summit of the wigwam croaking fiercely his displeasure flapping his great sable pinions vainly struggling for his freedom vainly calling on his people summer passed and shawondasee breathed his sighs oer all the landscape from the southland sent his ardors wafted kisses warm and tender and the maizefield grew and ripened till it stood in all the splendor of its garments green and yellow of its tassels and its plumage and the maizeears full and shining gleamed from bursting sheaths of verdure then nokomis the old woman spake and said to minnehaha tis the moon when leaves are falling all the wildrice has been gathered and the maize is ripe and ready let us gather in the harvest let us wrestle with mondamin strip him of his plumes and tassels of his garments green and yellow and the merry laughing water went rejoicing from the wigwam with nokomis old and wrinkled and they called the women round them called the young men and the maidens to the harvest of the cornfields to the husking of the maizeear on the border of the forest underneath the fragrant pinetrees sat the old men and the warriors smoking in the pleasant shadow in uninterrupted silence looked they at the gamesome labor of the young men and the women listened to their noisy talking to their laughter and their singing heard them chattering like the magpies heard them laughing like the bluejays heard them singing like the robins and wheneer some lucky maiden found a red ear in the husking found a maizeear red as blood is nushka cried they all together nushka you shall have a sweetheart you shall have a handsome husband ugh the old men all responded from their seats beneath the pinetrees and wheneer a youth or maiden found a crooked ear in husking found a maizeear in the husking blighted mildewed or misshapen then they laughed and sang together crept and limped about the cornfields mimicked in their gait and gestures some old man bent almost double singing singly or together wagemin the thief of cornfields paimosaid the skulking robber till the cornfields rang with laughter till from hiawathas wigwam kahgahgee the king of ravens screamed and quivered in his anger and from all the neighboring treetops cawed and croaked the black marauders ugh the old men all responded from their seats beneath the pinetrees xiv picturewriting in those days said hiawatha lo how all things fade and perish from the memory of the old men fade away the great traditions the achievements of the warriors the adventures of the hunters all the wisdom of the medas all the craft of the wabenos all the marvelous dreams and visions of the jossakeeds the prophets great men die and are forgotten wise men speak their words of wisdom perish in the ears that hear them do not reach the generations that as yet unborn are waiting in the great mysterious darkness of the speechless days that shall be on the graveposts of our fathers are no signs no figures painted who are in those graves we know not only know they are our fathers of what kith they are and kindred from what old ancestral totem be it eagle bear or beaver they descended this we know not only know they are our fathers face to face we speak together but we cannot speak when absent cannot send our voices from us to the friends that dwell afar off cannot send a secret message but the bearer learns our secret may pervert it may betray it may reveal it unto others thus said hiawatha walking in the solitary forest pondering musing in the forest on the welfare of his people from his pouch he took his colors took his paints of different colors on the smooth bark of a birchtree painted many shapes and figures wonderful and mystic figures illustration and each figure had a meaning page and each figure had a meaning each some word or thought suggested gitche manito the mighty he the master of life was painted as an egg with points projecting to the four winds of the heavens everywhere is the great spirit was the meaning of this symbol mitche manito the mighty he the dreadful spirit of evil as a serpent was depicted as kenabeek the great serpent very crafty very cunning is the creeping spirit of evil was the meaning of this symbol life and death he drew as circles life was white but death was darkened sun and moon and stars he painted man and beast and fish and reptile forests mountains lakes and rivers for the earth he drew a straight line for the sky a bow above it white the space between for daytime filled with little stars for nighttime on the left a point for sunrise on the right a point for sunset on the top a point for noontide and for rain and cloudy weather waving lines descending from it footprints pointing towards a wigwam were a sign of invitation were a sign of guests assembling bloody hands with palms uplifted were a symbol of destruction were a hostile sign and symbol all these things did hiawatha show unto his wondering people and interpreted their meaning and he said behold your graveposts have no mark no sign nor symbol go and paint them all with figures each one with its household symbol with its own ancestral totem so that those who follow after may distinguish them and know them and they painted on the graveposts of the graves yet unforgotten each his own ancestral totem each the symbol of his household figures of the bear and reindeer of the turtle crane and beaver each inverted as a token that the owner was departed that the chief who bore the symbol lay beneath in dust and ashes and the jossakeeds the prophets the wabenos the magicians and the medicinemen the medas painted upon bark and deerskin figures for the songs they chanted for each song a separate symbol figures mystical and awful figures strange and brightly colored and each figure had its meaning each some magic song suggested the great spirit the creator flashing light through all the heaven the great serpent the kenabeek with his bloody crest erected creeping looking into heaven in the sky the sun that listens and the moon eclipsed and dying owl and eagle crane and henhawk and the cormorant bird of magic headless men that walk the heavens bodies lying pierced with arrows bloody hands of death uplifted flags on graves and great warcaptains grasping both the earth and heaven such as these the shapes they painted on the birchbark and the deerskin songs of war and songs of hunting songs of medicine and of magic all were written in these figures for each figure had its meaning each its separate song recorded nor forgotten was the lovesong the most subtle of all medicines the most potent spell of magic dangerous more than war or hunting thus the lovesong was recorded symbol and interpretation first a human figure standing painted in the brightest scarlet tis the lover the musician and the meaning is my painting makes me powerful over others then the figure seated singing playing on a drum of magic and the interpretation listen tis my voice you hear my singing then the same red figure seated in the shelter of a wigwam and the meaning of the symbol i will come and sit beside you in the mystery of my passion then two figures man and woman standing hand in hand together with their hands so clasped together that they seem in one united and the words thus represented are i see your heart within you and your cheeks are red with blushes next the maiden on an island in the centre of an island and the song this shape suggested was though you were at a distance were upon some faroff island such the spell i cast upon you such the magic power of passion i could straightway draw you to me then the figure of the maiden sleeping and the lover near her whispering to her in her slumbers saying though you were far from me in the land of sleep and silence still the voice of love would reach you and the last of all the figures was a heart within a circle drawn within a magic circle and the image had this meaning naked lies your heart before me to your naked heart i whisper thus it was that hiawatha in his wisdom taught the people all the mysteries of painting all the art of picturewriting on the smooth bark of the birchtree on the white skin of the reindeer on the graveposts of the village xv hiawathas lamentation in those days the evil spirits all the manitos of mischief fearing hiawathas wisdom and his love for chibiabos jealous of their faithful friendship and their noble words and actions made at length a league against them to molest them and destroy them hiawatha wise and wary often said to chibiabos o my brother do not leave me lest the evil spirits harm you chibiabos young and heedless laughing shook his coalblack tresses answered ever sweet and childlike do not fear for me o brother harm and evil come not near me once when peboan the winter roofed with ice the bigseawater when the snowflakes whirling downward hissed among the withered oakleaves changed the pinetrees into wigwams covered all the earth with silence armed with arrows shod with snowshoes heeding not his brothers warning fearing not the evil spirits forth to hunt the deer with antlers all alone went chibiabos right across the bigseawater sprang with speed the deer before him with the wind and snow he followed oer the treacherous ice he followed wild with all the fierce commotion and the rapture of the hunting but beneath the evil spirits lay in ambush waiting for him broke the treacherous ice beneath him dragged him downward to the bottom buried in the sand his body unktahee the god of water he the god of the dacotahs drowned him in the deep abysses of the lake of gitche gumee from the headlands hiawatha sent forth such a wail of anguish such a fearful lamentation that the bison paused to listen and the wolves howled from the prairies and the thunder in the distance woke and answered baimwawa then his face with black he painted with his robe his head he covered in his wigwam sat lamenting seven long weeks he sat lamenting uttering still this moan of sorrow he is dead the sweet musician he the sweetest of all singers he has gone from us forever he has moved a little nearer to the master of all music to the master of all singing o my brother chibiabos and the melancholy firtrees waved their dark green fans above him waved their purple cones above him sighing with him to console him mingling with his lamentation their complaining their lamenting came the spring and all the forest looked in vain for chibiabos sighed the rivulet sebowisha sighed the rushes in the meadow from the treetops sang the bluebird sang the bluebird the owaissa chibiabos chibiabos he is dead the sweet musician from the wigwam sang the robin sang the opechee the robin chibiabos chibiabos he is dead the sweetest singer and at night through all the forest went the whippoorwill complaining wailing went the wawonaissa chibiabos chibiabos he is dead the sweet musician he the sweetest of all singers then the medicinemen the medas the magicians the wabenos and the jossakeeds the prophets came to visit hiawatha built a sacred lodge beside him to appease him to console him walked in silent grave procession bearing each a pouch of healing skin of beaver lynx or otter filled with magic roots and simples filled with very potent medicines when he heard their steps approaching hiawatha ceased lamenting called no more on chibiabos naught he questioned naught he answered but his mournful head uncovered from his face the mourning colors washed he slowly and in silence slowly and in silence followed onward to the sacred wigwam there a magic drink they gave him made of nahmawusk the spearmint and wabenowusk the yarrow roots of power and herbs of healing beat their drums and shook their rattles chanted singly and in chorus mystic songs like these they chanted i myself myself behold me tis the great gray eagle talking come ye white crows come and hear him the loudspeaking thunder helps me all the unseen spirits help me i can hear their voices calling all around the sky i hear them i can blow you strong my brother i can heal you hiawatha hiauha replied the chorus wayhaway the mystic chorus friends of mine are all the serpents hear me shake my skin of henhawk mahng the white loon i can kill him i can shoot your heart and kill it i can blow you strong my brother i can heal you hiawatha hiauha replied the chorus wayhaway the mystic chorus i myself myself the prophet when i speak the wigwam trembles shakes the sacred lodge with terror hands unseen begin to shake it when i walk the sky i tread on bends and makes a noise beneath me i can blow you strong my brother rise and speak o hiawatha hiauha replied the chorus wayhaway the mystic chorus then they shook their medicinepouches oer the head of hiawatha danced their medicinedance around him and upstarting wild and haggard like a man from dreams awakened he was healed of all his madness as the clouds are swept from heaven straightway from his brain departed all his moody melancholy as the ice is swept from rivers straightway from his heart departed all his sorrow and affliction then they summoned chibiabos from his grave beneath the waters from the sands of gitche gumee summoned hiawathas brother and so mighty was the magic of that cry and invocation that he heard it as he lay there underneath the bigseawater from the sand he rose and listened heard the music and the singing came obedient to the summons to the doorway of the wigwam but to enter they forbade him through a chink a coal they gave him through the door a burning firebrand ruler in the land of spirits ruler oer the dead they made him telling him a fire to kindle for all those that died thereafter campfires for their night encampments on their solitary journey to the kingdom of ponemah to the land of the hereafter from the village of his childhood from the homes of those who knew him passing silent through the forest like a smokewreath wafted sideways slowly vanished chibiabos where he passed the branches moved not where he trod the grasses bent not and the fallen leaves of last year made no sound beneath his footsteps four whole days he journeyed onward down the pathway of the dead men on the deadmans strawberry feasted crossed the melancholy river on the swinging log he crossed it came unto the lake of silver in the stone canoe was carried to the islands of the blessed to the land of ghosts and shadows on that journey moving slowly many weary spirits saw he panting under heavy burdens laden with warclubs bows and arrows robes of fur and pots and kettles and with food that friends had given for that solitary journey aye why do the living said they lay such heavy burdens on us better were it to go naked better were it to go fasting than to bear such heavy burdens on our long and weary journey forth then issued hiawatha wandered eastward wandered westward teaching men the use of simples and the antidotes for poisons and the cure of all diseases thus was first made known to mortals all the mystery of medamin all the sacred art of healing xvi paupukkeewis you shall hear how paupukkeewis he the handsome yenadizze whom the people called the storm fool vexed the village with disturbance you shall hear of all his mischief and his flight from hiawatha and his wondrous transmigrations and the end of his adventures on the shores of gitche gumee on the dunes of nagow wudjoo by the shining bigseawater stood the lodge of paupukkeewis it was he who in his frenzy whirled these drifting sands together on the dunes of nagow wudjoo when among the guests assembled he so merrily and madly danced at hiawathas wedding danced the beggars dance to please them now in search of new adventures from his lodge went paupukkeewis came with speed into the village found the young men all assembled in the lodge of old iagoo listening to his monstrous stories to his wonderful adventures he was telling them the story of ojeeg the summermaker how he made a hole in heaven how he climbed up into heaven and let out the summerweather the perpetual pleasant summer how the otter first essayed it how the beaver lynx and badger tried in turn the great achievement from the summit of the mountain smote their fists against the heavens smote against the sky their foreheads cracked the sky but could not break it how the wolverine uprising made him ready for the encounter bent his knees down like a squirrel drew his arms back like a cricket once he leaped said old iagoo once he leaped and lo above him bent the sky as ice in rivers when the waters rise beneath it twice he leaped and lo above him cracked the sky as ice in rivers when the freshet is at highest thrice he leaped and lo above him broke the shattered sky asunder and he disappeared within it and ojeeg the fisher weasel with a bound went in behind him hark you shouted paupukkeewis as he entered at the doorway i am tired of all this talking tired of old iagoos stories tired of hiawathas wisdom here is something to amuse you better than this endless talking then from out his pouch of wolfskin forth he drew with solemn manner all the game of bowl and counters pugasaing with thirteen pieces white on one side were they painted and vermilion on the other two kenabeeks or great serpents two ininewug or wedgemen one great warclub pugamaugun and one slender fish the keego four round pieces ozawabeeks and three sheshebwug or ducklings all were made of bone and painted all except the ozawabeeks these were brass on one side burnished and were black upon the other in a wooden bowl he placed them shook and jostled them together threw them on the ground before him thus exclaiming and explaining red side up are all the pieces and one great kenabeek standing on the bright side of a brass piece on a burnished ozawabeek thirteen tens and eight are counted then again he shook the pieces shook and jostled them together threw them on the ground before him still exclaiming and explaining white are both the great kenabeeks white the ininewug the wedgemen red are all the other pieces five tens and an eight are counted thus he taught the game of hazard thus displayed it and explained it running through its various chances various changes various meanings twenty curious eyes stared at him full of eagerness stared at him many games said old iagoo many games of skill and hazard have i seen in different nations have i played in different countries he who plays with old iagoo must have very nimble fingers though you think yourself so skillful i can beat you paupukkeewis i can even give you lessons in your game of bowl and counters so they sat and played together all the old men and the young men played for dresses weapons wampum played till midnight played till morning played until the yenadizze till the cunning paupukkeewis of their treasures had despoiled them of the best of all their dresses shirts of deerskin robes of ermine belts of wampum crests of feathers warlike weapons pipes and pouches twenty eyes glared wildly at him like the eyes of wolves glared at him said the lucky paupukkeewis in my wigwam i am lonely in my wanderings and adventures i have need of a companion fain would have a meshinauwa an attendant and pipebearer i will venture all these winnings all these garments heaped about me all this wampum all these feathers on a single throw will venture all against the young man yonder twas a youth of sixteen summers twas a nephew of iagoo faceinamist the people called him as the fire burns in a pipehead dusky red beneath the ashes so beneath his shaggy eyebrows glowed the eyes of old iagoo ugh he answered very fiercely ugh they answered all and each one seized the wooden bowl the old man closely in his bony fingers clutched the fatal bowl onagon shook it fiercely and with fury made the pieces ring together as he threw them down before him red were both the great kenabeeks red the ininewug the wedgemen red the sheshebwug the ducklings black the four brass ozawabeeks white alone the fish the keego only five the pieces counted then the smiling paupukkeewis shook the bowl and threw the pieces lightly in the air he tossed them and they fell about him scattered dark and bright the ozawabeeks red and white the other pieces and upright among the others one ininewug was standing even as crafty paupukkeewis stood alone among the players saying five tens mine the game is twenty eyes glared at him fiercely like the eyes of wolves glared at him as he turned and left the wigwam followed by his meshinauwa by the nephew of iagoo by the tall and graceful stripling bearing in his arms the winnings shirts of deerskin robes of ermine belts of wampum pipes and weapons carry them said paupukkeewis pointing with his fan of feathers to my wigwam far to eastward on the dunes of nagow wudjoo hot and red with smoke and gambling were the eyes of paupukkeewis as he came forth to the freshness of the pleasant summer morning all the birds were singing gayly all the streamlets flowing swiftly and the heart of paupukkeewis sang with pleasure as the birds sing beat with triumph like the streamlets as he wandered through the village in the early gray of morning with his fan of turkeyfeathers with his plumes and tufts of swans down till he reached the farthest wigwam reached the lodge of hiawatha silent was it and deserted no one met him at the doorway no one came to bid him welcome but the birds were singing round it in and out and round the doorway hopping singing fluttering feeding and aloft upon the ridgepole kahgahgee the king of ravens sat with fiery eyes and screaming flapped his wings at paupukkeewis all are gone the lodge is empty thus it was spake paupukkeewis in his heart resolving mischief gone is wary hiawatha gone the silly laughing water gone nokomis the old woman and the lodge is left unguarded by the neck he seized the raven whirled it round him like a rattle like a medicinepouch he shook it strangled kahgahgee the raven from the ridgepole of the wigwam left its lifeless body hanging as an insult to its master as a taunt to hiawatha with a stealthy step he entered round the lodge in wild disorder threw the household things about him piled together in confusion bowls of wood and earthen kettles robes of buffalo and beaver skins of otter lynx and ermine as an insult to nokomis as a taunt to minnehaha then departed paupukkeewis whistling singing through the forest whistling gayly to the squirrels who from hollow boughs above him dropped their acornshells upon him singing gayly to the wood birds who from out the leafy darkness answered with a song as merry then he climbed the rocky headlands looking oer the gitche gumee perched himself upon their summit waiting full of mirth and mischief the return of hiawatha stretched upon his back he lay there far below him plashed the waters plashed and washed the dreamy waters far above him swam the heavens swam the dizzy dreamy heavens round him hovered fluttered rustled hiawathas mountain chickens flockwise swept and wheeled about him almost brushed him with their pinions and he killed them as he lay there slaughtered them by tens and twenties threw their bodies down the headland threw them on the beach below him till at length kayoshk the seagull perched upon a crag above them shouted it is paupukkeewis he is slaying us by hundreds send a message to our brother tidings send to hiawatha xvii the hunting of paupukkeewis full of wrath was hiawatha when he came into the village found the people in confusion heard of all the misdemeanors all the malice and the mischief of the cunning paupukkeewis hard his breath came through his nostrils through his teeth he buzzed and muttered words of anger and resentment hot and humming like a hornet i will slay this paupukkeewis slay this mischiefmaker said he not so long and wide the world is not so rude and rough the way is that my wrath shall not attain him that my vengeance shall not reach him then in swift pursuit departed hiawatha and the hunters on the trail of paupukkeewis through the forest where he passed it to the headlands where he rested but they found not paupukkeewis only in the trampled grasses in the whortleberry bushes found the couch where he had rested found the impress of his body from the lowlands far beneath them from the muskoday the meadow paupukkeewis turning backward made a gesture of defiance made a gesture of derision and aloud cried hiawatha from the summit of the mountain not so long and wide the world is not so rude and rough the way is but my wrath shall overtake you and my vengeance shall attain you over rock and over river through bush and break and forest ran the cunning paupukkeewis like an antelope he bounded till he came into a streamlet in the middle of the forest to a streamlet still and tranquil that had overflowed its margin to a dam made by the beavers to a pond of quiet waters where kneedeep the trees were standing where the waterlilies floated where the rushes waved and whispered on the dam stood paupukkeewis on the dam of trunks and branches through whose chinks the water spouted oer whose summit flowed the streamlet from the bottom rose the beaver looked with two great eyes of wonder eyes that seemed to ask a question at the stranger paupukkeewis on the dam stood paupukkeewis oer his ankles flowed the streamlet flowed the bright and silvery water and he spake unto the beaver with a smile he spake in this wise o my friend ahmeek the beaver cool and pleasant is the water let me dive into the water let me rest there in your lodges change me too into a beaver cautiously replied the beaver with reserve he thus made answer let me first consult the others let me ask the other beavers down he sank into the water heavily sank he as a stone sinks down among the leaves and branches brown and matted at the bottom on the dam stood paupukkeewis oer his ankles flowed the streamlet spouted through the chinks below him dashed upon the stones beneath him spread serene and calm before him and the sunshine and the shadows fell in flecks and gleams upon him fell in little shining patches through the waving rustling branches from the bottom rose the beavers silently above the surface rose one head and then another till the pond seemed full of beavers full of black and shining faces to the beavers paupukkeewis spake entreating said in this wise very pleasant is your dwelling o my friends and safe from danger can you not with all your cunning all your wisdom and contrivance change me too into a beaver yes replied ahmeek the beaver he the king of all the beavers let yourself slide down among us down into the tranquil water down into the pond among them silently sank paupukkeewis black became his shirt of deerskin black his moccasins and leggings in a broad black tail behind him spread his foxtail and his fringes he was changed into a beaver make me large said paupukkeewis make me large and make me larger larger than the other beavers yes the beaver chief responded when our lodge below you enter in our wigwam we will make you ten times larger than the others thus into the clear brown water silently sank paupukkeewis found the bottom covered over with the trunks of trees and branches hoards of food against the winter piles and heaps against the famine found the lodge with arching doorway leading into spacious chambers here they made him large and larger made him largest of the beavers ten times larger than the others you shall be our ruler said they chief and king of all the beavers but not long had paupukkeewis sat in state among the beavers when there came a voice of warning from the watchman at his station in the waterflags and lilies saying here is hiawatha hiawatha with his hunters then they heard a cry above them heard a shouting and a tramping heard a crashing and a rushing and the water round and oer them sank and sucked away in eddies and they knew their dam was broken on the lodges roof the hunters leaped and broke it all asunder streamed the sunshine through the crevice sprang the beavers through the doorway hid themselves in deeper water in the channel of the streamlet but the mighty paupukkeewis could not pass beneath the doorway he was puffed with pride and feeding he was swollen like a bladder through the roof looked hiawatha cried aloud o paupukkeewis vain are all your craft and cunning vain your manifold disguises well i know you paupukkeewis with their clubs they beat and bruised him beat to death poor paupukkeewis pounded him as maize is pounded till his skull was crushed to pieces six tall hunters lithe and limber bore him home on poles and branches bore the body of the beaver but the ghost the jeebi in him thought and felt as paupukkeewis still lived on as paupukkeewis and it fluttered strove and struggled waving hither waving thither as the curtains of a wigwam struggle with their thongs of deerskin when the wintry wind is blowing till it drew itself together till it rose up from the body till it took the form and features of the cunning paupukkeewis vanishing into the forest but the wary hiawatha saw the figure ere it vanished saw the form of paupukkeewis glide into the soft blue shadow of the pinetrees of the forest toward the squares of white beyond it toward an opening in the forest like a wind it rushed and panted bending all the boughs before it and behind it as the rain comes came the steps of hiawatha to a lake with many islands came the breathless paupukkeewis where among the waterlilies pishnekuh the brant were sailing through the tufts of rushes floating steering through the reedy islands now their broad black beaks they lifted now they plunged beneath the water now they darkened in the shadow now they brightened in the sunshine pishnekuh cried paupukkeewis pishnekuh my brothers said he change me to a brant with plumage with a shining neck and feathers make me large and make me larger ten times larger than the others straightway to a brant they changed him with two huge and dusky pinions with a bosom smooth and rounded with a bill like two great paddles made him larger than the others ten times larger than the largest just as shouting from the forest on the shore stood hiawatha up they rose with cry and clamor with a whir and beat of pinions rose up from the reedy islands from the waterflags and lilies and they said to paupukkeewis in your flying look not downward take good heed and look not downward lest some strange mischance should happen lest some great mishap befall you fast and far they fled to northward fast and far through mist and sunshine fed among the moors and fenlands slept among the reeds and rushes on the morrow as they journeyed buoyed and lifted by the southwind wafted onward by the southwind blowing fresh and strong behind them rose a sound of human voices rose a clamor from beneath them from the lodges of a village from the people miles beneath them for the people of the village saw the flock of brant with wonder saw the wings of paupukkeewis flapping far up in the ether broader than two doorway curtains paupukkeewis heard the shouting knew the voice of hiawatha knew the outcry of iagoo and forgetful of the warning drew his neck in and looked downward and the wind that blew behind him caught his mighty fan of feathers sent him wheeling whirling downward all in vain did paupukkeewis struggle to regain his balance whirling round and round and downward he beheld in turn the village and in turn the flock above him saw the village coming nearer and the flock receding farther heard the voices growing louder heard the shouting and the laughter saw no more the flock above him only saw the earth beneath him dead out of the empty heaven dead among the shouting people with a heavy sound and sullen fell the brant with broken pinions but his soul his ghost his shadow still survived as paupukkeewis took again the form and features of the handsome yenadizze and again went rushing onward followed fast by hiawatha crying not so wide the world is not so long and rough the way is but my wrath shall overtake you but my vengeance shall attain you and so near he came so near him that his hand was stretched to seize him his right hand to seize and hold him when the cunning paupukkeewis whirled and spun about in circles fanned the air into a whirlwind danced the dust and leaves about him and amid the whirling eddies sprang into a hollow oaktree changed himself into a serpent gliding out through root and rubbish with his right hand hiawatha smote amain the hollow oaktree rent it into shreds and splinters left it lying there in fragments but in vain for paupukkeewis once again in human figure full in sight ran on before him sped away in gust and whirlwind on the shores of gitche gumee westward by the bigseawater came unto the rocky headlands to the pictured rocks of sandstone looking over lake and landscape and the old man of the mountain he the manito of mountains opened wide his rocky doorways opened wide his deep abysses giving paupukkeewis shelter in his caverns dark and dreary bidding paupukkeewis welcome to his gloomy lodge of sandstone there without stood hiawatha found the doorways closed against him with his mittens minjekahwun smote great caverns in the sandstone cried aloud in tones of thunder open i am hiawatha but the old man of the mountain opened not and made no answer from the silent crags of sandstone from the gloomy rock abysses then he raised his hands to heaven called imploring on the tempest called waywassimo the lightning and the thunder annemeekee and they came with night and darkness sweeping down the bigseawater from the distant thunder mountains and the trembling paupukkeewis heard the footsteps of the thunder saw the red eyes of the lightning was afraid and crouched and trembled then waywassimo the lightning smote the doorways of the caverns with his warclub smote the doorways smote the jutting crags of sandstone and the thunder annemeekee shouted down into the caverns saying where is paupukkeewis and the crags fell and beneath them dead among the rocky ruins lay the cunning paupukkeewis lay the handsome yenadizze slain in his own human figure ended were his wild adventures ended were his tricks and gambols ended all his craft and cunning ended all his mischiefmaking all his gambling and his dancing all his wooing of the maidens then the noble hiawatha took his soul his ghost his shadow spake and said o paupukkeewis never more in human figure shall you search for new adventures never more with jest and laughter dance the dust and leaves in whirlwinds but above there in the heavens you shall soar and sail in circles i will change you to an eagle to keneu the great wareagle chief of all the fowls with feathers chief of hiawathas chickens and the name of paupukkeewis lingers still among the people lingers still among the singers and among the storytellers and in winter when the snowflakes whirl in eddies round the lodges when the wind in gusty tumult oer the smokeflue pipes and whistles there they cry comes paupukkeewis he is dancing through the village he is gathering in his harvest xviii the death of kwasind far and wide among the nations spread the name and fame of kwasind no man dared to strive with kwasind no man could compete with kwasind but the mischievous pukwudjies they the envious little people they the fairies and the pygmies plotted and conspired against him if the hateful kwasind said they if this great outrageous fellow goes on thus a little longer tearing everything he touches rending everything to pieces filling all the world with wonder what becomes of the pukwudjies who will care for the pukwudjies he will tread us down like mushrooms drive us all into the water give our bodies to be eaten by the wicked neebanawbaigs by the spirits of the water so the angry little people all conspired against the strong man all conspired to murder kwasind yes to rid the world of kwasind the audacious overbearing heartless haughty dangerous kwasind now this wondrous strength of kwasind in his crown alone was seated in his crown too was his weakness there alone could he be wounded nowhere else could weapon pierce him nowhere else could weapon harm him even there the only weapon that could wound him that could slay him was the seedcone of the pinetree was the blue cone of the firtree this was kwasinds fatal secret known to no man among mortals but the cunning little people the pukwudjies knew the secret knew the only way to kill him so they gathered cones together gathered seedcones of the pinetree gathered blue cones of the firtree in the woods by taquamenaw brought them to the rivers margin heaped them in great piles together where the red rocks from the margin jutting overhang the river there they lay in wait for kwasind the malicious little people twas an afternoon in summer very hot and still the air was very smooth the gliding river motionless the sleeping shadows insects glistened in the sunshine insects skated on the water filled the drowsy air with buzzing with a far resounding warcry down the river came the strong man in his birch canoe came kwasind floating slowly down the current of the sluggish taquamenaw very languid with the weather very sleepy with the silence from the overhanging branches from the tassels of the birchtrees soft the spirit of sleep descended by his airy hosts surrounded his invisible attendants came the spirit of sleep nepahwin like the burnished dushkwoneshe like a dragonfly he hovered oer the drowsy head of kwasind to his ear there came a murmur as of waves upon a seashore as of faroff tumbling waters as of winds among the pinetrees and he felt upon his forehead blows of little airy warclubs wielded by the slumbrous legions of the spirit of sleep nepahwin as of some one breathing on him at the first blow of their warclubs fell a drowsiness on kwasind at the second blow they smote him motionless his paddle rested at the third before his vision illustration hurled the pinecones down upon him page reeled the landscape into darkness very sound asleep was kwasind so he floated down the river like a blind man seated upright floated down the taquamenaw underneath the trembling birchtrees underneath the wooded headlands underneath the war encampment of the pygmies the pukwudjies there they stood all armed and waiting hurled the pinecones down upon him struck him on his brawny shoulders on his crown defenseless struck him death to kwasind was the sudden warcry of the little people and he sideways swayed and tumbled sideways fell into the river plunged beneath the sluggish water headlong as an otter plunges and the birchcanoe abandoned drifted empty down the river bottom upward swerved and drifted nothing more was seen of kwasind but the memory of the strong man lingered long among the people and whenever through the forest raged and roared the wintry tempest and the branches tossed and troubled creaked and groaned and split asunder kwasind cried they that is kwasind he is gathering in his firewood xix the ghosts never stoops the soaring vulture on his quarry in the desert on the sick or wounded bison but another vulture watching from his high aerial lookout sees the downward plunge and follows and a third pursues the second coming from the invisible ether first a speck and then a vulture till the air is dark with pinions so disasters come not singly but as if they watched and waited scanning one anothers motions when the first descends the others follow follow gather flockwise round their victim sick and wounded first a shadow then a sorrow till the air is dark with anguish now oer all the dreary northland mighty peboan the winter breathing on the lakes and rivers into stone had changed their waters from his hair he shook the snowflakes till the plains were strewn with whiteness one uninterrupted level as if stooping the creator with his hands had smoothed them over through the forest wide and wailing roamed the hunter on his snowshoes in the village worked the women pounded maize or dressed the deerskin and the young men played together on the ice the noisy ballplay on the plain the dance of snowshoes one dark evening after sundown in her wigwam laughing water sat with old nokomis waiting for the steps of hiawatha homeward from the hunt returning on their faces gleamed the firelight painting them with streaks of crimson in the eyes of old nokomis glimmered like the watery moonlight in the eyes of laughing water glistened like the sun in water and behind them crouched their shadows in the corners of the wigwam and the smoke in wreaths above them climbed and crowded through the smokeflue then the curtain of the doorway from without was slowly lifted brighter glowed the fire a moment and a moment swerved the smokewreath as two women entered softly passed the doorway uninvited without word of salutation without sign of recognition sat down in the farthest corner crouching low among the shadows from their aspect and their garments strangers seemed they in the village very pale and haggard were they as they sat there sad and silent trembling cowering with the shadows was it the wind above the smokeflue muttering down into the wigwam was it the owl the kokokoho hooting from the dismal forest sure a voice said in the silence these are corpses clad in garments these are ghosts that come to haunt you from the kingdom of ponemah from the land of the hereafter homeward now came hiawatha from his hunting in the forest with the snow upon his tresses and the red deer on his shoulders at the feet of laughing water down he threw his lifeless burden nobler handsomer she thought him than when he first came to woo her first threw down the deer before her as a token of his wishes as a promise of the future then he turned and saw the strangers cowering crouching with the shadows said within himself who are they what strange guests hast minnehaha but he questioned not the strangers only spake to bid them welcome to his lodge his food his fireside when the evening meal was ready and the deer had been divided both the pallid guests the strangers springing from among the shadows seized upon the choicest portions seized the white fat of the roebuck set apart for laughing water for the wife of hiawatha without asking without thanking eagerly devoured the morsels flitted back among the shadows in the corner of the wigwam not a word spake hiawatha not a motion made nokomis not a gesture laughing water not a change came oer their features only minnehaha softly whispered saying they are famished let them do what best delights them let them eat for they are famished many a daylight dawned and darkened many a night shook off the daylight as the pine shakes off the snowflakes from the midnight of its branches day by day the guests unmoving sat there silent in the wigwam but by night in storm or starlight forth they went into the forest bringing firewood to the wigwam bringing pinecones for the burning always sad and always silent and whenever hiawatha came from fishing or from hunting when the evening meal was ready and the food had been divided gliding from their darksome corner came the pallid guests the strangers seized upon the choicest portions set aside for laughing water and without rebuke or question flitted back among the shadows never once had hiawatha by a word or look reproved them never once had old nokomis made a gesture of impatience never once had laughing water shown resentment at the outrage all had they endured in silence that the rights of guest and stranger that the virtue of freegiving by a look might not be lessened by a word might not be broken once at midnight hiawatha ever wakeful ever watchful in the wigwam dimly lighted by the brands that still were burning by the glimmering flickering firelight heard a sighing oft repeated heard a sobbing as of sorrow from his couch rose hiawatha from his shaggy hides of bison pushed aside the deerskin curtain saw the pallid guests the shadows sitting upright on their couches weeping in the silent midnight and he said o guests why is it that your hearts are so afflicted that you sob so in the midnight has perchance the old nokomis has my wife my minnehaha wronged or grieved you by unkindness failed in hospitable duties then the shadows ceased from weeping ceased from sobbing and lamenting and they said with gentle voices we are ghosts of the departed souls of those who once were with you from the realms of chibiabos hither have we come to try you hither have we come to warn you cries of grief and lamentation reach us in the blessed islands cries of anguish from the living calling back their friends departed sadden us with useless sorrow therefore have we come to try you no one knows us no one heeds us we are but a burden to you and we see that the departed have no place among the living think of this o hiawatha speak of it to all the people that henceforward and forever they no more with lamentations sadden the souls of the departed in the islands of the blessed do not lay such heavy burdens in the graves of those you bury not such weight of furs and wampum not such weight of pots and kettles for the spirits faint beneath them only give them food to carry only give them fire to light them four days is the spirits journey to the land of ghosts and shadows four its lonely night encampments four times must their fires be lighted therefore when the dead are buried let a fire as night approaches four times on the grave be kindled that the soul upon its journey may not lack the cheerful firelight may not grope about in darkness farewell noble hiawatha we have put you to the trial to the proof have put your patience by the insult of our presence by the outrage of our actions we have found you great and noble fail not in the greater trial faint not in the harder struggle when they ceased a sudden darkness fell and filled the silent wigwam hiawatha heard a rustle as of garments trailing by him heard the curtain of the doorway lifted by a hand he saw not felt the cold breath of the night air for a moment saw the starlight but he saw the ghosts no longer saw no more the wandering spirits from the kingdom of ponemah from the land of the hereafter xx the famine o the long and dreary winter o the cold and cruel winter ever thicker thicker thicker froze the ice on lake and river ever deeper deeper deeper fell the snow oer all the landscape fell the covering snow and drifted through the forest round the village hardly from his buried wigwam could the hunter force a passage with his mittens and his snowshoes vainly walked he through the forest sought for bird or beast and found none saw no track of deer or rabbit in the snow beheld no footprints in the ghastly gleaming forest fell and could not rise from weakness perished there from cold and hunger o the famine and the fever o the wasting of the famine o the blasting of the fever o the wailing of the children o the anguish of the women all the earth was sick and famished hungry was the air around them hungry was the sky above them and the hungry stars in heaven like the eyes of wolves glared at them into hiawathas wigwam came two other guests as silent as the ghosts were and as gloomy waited not to be invited did not parley at the doorway sat there without word of welcome in the seat of laughing water looked with haggard eyes and hollow at the face of laughing water and the foremost said behold me i am famine bukadawin and the other said behold me i am fever ahkosewin and the lovely minnehaha shuddered as they looked upon her shuddered at the words they uttered lay down on her bed in silence hid her face but made no answer lay there trembling freezing burning at the looks they cast upon her at the fearful words they uttered forth into the empty forest rushed the maddened hiawatha in his heart was deadly sorrow in his face a stony firmness on his brow the sweat of anguish started but it froze and fell not wrapped in furs and armed for hunting with his mighty bow of ashtree with his quiver full of arrows with his mittens minjekahwun into the vast and vacant forest on his snowshoes strode he forward gitche manito the mighty cried he with his face uplifted in that bitter hour of anguish give your children food o father give us food or we must perish give me food for minnehaha for my dying minnehaha through the farresounding forest through the forest vast and vacant rang that cry of desolation but there came no other answer than the echo of his crying than the echo of the woodlands minnehaha minnehaha all day long roved hiawatha in that melancholy forest through the shadow of whose thickets in the pleasant days of summer of that neer forgotten summer he had brought his young wife homeward from the land of the dacotahs when the birds sang in the thickets and the streamlets laughed and glistened and the air was full of fragrance and the lovely laughing water said with voice that did not tremble i will follow you my husband in the wigwam with nokomis with those gloomy guests that watched her with the famine and the fever she was lying the beloved she the dying minnehaha hark she said i hear a rushing hear a roaring and a rushing hear the falls of minnehaha calling to me from a distance no my child said old nokomis tis the nightwind in the pinetrees look she said i see my father standing lonely at his doorway beckoning to me from his wigwam in the land of the dacotahs no my child said old nokomis tis the smoke that waves and beckons ah said she the eyes of pauguk glare upon me in the darkness i can feel his icy fingers clasping mine amid the darkness hiawatha hiawatha and the desolate hiawatha far away amid the forest miles away among the mountains heard that sudden cry of anguish heard the voice of minnehaha calling to him in the darkness hiawatha hiawatha over the snowfields waste and pathless under snowencumbered branches homeward hurried hiawatha emptyhanded heavyhearted heard nokomis moaning wailing wahonowin wahonowin would that i had perished for you would that i were dead as you are wahonowin wahonowin and he rushed into the wigwam saw the old nokomis slowly rocking to and fro and moaning saw his lovely minnehaha lying dead and cold before him and his bursting heart within him uttered such a cry of anguish that the forest moaned and shuddered that the very stars in heaven shook and trembled with his anguish then he sat down still and speechless on the bed of minnehaha at the feet of laughing water at those willing feet that never more would lightly run to meet him never more would lightly follow with both hands his face he covered seven long days and nights he sat there as if in a swoon he sat there speechless motionless unconscious of the daylight or the darkness then he buried minnehaha in the snow a grave they made her in the forest deep and darksome underneath the moaning hemlocks clothed her in her richest garments wrapped her in her robes of ermine covered her with snow like ermine thus they buried minnehaha and at night a fire was lighted on her grave four times was kindled for her soul upon its journey to the islands of the blessed from his doorway hiawatha saw it burning in the forest lighting up the gloomy hemlocks from his sleepless bed uprising from the bed of minnehaha stood and watched it at the doorway that it might not be extinguished might not leave her in the darkness farewell said he minnehaha farewell o my laughing water all my heart is buried with you all my thoughts go onward with you come not back again to labor come not back again to suffer where the famine and the fever wear the heart and waste the body soon my task will be completed soon your footsteps i shall follow to the islands of the blessed to the kingdom of ponemah to the land of the hereafter xxi the white mans foot in his lodge beside a river close beside a frozen river sat an old man sad and lonely white his hair was as a snowdrift dull and low his fire was burning and the old man shook and trembled folded in his waubewyon in his tattered white skinwrapper hearing nothing but the tempest as it roared along the forest seeing nothing but the snowstorm as it whirled and hissed and drifted all the coals were white with ashes and the fire was slowly dying as a young man walking lightly at the open doorway entered red with blood of youth his cheeks were soft his eyes as stars in springtime bound his forehead was with grasses bound and plumed with scented grasses on his lips a smile of beauty filling all the lodge with sunshine in his hand a bunch of blossoms filling all the lodge with sweetness ah my son exclaimed the old man happy are my eyes to see you sit here on the mat beside me sit here by the dying embers let us pass the night together tell me of your strange adventures of the lands where you have travelled i will tell you of my prowess of my many deeds of wonder from his pouch he drew his peacepipe very old and strangely fashioned made of red stone was the pipehead and the stem a reed with feathers filled the pipe with bark of willow placed a burning coal upon it gave it to his guest the stranger and began to speak in this wise when i blow my breath about me when i breathe upon the landscape motionless are all the rivers hard as stone becomes the water and the young man answered smiling when i blow my breath about me when i breathe upon the landscape flowers spring up oer all the meadows singing onward rush the rivers when i shake my hoary tresses said the old man darkly frowning all the land with snow is covered all the leaves from all the branches fall and fade and die and wither for i breathe and lo they are not from the waters and the marshes rise the wild goose and the heron fly away to distant regions for i speak and lo they are not and whereer my footsteps wander all the wild beasts of the forest hide themselves in holes and caverns and the earth becomes as flintstone when i shake my flowing ringlets said the young man softly laughing showers of rain fall warm and welcome plants lift up their heads rejoicing back unto their lakes and marshes come the wild goose and the heron homeward shoots the arrowy swallow sing the bluebird and the robin and whereer my footsteps wander all the meadows wave with blossoms all the woodlands ring with music all the trees are dark with foliage while they spake the night departed from the distant realms of wabun from his shining lodge of silver like a warrior robed and painted came the sun and said behold me gheezis the great sun behold me then the old mans tongue was speechless and the air grew warm and pleasant and upon the wigwam sweetly sang the bluebird and the robin and the stream began to murmur and a scent of growing grasses through the lodge was gently wafted and segwun the youthful stranger more distinctly in the daylight saw the icy face before him it was peboan the winter from his eyes the tears were flowing as from melting lakes the streamlets and his body shrank and dwindled as the shouting sun ascended till into the air it faded till into the ground it vanished and the young man saw before him on the hearthstone of the wigwam where the fire had smoked and smouldered saw the earliest flower of springtime saw the beauty of the springtime saw the miskodeed in blossom thus it was that in the northland after that unheardof coldness that intolerable winter came the spring with all its splendor all its birds and all its blossoms all its flowers and leaves and grasses sailing on the wind to northward flying in great flocks like arrows like huge arrows shot through heaven passed the swan the mahnahbezee speaking almost as a man speaks and in long lines waving bending like a bowstring snapped asunder came the white goose wawbewawa and the pairs or singly flying mahng the loon with clangorous pinions the blue heron the shuhshuhgah and the grouse the mushkodasa in the thickets and the meadows piped the bluebird the owaissa on the summit of the lodges sang the opechee the robin in the cover of the pinetrees cooed the pigeon the omemee and the sorrowing hiawatha speechless in his infinite sorrow heard their voices calling to him went forth from his gloomy doorway stood and gazed into the heaven gazed upon the earth and waters from his wanderings far to eastward from the regions of the morning from the shining land of wabun homeward now returned iagoo the great traveller the great boaster full of new and strange adventures marvels many and many wonders and the people of the village listened to him as he told them of his marvellous adventures laughing answered him in this wise ugh it is indeed iagoo no one else beholds such wonders he had seen he said a water bigger than the bigseawater broader than the gitche gumee bitter so that none could drink it at each other looked the warriors looked the women at each other smiled and said it cannot be so kaw they said it cannot be so oer it said he oer this water came a great canoe with pinions a canoe with wings came flying bigger than a grove of pinetrees taller than the tallest treetops and the old men and the women looked and tittered at each other kaw they said we dont believe it from its mouth he said to greet him came waywassimo the lightning came the thunder annemeekee and the warriors and the women laughed aloud at poor iagoo kaw they said what tales you tell us in it said he came a people in the great canoe with pinions came he said a hundred warriors painted white were all their faces and with hair their chins were covered and the warriors and the women laughed and shouted in derision like the ravens on the treetops like the crows upon the hemlocks kaw they said what lies you tell us do not think that we believe them only hiawatha laughed not but he gravely spake and answered to their jeering and their jesting true is all iagoo tells us i have seen it in a vision seen the great canoe with pinions seen the people with white faces seen the coming of this bearded people of the wooden vessel from the regions of the morning from the shining land of wabun gitche manito the mighty the great spirit the creator sends them hither on his errand sends them to us with his message wheresoeer they move before them swarms the stinging fly the ahmo swarms the bee the honeymaker wheresoeer they tread beneath them springs a flower unknown among us springs the whitemans foot in blossom let us welcome then the strangers hail them as our friends and brothers and the hearts right hand of friendship give them when they come to see us gitche manito the mighty said this to me in my vision i beheld too in that vision all the secrets of the future of the distant days that shall be i beheld the westward marches of the unknown crowded nations all the land was full of people restless struggling toiling striving speaking many tongues yet feeling but one heartbeat in their bosoms in the woodlands rang their axes smoked their towns in all the valleys over all the lakes and rivers rushed their great canoes of thunder then a darker drearier vision passed before me vague and cloudlike i beheld our nation scattered all forgetful of my counsels weakened warring with each other saw the remnants of our people sweeping westward wild and woeful like the cloudrack of a tempest like the withered leaves of autumn xxii hiawathas departure by the shore of gitche gumee by the shining bigseawater at the doorway of his wigwam in the pleasant summer morning hiawatha stood and waited all the air was full of freshness all the earth was bright and joyous and before him through the sunshine westward toward the neighboring forest passed in golden swarms the ahmo passed the bees the honeymakers burning singing in the sunshine bright above him shone the heavens level spread the lake before him from its bosom leaped the sturgeon sparkling flashing in the sunshine on its margin the great forest stood reflected in the water every treetop had its shadow motionless beneath the water from the brow of hiawatha gone was every trace of sorrow as the fog from off the water as the mist from off the meadow with a smile of joy and triumph with a look of exultation as of one who in a vision sees what is to be but is not stood and waited hiawatha toward the sun his hands were lifted both the palms spread out against it and between the parted fingers fell the sunshine on his features flecked with light his naked shoulders as it falls and flecks an oaktree through the rifted leaves and branches oer the water floating flying something in the hazy distance something in the mists of morning loomed and lifted from the water now seemed floating now seemed flying coming nearer nearer nearer was it shingebis the diver was it the pelican the shada or the heron the shuhshuhgah or the white goose wawbewawa with the water dripping flashing from its glossy neck and feathers it was neither goose nor diver neither pelican nor heron oer the water floating flying through the shining mist of morning but a birchcanoe with paddles rising sinking on the water dripping flashing in the sunshine and within it came a people from the distant land of wabun from the farthest realms of morning came the blackrobe chief the prophet he the priest of prayer the paleface with his guides and his companions and the noble hiawatha with his hands aloft extended held aloft in sign of welcome waited full of exultation till the birchcanoe with paddles grated on the shining pebbles stranded on the sandy margin till the blackrobe chief the paleface with the cross upon his bosom landed on the sandy margin then the joyous hiawatha cried aloud and spake in this wise beautiful is the sun o strangers when you come so far to see us all our town in peace awaits you all our doors stand open for you you shall enter all our wigwams for the hearts right hand we give you never bloomed the earth so gayly never shone the sun so brightly as today they shine and blossom when you come so far to see us never was our lake so tranquil nor so free from rocks and sandbars for your birchcanoe in passing has removed both rock and sandbar never before had our tobacco such a sweet and pleasant flavor never the broad leaves of our cornfields were so beautiful to look on as they seem to us this morning when you come so far to see us and the blackrobe chief made answer stammered in his speech a little speaking words yet unfamiliar peace be with you hiawatha peace be with you and your people peace of prayer and peace of pardon peace of christ and joy of mary then the generous hiawatha led the strangers to his wigwam seated them on skins of bison seated them on skins of ermine and the careful old nokomis brought them food in bowls of basswood water brought in birchen dippers and the calumet the peacepipe filled and lighted for their smoking all the old men of the village all the warriors of the nation all the jossakeeds the prophets the magicians the wabenos and the medicinemen the medas came to bid the strangers welcome it is well they said o brothers that you come so far to see us in a circle round the doorway with their pipes they sat in silence waiting to behold the strangers waiting to receive their message till the blackrobe chief the paleface from the wigwam came to greet them stammering in his speech a little speaking words yet unfamiliar it is well they said o brother when you come so far to see us then the blackrobe chief the prophet told his message to the people told the purport of his mission told them of the virgin mary and her blessed son the saviour how in distant lands and ages he had lived on earth as we do how he fasted prayed and labored how the jews the tribe accursed mocked him scourged him crucified him how he rose from where they laid him walked again with his disciples and ascended into heaven and the chiefs made answer saying we have listened to your message we have heard your words of wisdom we will think on what you tell us it is well for us o brothers that you come so far to see us illustration westward westward hiawatha sailed into the fiery sunset page then they rose up and departed each one homeward to his wigwam to the young men and the women told the story of the strangers whom the master of life had sent them from the shining land of wabun heavy with the heat and silence grew the afternoon of summer with a drowsy sound the forest whispered round the sultry wigwam with a sound of sleep the water rippled on the beach below it from the cornfields shrill and ceaseless sang the grasshopper pahpukkeena and the guests of hiawatha weary with the heat of summer slumbered in the sultry wigwam slowly oer the simmering landscape fell the evenings dusk and coolness and the long and level sunbeams shot their spears into the forest breaking through its shields of shadow rushed into each secret ambush searched each thicket dingle hollow still the guests of hiawatha slumbered in the silent wigwam from his place rose hiawatha bade farewell to old nokomis spake in whispers spake in this wise did not wake the guests that slumbered i am going o nokomis on a long and distant journey to the portals of the sunset to the regions of the homewind of the northwest wind keewaydin but these guests i leave behind me in your watch and ward i leave them see that never harm comes near them see that never fear molests them never danger nor suspicion never want of food or shelter in the lodge of hiawatha forth into the village went he bade farewell to all the warriors bade farewell to all the young men spake persuading spake in this wise i am going o my people on a long and distant journey many moons and many winters will have come and will have vanished ere i come again to see you but my guests i leave behind me listen to their words of wisdom listen to the truth they tell you for the master of life has sent them from the land of light and morning on the shore stood hiawatha turned and waved his hand at parting on the clear and luminous water launched his birchcanoe for sailing from the pebbles of the margin shoved it forth into the water whispered to it westward westward and with speed it darted forward and the evening sun descending set the clouds on fire with redness burned the broad sky like a prairie left upon the level water one long track and trail of splendor down whose stream as down a river westward westward hiawatha sailed into the fiery sunset sailed into the purple vapors sailed into the dusk of evening and the people from the margin watched him floating rising sinking till the birch canoe seemed lifted high into that sea of splendor till it sank into the vapors like the new moon slowly slowly sinking in the purple distance and they said farewell forever said farewell o hiawatha and the forests dark and lonely moved through all their depths of darkness sighed farewell o hiawatha and the waves upon the margin rising rippling on the pebbles sobbed farewell o hiawatha and the heron the shuhshuhgah from her haunts among the fenlands screamed farewell o hiawatha thus departed hiawatha hiawatha the beloved in the glory of the sunset in the purple mists of evening to the regions of the homewind of the northwest wind keewaydin to the islands of the blessed to the kingdom of ponemah to the land of the hereafter the end
