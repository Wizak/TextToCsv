flashman and the tiger george macdonald fraser served in the border regiment in burma during the war his autobiography quartered safe out here is held to be one of the great personal memoirs of the second world war and in the gordon highlanders he has worked on newspapers in britain and canada and has written many bestselling novels in addition to the eleven volumes of the flashman papers thousands of readers around the world have been delighted by the three volumes of stories about private mcauslan thoughtfully described as the biggest walking disaster to hit the british army since ancient pistol he has also written numerous films most notably the three musketeers the four musketeers and the james bond film octopussy when sir harry flashman vc the celebrated victorian soldier scoundrel amorist and selfconfessed poltroon began to write his memoirs early in the present century he set to work with a discipline remarkable in one whose life and conduct were to put it charitably haphazard and irregular disdaining chronology he adopted a random method selecting episodes in his adventurous life and shaping them into complete selfcontained narratives in the fashion of a novelist rather than an autobiographer this was of immense help to me when the flashman papers which were still unpublished at sir harrys death in turned up as a collection of packets in a teachest at a midlands saleroom in and were entrusted to me as editor by flashmans executor the late mr paget morrison of south africa in accordance with his strict instructions i dealt with the packets one at a time and found that thanks to sir harrys methodical approach only a minimum of editing correcting his occasional spelling mistakes and providing footnotes was necessary to render the work fit for publication each packet contained a book almost readymade and soon the public who until then had been aware of flashman only as the cowardly bully of thomas hughess tom browns schooldays were in possession of his illuminating and often scandalous accounts of the first afghan war the schleswigholstein question the africanamerican slave trade and the crimean war it was with the fifth packet that the pattern changed along with his account of the indian mutiny sir harry had enclosed a separate brief narrative on an entirely different subject which he plainly felt did not call for extended treatment since it was too short for separate publication and its inclusion with the mutiny memoir would have made for an unwieldy book i put it by hoping the later packets would yield similar fragments which with the first might make a full volume since then two other such pieces have come to light and the result is this collection of minor episodes in the career of an eminent if disreputable victorian one deals with a hithertounknown european crisis which but for flashman s reluctant intervention might well have advanced the outbreak of the first world war by three decades with incalculable consequences since it is by far the longest fragment presents a picture of a great monarch involves if only at a distance many leading statesmen of the time and finds flashman in alliance with the shade of an old adversary i have given it priority the second piece clears up at last one of the most puzzling mysteries of the victorian era the notorious baccarat scandal in which the prince of wales was an unhappy actor the third extract touches briefly on two of the most spectacular military actions of the century and sees flashman pitted against one of the great villains of the day and observing with his usual jaundiced eye two of its most famous heroes as this extract was the first to come to light more than twenty years ago and its known existence has caused some speculation among students of the papers i have given its title to the full volume gmf you dont know blowitz probably never heard of him even which is your good luck although i dare say if youd met him youd have thought him harmless enough i did to my cost not that i bear him a grudge much for he was a jolly little teetotum bursting with good intentions and you may say it wasnt his fault that they paved my road to hell which lay at the bottom of a saltmine and its only by the grace of god that i aint there yet entombed in everlasting rock damnable places and not at all what you might imagine not a grain of salt to be seen for one thing mind you when i say twasnt blowitzs fault im giving the little blighter the benefit of the doubt a thing i seldom do but i liked him you see in spite of his being a journalist tricky villains especially if they work for the times he was their correspondent in paris thirty years ago and doubtless a government agent show me the times man who wasnt from delane to the printers devils but whether he absolutely knew what he was about or was merely trying to do old flashy a couple of good turns i aint sure it was certainly his blasted pictures that led me astray photographs of two lovely women laid before my unsuspecting middleaged eyes one in tother in and between em they landed me in the strangest pickle of my misspent life not the worst perhaps but bad enough and deuced odd i dont think i understand the infernal business yet not altogether it had its compensations along the way though among them the highest decoration france can bestow the gratitude of two crowned heads the chance to serve otto bismarck a bad turn and the favours of that delightful little spanker mamselle caprice to say nothing of the enchanting iceberg princess kralta no i cant think too much ill of little blowitz at the end of the day he was reckoned the smartest newsman of the time better than billy russell even for while billy was the complete hand at dramatic description thin red streaks and all and the more disastrous the better blowitz was a human ferret with his plump little claw on every pulse from lisbon to the kremlin he knew everyone and everyone knew him and trusted him that was the great thing kings and chancellors confided in him empresses and grand duchesses whispered him their secrets prime ministers and ambassadors sought his advice and while he was up to every smoky dodge in his hunt for news he never broke a pledge or betrayed a confidence or so everyone said blowitz loudest of all i guess his appearance helped for he was nothing like the job at all being a fivefoot butterball with a beaming baby face behind a mighty moustache innocent blue eyes bald head and frightful whiskers a foot long chattering nineteen to the dozen gushing gallantly at the womenfolk nosing up to the elbows of the men like a deferential gun dog chuckling at every joke first with all the gossip a prime favourite at every paris party and reception and never missing a word or a look or a gesture all of it grist to his astounding memory let him hear a speech or read a paper and he could repeat it pat every word like macaulay aye and when the great crises came and all europe was agog for news of the latest treaty or rumour of war or collapsing ministry it was to the times paris telegrams they looked for blowitz was a past master at what the yankee scribblers call the scoop at the famous congress of berlin when the doors were locked for secret session bismarck looked under the table and when disraeli asked him what was up bismarck said he wanted to be sure blowitz wasnt there a great compliment you may say and if you dont blowitz did frequently it was through billy russell who you may know was also a times man and an old chum from india and the crimea that i met this tubby prodigy at the time of the francoprussian farce in and wed taken to each other straight off at least blowitz had taken to me as folk often do god help em and i didnt mind him he was a comic little card and amused me with his froggy bounce and tall tales about how hed scuppered the commune uprising in marseilles in by leaping from rooftop to rooftop to telegraph some vital news or other to paris while the communards raged helpless below and saved some fascinating balkan queen and her beautiful daughter from shame and ruin at the hands of a vengeful monarch and been kidnapped when he was six and fallen in love with a flashingeyed gypsy infant with a locket round her neck sounded deuced like the bohemian girl to me but he swore it was gospel and part of his destiny which was a great bee in his bonnet you ask what if i had slipped from those marseilles roofs and been dashed to pieces on the cruel cobbles or torn asunder by those ensanguined terrorists cries he swigging champagne and waving a pudgy finger what you say if that vengeful monarchs agents had entrapped me moi blowitz what if the gypsy kidnappers had taken another road and so eluded pursuit ah you ask yourself these things cher arree i dont do anything o the sort you know but you do of a certainty cries he i see it in your eye the burning question you consider you speculate you what you wonder would have become of blowitz or of france or the times by example he inflated looking solemn or europe search me old blowhard says i rescuing the bottle all i ask is whether you got to grips with that fascinating balkan bint and her beauteous daughter and if so did you tackle em in tandem or one after tother but he was too flown with his fatheaded philosophy to listen i did not slip me i could not i foiled the vengeful monarchs ruffians it was inevitable my gypsy abductors took the road determined by fate he was quite rosy with triumph le destin my old one destiny is immutable we are like the planets our courses preordained some of us he admitted are comets vanishing and reappearing like the geniuses of the past thus moses is reflected in confucius caesar in napoleon attila in peter the great jeanne darc in in florence nightingale or does it have to be a frog well then madame du barry jeanne darc is yet to reappear perhaps but you are not serious my boy you doubt my reason oh yes you do but i tell you everything moves by a fixed law and those of us who would master our destinies he tapped a fat finger on my knee we learn to divine the intentions of the supreme will which directs us ye dont say one jump ahead of the almighty who are you reincarnating by the way baron munchausen he sat back chortling twirling his moustache oh arree arree you are incorrigible well i shall submit no more to your scepticism meprisant your dйrision anglaise you laugh when i tell you that in our moment of first meeting i knew that our fates were bound together regard this man i thought he is part of your destiny it is so we are bound i blowitz in whom tacitus lives again and you ah but of whom shall i say you are a reflection murat perhaps your own prince rupert some great beau sabreur surely he twinkled at me or would it please you if i named the chevalier de seignalt whos he when hes at home in italy they called him casanova aha that marches you see yourself in the part well well laugh as you please we are destined you and i youll see mon ami oh youll see he had me weighed up no error and knew that on my infrequent visits to paris which is a greasy sort of sink not much better than port moresby the chief reason i sought him out was because he was my passport to society salons and the company of the female gamebirds with whom the city abounds and i dont mean your poxedup opera tarts and cancan girls but the quality traffic of the smart hotels and embassy parties whose languid ennui conceals more carnal knowledge than youd find in babylon my advice to young chaps is to never mind the moulin rouge and pigalle but make for some diplomatic mкlйe on the rue de lisbonne catch the eye of a wellfleshed countess and ere the nights out youll have learned something you wont want to tell your grandchildren in spite of looking like a plum duff on legs blowitz had an extraordinary gift of attracting the best of em like flies to a jampot no doubt they thought him a harmless buffoon and he made them laugh and flattered them something monstrous and to be sure he had the stalwart flashy in tow which was no disadvantage though i say it myself i suppose you could say he pimped for me in a way but dont imagine for a moment that i despised him or failed to detect the hard core inside the jolly little flaneur i always respect a man whos good at his work and i bore in mind the story that blowitz had made his start in france by paying court to his employers wife and the pair of them had heaved the unfortunate cuckold into marseilles harbour from a pleasureboat left him to drown and trotted off to the altar yes i could credit that another story undoubtedly true was that when the times in his early days on the paper were thinking of sacking him he invited the manager to dinner and there at the table was every great power ambassador in paris that convinced the times as well it might so there you have m henri stefan oppertblowitz and if ive told you a deal about him and his crackpot notions of our shared destiny its because they were at the root of the whole crazy business and dam near cost me my life as well as preventing a great european war which will happen eventually mark my words if this squirt of a kaiser aint put firmly in his place if i were asquith id have the little swine took off sudden plenty of chaps would do it for ten thou and a snug billet in the colonies afterwards but thats common sense not politics you see that by the way it was at the back end of that the unlikely pair of blowitz and sam grant late president of the united states put me on the road to disaster and in the most innocentseeming way like all retired yankee bigwigs sam was visiting the mother country as the first stage of a grand tour which meant he being who he was that instead of being allowed to goggle at westminster and windermere in peace he must endure adulation on every hand receiving presentations and the freedom of cities having fat aldermen and provosts pump his fin which he hated of all things listening to endless boring addresses and having to speechify in turn with crowds huzzaing wherever he went the nobility lionising him in their lordly way and being beset by admiring females from liverpool laundresses to the great white mother herself ulysses s grant never called for help in his life but just then i seemed to catch a glimpse within the masterful commander and veteran statesman of the thinskinned scotch yokel from the ohio tanyard uneasily adrift in an old sosuperior world which hed have liked to despise but couldnt help feeling in awe of no doubt windsor and buck house had been ordeal enough and now the prospect of standing tonguetied before the french president and a parcel of courtly supercilious frogs had unmanned him to the point where he was prepared to regard me as a friendly face of course i agreed straight off in my best toadymanly style id never have dared say no to grant at any time and i wouldnt have missed watching him and macmahon in a state of mutual bewilderment for all the tea in china so there i was a few weeks later in a gilded salon of the elysee when grant wearing his most amiable expression which would have frightened geronimo was presented to the great marshal a grizzled old hero with a leery look and eyebrows which matched his moustache for luxuriance a sort of grant with garlic he was they glowered at each other and bowed and glowered some more before shaking hands with sam plainly ready to leap away at the first hint of an embrace after which silence fell and i was just wondering if i should tell macmahon that grant was stricken speechless by the warmth of his welcome when madame macmahon god bless her inquired in english if wed had a good crossing she was still a charmer at sixty and sam was so captivated in relief that he absolutely talked to her which left old macmahon standing like a blank file blowitz who as usual was to the fore among the attendant dignitaries and crawlers came promptly to the rescue introducing me to the marshal as an old companioninarms sort of both of us having served in crimea this seemed to cheer the old fellow up ah i was that flashman of balaclava was i and id done time in the legion etrangиre also had i why he was an old algeria hand himself we both had sand in our boots nestce pas hoho well this was formidable to meet in an english soldier of all people a vieille moustache who had woken to the cry of au jus and marched to the sausage music blowitz said that wasnt the half of it le colonel flashman had been a distinguished ally of france in china montauban would never have got to pekin without me macmahon was astonished hed had no notion well there werent many of us left decidedly we must become better acquainted the usual humbug though gratifying but pregnant of great effects as the lady novelists put it for early in the following may long after grant had gone home and i was pursuing my placid way in london i was dumfounded by a letter from the french ambassador informing me that the president of the republic in recognition of my occasional services to france wished to confer on me the legion of honour well bless the dear little snaileaters thinks i for while ive collected a fair bit of undeserved tinware in my time you cant have too much of it you know i didnt suspect it but this was blowitz at work taking advantage of my meeting with old macmahon to serve ends of his own the little snake had discovered a use for me and decided to put me in his debt didnt know flash too well did he at all events hed dropped in macmahon s ear the suggestion that i was ripe for a frog decoration and macmahon was all for it apparently so back to paris i went in my best togs had the order hung round my unworthy neck received the marshals whiskery embrace and was borne off to voisins by blowitz to celebrate and be reminded that i owed my latest glorification to him and our shared destiny what joy compares itself to advancing the fortunes of an old friend to whom one is linked by fate beams he tucking his napkin under his several chins and diving into his soup for in serving him do i not serve myself thats my modest old blow says i what dye want ah sceptique did i speak of obligation then it is true i hope to interest you in a small affair of mine oh but an affair after your own heart i think and to our mutual advantage but first let us do honour to the table champagne my boy so i waited while he gorged his way through half a dozen overblown courses why the french must clart decent grub with glutinous sauces beats me and when the waiters had cleared and we were at the brandy and cigars he sighed with repletion patted his guts and fished a mounted picture from his pocket it is a most amusing intrigue this says he and presented it with a flourish voila im rather a connoisseur of photography and there was a quality about the present specimen which took my attention at once it may have been the opulence of the setting or the delicacy of the handcolouring or the careful composition which had placed two gigantic blackamoors with loincloths and scimitars among the potted palms or the playful inclusion of the parakeet and tiny monkey on either side of the oriental couch on which lounged a lovely odalisque clad only in gold turban and anklefetters her slender body arched to promote jutting young bumpers which plainly needed no support her lips parted in a sneer which promised unimaginable depravities a caption read la petite caprice well it was a change from froufrou i tore my eyes away from the potted palms a mite puzzled as ive said blowitz had put me in the way of society gallops but never a professional trиs appйtissante non says he i tossed it back to him which convent is she advertising he clucked indignantly she is not what you suppose this is a theatrical picture made when she was employed at the folies from necessity let me tell you to finance her studies serious studies such pictures are de rigueur for a folies comedienne well i could see she hated posing for it would it surprise you says he severely to learn that she is a trained criminologist speaks fluently four languages rides fences and shoots and is a valued member of the dйpartement secret of the ministry of the interior at present in our berlin embassy where i was influential in placing her ah you stare do i interest you my friend she might if she was on hand but since she aint and posing for lewd pictures belies her stainless purity did i say that no no my boy she is no demimondaine la belle caprice but she is a woman of the world let us say that is why she is in berlin and whats she to do with this small affair after my own heart to our mutual advantage he sat back lacing his tubby fingers across his pot as i recall you were at one time intimate with the german chancellor prince bismarck but that you hold him in no affection i choked on my brandy thankee for the dinner and the legion of honour old blow says i preparing to rise i dont know where youre leading but if its to do with him i can tell you that i wouldnt go near the squareheaded bastard with the whole household brigade but my friend be calm i beg resume the seat if you please it is not necessary that you go near his highness no such thing he figures only how shall i say at a distance thats too bloody close i assured him but he protested that i must hear him out our destinies were linked he insisted and he would not dream of a proposal distasteful to me death of his life quite the reverse indeed so i sat down and put myself right with a brandy mention of bismarck always unmans me but the fact was i was curious not least about the delectable mamselle caprice eh bien says blowitz and leaned forward plainly bursting to unfold his mystery you are aware that in a few weeks time a great conference is to take place at berlin of all the powers to amend this ridiculous treaty of san stefano made by russia and turkey i must have looked blank for he blew out his cheeks at least you know they have recently been at war in the balkans absolutely says i there was talk of us having a second crimea with the moujiks but i gather thats blown over as for san stefano did you say greek to me old son he shook his head in despair you have heard of the big bulgaria surely not even of the little un he seemed ready to weep or the sanjak of novi bazar watch your tongue if you please were in a public place incroyable he threw up his hands and it is an educated englishman this widely travelled and of a military reputation europe may hang on the brink of catastrophe and you he smote his fat forehead my dear arree will you tell me then what events of news you have remarked of late well lets see our income tax went up tuppence baccy and dog licences too some woman or other has sailed round the world in a yacht he was going pink so just to give him his moneys worth i added elspeths bought one of these phonographs that are all the rage oh aye and gilbert and sullivan have a new piece and dam good too the jolliest tunes i am an englishman behold me as you were just saying enough he breathed heavily i see i must undertake your political education surlechamp gilbert and sullivan mon dieu and since he did and ill lay odds that you dear reader know no more about big bulgaria and tother thing than i did ill set it out as briefly as can be its a hellish bore like all diplomaticking but youd best hear about it and then you can hold your own with the wiseacres at the club or teatable first off the balkans you have to understand that theyre full of people whod much rather massacre each other than not and their turkish rulers were incapable of controlling things what with the disgusting inhabitants forever revolting and russia and austria trying to horn in for their own base ends by and large we were sympathetic to the turks not because we liked the brutes but because we feared russian expansion towards the mediterranean at the same time we were forever nagging the turks to be less monstrous to their balkan subjects with little success turks being what they are and when around the bulgars revolted and the turks slaughtered of them to show who was master gladstone got in a fearful bait and made his famous remark about the turks clearing out bag and baggage he had to sing a different tune when the russians invaded ottoman territory and handed the turks a handsome licking we couldnt have ivan lording it in the balkans and for a time it looked as though wed have to tackle the great bear again we sent warships to the dardanelles and indian regiments to malta but the crisis passed when russia and turkey made peace with the san stefano treaty see flashman at the charge the trouble was that this treaty created what was called big bulgaria which would clearly be a russian province and steppingstone to the mediterranean and the suez canal the austrians with their own ambitions in the balkans were also leery of russia so to keep the peace bismarck the honest broker called the congress of berlin to amend san stefano to everyones satisfaction if possible everyone will be there tout le monde blowitz was fairly gleaming with excitement prince bismarck will preside with your lord salisbury and lord beaconsfield as we must learn to call m disraeli haymerle and andrassy from austria desprez and waddington from france gorchakov and shuvalov from russia oh and so many more from turkey and italy and germany it will be the greatest conference of the powers since the congress of vienna with the fate of europe the world even at stake i could see it was just his meat but what i wondered did it have to do with me he became confidential blowing garlic at me a new treaty will emerge the negotiations will be of the most secret no word of what passes behind those closed doors will be permitted to escape until the new treaty is published no doubt by prince bismarck himself his voice sank to a whisper it will be the greatest news story of the century my friend and the correspondent who obtains it beforehand will be hailed as the first journalist of the world the round rosy face was set like stone and the blue eyes were innocent no longer the times will have that story first alone exclusive his finger rapped the table on each word and i thought aye you could have heaved your wifes former husband into the drink no error then he sat back beaming again more brandy my boy got an embassy earwig have you how much are you paying him he winked like a conspiring cherub better than any earwig dear arree i shall have the entrйe to the mind of one of the principal parties and he will not even know it he glanced about furtively in case bismarck was hiding behind an icebucket the russian ambassador to london count peter shuvalov will be second only to prince gorchakov in his countrys del egation he is an amiable and experienced diplomat and the most dedicated lecher in the entire corps diplomatique oh but a satyr i assure you who consumes women as you do cigars and with a mistress who knows how to engage his senses he is oh qui ne sen fait pas how do you say in english easygoing prйcisйment easygoing to the point of indiscretion i could give numerous instances names which would startle you gad you get about ever thought of writing your recollections youd make a mint he waved it aside now this congress will dance like any other and it is inevitable that m shuvalov will encounter at a party the opera perhaps on his evening promenade on the friederichstrasse the enchanting mamselle caprice of the french embassy what then i will tell you he will be captivated he will pursue he will overtake and his enjoyment of her charms will be equalled only by the solace he will find in describing the labours of the day to such a sympathetic listener i know him believe me he sipped a satisfied chartreuse and i know her no doubt she will be the adoring ingйnue and m shuvalov will leak like an old samovar i had to admire him crafty little halfpint aint you though here give us another squint a t that picture by jove lucky old shoveloff but hold on blow she may romp each days doings out of him but she cant get you the treaty word for word and thats what you want surely mais certainement am i an amateur then no i absorb her reports by the day and only when all is concluded and the treaty is being drafted do i approach a certain minister who holds me in some esteem i make it plain that i am au fait with the entire negotiation he is aghast you know it all he cries a matter of course i reply with modesty and now i await only the text of the treaty itself he is amazed but convinced this blowitz he tells himself is a wizard and from that cher arree says he smiling smugly it is but a short step to the point where he gives me the treaty himself oh it is a technique i assure you which never fails its true enough theres no surer way of getting a secret than by letting on you know it already but i still couldnt see why he was telling me because one thing only is lacking it is out of the question that caprice should communicate with me directly for i shall be jealously observed at all times not only by competitors but by diplomatic eyes possibly even by the police it is the price of being blowitz he shrugged then dropped his voice so it is vital that i have what you call a gobetween nestce pas so that was it and before i could open my mouth let alone demur his paw was on my sleeve and he was pattering like a yankee snakeoil drummer arree it can only be you i knew it from the first have i not said our fates are linked to whom then should i turn for help in the greatest coup of my career and it will be without inconvenience indeed to your satisfaction rather so thats why you wangled me the order of the frog wangle what is this wangle oh my best of friends that was a bagatelle but this what i beg of you ah it imports to me beyond anything in the world and i would trust no other my destiny our destiny would forbid it you will not fail blowitz when folk yearn and sweat at me simultaneous i take stock well now i dont know blow shall i give you reasons one i shall be forever in your debt two my coup will enrage prince bismarck that pleases eh and three he smirked like a lascivious buddha you will make the acquaintance the intimate acquaintance of the delicious mamselle caprice at that it wasnt half bad it was safe and i could picture bismarcks apoplexy if his precious treaty was published before he could make his own pompous proclamation i took another slant at the photograph lying between us splendid potted palms they were and while her pose of wanton invitation might be only theatrical as blowitz had said i couldnt believe she wasnt enjoying her work well what would i have to do dyou know the little villain had already reserved me a berlin hotel room for the duration of the conference confidence in destiny no doubt it is in the name of jansen dutch or belgian as you prefer but not i think english he had it all pat i would rendezvous with caprice at her apartment near the french embassy and there in the small hours of each morning when she had sent shuvalov on his exhausted way she would give me her reports writ small on rice paper each day you and i will lunch separately and without recognition of course at the kaiserhof where i shall be staying you will have concealed mamselles report in the lining of your hat which you will hang on the rack at the diningroom door when we go our respective ways i shall take your hat and you mine this kind of intrigue was just nuts to him plainly they will be identical in appearance and i have already ascertained that our sizes are much the same we repeat the performance each day eh voila it is done in secrecy the most perfect well my boy does it march the only snag i could see was being first wicket down with the lady after shed endured the attentions of blasted shoveloff and would be intent on writing her reports happy thought being a mere diplomat his performance might well leave her gnawing her pretty knuckles for some real boudoir athletics in which case the reports could wait until after breakfast well if id had any sense or an inkling of what lay years ahead or been less flown with voisins arrack id have given the business the goby but you know me the promise of that photograph and the thought of dear otto smashing the chandelier in his wrath were too much for my ardent boyish nature and it never hurts to do the press a good turn so it was with a light heart and my hat on three hairs that i found myself strolling under the famous lime trees to the brandenburg thor a few weeks later taking a long slant at the thier garten in the june sunshine and marvelling at the valkyrian proportions of german women which awoke memories of my youthful grapplings with that blubbery baroness in munich pechsomething her name was a great whale of a woman with an appetite to match that had been thirty years ago and i hadnt visited germany since with good reason when youve been entrapped kidnapped forced to impersonate royalty shanghaied into marriage halfhung by danish bandits crossed swords in dungeons with fiends like rudi von starnberg drowned near as dammit and been bilked of a fortune well bognor for a holiday dont look so bad thank god it was far behind me now rudi was dead and lovely lola and even bismarck had probably given up murder in favour of war not that hed done much in that line for a few years mellowing with age like enough still id steer well clear of their congress otto aside id no wish to have disraeli inveigling me into a game of vingtetunt nor had i any great desire to do berlin it may have the finest palaces in germany and the broadest streets which is capital if you enjoy miles of ornamented stucco and dont mind tumbling into drains which are mostly uncovered but it also has the disadvantage of being full of germans most of em military they say theres a garrison of and it seemed to me the whole kitboodle of em were on unter den linden sentries presenting arms at every door and the pavements infested by swaggering junkers with plumed helmets and clanking medals still full of prussian bounce because theyd licked the frogs eight years before as though that mattered the congress was to begin on the th and it was on the evening of the th that i left my modest hotel on the tauben strasse and walked the short distance to the discreet pleasant little court off the jager strasse where mamselle had her apartment both of us quietly tucked away but convenient for unter den linden and the wilhelmstrasse where the congress was to sit blowitz had fixed the time and primed her his note awaiting me at my hotel had hinted delicately that she knew i wasnt a puritan exactly and would expect to be paid in kind for my services so i was in excellent fettle as i knocked at her door my one doubt was that being used to coupling for her country she might be a dutiful icicle see royal flash t see flash for freedom with one eye on the clock and her mind elsewhere in which case id just have to jolly the sparkle into her eyes i neednt have fretted it was there from the first in the mouthwatering vision who opened the door determined to practise her art on flashy like all good actresses shed decided exactly how to play her part and dressed according in a dйshabillй of frothy black lace clinging to a petite hourglass shape which recalled the maharani jeendan of intoxicating memory without her turban her hair showed light auburn cut in a fetching schoolgirl fringe above a lovely impudent face whose smile of invitation would have melted torquemada for an instant it faded on hen jansen only to return as i made my gallant bow oh pardon she exclaimed i was expecting someone much older mamselle says i saluting her dainty fingertips you and i will get along famously may i return the compliment by saying that your photograph dont do you justice ah that photograph she made a pretty moue and rolled her eyes how i blushed to see it outside the theatre but now it has its uses non she didnt wink but her voice did and her smile as she closed the door and looked me up and down was pure sauce stefan tells me it brought you to berlin oui stefan has a reputation for accuracy oui says i and now that the courtesies had been observed and she was french anyway i slipped my hands under her delectable stern hoisted her up and kissed her soundly she gave a muffled squeak for forms sake before thrusting her tongue between my lips but just as i was casting about for a convenient settee she disengaged giggling and said i must put her down and we should have an aperitif and then i must explain something to her no explanation necessary growls i but she wriggled clear rolling her rump and checking my pursuit with a shaken finger and if youd seen that bouncy little bundle pouting mischievous reproof and absolutely crying nonnonlala like the maid in a french farce youd have been torn between bulling her on the spot and brushing away a sentimental tear i did neither i enjoy a good performance as well as the next licentious rascal and never mind playing waitabit with a coquette who knows her business so i sat on the couch while she filled two glasses pledged me with a flashing smile and then sauntered artlessly into the sunlight from the window to give me the benefit of her transparent nйgligйe there followed as eccentric a conversation as i can recall and ive been tкteatкte with mangas colorado apache remember and the lunatic leader of the taiping rebellion mamselle you are comfortable eh bien you must rest quietly a moment and be courtois what you call proper correct until you have explained what i wish to know flashy good as gold fire away m so tell me then what is so tres amusant about that f good god its punch one of last months m if i am to be perfect in english i must understand your humour nestce pas so instruct me if you

question ah but only one these words above this article what do they mean f hankey pankey i knew it bigod you understand punchs beastly jokes as well as i do dont you well just for that young woman i shant tell you what hankeypankey means ill show you afterwards as i lay blissfully tuckered with that splendid young body astride of me moist and golden in the fading sunlight her eyes closed in a satisfied smirk i found myself wondering idly if the french secret service ran an ecole de galop to train their female agents in the gentle art of houghmagandie as elspeth calls it and if so were there any vacancies for visiting professors anyway mamselle caprice must have been the messalina prizewoman of her year no demimondaine perhaps according to blowitz but as expert an amateur as id ever struck with the priceless gift of fairly revelling in her sex and using it with joyous abandon and considerable calculation as i was about to learn she stretched across to the nearby table for a gilttipped cigarette lighting it from a tiny spirit lamp and i couldnt resist another clutch at those firm pointed poonts overhead she squirmed her bottom in polite response trickling smoke down her shapely nostrils as she studied me head on one side then she leaned down murmuring in my ear if you were count shuvalov would you be ready to confide in me now she gave a little chuckle and nibbled ill be damned been using me for net practice have you i couldnt help laughing experimenting on me you little trollop of all the sauce why not says the shameless baggage sitting up again and drawing on her scented weed if i am to learn his secrets it is well i should know what beguiles men of his age after all you and he are no longer boys but mature possibly of similar tastes a couple of ageing libertines you mean well thankee my dear im obliged to you as im sure count shoveloff will be and if you pay him the kind of loving attention youve just shown me i dare say hell be sufficiently captivated to gas his fat head off oh he is captivate already says she airily he has admired the notorious photograph and we have met and he has begged an assignation for tomorrow night has he now thats brisk work highly professional too by blowitz by the french secret department certainly by the brazen little bitch sitting cool as a trout athwart my hawse sporting her boobies and blowing smokerings while she mused cheerfully on how best to squeeze the juice out of her russian prey you see says she to captivate to seduce is nothing he is only a man she gave the little shrug that is the frenchwomans way of spitting on the pavement but afterwards to make him tell what i wish to know ah that is another thing which is why i ask you who are experienced in secret affairs blowitz says you know well these russians you have made the intrigues you have made love to many many women and i am sure they have how do you say practised their nets on you she smiled sleepy seductivelike and leaned down again to flicker the tip of her tongue against my lips so tell me which of them most appealed to win your confidence the fool the taskmistress the slave lingйnue or perhaps la petite farceuse who teases you with foolish jokes and then she wriggled stroking her bouncers across my chest to which would you tell your secrets my youve studied your subject havent you i eased her gently upright well the answer my artful little seductress is to none of em unless i wanted to but i aint shoveloff remember from what i hear hes the kind of vain ass who cant resist showing off to every pretty woman he meets so it dont matter a rap whether you play the innocent or delilah or gretchen the governess get him halftipsy pleasure him blind and listen to him blather but dont try to come round him with jokes from punch cos theyd be lost on him tease him with a few funny bits from tolstoy if you like or the latest wheezes from ivan the terribles guffawgraph oh idiot she slapped me smartly on the midriff giggling you are not serious you i ask advice and you make game of me advice my eye mocking a poor old man more like old ha exclaims she rolling her eyes she could pay a neat compliment the minx as if there was anything i could teach you about bewitching a man i can pay a compliment too she gave a complacent toss of the head arms akimbo oh one can always learn from a wise teacher i think says she assuming the depraved sneer she had worn in her photograph that since i do not like m shuvalov i should prefer to be gretchen the governess trиs implacable sans remords she made growling noises flourishing an imaginary whip ah well we shall see and now she hopped nimbly down i make supper which she did very tasty an omelette that was like a souffle for lightness with toast and a cold moselle fruits soaked in kirsch and coffee arabi style black as night sweet as love hot as hell listening to her cheery prattle and bubbling laughter across the table i found myself warming to mamselle caprice and not only cos she was a little stunner and rode like a starving succubus and cooked rather well i liked her style no humbug just jezebel with a sassy twinkle and a fifthform fringe lightly touched by the crazy gods as many politicals are georgie broadfoot was daft as a brush in her case it might have been a mask a brass front over inner hurt she was in a dirty business and no doubt her male colleagues being proper little christian crooks would make it plain that they regarded her as no better than a whore i did myself but i wasnt fool enough to damp her amorous ardour by showing it but no twasnt a mask as we talked i recognised her as one of these fortunate critters who are simply without shame and wouldnt know conscience if they tripped over it in broad day she was fairly gloating at the prospect of wringing shuvalov dry for the sheer fun of it and the handsome fee blowitz had promised her a hundred golden pounds cries she gleefully you see it is not a secret department matter but personal to stefan and his paper and since he has friends in high places behold i am in berlin and thats all that matters to me my little punchfancier says i nuzzling her neck as we repaired to the couch as an asian princess once said to me lick up the honey stranger and ask no questions an asian princess she clapped her hands ah but i must hear of this was she beautiful did you carry her off were you her slave and so on so i told her all about ko dalis dreadful daughter and how shed rescued me from a russian dungeon and filled me with hasheesh unawares and dam near had me blown to bits and was surpassingly beautiful but bald as an egg whether she believed me god knows but she demanded particulars of a most intimate nature inviting comparison between the silk one and herself and that inevitably led to another glorious thrashingmatch which restored her amourpropre and left me in what i once heard a french naval officer describe as a condition of swoon only when i was taking my leave did we return to the subject of shuvalov his assignation with her was for eight the following evening after the first day of the congress and she expected to have him off the premises by midnight whereafter i would roll up to see that all was well she would write her report and we would enjoy a late supper and whatever else came to mind before i left with her despatch in my hat for transfer to blowitz later in the day she hadnt counted on shoveloffs appetite for jollity though the clocks were chiming twelve when i sauntered up the jager strasse in the warm dark of the next night and turned into her court only to see that her curtain was still closed the signal wed agreed if the russian buffoon was still infesting her quarters i took a turn up and down thankful that it wasnt winter berlin in june evidently went home with the milk and there were open carriages carrying merrymakers up the mauer strasse to the linden sounds of gaiety and music came from the prinz carl palace across the way and beyond it i could see lights burning in the great ministries on the wilhelmstrasse understrappers of the congress still hard at it while their betters waltzed and junketed aye and rogered away the diplomatic night if shuvalov was anything to go by it was close on two and i was in a fine fume when a cloaked and tilehatted figure emerged at last from caprices court taking the width of the pavement damn him and a moment later i was being admitted to her apartment by a furious hareem houri clad only in a gold turban with a slavefetter on one ankle fairly spitting blood while she filled an antique bathtub with hot water the air was thick with steam and gallic oaths which i hadnt heard outside a legion barrackroom count shuvalov she informed me was a sacred perverted beast a savage and a mackerel and a swine of tastes indescribable he professed to have been so enraptured by her photograph that he had brought the turban and shackles for her to wear describing himself as haroun alraschid and demanding from her an arabian nights performance which i doubt even dick burton had ever heard of he had also insisted that they smear each other all over with quince jam to which he was partial and while much of it had been removed in the ensuing frolic i noticed that she still had a tendency to attract fluff and other light debris as she raged to and from the kitchen with hot kettles for her bath and for a hundred pounds i endure this cries she kicking her fettered foot and fetching herself a crack on the shin with the chain ah merde it will not come off and i shall never be clean again oh but it is not only this disgusting confiture this this ordure collant but his loathsome touch his foul body and vile breath his hideous tongue upon me ugh muscovite ape oh do not look at me i cannot bear to be seen in fact she looked adorable if you can imagine an alma tadema beauty striking passionate poses while picking feathers off her bottom i soothed her by undoing the anklechain lifting her into the bath and lovingly soaping her from head to foot while murmuring endearments im a dab hand at this having trained under queen ranavalona so to speak and after a while her plaintive cursing gave way to little sighs and whimpers her eyes closed and her mouth trembled and when i suggested i could do with a sluicing myself she responded with an enthusiasm that would have done credit to those poor little kashmiri sluts who bathed me so devotedly at lahore the night the ceiling fell in aye ive wallowed in some odd spots in my time but nowhere more happily than berlin with that delightful mermaid performing as though shoveloff had never existed and the floor ankledeep in suds heaven knows what the charwoman had to say in the morning it cheered caprice up no end and by the time wed dried off and drowsed a little and made an early breakfast of coffee and rolls she was her vivacious self again even making fun of shoveloffs amorous peculiarities her first report for blowitz was a brief one the galloping cossack having been too intent on his muttons for much conversation but having taken his measure she was sure she could make him sing in due course a shallow fool mais pompeux and his brain is in his was her charming verdict also he is jealous of his leader the prince gorchakov she lowered an eyelid let me touch that key and he will boast everything he knows and i guess he did having sampled her myself and marked her al at flashys id still wondered if she could keep shuvalov in thrall for the whole congress it lasted a month you know but damme if she didnt not that he saddled her up every night see flashman and the mountain of light you understand but more often than not and whether she was ringing the changes pride o the hareem one night gretchen the governess the next or was tempting him with different flavours of jam i didnt inquire she kept him happy i had my ration of her and for the rest blowitzs arrangements went like clockwork there he was every day browsing at the kaiserhof while i lunched at tother side of the room never a glance between us and each picking up the others tile when we left we had one scare when an idiot diner by mistake went off with my hat containing caprices report my first thought was oh lor were rumbled and i was ready to make for the long grass till i saw that blowitz was on the qv but instead of leaping up with screams of ah voleur rendez le chapeau as youd expect from a bohemian frog he quietly despatched a waiter in pursuit the apologetic diner replaced my roof on its peg and no attention had been drawn to blowitz or to me my opinion of little fat stefan went up another rung he was a cool hand and even it seemed to me sometimes a reckless one it was about halfway through the congress when the other correspondents were all in a frenzy at the absolute lack of news from the secret sessions that he broke cover with an item that was plainly from the horses mouth gorchakov had made some speech in camera and there was the gist of it in the times two days later diplomatic berlin was in uproar at once who could have leaked the news it was after this that bismarck who took the breach as a personal affront looked under the table to see if blowitz was roosting there his fury was even greater soon after when the times had the news that disraeli had threatened to leave berlin over some wrangle that had arisen and then decided to stay after all of course the blabberer in both cases had been shuvalov as i learned from caprice who had passed the glad tidings on to blowitz via my tile i was fearful that shoveloff might twig he was being milked but she pouf ed it away he was too dull and besotted to know what he was saying after shed put him over the jumps and depend upon it says she stefan knew what he was about she was right too the little fox had been angling like every other scribbler for an interview with bismarck and after the column about dizzy appeared hanged if he didnt get one otto you see was so piqued and mystified that his precious congress was being blown upon that he invited blowitz to dinner no doubt hoping to learn what his source had been fat chance blowitz came away with a fivehour interview leaving the iron chancellor none the wiser and fit to be tied the times triumphed yet again and the rest of the press gang could only gnash their teeth what between helping to spoil bismarcks digestion and whiling away the golden afternoons with caprice i was in pretty bobbish form and took to promenading about the town in search of amusement i didnt find it on one day at least when chance took me down the wilhelmstrasse past the congress hall and who should i meet face to face but dear otto himself he was with a group of his bagcarriers and other reptiles coming down the steps to his carriage and for one bloodfreezing instant our eyes met as they had not done since that day at tarlenheim thirty years before when hed launched me unsuspecting into his ghastly strackenz murder plot id never have recognised him if i hadnt seen his mug in the papers for the nasty young norse god had turned into a jowly sausagefaced old buffer whose head seemed to grow straight out of his collar without benefit of neck just for a second he stared and i thought bigod he remembers me but there aint a thing he can do so why dont i exclaim well otto old sport there you are then drowned any danish princelings lately its the kind of momentary madness that sometimes takes me but thank god i tipped my tile instead he did likewise frowning and a moment later he was clambering aboard and i was legging it in search of a gallon or two of brandy quite a turn hed given me but then he always did bad medicine bismarck bad man i kept clear of the official cantonment thereafter and by the last week of the congress was beginning to be infernally bored even with caprice when i found myself knocking at her door in the expectation of having it opened by elspeth smiling blonde and beautiful i realised it was time for the train home oddly enough if id cut out then it wouldnt have mattered for blowitz no longer needed her reports although he continued to change hats with me at the kaiserhof the fact was his stock had risen so high with his three scoops that he was being fed information by the bushel the embassy fawns being anxious to stand well with him he even put it about very confidentiallike that bismarck had promised to give him the treaty before it was published which wasnt true but made them toadeat him harder than ever i knew nothing of this of course and on the penultimate day of the congress a friday as i was strolling home enjoying the morning after a strenuous late breakfast with caprice i was taken flat aback by blowitzs moon face goggling at me from the window of a drosky drawn up near my hotel in in hisses he whipping down the blind so i climbed aboard demanding what the devil was up and before i was seated he was hammering on the roof and bawling to the coachee to make for the station with all speed we leave on the for cologne cries he fear not your bill is paid and your baggage awaits at the train the dooce it does but the congress dont end till tomorrow let it end when it will it is imperative that i leave berlin at once that i am seen to leave mortified and en colиre he was red with excitement and beaming regardezmoi do i look sufficiently enraged then you sound sufficiently barmy but what about the treaty i thought twasnt to be finished until this evening he pulled back the lapel of his coat chuckling whipped out a bulky document waved it at me and thrust it away again a treaty of sixtyfour articles approved printed fini what dyou say to that my boy nothing remains but the preamble and a few extra clauses to be adopted at todays session he rubbed his hands squirming with delight it is done dear friend it is done blowitz triumphs he is exalted ah and you my brave one my accomplice extraordinary i could embrace you keep your dam distance look here if youve got the thing what are you in such an infernal hurry for he smote his forehead ah forgive me in my joy i go too fast let me explain he was licking his lips at his own cleverness you remember i told you in paris how i would persuade some diplomat of eminence to give me an advance copy of the treaty eh bien this morning i received it i rejoice knowing that no other journalist will see the treaty until after the signing ceremony tomorrow but in the meantime a crisis has raised itself since my interview with prince bismarck the german press has been in jealous agitation and to pacify them he has let it be known that he will give them the treaty this evening when i learn this i am thunderstruck he assumed a look of horror of what use to me to have the treaty in my pocket if it is to appear in the berlin journals tomorrow where then is my exclusive account my priority over my rivals down the drain id say so why are you exalted because i see at once how to frustrate them i go to prince hohenlohe the german minister and demand that as a reward for my services to the congress and because i am blowitz prince bismarck should give the treaty only to me so that i may publish it in the times tomorrow hohenlohe consults bismarck who refuses he says i must wait until it is signed but he raised a pudgy finger i know bismarck he is one for strict justice having said i must wait until tomorrow he will now make the german papers wait also so in effect i have gained a postponement you see i dont know if macchiavelli was a fat little cove with long whiskers but he should have been when prince hohenlohe tells me my request is refused i play my part i am affronted my disgust knows no bounds i tell him i am leaving berlin at once in protest if blowitz is to be treated with such contempt they may keep their congress and their treaty hohenlohe is dismayed but i am adamant i take my leave in what you call the dudgeon and word flies from mouth to mouth that blowitz is beaten that he sulks like a spoiled child my rivals rejoice at my failure and breathe sighs of relief and all the time the treaty is here he tapped his breast chortling and tomorrow it will appear in the times and in no other paper in the world he paused to draw breath and gloat you never saw smugness like it so i pointed to the one fly i saw in his ointment but you havent got the preamble or the clauses theyre adopting today he gave a lofty wave soit tranquil my arree from hohenlohe i go tout suite to m de st vallier the french ambassador who i know has a copy of the preamble in confidence i show him the treaty he is staggered he goes pale but when i ask for the preamble and clauses he throws up the hands crying why not since already i have so much he cannot give me his copy of the preamble but he reads it aloud page upon page and now it is here he tapped his brow and will be dictated to my secretary after we board the train i aint given to expressions of admiration as you know but looking at that grinning cherub with his baby peepers and daft whiskers i confess i put a finger to my hat brim though i still dont see why youre in such an almighty sweat to leave cant you telegraph your story to london from berlin oh my boy you want to laugh where my every action is watched my movements followed why let a telegraph clerk catch a glimpse of my message and i should be in a police cell he grew earnest but it is not the authorities i fear it is envious rivals my little charade of pique will deceive the many but not all some knowing blowitz will suspect me still they may board the train they would rob me if they could that says he clapping a hand on my knee is why i bring you with me i am small you are large who knows what they may attempt between here and paris but what have i to fear cries he with a great idiot laugh when the bravest soldier of the british army the partner of my fate is by my side a great deal i could have told him if bismarcks bullies were after him hed find himself relying on the communication cord but no that wasnt likely even otto wouldnt dare blowitzs brother journalists were another matter as i saw when we reached the station and they were on the platform to see him off with covert grins and ironic tiledoffing i hadnt realised what respect and jealousy my stout friend attracted he bustled down the train looking like an angry frog in his great fur coat and felt hat ignoring their greetings and i played up by taking his arm and wearing my most threatening scowl the secretary and blowitzs colleague wallace were already aboard and when we pulled out punctually on blowitz told the secretary to get out his book folded his hands across his paunch closed his eyes and recited steadily for half an hour it was fearful stuff all in german with an occasional phrase in french or english by way of explanation and he didnt even pause once when the train clanked to an unexpected halt and we were almost jolted from our seats he forged light ahead with his dictation and when it was done he sat drooping like a limp doll and then went straight off to sleep for concentration and power of mind i dont recall his equal sure enough there were fellows from the other papers on the train wallace spotted two germans and an italian in the next carriage but once one of em had tried to look in on us and id sent him about his business they let us alone they followed us when we alighted for refreshment at cologne but we baffled em by each taking a different way back to the train so that they had to separate one dogging blowitz another behind me the third after the secretary and no one at all to watch wallace who was lurking in the wc with treaty preamble and all inside his shirt until the time came for him to board another train to brussels where he would telegraph the whole thing to london wallace had wondered if the belgians would accept such an important document blowitz told him that if there was any difficulty he was to send for the superintendent tell him the times was thinking of setting up a daily line to london and that this despatch was by way of a test of course if brussels didnt want the businessnuff said so next morning saturday july before the leading statesmen of europe had even penned their signatures to the treaty otto bismarck was goggling apoplectically at a telegram from london informing him that the whole sixtyfour articles preamble etc were in that days times with an english translation talk about a scoop blowitz was drunk with glory conceit and gratitude when i managed to tear myself from his blubbering embrace in paris and i wasnt displeased myself tisnt every day you play a part in one of the great journalistic coups and whenever i see some curmudgeon at the club cursing at the labour of cutting open his times and then complaining that theres no news in the dam thing i think aye you should see what goes to the making of those paragraphs that you take for granted my boy my one regret as i tooled back to london was that i hadnt been able to bid a riotous farewell to caprice shed been worth the trip neer mind spoking ottos wheel and i found myself smiling fondly as i thought of punch and the gauzy lace clinging to that houri shape in the sunlight ah well there would doubtless be more where that came from in case you dont know the great berlin treaty panned out to general satisfaction for the time being anyway big bulgaria was cut in two roumania youll be charmed to learn became independent austria won the right to occupy bosnia and herzogovina russia got bessarabia wherever that may be the turks remained a power in the balkans more or less and by some strange sleight of hand we managed to collar cyprus there had been a move at one stage to invite my old comrade william tecumseh sherman the yankee general to become prince of bulgaria but nothing came of it pity he was the kind of savage whod have suited the bulgars like nuts in may at all events what they call a balance was achieved and everyone agreed that bismarck had played a captains innings hoch hoch und hes ein jolly good fellow so he ought to have been content but i can tell you something that wasnt suspected at the time and has been known to only a handful since the congress left darling otto an obsessed man its gods truth the brute was bedevilled by the galling fact that little blowitz had stolen a march on him and he could not figure out how it had been done astonishing eh here was the greatest statesman of the age whod just settled the peace of europe for a generation and more and still that trifle haunted him over the years perhaps twas the affront to his dignity or his passion for detail but he couldnt rest until he knew how blowitz had got hold of that treaty how do i know you may ask well im about to tell you and im not sure that bismarcks mania wasnt the strangest part of the adventure that befell me five years later and which had its origins in my meetings with grant and macmahon caprices picture and the congress of berlin the trouble with a reputation like mine is that youre bound to live up to it its damnably unfair take general binks or colonel snooks trueblue military muttonheads brave as bedamned athirst for glory doing their dutiful asinine bit in half a dozen campaigns but never truly catching the public eye and at last selling out and retiring from obscurity to cheltenham with a couple of wounds and barely enough to pay the club subscription foot the memsahibs whist bill send adolphus to a crammer cos the wellington fees are beyond them and afford a drunken loafer to neglect the garden of ramilles or quatre bras or whatever they choose to call their infernal villas thats snooks and binks profitable labour to the grave and no one notices and then take flashy born poltroon and wastrel pitchforked against his will into the selfsame expeditions and battles scared out of his wits but surviving by shirking turning tail pretence betrayal and hiding behind better men and emerging at the end o the day by blind luck and astonishing footwork with a vc knighthood a string of foreign decorations as long as rileys crime sheet a bloody fortune in the bank and a name and fame for derringdo thats the talk of the empire well now flash old son says you thats compensation surely for all the horrors unmanfully endured and dont forget that along the road youve had enough assorted trollop to fill chelsea barracks with an annexe at aldershot and elspeth the most undeserved benefit of all furthermore youve walked with the great ones of the earth enjoy the admiring acquaintance of your gracious queen and half a dozen other royalties and presidents to say nothing of ministers and other prominent rabble and are blessed with grandlings and greatgrandlings too numerous to count so what the devil have you to complain of heavens man binks and snooks would give their right arms for onefiftieth of your glory and loot and youve never been found out a few leery looks here and there but no lasting blemishes much so chubbarao flashy and count yourself lucky well i do damned lucky but theres been a price to pay and i dont mean in terror and agony and suffering not at all my cavil is that having bought it cruel hard i wasnt left to enjoy it in peace like binks and snooks they could run up to town to get their hair cut and drop in at the club at a moment of national crisis and no one paid them any heed much less expected em to race round to horse guards applying to be let loose against the ashantis or the dervishes or whatever other blooddrinking heathen were cayoodling round the imperial outposts retired gone to grass out of reckoning absolutely that was colonel snooks and general binks ah but flashy was a different bag of biltong altogether let some daft fakir start a rising in a godforsaken corner you never heard of or the british lions tail be tweaked anywhere between shanghai and sudan and some journalistic busybody would be sure to recall that twas in that very neck of the woods that the gallant flashy hector of afghanistan defender of pipers fort leader of the light brigade won his spurs or saved the day or committed some equally spectacular folly the hour demands the man and who better to uphold britannias honour in her present need than the valiant veteran of lucknow and balaclava and so forth they were never rash enough to suggest i should have command but seemed to have in mind some auxiliary post of slaughterergeneral as befitting my desperate reputation not that the hapenny press matters but the united service and pall mall do with their raised eyebrows and faintly critical astonishment ah flashman lamentable business in egypt what be quiet goin with wolseley i dare say no you surprise me dash it you can see them thinking man of his reputation prime of life dont he know his duty good god if id had the belly of binks or snookss gout id not be thought of but when youve a lancer figure and barely a touch of grey in your whiskers and the renown of bayard youre expected to be clamouring for service and when your sovereign lady regards you popeyed over the teacups with a bland i expect dear sir harry that you will be accompanying sir garnet to egypt you can hardly remind her that youre past sixty and disinclined especially when the idiot you married in an evil hour is assuring her majesty that youre champing at the bit all round its a case of no show without flashy and before you can say godhelpus youre in the desert listening to cock o the north and trying to look as though youre itching to come to grips with twice your weight in angry niggers it is i repeat damnably unfair and by the autumn of id had enough of it in the five years since ottos congress id been well in the public eye chiefly because of my supposed heroics in south africa in a place id have shunned like the plague but for elspeths insatiable fondness for money as if old morrisons million wasnt enough without bothering her empty head over her cousins supposed mine then in there had been the egyptian garboil i mentioned a moment ago joe wolseley had asked for me pointblank and with the press applauding and the queen approving and elspeth bursting into tears as i rogered her farewell what the blazes could i do but fall in in the event it wasnt the worst campaign ive seen not by a mile at least it was short we only went in with great reluctance to help the khedive quell his rebellious army who were slaughtering christians and vowing to drive all foreigners from the country bad news for our suez canal investors and our lifeline to india joe brought em to heel smartly enough at telelkebir where the kilties massacred everything in sight and my only bad scare was when i found myself perforce charging with the tin bellies at kassassin but by gallantly turning aside to help baker russell when his horse was shot and so arriving when the golliwog infantry were already taking to their heels i missed the worst of it cursing my bad luck and baker for holding me up a good glare and loud roar sabre in hand work wonders joe said id been an inspiration to the household riders and wanted me to stay on at cairo but i muttered that he didnt need me now that peace was breaking out and his staff wallopers grinned at each other and said wasnt that old flashy just i was mighty glad to be home by christmas of i can tell you for while egypt was quiet enough by then i could guess it was liable to be hot enough presently and not just with the sun after wed brought the khedives troops back to their allegiance the idea was that wed withdraw but that was all my eye for down south in the sudan the war drums were already beating with the maniac mahdi stirring up the fuzzywuzzies in a great jihad to conquer the world with egypt first on the list hell of a place the sudan all rock and sand and thorn and the most monstrous savages in creation charley gordon my china acquaintance had governed it in the s and spent most of his time poring over the scriptures and chasing slavers before retiring to palestine to watch rocks and contemplate the infinite mad as a cut snake he was but the sudan had gone to pot entirely after he left and was now going to need attention from guess who from the khedives army led by soldiers of the queen that was who whether gladstone liked it or not and i was shot if i was going to be one of em so i came home along of joe and bimbashi stewart and others having served my turn but would you believe it in when that immortal ass hicks was given command of the khedives army half of whom had been our enemies a few months earlier and told to deal with the sudan there were those at horse guards with the brazen cheek to suggest that i should go out again to serve on his staff since he was my junior i was able to scotch that flat but when word came in september that hed gone off mahdihunting at last blowed if one of the gutter rags didnt come out with a leaderette regretting that the task has fallen to an officer of comparative inexperience while such distinguished soldiers as lord wolseley majorgeneral gordon and sir harry flashman men thoroughly familiar with the country and the enemy remain at home or unemployed it was the mention of gordons name more than my own that brought the sweat out on my brow for while no one in his senses would suggest that i should replace hicks there was a strong shave in the clubs that cracked charley would be recalled and given the job and i knew that if he was flashy would be the first hed want to enlist china had given him the misguided notion that i was the devils own fireeater and just the chap to have on hand when fuzzy charged the square well soldiering under joe wolseley had been bad enough but at least he was sane gordon id as soon go to war with the town drunk the man wasnt safe sticking forks in people and scattering tracts from railway carriages and accosting perfect strangers to see if theyd met jesus lately i ask you no a holiday abroad was indicated before the mad sapper came recruiting and id just reached that conclusion when blowitzs letter bearing that fateful second photograph landed on the breakfast table it couldnt have come more pat this is what he wrote with more underlinings and points of admiration than elspeth at her worst not times style at all dearest friend i write to you by royal command what do you think of that it is true a princess no less and such a princess plus belle et elegant whose most ardent desire is to meet the gallant and renowned sir hf for reasons which i shall explain when we meet come to paris no later than october the fourth my dear harry i promise you will be enchanted and oblige your best of friends and loyal comrade in destiny stefan b ps recalling your interest in photography i enclose a portrait of her royal highness a bientфt well wasnt this the ticket elspeth was in scotland enduring her sisters and here was the ideal billet where i could lurk incog while gordon beat the bushes and enjoy some good carnal amusement to judge from the photograph not that her highness was an outstanding beauty but her picture grew on me as i studied it it showed a tall imposing female standing proud in a splendid gown of state a coronet on her piled blonde hair one gloved hand resting on the arm of a throne the other holding a plumed fan the sash of a jewelled order over her bare shoulders and enough bijouterie disposed about her stately person to start a bazaar she was in profile surveying the distance with a chilling contempt which sat perfectly on a rather horsy face with a curved highbridged nose minor mittel european royalty to the life with the same stenchinthenostrils look as my darling little irma of strackenz but nowhere near as pretty striking though and there were promising signs shed be about forty and properly saddlebroken with the full mouth and drooping lower lip which betoken a hearty appetite and a remarkable wasp waist between a fine full rump and upper works which would have made miss marie lloyd look positively elfin i could imagine stripping her down and watching her arrogance diminish with each departing garment and she had an ardent desire to meet the gallant sir hf i reached for bradshaw reading the letter again later it struck me that there was something familiar about it an echo of the past which i couldnt place until a couple of days later the afternoon of october the third to be precise when i was ensconced in my smoker on the continental mail express and suddenly i knew what id been reminded of that doomladen summons that had taken me to lola montez in munich oh so long ago there was the same slightly eccentric wording and the purport was uncannily similar an invitation from an exotic titled woman of mystery for reasons unstated with a strong hint of fleshly pleasures in prospect and what besides in lolas case there had been a nightmare of terror intrigue imposture and deadly danger from which id barely escaped with my life oh but that had been a bismarck plot in the bad old days this was jolly little blowitz and a doubtless spoiled and jaded piece of aristocracy in search of novelty and excitement but how had she heard of me and why was i worth fetching across the channel odd that and for no reason i remembered rudi starnbergs voice across the years she brought me all the way from hungary and found myself shivering and why no later than october the fourth aye odd but not fishy surely its the curse of a white liver that it has you starting at shadows imagining perils where none exist on tother hand its been a useful storm signal over the years and it was still at work ever so little when we pulled into the gare du nord at the sight of blowitz on the platform my cares dissolved he was a trifle plumper in the cheek a shade greyer in the whisker but still the same joyful little bonhomme rolling forward waving his cane with glad cries fairly leaping up to embrace me and dam near butting me under the chin chattering nineteen to the dozen as he led me out to a fiacre and not letting me get a word in until we were seated at the selfsame table in voisins when he had to leave off to attend to the maitre i couldnt help grinning at him across the table he looked so confounded cheery well its famous to see you again old blow says i when hed ordered and filled our glasses heres to you and to this mysterious lady now who is she and what does she want he drank and wiped his whiskers businesslike the princess kralta but of blood the most ancient in europe descended from stefan bathory arnulf of carinthia barbarossa name whom you will she is de la royaute la plus royale and landless as the best monarchs are but rich to judge from the state she keeps oh and received everywhere on terms with the highest she is befriended of the german emperor for example and he shot me a quizzy look of our old acquaintance prince bismarck nonono he added hastily her intimacy with him is of a how shall i say of an unconventional kind ive met some of his unconventional intimates and i didnt take to em a bit if shes one of his she is not one of anyones i mention bismarck only because when i first met the princess she brought me a friendly message from him cest vrai absolument can you guess what it was that he bears me no ill will for my activities at the congress of berlin he shook his head chuckling can you believe it eh no and neither will you if youve any sense that bastard never forgave or forgot in his life very well neer mind him what more about this princess is she married its always best to know beforehand there is a husband he shrugged but he does not figure uhhuh so what does she want with me he gave a little snort of laughter what do women ever want with you ah but there is something else also he leaned forward to whisper looking droll she wishes to know a secret a secret that she believes only you can tell her he sat back as the food arrived with a cautioning gesture in case i made some indiscreet outcry i suppose since i knew the little blighters delight in mysterious hints i just waded into the grub you do not ask what it is he grumbled ah but of course le flegme britannique never mind you will raise a brow when you hear i promise and i did for i never heard an unlikelier tale in my life all of it true for i saw it confirmed in the little blighters memoirs a few years ago and why should he lie to posterity but even at the time i believed it because being a crook myself i can spot a straight tongue and blowitz had one hed met the princess kralta at a diplomatic dinner and plainly fallen head over heels as he often did in his harmless romantic way and she had equally plainly given him every encouragement you have seen her likeness but believe me it tells you nothing how to describe her her magnetisme the light of charm in those great blue eyes the little toss of her silky blonde hair as she smiles revealing the brilliancy of her small teeth you found her portrait forbidding non my friend when you see those queenly features melt into the tenderest of expressions the animation of her darting glances the melodious quality of her voice ah mais ravissante whoa steady lad mind the cutlery liked her did you my friend i was enchanted he sighed like a ruptured poodle i confess it i who have encountered the charms of the loveliest women in europe that the princess kralta wove a spell about me and it is not only her person that allures her exquisite elegance her divinity of shape and movement aye shes well titted out i noticed but the beauty of her nature her frank friendliness and ease of deportment the candour of her confidences he babbled through the next two courses but dont suppose that i despised his raptures there are women like that and as often as not theyre not the ones of perfect feature angie burdettcoutts was no radiant looker but shed have caused a riot in the college of cardinals simply by walking by whereas the empress of austria of whom more presently was perfection of face and figure and quite as exciting as a plate of mashed turnip id seen enough of la kralta in her picture to believe that she might well have the magic february face or no shed gone out of her way to captivate blowitz over a period of months doing him little kindnesses making friends with his wife and trusting him with her most intimate confidences which is the surest way a woman has of getting a man under her dainty thumb once or twice she spoke of the berlin congress and bismarcks curiosity as to how blowitz had got his scoop it had irritated otto that he couldnt fathom that and hed told her he was determined to find out some day indeed my friend says blowitz to me as he plunged into his dessert she confessed to me that she had promised the prince she would use all her womanly wiles to wring the secret from me i admired her honesty in admitting as much but assured her that i never under any persuasion betray my sources she laughed and told me playfully that she would continue to try to beguile the truth from me and did she succeed no but i was content that she should try one does nothing to discourage the attention of a lady of such fascination i am not vain of my attractions sighs he glancing ruefully at the balding little tub with ghastly whiskers reflected in the long glass on voisins wall and i know when i am being how would you say worked upon i enjoy it and my affection and regard for the lady are not diminished rather they increase as she continues to confide in me with a candour which suggests that her friendship and interest in me are true and not merely assumed listen and judge for yourself and he launched into a piece of scandal which id have said no woman in her right mind would have confided to a journalist not if she valued her reputation as presumably this kralta female did yet shed confessed it says blowitz to convince him how deeply she trusted him this was her story shed been staying at some fashionable spa where the german emperor an amiable dotard with whom as blowitz had said she was on friendly terms had sent for her in great agitation would she do him a favour a service to the state and to the peace of the world at your service majesty says loyal kralta the emperor had then confessed that he was damnably worried about bismarck the chancellor was in a distracted state nervous irritable complaining about everyone suspicious that the great powers were plotting mischief against germany moody obstinate and off his oats entirely even now he was alone on his estate sunk in the brooding dumps and unless something was done hed go to pieces altogether international complications possibly even war would follow what otto needed to set him to rights said the emperor was an amusement something to divert him from vexatious affairs of state and princess kralta was just the girl to provide it she must visit bismarcks estate in perfect secrecy taking only her maid and enough clothing for a weeks stay anonymous agents would drive her to the station put her in a reserved compartment meet her arrange delivery of her luggage and take care of all expenses her husband would have been got out of the way before her departure the emperor would send him to berlin on a mission which would keep him there until after kralta had returned to the spa no word of her visit must be spoken the emperors part must never be mentioned blowitz paused she agreed without hesitation hold on there says i are you telling me that the german emperor the allhighest kaiser of the fatherland pimped for otto bismarck get away with you i am telling you says blowitz primly precisely what the princess told me no more no less cest tout well dammit what shes saying is that she was sent where schonhausen to grind otto into a good humour i do not know grind and she did not mention schonhausen may i continue oh pray do im all attention she goes to bismarck he asks did the emperor send you she says he did not and that she has come to see how such a great man will receive a giddy little person who ventures into the lions solitude those were her very words to me the chancellor laughs hopes it will not be a short visit and then says blowitz pokerfaced assists her to unpack her frills and furbelows her own words again expressing gay amusement as he does so ile shrugged and sat back helping himself to brandy well come on man what else did she tell you only that at the end of her visit the chancellor saw her to her landau saying i have been delighted to forget the affairs of the world for a time the princess returns to her wateringplace her husband is summoned back from berlin and the emperor thanks her joyfully for saving the peace of europe blowitz swilled and sniffed his brandy and that my boy is all the ladys tale well ill be damned thats one you wouldnt send to the times dyou believe her without doubt what woman would invent such a story also i know when i am being deceived i didnt disbelieve it myself although the emperors part took a little swallowing and yet if he truly believed that a weeks rogering with a royal flashtail would put otto in trim and keep the ship of state on a smooth course why not bismarck would be all for it hed been the town bull around schonhausen in his young days and would be just as randy in his sixties well it was an interesting piece of gossip and confirmed that the haughty princess kralta was partial to mutton come to think of it blowitz had a gift for encountering females who were patriotic riders hadnt he just and of introducing em to me bless him well well i returned to the point which had suddenly become clear to me well blow im grateful to you for rehearsing the ladys character for me says i very instructive possibly useful of course i went on carelessly the secret which she believes she can learn only from me is the one that bismarcks dying to know how you got the berlin treaty in advance thats it aint it for once he was taken flat aback his blue eyes popped his jaw dropped and then he burst out laughing oh but you should have been a journalist cries he and i hoped to amaze you with my denouement how did you guess come now what other secret do i have that she could want to know but if youre willing to let her have it why not tell her yourself i nearly added that he could have charged her a delightful price for it but i knew that wasnt his style odd fish blowitz ready and willing to put me in the way of fleshly delights as hed shown in the past but strict chapel himself he regarded me seriously i shall tell you says he slowly the princesss confession to me of her visit to prince bismarck moved me deeply en fait she was saying to me here is my trust ma confiance my honour as a woman i place it in your hands blowitz oh my dear arree quel geste what trust what proof of devoted affection so help me he was starting to pipe his eye from such a woman so worldly so intelligent so sensible it could not fail to awaken in me emotions of gratitude and obligation it gave her the right to demand from me an equal proof of my friendship my trust in her you my friend will see that i know well i didnt in fact but i aint a besotted bohemian he sighed long and solemn like an old horse farting when she renews her request that i divulge my secret i feel i can no longer refuse it means much to her since it will enable her to gratify prince bismarck and it can bring no harm to me i resolve then to tell her he took another gulp of brandy leaned towards me and became dramatic as though he were telling a ghost story in whispers we are in her salon seated upon a sofa that stands against a great mirror covering the wall behind us the salon is dim the curtains drawn the only light comes from a candelabrum on the table before us as i prepare to speak i see one of the candles flicker i am astonished all doors and windows are closed so whence comes this draught i move myself on the sofa and a zephyr from the direction of the minor fans my cheek what can it mean i ask myself and then i know you never saw such desperate bad acting hands raised eyes and mouth agog worse than irving hearing the bells then he glared like a mad marmoset one finger outthrust i realise i am the victim of treachery which i hate above all else in the world i closely scrutinise the mirror what do i see but that a gap has opened in the glass so one stands behind the mirror a witness to take down what i say i rise pointing to the flickering flame then to the cloven mirror just as the princess puts out a hand to remove the candlestick i address her in a voice which i vainly strive to render calm too late madame i cry i have understood she touches an electric button a door opens a butler enters and without a word the princess indicates to me the way to the door i bow i withdraw i leave the house he dried up there abruptly looking expectant so i said that after such a thrilling tale i was surprised that five masked chaps with stilettoes hadnt leaped on him in the hall he said stiffly that they hadnt and the mortification he felt at her duplicity had been keener than any stab wounds i said that i gathered he was still on terms with the lady though and he blew out his cheeks in resignation que voulezvous am i one to bear a grudge against a beautiful woman true our relationship cooled for a time until a few weeks ago in effect when she begged me to visit her and pleaded that the importance she had attached to learning my secret had made it imperative that she have a witness her contrition was expressed with such charm and sincerity that i forgave her at once and she then confessed that she had a favour to ask of me i had once told her had i not that among my friends i numbered the celebrated sir harry flashman i replied that you were my best of friends and she sighed oh such a sigh and cried out ah that hero what i would give to meet him i assured her that it could be arranged and then he twinkled mischievously it occurred to me that here was an opportunity to repay you cher arree for your great service to me in berlin it happens i told her that sir harry also possesses the secret of the congress treaty no doubt he could be persuaded to divulge it to one so charming as yourself my friend she was overjoyed and urged me to effect an introduction without delay he beamed at me stroking his whiskers you see my thought while i do not doubt your ability to captivate a lady who already holds you in the warmest regard it will do no harm if you are also in a position to answer a question to which she attaches such importance it will amuse you to be persuaded non i studied the innocentcunning face wondering subtle little devil aint you blow why are you so obliging you know how ill make her pay for the secret are you using me as a penance for her sins by any chance my dear friend ah but that is unkind when i have no thought but to amuse you oh perhaps i am also taking my little revenge on la grande princesse by making her a suppliant to one less foolishly sympathetic than blowitz but who knows he tittered it may end by amusing her also if you mean that shell find me a welcome change from otto bismarck im flattered says i and asked when id meet the lady he became mysterious again saying it would be for tomorrow night but wouldnt tell me where be patient my friend i wish your rendezvous to be a surprise what you call a treat my petit cadeau to you believe me it will be a most novel meetingplace oh but romantic you will be delighted i promise and i will have made you a trifling repayment towards the debt i owe you for berlin so i humoured him and agreed to be at my hotel the chatham the following evening with my valise all packed his mention of berlin had reminded me of caprice but he had not seen her in two years after the congress i heard of her in rome and vienna but nothing since and i do not inquire since i suppose her work is of a secret nature still ah but she had the true gift of intrigue la petite caprice decidedly she must marry an ambassador of promise then her talents will have full play eh looking back i guess blowitzs treat was a sight to see the first of anything usually is and the inauguration which took place in paris that sunday night was historic in a froggy sort of way if i wasnt unduly impressed blowitz himself was partly to blame one evening of his company was always about my limit and his enthusiasm for his petit cadeau was such that i was quite put off beforehand and a day spent loafing in the hotel hadnt raised my spirits the small unease that had been in my mind on the channel crossing had returned as it always does when i aint quite sure what im being pushed into or why and when blowitz collected me from the chatham as dusk was falling i was carrying a decided hump all the greater cos common sense told me id no reason for it blowitz was in a fine excitement greeting me exuberantly telling the cabby to make all haste to the place de strasbourg and parrying my inquiries with a waggishness which set my teeth on edge all would be revealed presently yes we had a small journey to our rendezvous with princess kralta but everything was arranged and i would be transported in more ways than one this with a hysterical giggle as he bounced up and down on his seat urging the driver to hurry i fought down an urge to kick the little chatterbox out of the cab and consoled myself with the thought i hat presently id be having my wicked way with that fine piece of blueblooded batter the vision of her imperious figurehead and strapping form had been in my mind all day competing with my vague unease and now that the reality was in prospect i was becoming a mite impatient shortly before seven we pulled up at the canopied entrance of the gare de lest blowitz clamouring for porters and hurrying me into the concourse so our small journey was to be by rail which meant i supposed that madames mansion lay in one of the fashionable districts outside the city the station seemed uncommon busy for a sunday night there was a great crowd milling under the electric lamps but blowitz bustled through like a tug before a liner flourishing a token and announcing himself with his usual pomposity to a bluecoated minion who conducted us through a barrier to a lesscrowded platform where knots of passengers and uniformed railway officials were waiting beside a train all eyes were turned to it and i have to say it looked uncommon smart and polished gleaming blue and gold under the lights but otherwise ordinary enough the steam hissing up from beneath the engine with that pungent railway smell the porters busy at the five long coaches on one of which the curtains were drawn back to reveal the glowing pink interior of a dining salon and yet there was an unwonted hush about the working porters an excitement among the throng watching from the barrier and an air of expectancy in the little groups on the platform blowitz stopped clutching at my arm and staring at the train like a child in a toy shop ah gaze upon it cries he is it not the train of trains the ultimate lapogee le dernier cri of travel oh my boy who was the genius who said let the country build the railway and the railway will build the country and not only a country now a continent a world he flourished a hand behold that which will be called the monarch of the rails as it prepares for its first journey he turned to beam up at me his eyes glistening moistly yes this is my surprise my treat my petit cadeau to you dearest of friends to be one of the select band who will be the pioneers on this historic voyage you and i arree and a mere handful of others we alone will share this experience the envy of generations of travellers yet to come the first to ride upon the magic carpet of the steel highway lexpress orient the name meant nothing then since this was only the inception of what i suppose is now the most famous train on earth and to be honest it still dont mean that much im a steamship man myself they dont rattle or jolt i dont mind the occasional heave and the feeling of being snug and safe appeals to my poltroon nature once aboard the world cant get at you and if danger threatens you can usually take to the boats or swim for it trains i regard as a necessary nuisance but with blowitz bouncing and pawing my sleeve i was bound to be civil well much obliged blow says i handsome of you it looks a capital train as trains go but how far is it going eh it didnt look district line exactly but my question was ignored capital as trains go squawks he flinging up his hands milles tornades this you say of the supreme train de luxe a veritable palace upon wheels the reassertion of privilege in travel why thanks to my good friend nagelmacker le haute monde may be carried to the ends of the continent in the luxury of the finest hotel sleeping and waking in apartments of elegance and comfort dining on the superb cuisine of a burgundian chef enjoying perfect service splendid wines everything of the best and all this he concluded triumphantly for two thousand miles from paris to constantinople in a mere ninety hours less than whats that you aint getting me to constantinople he crowed with laughter taking my arm to urge me forward no no that is for me not for you cher arree i travel on about my business which will be to seek interviews with ministers and crowned heads en route with a grand finale in constantinople where i hope to obtain audience of the sultan himself oh yes blowitz works while you he glanced roguishly from me to the train journey only as far as vienna in the company of royalty more agreeable by far aha that marches eh a day and a night in her charming company and then the city of the waltz the tokay of music and romance where you may dally together by the banks of the enchanted danube i managed to stem his cooks advertising at last you mean shes on the train he raised a finger glancing round and dropping his voice officially no the sleeping coach reserved for ladies will be unoccupied until vienna however he nodded towards one of the darkened coaches for such a distinguished passenger as her highness accommodation has been found and now my immovable englishman cries he grinning all over his fat cheeks you will tell me at last that you are glad you came to paris and that blowitzs little gift pleases you whatever i replied must have satisfied him for he bore me off to meet the other passengers all of whom seemed to know him but in fact i wasnt at all sure that i liked his petit cadeau id come to france to skulk and fornicate in peace not to travel on the other hand id never visited vienna which in those days was reckoned first among all the capitals of europe for immoral high jinks and a day and a night of luxurious seclusion with her highness should make for an amusing journey the last railroad rattle id enjoyed had been the voluptuous mrs popplewell on the baltimore line in and rare fun it had been until she pitched me off the train and i had to hightail it for dear life with the kuklos in hot pursuit still the three fates were unlikely to be operating in austria oh the blazes with it what was i fretting for so i exchanged courtesies with the others of whom i remember only the celebrated nagelmacker boss of the line who looked like a sicilian bandit but was all courtesy and a somethingorother effendi a fat beard from the turkish embassy there were various scribblers and a swarm of railway directors frog and belgique mostly making about two score all told and then there was a sudden bustle and we were being herded aboard with minions directing us to our compartments i remember blowitz and i were in number which seemed odd on such a small train and whistles were blowing and guards shouting and from our window we could see the mob at the barrier hurrahing and throwing up their hats and officials on the platform were waving and the carriage doors were closed crash crash crash a last whistle shrilled and then a strange silence fell over the gare de lest and i guess little blowitzs enthusiasm must have had its effect for i remember feeling a strange excitement as the train quivered ever so little the steam rushed hissing past our window there was a faint clank of buffers a gentle rumble of see flashman and the angel of the lord which recounts inter alia his adventures with the kuklos the forerunner of the infamous ku klux klan and its leaders who styled themselves atropos clotho and lachesis the three fates of mythology wheels beneath our feet and we were gliding away smoothly and ever so slowly the waving figures on the platform passing from sight in succession and then we were out of the station and i was thinking youve been in some odd vanguards flashy from the fortyniners to the light brigade and heres another for you and blowitz snapped shut his hunter and shook my hand gulping with emotion gad he was a sentimental little barrel sept heures et un prйcisйment says he reverently lexpress orient parti he was in a state of nonalcoholic intoxication if ever i saw one exclaiming in delight over every convenience and decoration in our cabin and inviting me to marvel at the fine upholstered furniture the glossy panelling the neatlyconcealed little basin in a corner by the door the array of lights and buttons the hidden cupboards and drawers the velvet curtains and the rest every second word of his babble was magnifique or superbe or merveilleux and once even tophole i declare and i couldnt deny that it was as it turned out my first journey on the orient express was to be my last but i remember it as the bestappointed train i ever struck and delighted blowitz by saying so you will find no more splendid accommodation in vienna cries he which reminds me you should stay at the golden lamb on the praterstrasse rather than the archduke charles give my name to herr hauptmann and you will receive every attention and his table is all that could be desired ah mais йcoutez even as i speak le diner est servi allons mettonsnous that was another score for the orient express we were hardly out of paris before we had the nosebags on and i have to concede that there was nothing wrong with the grub on offer in the opulent dining salon with its little pink shades and snowy cloths and silver and crystal and swift service blowitz almost burst into tears of gluttony at the sight of it and stuffed himself to ecstasy going into raptures at each arriving course and reproaching me for my apparent lack of appetite in fact i was sharpset but ate and drank in moderation for my mind was on the ladies sleepingcoach where i supposed la kralta would be dining in anonymous seclusion you dont want to be bloated when the charge is sounded the food and wine had its effect though my blues had vanished and i was beginning to enjoy the luxurious comfort presently when blowitz had engulfed his last marron glacй and staggered afoot gasping blessings on the chef we made our way to the little observation platform for a smoke before going our separate ways he had given me the number of madames voiture in the ladies car and said with knowing chuckles that he imagined he would have no to himself for the night you will hardly wish to join the excursion at strasbourg which we reach at five oclock in the morning sniggers he oh yes i shall take it no rest for le pauvre blowitz and i confess i am still too excited to sleep anyway oh my friend what a journey i can hardly believe it strasbourg vienna budapest bucharest we glide through them all the jewels of europe and at last the bosphorus the golden horn i cannot prevail on you to make the whole journey no well it may be best that you alight with her highness at vienna only nagelmackers trusted few know of her presence but it could hardly be secret after other ladies join us and we wish no gossip eh he tapped his boozeenriched nose my boy i wish you joy of your adventure ah but one thing in divulging our little secret you will make no mention of la caprice by name that must remain confidential always now to my arms he embraced me as closely as his potbelly permitted we shall meet again before vienna a bientфt he toddled off rejoicing to the salon and i finished my cigar watching the dark woods and fields flow past at thirty miles an hour then i made my leisurely way back through the salon where blowitz and the boys were plainly intent on making a night of it from the laughter and jollity i guessed theyd be singing ere long in our sleeping coach the attendants were making up the berths one above tother as on shipboard whether blowitz or nagelmacker had warned them to look the other way i dont know but none of em gave me so much as a glance as i passed through the communicating door to the ladies coach closed it behind me and found myself in the long empty corridor which ran past the doors of the untenanted compartments to the front baggage car it was quieter here with only the rumble of wheels and the faint creak of coachwork the number on the nearest door suggested that madames cabin was at the far end and i paused beneath the dim nightlight over the attendants empty stool to consider my tactics it was a novel situation you see even for as practised a ram as yours truly how dyou set about a proud beauty whos probably ready to ride in return for information but whom youve never met question of etiquette really and i couldnt recall a similar case i might approach her a la cavalier all courtly grace and flash gallantry giving her the chance to pretend willing surrender thus respecting the conventions and prolonging the fun or i could stride in with evening maam fine weather what strip away which had answered splendidly with little duchess irma not that she was a total stranger wed met at our wedding but recalling the haughty mien and fine proportions of princess kralta i suspected that jollying her into action might be a bore while on tother hand she was too big to wrestle into submission in the confines of a sleeping berth quite a dilemma and i was getting monstrous randy just thinking about it so i decided to play the bowling as it came strode down the swaying corridor and knuckled the walnut wer ist es says a female voice and not knowing the german for roger the lodger i said it was flashman ein englander und ein edelman and a pal of blowitzs at this there was a bustle within murmured question and brisk reply a sudden almighty clattering of crockery a blistering rebuke in mittel european and finally out popped a pert little giggler of a ladys maid bearing a tray of dinner dishes as she emerged a slim beringed hand reached from behind the door deftly removing a bottle from the tray the door closed the maid shot me a smirk and scurried into the next cabin and i was just interpreting these as excellent omens when the rebuking voice started to call herein but changed it to enter i tooled in and there she stood her extremely royal highness the princess kralta as ever was clad in regal dignity and a magnificent coat of sables which covered her to the floor i might have thought it an odd rig at that time of night if id had eyes for anything except the long pale equine face framed by unbound blonde hair flowing to her shoulders the cold blue eyes looking disdainfully down her noble nose the full haughty mouth the white hand clasping the coat beneath her rather pointed chin while she extended the other imperiously slim fingers drooping to be kissed it was as though some highly superior norse goddess was condescending to notice an unusually dirty worm of a mortal i nuzzled dutifully deciding that while she couldnt compare for beauty to montez or elspeth or yehonala or a dozen others blowitz had been right she had magnetisme by the bucket enough to inspire worship in him and his like why for a moment i felt awed myself and that was enough to put me on guard thinking ware this one lad shes too good to be true and likely false as a twobob diamond for all her grand air and queenly poise watch her like a hawk but rejoice in the droop of the plump nether lip and the wanton way she lets you make a meal of her fingers sure signs that with proper management shell romp like a demented stoat enchanted highness says i retaining her hand and for a moment we weighed each other before she withdrew it to indicate the lower berth which was made up as a bed you come unannounced sir i was about to retire i had not expected you tonight she spoke perfect english with that soft danube accent that is so attractive in men and women both your highness is gracious to expect me at all says galahad flashy if i am inopportune my excuse is that having seen your picture i could not wait to view the reality she arched an eyebrow indeed but as we left paris more than two hours ago i take it you have restrained your eagerness long enough to dine smiling ever so cool the smart bitch very good my lass brace yourself sparingly your highness says i and with mounting impatience had i known how far your beauty outshines the image of the photographer id have gone without dessert possibly even without the poulet aux truffes from the evidence of your dinner tray i gather you enjoyed them both so you may judge the depth of my sincerity i moved a step closer sighed deeply and regarded her solemnly but what am i saying the truth is that for one glance from those glorious eyes one gleam of the golden cascade of your hair id have made do with a cheese sandwich and a pint of stout it took her flat aback small wonder and for an instant she stiffened and i received the freezing queen bess stare and then to my astonishment her lips trembled into a smile and then a chuckle and suddenly she was laughing outright bless her id been right she was human beneath the ice and i warmed to her in that moment and not only out of lust although i wondered if a swift flashman crossbuttock mightnt be in order but decided to observe the niceties a little longer make em laugh and youre halfway to bed anyway she was regarding me now with an odd look quarter amused three parts wary the poulet was passable the crepe chantilly she shrugged and i begin to see that m blowitz spoke no more than the truth when he said that sir harry flashman was a quite unusual man tres amusant tres beau he told me and tres galant now the cool smile on the fine horse face was haughtycoquettish as she looked me up and down quite overpoweringly galant its these tiny compartments chaps my size tend to loom rather says i happy to continue bantering now that i was sure of her and curious to see how shed play the game after all she was the one who wanted something perhaps if your highness would deign to be seated i indicated the only chair and she gave me a sidelong look and disposed herself gracefully an elbow on the chair arm a finger along her cheek but still keeping the fur carefully about her yes certainly unusual says she that is very well i am unconventional myself i think that we shall understand each other she smiled again which strangely enough didnt improve her looks for while her teeth were like pearls they protruded slightly breeding no doubt in spite of your tendency to talk charming nonsense golden cascades and sandwiches of cheese is that how you approach all your ladies only if im sure itll be appreciated but dont misunderstand me highness it may be nonsense but i meant every word of it i took a step forward and hunkered down in front of her eyeing her with ardour youre what we call an absolute stunner you know aye the most desirable woman ive seen since since we left the gare de lest says she coolly even that is not true my maid is prettier by far than i as i am sure you noticed prettys ten a penny i said desirable anyway shes only a maid not a princess and she dont want anything from me she sat farther back in her chair considering me as she toyed with her hair and i do says she in fact sir harry each of us wants something from the other do we not she glanced at the bottle shed taken from the tray standing above the basin shall we begin our negotiation with a glass of wine i rose to fill a couple of glasses and when wed sipped she set hers on the little stand by the window crossed her legs beneath the coat tossed back her golden mane and looked me in the eye no longer smiling but not unfriendly either i hunkered down again believe it or not it puts you at an advantage women dont care to have a great hairy man crouched at their feet prepared to spring stefan blowitz tells me that you hold a secret which i wish to know says she and that you are willing to pardon highness a secret prince bismarck wants to know very true she inclined her head by the way i expect highness from inferiors to friends i am kralta honoured im sure im harry so first tell me why should busy otto with the cares of the world on his back want to know an old secret that aint worth a button i do not know says she simply he did not tell me and he is not a man of whom one asks reasons not even if one is on intimate terms with him she didnt even blink let alone blush come now kralta we both know bismarck and his fine clockwork mind he dont ask damfool questions and this one couldnt be sillier without an excellent reason cant you even guess what it might be she took a sip of wine you have said it yourself harry his fine clockwork mind he must know all if he has another reason i do not know it and wouldnt tell if she did well it made no odds now as i contemplated the perfect buttermilk skin and silken tresses it was time to get to the meat of the matter well it dont signify but i beg your pardon i interrupted you were saying about blowitz he said that if i asked you how the berlin treaty was obtained you could tell me absolutely happy to oblige it surprised her now well presently lets say in vienna on your word of honour cross my heart never fear im an authority on honour she hesitated and in the meantime i just grinned at her wickedflashylike and she sat back in her chair giving me a long look with a pout to her lower lip that set my mouth watering i see there is a price fair exchange id call it says i enjoying myself and to avoid meeting my eye she turned her head aside displaying the imperious broodmare profile her voice was calm and quiet you think it fair to exact a price to take advantage of a helpless woman perhaps you are one of those men i suppose i must call them that who enjoy forcing a woman to humiliate herself aye im a cruel swine aint i just and youre about as helpless as the prussian army but i am expected to ask your terms to plead perhaps dyou need to ask them she was still for a moment and then she sighed rose from her chair still clasping the fur collar beneath her chin and looked down at me with that cool superior smile not for a moment says she and turning her back she shrugged the coat to the floor and stood there bare as a babe i overbalanced and sat staring at the long shapely legs the plump buttocks the wasp waist and the alabaster perfection of the smooth strong back all revealed so unexpected she stirred her rump and as i reached out clutching joyfully she glanced complacently over her shoulder a fair exchange nestce vas and i have to own that it was that sudden shedding of her clobber just when shed been pretending that shed have to be coaxed or ravished is the kind of lecherous trick that wins my heart every time and when we came to grips she behaved like the demented stoat aforesaid not as skilful as many perhaps but a good bruising roughrider full of running and as heartily selfish as royal fillies invariably are intent on nothing but their own pleasure which suits me admirably theres nothing like voracity in the fair sex especially when shes as strong as a bullock which kralta was not unlike that gigantic chinese brigandess who halfkilled me on the road to nanking but civilised you understand and willing to chat afterwards in a frank easy way which youd not have expected from her lofty style and figurehead i guess i just like contrary women and kralta was one crooked as a jesuits conscience as i was to discover but with a spirit and quality that made you feel it was almost a privilege to mount her but then ive remarked before that royal breeding tells and no doubt im as impressionable as the next horny peasant she was a born adventuress too aye the very archetype of all those subtle sirens whom romantic writers love to imagine aboard the orient express id barely disentangled myself from those muscular satin limbs and shed stopped gasping in what i think was hungarian and recovered her breath when she murmured so must the secret wait until vienna her long fingers stroked my stomach carelesslike better there should be nothing between us nem then we can enjoy our journey she flirted her lips across my chest why not tell me now so that you can call the guard and have me slung out as soon as youve heard it ive known women who wouldnt think twice you think i am such a one after her stroking hand slid downwards do you not trust me when i have trusted you harry steady girl a little decorum if you please ill tell you princess kralta aye well kralta i trust folk as far as i can throw em which in your case i fondled a voluptuous handful aint far thank god no viennall be soon enough i aint a modest man but im not fool enough to think that youd continue to play pretty just for the sake of my manly charms dyou know how little you know of women says she or rather how iittle you know of me i know youre bismarcks mistress i couldnt resist touching this condescending madam on a raw spot but of course it wasnt fat little stefan has been gossiping has he she sounded amused what did he tell you oh how the german emperor persuaded you to gallop stout otto into a cheerful frame of mind which im bound to say youre well equipped to do i gave her bottom a hearty squeeze ill bet he couples like a cannibal does he coarse stuff you see to put her in her place but all it provoked was a dry chuckle poor blowitz either he is a bad reporter or he was trying to protect my reputation she eased herself up on an elbow and smiled at me boldeyed in fact his majesty made no such suggestion he merely poured out his fears to me like the garrulous old woman that he is it was i who suggested delicately since the emperor is easily shocked that i myself should refresh prince bismarck delicacy being her forte the brazen bitch gods truth dyou mean you wanted bismarck talk about a glutton for punishment what on earth possessed you she gave a little dismissive shrug amusement whim what shall i call it i am forty years old immensely rich in my own right titled and privileged married to a dull nonentity and bored beyond belief it follows that i seek diversion excitement pleasure and above all novelty when a new sensation offers i pursue it as you have discovered she teased her lips across mine that is what possessed me ill be damned you didnt tell that to the emperor ill be bound what did he say oh men are such hypocrites he pretended not to understand but he did everything in his power to smooth my way to schonhausen secret arrangements agents to conduct me my husband sent off on a fools errand she gave a wellbred sneer a professional procurer could have done no more and so bismarck was as you say galloped into a good humour the emperor was pleased and grateful and i says she sitting up and stretching wantonly poonts at the high port enjoyed the supreme gratification of having the most powerful man in the world panting for me in his shirttail see why i said it was a privilege to mount her there aint many women as shameless as i am and by gum she was proud of it of course i was bound to ask how the most powerful man in the world had performed and she shrugged laughing oh very active for his age and very prussian which is to say gross and greedy an ageing bull without refinement or subtlety she was one to talk as the french philosopher said it was an interesting experience but not one to be repeated now i her eyes narrowed and the ripe lower lip drooped as she reclined beside me again her hands questing across my body am devoted to repetition and so i believe are you ah but indeed you are and since i did not decoy you from london only to find out silly secrets she slid a strapping thigh across my hips gasped sharply in hungarian and began to plunge up and down oh let us repeat ourselves again and again and again so we did as the orient express thundered on towards distant strasbourg myself rapturously content to lend support so to speak while royalty revelled in the joys of good hard work god knows how bismarck had stood it at his time of life and i remember thinking that if one had wanted to assassinate him kralta could have given him a happier despatch than the old bastard deserved clanks and whistles and a shocking cramp in my old thigh wound awoke me as we pulled in past the porte de saverne to strasbourg station and when i tried to move i couldnt because kralta was sleeping on top of me hence my aching limb trapped beneath buxom royalty thats the drawback to railroad rattling when youve walloped yourselves to a standstill theres no room to doze off contentedly rump to rump and you must sleep catchascatchcan fortunately she soon came awake and i heard the rustle of her furs as she slipped out into the corridor leaving me to knead my leg into action sigh happily at the recollection of a rewarding nights activity raise the blind for a peep at the station and groan at the discovery from the platform clock that it was only ten to five the place was bustling even at that ungodly hour with some sort of reception for our passengers and i remembered blowitz had talked of a dawn excursion there he was sure enough well to the fore with nagelmacker and a gang of tiletipping dignitaries he was trying to be the life and soul as usual but looking desperate seedy after all his sluicing and guzzling which was a cheering sight if id known then that the strasbourg river is called the ill d have called to him to have a look at it as suiting his condition that reminded me that i was in urgent need of the usual offices and i was about to lower the blind when my eye was caught by a chap sauntering along the platform valise in hand a tall youthful figure somewhat of a swell with his long sheepskincollared coat thrown back from his shoulders stylishly tilted hat shading his face ebony cane a bloom in his lapel and a black cigarette in a long amber holder bit of a continental fritillary but there was something in the cut of his jib that seemed distantly familiar as he strolled leisurely by couldnt be anyone i knew and i put it down as a fleeting likeness to any one of a hundred subalterns in the past lowered the blind drew on shirt and trousers and hobbled out to seek relief when i returned the little maid had set out a tray of coffee hot milk and petit pain and was plumping the pillows and smoothing the sheets of the berth kralta was in the chair her robe about her perfectly groomed and bidding me an impersonal good day as though shed never thrashed about in ecstatic frenzy in her life early as it is i thought a petit dйjeuner would not be amiss says she manon has made up a berth for you in the next cabin so that you may sleep until a more tolerable hour as i shall the maid poured coffee for me and milk for her mistress and waited on us while we ate and drank in silence kralta poised and dignified as befitting royalty en dйshabillй flashy halfconscious as usual when rousted out at am i was glad of the coffee and finished the pot worn as i was with lack of sleep and kraltas attentions i knew it would take more than a pint of turkish to keep me awake when wed finished manon removed the tray and i was preparing to take my weary leave when kralta stopped me with a hand on my sleeve she said nothing but put her hands up to my cheeks appraising me in that shallibuythebruteornot style and then she was kissing me with startling passion mouth wide lips working hungrily tongue halfway to breakfast tuckered or not i was game if she was and i was delving under the fur for her fleshpots when she pulled gently away pecked me on the cheek murmured later we have vienna and before i knew it i was in the corridor and her lock was clicking home i was too tired to mind the lower berth in the next cabin was turned down and looked so inviting that i dragged off my duds any old how and crawled in gratefully reflecting that the orient express was an al train and kralta the teasing horsefaced baggage with her splendid assets was just the freight for it and vienna lay ahead even as my head touched the pillow the train gave a clank and shudder and then we were gliding away again and i was preparing for sleep by saying my prayers like a good boy their purport being the pious hope that i hadnt forgotten any of the positions fetnab had taught me on the grand trunk and which id rehearsed with mrs whatshername in the ruined temple by meerut and would certainly demonstrate to kralta as soon as we found a bed with a decentish bit of romping room in it i expected to sleep soundly but didnt for i was troubled by a most vivid dream one of those odd ones in which youre sure youre awake because the surroundings of the dream are those in which you went to sleep there i was in my berth on the orient express stark beneath the coverlet with sunlit autumn countryside going past the window and near at hand two people were talking kralta and an englishman and i knew he was a public school man because although they spoke in german he used occasional slang and there was no mistaking his nil admirari drawl i couldnt see them and it was the strangest conversation in which they chaffed each other with a vulgar freedom which wasnt like kralta at all somehow she said of course shed made love to me twice and the man laughed and said she was a slut and she said lightly no such thing she was a female rake and he was just jealous he said if he were jealous of all her lovers hed have blown his brains out long ago and they both seemed amused then their voices were much closer and kralta said i wonder how hell take it and the man said hell have no choice then she said he may be dangerous and the man said the queerest thing that any man whose name could make bismarck grit his teeth was liable to be dangerous the dream ended there and i must have slept on for when i woke sure enough i was still in the berth but somehow i knew that time had gone by but why was there no feeling in my legs and who was the chap in the armchair smoking a black gasper in an amber holder and rising and smiling as i strove to sit up but couldnt of course he was the young boulevardier id seen on strasbourg station hut what the hell was he doing here and what was the matter with my legs back to life cries he there now dont stir be aisy as the irishman said an if yez cant be aisy be as aisy as ye can here take a pull at this the sharp taste of spa water cleared my parched throat if not my wits better eh now now gently does it who am i and wheres the delightful kralta and whats to do and hows your pater and so forth he chuckled all in good time old fellow i fancy youll need somethin stronger than spa when i tell you neer mind alls well and when youre up to par well have a bite of luncheon with her highness i say though youve made a hit there bit of a wild beast aint she too strong for my taste but one has to do the polite with royalty what says this madman cheerfully care for a smoke i tried again to heave up flailing my arms feebly without success and now my dream came back to me halfunderstood and i knew from the numbness of my limbs that this was no ordinary waking kralta the bitch must have doctored my coffee and it had been no dream but reality and this was the bastard shed been talking to about me and bismarck lie still damn you cries the young spark grinning with a restraining hand on my shoulder you must you know for one thing your legs wont answer yet awhile and even if they did youre ballocknaked and its dam parky out and were doin forty miles an hour and if you tried to leave the train he added soothingly id be bound to do somethin desperate see i hadnt seen his hand move but now it held a small underandover pistol levelled at me then it was gone and he was lighting a cigarette so just be patient theres a good chap and youll know all about it presently sure you wont smoke theres no cause for alarm pon honour youre among friends well companions anyway and im goin to be your tee jay and see you right what dyou know in all my fright and bewilderment it was that piece of schoolboy slang that struck home so in keeping with his style and speech and yet so at odds with his looks he couldnt be public school surely not with those classic features that belong east of vienna and would be as out of place in england as a chinamans no not with that perfect straight nose chiselled lips and slightly slanted blue eyes if this chap wasnt a mittel european id never seen one tee jay i croaked and he laughed aye guide philosopher and friend showin the new bugs the ropes what did you call em at rugby im a wykehamist you know and that was your doin believe it or not deed it was he blew a cloud grinning at my stupefaction and the feeling that id seen him before hit me harder than ever the half jeering smile the whole devilmaycare carriage of him but where when oh yes you impressed the guvnor no end cries he its an english school for you my son he told me hellish places by all accounts rations a siberian moujik wouldnt touch and less civilised behaviour than youd meet in the congo but im told theres no education like it a lifetimes trainin in knavery packed into six years no wonder they rule half the world why if id been to eton or harrow id have had flashman on toast thats what the guvnor said this was incredible the the guvnor as ever was you and he were sparrinpartners oh ever so long ago before my time ages he wouldnt tell about it but he thought you no end of a fellow if ever you run into flashman well try not to but if you do keep him covered for hes forgotten more dodges than youll ever know he told me once his great trick is shammin fear dont you believe it my boy for thats when hes about to turn tiger i remember he fingered the scar on his brow as he said it i say did you give him that his eyes were alight with admiration damned if they werent youll have to tell me about that you know my heart had stopped beating some time before i could only stare at him appalled as the truth dawned my god you mean youre rupert willem von starnberg cries he sticking out his hand but you must call me bill its a backhanded tribute to the memory of the late unlamented rudi von starnberg that my first impulse on meeting his offspring was to look for the communication cord and bawl for help time was id ha done both but when youve reached your sixties youve either learned to bottle your panic sit tight and think like blazes or you havent reached your sixties mallum i didnt know what the devil was afoot or why but id heard his name and his threat and seen his derringer no wonder hed seemed familiar taller longer in the jaw straight auburn hair instead of curls and cleanshaven but still unmistakable rudis son my god another of him that settled one thing whatever the ghastly plot it didnt signify beside the urgent need to get off this infernal train in one piece jildit and if this brute was anything like dear papa id have my work cut out you may think his threat was ridiculous on a civilised railroad carrying respectable passengers through the heart of peaceful europe i did not i knew the family but i must have time to think and find out so i let him clasp my nerveless hand assuring me warmly that hed wanted ever so much to meet me that was a facer if you like rudi had been as deadly an enemy as id ever run from and dam near did for me in the jotunberg dungeons and here was this ruffian talking as though wed been boon companions and yet hadnt that been rudi all over carefree villainy with a twinkling eye clapping your shoulder and stabbing your back together playing for time i muttered something idiotic about not knowing rudi had married and he laughed heartily he had to you see when i happened along in you knew mother helga kossuth ladyinwaitin to the duchess of strackenz in your time ive heard her speak of you but nothin to a purpose kept her counsel like the guvnor they would imposture and assassination aint matters to beguile your infants bedtime i remembered helga a lovely redhaired creature whom rudi had been sparking back in evidently with more constancy than id have given him credit for and now the result of their union was watching me with an eye like an epee as i cautiously flexed my toes feeling the life return to my legs weighed the distance between us and asked what time it was just past noon munich in half an hour but dont form any rash plans for gettin out there he eyed me mockingly im understand t quickly sure you wouldnt enjoy ten years in a bavarian prison bad as rugby i shouldnt wonder oh yes he continued enjoying himself i have it on excellent authority prince bismarcks in fact that a warrant still exists for the arrest of one flashman a british subject on a most serious criminal charge the rape of one baroness pechmann at a house in the karolinen platz munich thirtyfive years ago astonishin how youthful peccadilloes come home to roost its a lie a damned infamous lie it was startled out of me in a bellow of shock and rage it was a trap a vile plot by that swine bismarck and lola montez and that fat lying whore so you told the examinin magistrate one herr karjuss ile drew a paper from his breast strangely enough he didnt believe you of course there were several witnesses includin the victim herself and your foresworn rat of a father you took the words from my mouth yes their signed statements are in the files and would have been used at your trial if you hadnt absconded still the case can easily be reopened absconded my god trepanned into that strackenz nightmare i felt as though id been kicked in the stomach for it was all true though i hadnt given it a thought in half a lifetime true at least that id been falsely accused by those fiends blackmailed with the threat of years in a stinking gaol and the evidence would still be there the only falsehood being that id raped that simpering sow why wed barely buckled to and shed been fairly squealing for it the baroness youll be happy to know is in excellent health and eager to testify did i say ten years straitlaced lot the bavarians it could easily be life you wouldnt dare what dyou think im nobody to be railroaded by some tinpot foreign court on a trumpedup charge by god youll find out different i count for something and if you think the british government will stand by while your lousy corrupt they stood by while he consulted his paper yes while colonel valentine baker went away for twelve months he was a stalwart hero of empire too it seems and all hed done was kiss a girl and tickle her ankle in a railway carriage i must say he chuckled the longer i serve bismarck the more i admire him its all here you know he tapped the paper how youd bluster i mean and how to shut you up id never heard of this baker chap dear me flies unbuttoned on the portsmouth line what next i say we might even work up a second charge against you indecent assault on the orient express with kralta sobbin in the witnessbox thatd make the cheese more bindin in court what he shook his head mock regretful im afraid harry my boy youre cooked id known that for all my noise the moment hed recalled the name pechmann theyd got me neck and heel this jeering ruffian and his icy bitch of an accomplice and bismarck who else would have thought to conjure up that ancient false charge to force my hand now but for what in gods name i must have looked like a landed fish for he gave me a cheery wink and slapped the edge of my berth but dont fret it aint goin to happen its the last thing we want heavens youd be no good to us in clink i only mentioned the pechmann business to let you see where you stand if but see here says he brisk and friendly why not hear what we want of you it aint in the least smoky i swear in fact its a dam good deed he came to his feet now then youre feelin better i can see in body if not in spirit legs right as rain eh oh yes i noticed he gave me that cocky starnberg grin that shivered my spine so ill take a turn in the corridor while you put on your togs and have a sluice no shave just yet im afraid i took the razor from your valise just in case then well have some grub and come to biznai he gave a cheery nod and was gone i cant tell you my thoughts as i rose none too steadily and dressed because i dont remember id been hit where i lived and hard and there was nothing for it but to clear my mind of fruitless speculation and take stock of what i knew thus starnberg and kralta were bismarck agents and had trapped me drugged me threatened me with firearms and the certainty of years in gaol if i didnt do what nothing smoky a dam good deed i doubted that rather but on tother hand they hadnt shown hostile exactly kralta had let me roger her as part of the trap but i knew from a lifetimes study of wellrattled women that shed taken a shine to me too and while starnberg was probably as wicked and dangerous a sonofabitch as his father hed seemed a friendly disposed sort of blackmailing assassin why latterly hed been almost coaxing me i was at a loss all i knew was that if they were about to force me into some diabolic plot or preparing to sell me a fresh cargo of gammon they were going a rum way about it i could only wait and listen and look for the chance to cut so i made myself decent took another pull at the spa touched my toes transferred my claspknife from my pocket to my boot decided id felt worse and was in fair parade order when he returned preceded by manon with a loaded tray which she set down on a little folding camp table before making brisk work of converting the berth into a sofa what not hungry says he when i declined sandwiches and drumsticks no i guess laymedowndead aint the best foundation for luncheon but youll take a brandy capital ah and here is her highness a glass of champagne my sweet and the armchair it is well done and fitting for a princess as my stratford namesake has it she is a real princess you know harry and im a count and youre a belted whatdyecallit so were rather a select company what it might have been rudi himself chattering gaily and keeping between me and the door as he bowed in kralta very elegant in a furtrimmed travelling dress and matching cossack cap she gave me her cool stare and then to my surprise held out her hand with a little smile asking courteously if id slept well damn her impudence but i took her hand as a little gentleman ought with a silent bow as though she hadnt fed me puggle and wed never played twobacked beastie in our lives a still tongue and sharp eyes and ears were my line until i knew what was afoot after which id be even stiller and sharper all glasses charged cries starnberg capital to our happy association then he lighted one of his cigarettes and settled on he sofa corner by the door i was seated by the window now then biznai says he first off chancellor prince bismarck presents his compliments apologises for any inconvenience caused and invites your assistance in preservin the peace of europe and thats no lie he added its in the balance and if things go wrong well have the bloodiest mess since bonaparte hed stopped smiling and kralta was watching me intently why your assistance he went on freak of chance nothing more youve been told that for five years bismarck wondered how blowitz got hold of the berlin treaty thats true tho it didnt keep him awake then a few months ago idly enough he suggested to kralta that she might worm it out of little stefan she failed but heres the point he levelled his cigarette at me in talkin to her about berlin blowitz chanced to mention your name in passin you know how he gasses about the people he knows and in reportin her failure she in turn mentioned it to bismarck now says he looking leery i dont know what you and bismarck and the guvnor were up to in strackenz years ago but when bismarck heard the name flashman he sat up straight didnt he kralta she nodded he said that man again i was right i did see him in berlin during the congress then he laughed and said i should trouble no more about blowitz he would find out the secret of the treaty for himself through other agents and didnt he just cries stamberg all about some courtesan who wormed information out of one o the russians and you passed it to blowitz in your hat and a french diplomat was so impressed by blowitzs omniscience that he handed over the treaty who was the courtesan harry says he with a sly glance at kralta another of your light o loves id kept a straight face through this revelation now i shook my head since bismarck was so dam clever let him find out caprices identity for himself if he wanted to well bismarck was amused said he admired blowitzs ingenuity but that was that havin discovered the ploy bismarck was content and none of it matters now the only important thing about blowitz and the whole berlin business was that it brought your name back to bismarcks notice see so just by that chance you were still in his mind a few weeks ago when he first had word of the threatenin crisis i mentioned just now it struck him that you would be useful nay essential to him in meetin that crisis flashman is the man were his very words we must have him the question was how to enlist you he thought you might he reluctant he glanced at kralta wasnt that how he put it rather more strongly for once there was a glimmer of humour in the cool blue eyes he said you would have to be compelled so i was instructed to entice you to paris she paused and starnberg burst out laughing tell him what bismarck said oh well if you wont i will ile said you were a lecherous animal governed altogether by lust lie winked at kralta which made him irresistible to you didnt it my dear she ignored this id resolved to keep mum but suddenly the chance to play parfit gentil flashy seemed sound policy knowing your parentage im not surprised by your guttersnipe manners says i get to the point and keep your impertinences to yourself he crowed with delight clapping his hands why kralta i do believe youve got a champion bless me if you havent won his manly heart or some other part of his anatomy which i shant mention since delicacy seems to be the order of the day he grinned from one to other of us lord what a pair of randy hypocrites you are the older generation he shook his head as i was saying says kralta calmly to me i was the lure to attract you as you know i used the unsuspecting blowitz to bring us together he was most obliging hinting slyly that if i still wished to know how the berlin treaty was obtained you could he persuaded to tell me naturally i did not tell him that we already knew that little secret but pretended delight and urged him to lose no time in bringing you to paris you may resent the deception we i have practised but i cannot regret it the horse face was proudly serene but with the little smile at the corner of her mouth for several reasons when you have heard what prince bismarck proposes you will understand one of them she made a languid gesture to starnberg to continue well thankee maam says he sardonically and filled my glass but before we come to that we have a few questions and twill save time if you answer without troublin why we ask em youll learn never fear how friendly are you with the emperor of austria franzjosef hardly friendly ive met him yes on his yacht off corfu in on your return from mexico where you had led the unsuccessful attempt to rescue his brother maximilian from a juarista firin squad a gallant failure which earned you the imperial gratitude as well as the order of maria theresa presented to you he cocked a quizzy eyebrow by the empress elisabeth and aint she a peach though id call that friendly theyd done their lessons up to a point the gallant failure had been the biggest botch since the kabul retreat thanks to the idiot maximilian who was damned if hed be rescued so there and id come off by the skin of my chattering teeth and the good offices of that gorgeous little fireeater princess aggie salmsalm and jesus monteros gang of unwashed bandits who were on hand only because jesus thought i knew where montezumas treasure was cached more fool he another fragrant leaf from my diary that was and my only regret for emperor max was that hed been a fairish cricketer for a novice and might have made a halfdecent batter if hed lived but it was true enough that franzjosef had been uncommon civil for an emperor and the beautiful sissi had given me the glad eye as shed handed over the white cross cant think what became of it in a drawer somewhere i expect kralta asked did the emperor franzjosef shake hands with you a deuced odd question and i had to think i believe he did yes he did coming and going then hes certainly friendly says starnberg he only takes the paw of close relatives and tremendous swells usually that was the only time you met him would he be pleased to see you again dyou think you know hospitably inclined stop over for a weekend that kind of thing how the devil should i know what on earth has this to do bismarck is sure he would be not that hes asked but your name has been mentioned to the emperor lately and he spoke of you most warmly gratifyin what from such a cold fish and the empress this was kralta was she well disposed towards you she was very gracious charming see here this is did you admire her of course he did laughs willem who doesnt half europes in love with the beautiful sissi you met her again later says kralta in england i hunted with her once or twice yes hunted eh willems tongue was in his cheek was that the only exercise you took with her yes damn your eyes and if thats where youve been leading with your infernal questions it had to be asked says kralta sharply she stared down her nose then there are no grounds at all for the emperor to feel jealousy towards you where his wife is concerned or to put it tactfully says willem if you happened along franzjosef wouldnt bar the door on you just because little sissi was on the premises he gave the snorting little chuckle which i was beginning to detest very good dye know what kralta bismarck was right flashman is the man i say munich already how time flies in jolly company he stood up and consulted his watch we stop only five minutes but you wont do anythin rash harry will you a german gaol wouldnt suit you know he neednt have fretted one thought alone was in my mind as we waited looking out on the orderly bustle of munich station the austrian frontier lay a bare sixty miles off wed cross it in two hours and if i could give em the slip id be beyond the reach of bavarian law in a country at loggerheads with germany and as likely to oblige bismarck by returning a fugitive as i was to take holy orders as to what he could want of me i was no wiser what could it matter what the emperor and empress of austria thought of a mere british soldier she had an eye for men and it was common talk that franzjosef had warned her off various gallants with whom her relations had probably been innocent enough but i hadnt been among em i dare say i could have added her scalp to my belt but id never tried for good reason everyone knew that franzjosef whose ambition seemed to be to bag every chamois and woman in austria had given her cupids measles and while the poulticewallopers had doubtless put her in order again you cant be too careful and while she looked like pallas athene i suspected she was halfcracked flung herself about in gymnasiums and went on starvation diets and wrote poetry and asked for a lunatic asylum as a birthday present so id been told she and franzjosef hadnt dealt too well since hed poxed her and shed taken to wandering europe while he pleaded with her to forgive and forget royal marriages are the very devil i tell you this because its pertinent to the catechism which willem resumed as soon as wed pulled out of munich he began by asking what i knew of the austrian empire i retorted that they seemed to be good at losing wars and territory having been licked lately by france prussia and italy for heavens sake and that the whole concern was pretty ramshackle beyond that i knew nothing and cared less he nodded aye ramshackle enough fifty million folk of a dozen different nations bound together in a discontented mass under a stiffnecked autocrat who dont know how to manage em hes a dull dog franzjosef whose blunders have cost him the popularity he enjoyed as the handsome boyemperor of thirtyfive years ago but his empires the heart and guts of europe and if it were to suffer any great convulsion well it better not know anythin about hungary i understood it was the biggest state in the empire bar austria itself and that the natives were an ornery lot but fine horsemen he grinned proper little professor of international politics you are well im quarter hungarian myself through mama rest o mes prussian and youre right theyre an ornery lot and dont care above half for austrian rule theyve declared independence in the past risin in revolt and franzjosef made the mistake of gettin the tsar to put em down with russian troops theyll never forgive him that hes been at his wits end to keep em quiet makin concessions havin himself and sissi crowned king and queen of hungary but there are still plenty of magyar nationalists whod like to cut with austria altogether people like lajos kossuth regular firebrand who led the uprisin now in his eighties and exiled in italy but still hatin the hapsburgs like poison and dreamin of free hungary believe it or not he and his nationalist pals have the sympathy of empress sissi and the emperors son and heir crown prince rudolf who favour constitutional reform and there are others extremists whod like to take a shorter way he paused to light a cigarette blowing out the match and watching its smoke terrorists like the holnup which is hungarian for tomorrow nuff said they skulk in secret plottin bloody revolution but most hungarians regard em as a squalid gang of fanatics not to be taken seriously he threw aside the spent match so did we until about a month ago when bismarck got word through his private intelligence service that the holnup were about to take the warpath in earnest here let me give you another brandy he poured out a stiff tot and a cloud must have passed over the sun just then for the brightness faded from the pretty autumn colours speeding past the window and to my nervous imagination it seemed that the shadow penetrated into the compartment robbing the trickling brandy of its sparkle and that even the rumble of the wheels had taken on a menacing insistent note the holnup intend to assassinate franzjosef says willem filling a second glass for himself if they succeed therell be civil war oh pottin royaltys nothing new and usually theres no great harm done various lunatics have tried for franzjosef before there have been two attempts on the german emperor and the tsar was blown up a couple of years ago but this would be different what hungarians killin the austrian monarch at a time when hungarys boilin with unrest when its known that sissi supports its independence and surrounds herself with worshippin magyars and corresponds with kossuth and theres even been rumour of a conspiracy to bestow the crown of hungary on prince rudolf who hates papa and is as prohungarian as his beautiful idiot of a mother he gave a mirthless bark of laughter think what use the nationalists could make of those two halfwits willin or not casus belli if you like civil war in austriahungary and how long before france and germany and russia aye and perhaps even england were drawn in and that is what will happen if franzjosef stops a hungarian bullet somewhere or other that downy bird kipling observes that the lesson of the island race is to put away all emotion and entrap the alien at the proper time i learned it in my cradle long before he wrote it and have practised it all my life with some success and only this difference that for entrap i prefer to substitute escape the puttingawayemotion business aint always easy but i like to think i managed it pretty well in the face of starnbergs disgusting proposal concealing my shocked bewilderment before that grinning young devil and his steelyeyed accomplice as they watched to see how i would respond to their bombshell there was no point in protest or roaring refusal as you know id been pressganged aboard the good ship disaster before by legions of experts from palmerston to lincoln with the likes of colin campbell and alick gardner and u s grant and broadfoot and j b hickok and raglan and god knew who else along the way all urging hapless flashy into the soup by blackmail and brute force and nothing to be done about it ah but this time there was you see with the austrian border drawing nearer by the minute so i must bide my time and delude the aliens as seemed best listening to their lunatic notions as though i might be persuadable and waiting my chance to cut and run my strong card was that despite willems menaces theyd made it plain that they wanted me as a willing ally i must play on that but not too hard the question was which role to adopt balancing righteous outrage at the way id been treated against the chivalrous impulses which theyd expect from an officer and gentleman so now i let out a soft ha and gave willem my most sardonic stare are wt indeed just the two of us eh well setting aside your optimism and impudence perhaps youll tell me how precisely you mean youre game cries he eagerly youre with us suppose you tell me why i should be how can you not kralta couldnt believe her ears like a queen with a farting courtier with the peace of europe in the balance and the lives of thousands perhaps millions at stake ah but are they forgive me if after being hoodwinked lied to held against my will and threatened with prison and pistols i cant help wondering if this great tale of a plot is true of course its true cries willem heavens man why should we invent it i gave this the shrug it deserved and he cursed softly look here if youre in a bait cos youve been bobbled and made a muffin of he sounded like a thirdform fag well i dont wonder but cant you see we had no choice bismarck was sure wed have to force your hand and that this was the only way havin seen you i aint so sure hes right he ran a hand through his hair and leaned forward looking keen you ask me how you and i can stop the holnup and ill tell you the ins and outs presently but in principle now aint it a stunt after your own heart as i told you nothin smoky but a dam good deed and a rare adventure why the old guvnor would have jumped at it and youd ha been the first hed have wished to have alongside and if you cannot forgive the deceits we have practised put in kralta think of the cause we serve you have done brave deeds for your queen and country but nothing nobler than this she hadnt the style or figurehead to look pleading but she absolutely laid a hand on mine and her glance had more promise than appeal in it for my part if i can make any amends she ventured a toothy smile pressing my fin please say you will not fail us all depends on you all of which confirmed my conclusion that they were under the misapprehension which has sustained me for a lifetime they truly believed my heroic reputation and thought i was the kind of derringdo idiot whod answer the call of duty and danger like a good un itching to fight the good fight bismarck knew better which was why id been threatened with violence and the law but now blessed if they werent appealing to my better nature remarkable but you have to play the ball as it comes off the wicket so all very fine says i but before i hear the ins and outs let me tell you that so far youve made no sense you say these hungarian rascals are going to put paid to franzjosef and you know where and when very well round em up and string em up why dont you because it aint that simple insists willem bismarcks spy in the holnup knows their plan but not the names of the assassins or where they are this minute all were sure of is that theyll have assembled somewhere near ischl three days from now and will strike before the emperor returns to vienna on sunday next that means the attempt will be made this friday or saturday then let him go back to vienna tomorrow for gods sake or if hes fool enough to stay surround his place with troops or hasnt brilliant otto bismarck thought of that you do not understand kralta had me by the hand again none of these things is possible no ordinary precautions will serve you see the emperor does not know he is in danger he must not know she meant it too i could only gape and ask why not because the lord alone knows what hed do if he did exclaims willem its this way no one knows of this plot except bismarck his man in the holnup and a handful of his agents like ourselves but suppose franzjosef or the imbeciles who compose his cabinet got wind of it hes the kind of purblind ass who would take it as a sure sign that all hungarys out for his blood and hed act according orderin arrests repressions perhaps even executions or some such folly he could provoke the very upheaval bismarcks tryin to prevent hungarys a powderkeg and an outraged franzjosef is the very man to set it off he drew breath thats why he mustnt know there is another reason says kralta the empress and crown prince make no secret of their hungarian sympathies she is adored in budapest and there are those who would welcome rudolf as king of an independent hungary if the emperor learned of the holnup plot he might easily be led to false conclusions he wouldnt be in the mood for a game of happy families at any rate snaps willem so there you have it now franzjosef is only at ischl by chance normally he comes for a summers shootin with a full retinue but this week there are only the lodge servants a couple of aides and a file of sentries under a sergeant more for ceremony than anything and quite useless against assassins who know their business theres no earthly way to make him leave early without informin him of the plot so bismarck has devised a way to guard him secretly so that he dont know hes bein guarded he laughed at my look of derision impossible you think oh come come you know bismarck why its nuts to him im waiting to hear what it is to me i reminded him patience im comin to that we leave the train this evening at linz where we spend the night and catch the local train to ischl in the morning arrivin at about noon we spend the next thirtysix hours establishin ourselves as tourists whove come to enjoy the attractions of the spa browse in its boutiques partake of the delicious confections for which its cafйs are famous and walk in the delightful countryside says he airily never mind bismarck it was nuts to him the jaunty ruffian on thursday morning you and i will take a stroll in the grounds of the royal lodge which lies a little way outside the town refreshin our spirits in the beautiful hilly woodland and admirin the picturesque river meanderin down to the town below but now he spread his hands in comic dismay misfortune overtakes us you slip and sprain your ankle i hasten to find help and spy a gentleman out with his gun and loader and damme if it aint the emperor of austria and if you think thats one whale of a coincidence says he cocking an eyebrow it aint franzjosef would rather shoot chamois than eat his dinner and is in those woods at crack of dawn every day bar sunday if by some mischance hes not ill go to the lodge but one way or tother hes goin to learn that theres a foreign gentleman in distress in his bailiwick and when he discovers that tis none other than sir h flashman old acquaintance and saviour of brother max in mexico hell be all concern and will undoubtedly offer him and his companion the hospitality of the royal residence for a day or two and there my dear harry chuckles he we shall be honoured guests chez franzjosef and if the holnup can come at him while were on the premises well theyll be smarter lads than i think they are what taking this as a rhetorical question and being numb and speechless anyway i let it pass without remark willem rubbed his hands now for the fun franzjosef is all for the simple life he sleeps on a soldiers bedstead in a plain little room overlookin the garden with a single orderly on a pallet outside the door and his aides snug in their rooms down the corridor everyone snorin their heads off as theyve done this thirty years past and why not whats to fear a single sentry under the window probably half asleep all quiet in the garden and surrounding woods gods in his heaven and alls well until he dropped his voice to a hollow whisper out of those woods the holnup come skulkin in the halflight before dawn perhaps a single bravo more likely two but certainly not more than three say three two to look out and cover one to do the dirty deed all creepin unawares into our ambush there was a glitter in his eye that took me straight back to the jotunberg dungeons well take em either in the house or outside as chance dictates and we kill em stone dead every one follow i let that pass too taking the advice of his irishman and being as aisy as i could while he lighted himself a nonchalant cigarette itll be a noisy business of course and therell be a fine howdedo when the sleepers awake to find three dead assassins and the two gallant visitors whose vigilance has saved the day but once theyve grasped whats happened you can bet your last tizzy theyll want to keep it quiet he grinned pleased as punch tapping my knee therell be no inconvenient inquiry which might result in the unhappy discovery that this was a hungarian plot why because whatever folly franzjosef might have committed if hed learned of the holnup attempt beforehand hell not raise cain when its all past and no harm done therell be nothin to show that the corpses are hungarians they may even be foreign hirelings and whatever he may suspect the less the public hear of it the better no monarch likes it to be known that hes been a target not if it can be kept dark and his aides wont care to have their incompetence noised abroad so twill all be discreetly damped down everyone sworn to secrecy eternal gratitude to the two gallant saviours perhaps even a pound out of the royal poorbox why if failin to save poor old max earned you the maria theresa we ought to get a couple of iron crowns at least and europe will remain at peace says kralta quietly aye and well all live happy ever after willem blew a smokering so there you have it all of it now you understand what all this todo which youve found so puzzlin and inconvenient has been about and why bismarck chose you cos youre the only man he could put into franzjosefs house and no questions asked and youre qualified for the work he paused contemplating his cigarette well there it is what dyou say harry the honest answer to that would have been to tell him he was stark raving mad and if he hadnt been rudi starnbergs son with a gun in his armpit and the means to railroad me on to the bavarian rockpile for life i might well have given it since my present need was to temporise and give the impression that i might be talked into their ghastly scheme i played it as they would expect from the redoubtable flashy indignation forgotten narroweyed and considering asking shrewd questions how could they be sure franzjosef would offer us bed and board what other agents would bismarck have at ischl what if our ambush went wrong what if it couldnt be hushed up what if by some unforeseen twist of fate willem and i should find ourselves facing charges of murder entirely academic questions from my point of view but they elicited prompt answers none of them incidentally concerned with the morality of butchering the wouldbe assassins willem being a chip off the starnberg block wouldnt think twice but i was interested that kralta too apparently took bloodshed for granted and both youll notice assumed that it was all in the nights work for me flattering if you like willem dealt confidently with my doubts its bismarcks scheme and he dont make mistakes franzjosef is bound to take us in but if he didnt wed just picket his lodge and deal with the holnup in the grounds therell be half a dozen stout lads in ischl at my orders but they wont know whats afoot and i shant call on them unless i must if word of the fracas gets out well thats bismarcks biznai and hell see to it that were kept clear of embarrassment murder what when weve saved the emperor of austria dont be soft well satisfied i wasnt but i chewed my lip looking grim while they watched me with mounting hope and encouraged me with occasional reminders of what a fine crusading enterprise it was and no other way to ensure the peace of europe and the welfare of its deserving peasantry kralta was particularly moving on the score of the juvenile population i remember while willem appealed to what he supposed was my sense of adventure poor fool plainly he regarded a handtohand deathstruggle in the dark as no end of a lark i responded with few words and at last said i would sleep on it when we reached linz they seemed to take that as a sign that i was halfway to agreement for willem nodded thoughtfully and refilled my glass while kralta astonished me by kissing me quickly on the cheek and leaving the compartment willem laughed softly sentimental little thing aint she gad what a week youll have in vienna when its all over but i says he fixing me with a merry eye aint sentimental at all and in case just in case mind you youre as foxy as my old guvnor made out and have some misguided notion that youll be able to slip away once were on austrian soil well dont try it thats all those stout lads i spoke of will be on hand and they can have you back in bavaria before you can say knife he patted his pocket if i havent shot you first i reminded him coldly that id be no use to him dead and he grinned youd be even less use to yourself but we wont dwell on that eh youre a practical man and ive a notion that youll fall in with us just so long as you understand that youre going to stand up with me against the holnup one way or tother what so i hadnt fooled him above half and must just wait and hope one thing only i was sure of he wasnt getting me within a mile of franzjosef and the blasted holnup supposing they existed and the tale id been spun wasnt some huge machiavellian hoax conceived by bismarck for diabolic purposes that i couldnt even guess at that was possible but dyou know i was inclined to believe theyd told me the truth not all of it perhaps but true so far as it went it was wild but no wilder than some intrigues id known the strackenz marriage for one john browns raid for another that hungarian fanatics should be after franzjosefs blood was all too credible what boggled the mind was the scheme bismarck had designed to stop them until you studied it and saw that nothing else would have answered the threat of explosion in europe had arisen suddenly like a genie from a bottle worse than or crimea or san stefano and faced with the apparently impossible task of ensuring the emperors safety while keeping him in the dark that icecold brain had seen that unlikely old flashy was the vital cog having the entrйe to franzjosef and being eminently blackmailable and hed gone calmly and swiftly to work to bring me where i now was by the most outlandish means using kralta and willem and above all his knowledge of me his planning had been meticulous so far as for what lay ahead it remained to be seen whether the web which his perverted genius had spun over ischl would be proof against my frantic efforts to break loose and the hell with franzjosef and the peace of europe both well hed spun a similar web over strackenz and id diddled the bastard then hadnt i all very well my immediate concern was to bolt and with this sonofabitch starnberg halfexpecting it id have my work cut out it must be soon once hed got me to ischl with his gang dogging us id be sunk linz where we were to stop the night might be my best chance id no doubt he was as restlessly quick on the trigger as his murderous father but if i yelled for help in the street or in a hotel hed not dare cut loose with his piece would he yes he would though and take his chance and make his excuses to bismarck later the local train to ischl would be no easier to break from than the orient express dear god had i the nerve to spring at him now land one solid blow and leg it for the compartment where blowitz and the boys would be whiling away the time and id be safe even from this bloody young villain and as the desperate thought flashed across my mind i realised that he was drawing lazily on his cigarette watching me with that insolent starnberg smile on his handsome face and my courage melted like slush in a gutter since i was supposed to be meditating on whether to join their frightful scheme or not they let me be for the rest of the journey kralta next door and rudi reading and smoking placidly while i brooded in my corner once i made a halfhearted suggestion about bidding farewell to blowitz who expected me to get out at vienna and might wonder where id got to willem gave me a slantendicular smile and said kralta would send him a note dusk was falling when we pulled into linz but no more rapidly than my spirits when we left the station willem close at my elbow and kralta alongside and i saw the closed coach by the kerb with a couple of burly fellows in billycocks and long coats waiting to usher us aboard one sat by the driver while the other rode inside with us he was a beeffaced rascal with piggy little pale eyes which never left me and great mottled hands resting on his knees strange i can see them yet powerful paws with bitten nails while the rest of that brief coachride has faded from memory possibly because of the shock i received when we reached our destination and i saw that it wasnt the expected hotel or inn but a detached house on what i suppose were the outskirts of linz surrounded by a high ivycovered wall and approached through an arched gateway which was closed behind us by the chap on the box that put the final touch to my despair it wasnt only that there would plainly be no escape from here or the sight of another brace of bullies waiting by the open front door under a flickering lantern or the air of gloom that hung over the house itself conjuring thoughts of bats and barred windows and varney the vampire doing the honours as butler what chilled my skin was the bismarckian efficiency of it all the evidence of careful preparation the smoothness with which id been conveyed from train to prison that was the moment when i began to doubt if there was a way out and the nightmare sketched out by willem changed from the frighteningly possible to the unspeakably probable there are chaps i know who when doom seems certain grit their teeth and find renewed courage in their extremity i aint like that at all but my native cowardice does take on a sort of reckless frenzy rather like those fellows who caught the black death and thought oh well to hell with everything we might as well carouse and fornicate to the end cos at least its more fun than repentance or prayer it was in this spirit that i was able to roger that houri in borneo during the batang lupar battle whimpering fearfully the while and do justice to mrs popplewell while in flight from the outraged townsfolk of harpers ferry it dont cast out fear but it does take your mind off it in my present plight things were made easier by willem and kralta who kept up the pretence that i was a willing guest chatting amiably as we went indoors calling for comforts and refreshments and when we came to a late supper in the sparsely furnished diningroom setting themselves to put me at ease a herculean task youll allow but they didnt shirk willem pattered away cheerily and kralta shrewdly guessing that nothing was more likely to put me in trim than a fine display of gleaming shoulders and rampant boobies across the board had changed into evening rig of red velveteen stuff with jewels sparkling on her bosom and in her hair why not thinks i itll see you through a restless night at any rate so i joined in their talk stiff enough at first but unbending to the extent of reminiscing about a campaign or two and from their occasional exchange of glances i could see that they were thinking aha the brutes coming round after all nothing was said about the ischl business until we were about to part for the night by which time id drunk enough to swamp my worst fears and prime me for another bout with kralta shed left us to our cigars with a cool smile for me as i drew back her chair and when we were alone willem says our proposal dyou still need to sleep on it do i have a choice i wondered hardly but id like to think you were with me willingly for the good cause oh and the fun of it he chuckled gad he was like rudi ruthless as cold iron but treating it as a game come on harry what dyou say if i say aye would you trust me on your word of honour yes lying bastard but it gave me the chance to play bluff flashy to the hilt i sat up straight and looked him in the eye very well says i deliberately ill give it in return for your word of honour that all youve told me is gospel true he was on his feet like a shot hand held out smiling eagerly done cries he on my honour oh this is famous i knew youd come round here we must certainly drink to this so we did neither of us believing the other for an instant but content with the pretence at that i aint sure that he didnt halfbelieve me for i can sound damned trueblue when i want to we drank and he clapped me on the shoulder bubbling with spirits and delivered me to my beefy watchdog crying good night old fellow sweet dreams as i was shepherded up the stairs the lout saw me silently into a room which was as id expected bars on the window lock clicking behind me and kralta sitting up in the great fourpost bed clad in a gauzy nightrail and a look of expectation tell me he persuaded you cries she not for a moment my dear says i shedding my coat you see i knew his father and id not trust either of em round the corner the fine long face hardened in dismay and she drew back against the pillows as i sat down on the side of the bed no he has not persuaded me i leaned towards her with my wistful flashy smile reaching out to touch her hair but you have you see im a simple sort of chap kralta always have been i dont always know a wrong un when i meet one but i do know when someones straight i kissed her gently on the forehead and felt her quiver distractingly youre straight as a die and while i aint much on politics or the smoky things these statesmen get up to or even understand above half all the stuff that willem told me well that dont matter truly i fondled a tit with deep sincerity and felt it harden like a blownup football if you think its a worthy cause well thats good enough for me ever seen a horse weep nor i but having watched the tears well in those fine blue eyes and trickle down her muzzle and heard her whinny and bare her buck teeth in a smile of glad relief i dont need to her arms went round my neck oh but all my deceits and lies honourable lies my darling to a noble end why ive told a few stretchers of that sort myself in my time when duty demanded it i slipped the flimsy stuff aside to get a proper grip of the meat and kissed her lingeringly on the mouth she clung moistly making small noises of contrition turning to passion and i went to the glad work of entrapping the alien at the proper time ischls a pretty little place almost an island enclosed on three sides by the rivers traun and ischl and lying at the heart of some of the finest scenery in europe forest country and lakes and the mountains of the saltzkammergut bad ischl they call it nowadays and i believe its become a favourite resort of the squarehead quality but even in the emperors patronage had made it fashionable and there was more of society about than youd have expected come to take the waters inhabit the fine villas along the traun drive in the woods and on the river boulevards promenade in the gardens of the new casino and throng the more elegant shops and cafйs of which there were a surprising number the townsfolk were stout and prosperous and the inevitable peasantry in their awful little black pants and suspenders seemed to know their place and gave the scene an air of picturesque gaiety which didnt reflect my mood exactly willem i think reckoned i was reluctant still but would be bound to go through with his ghastly scheme kralta on tother hand having a romantic and patriotic heart beneath her glacial exterior and being partial to pork was convinced id seen the light shed taken to me no error and wanted to trust me you see that was fine but left me no nearer to finding a means of escape the journey from linz had afforded no chance at all with willem close on hand and his four thugs in the next compartment and at ischl where we were installed at the golden ship in a sidestreet off the marktplatz they never let me out of their sight that very first day when wed settled in and got our bearings in the town strolling by the traun admiring the casino gardens taking coffee in an opulent patisserie and generally idling like wellbred little tourists willem stuck like a burr and my beefy scoundrel lurked in the background how theyd act if i suddenly darted to the nearest copper yelling that i was being kidnapped i couldnt guess and didnt dare find out set aside that willem might well have put a slug in my spine and faded out of sight youre at the deuce of a disadvantage being a foreigner even if you speak the lingo the authorities aint inclined to believe you not in the face of explanations from an imposing lady of quality and her junker escort backed by four worthy cabbageeaters in hard hats poor cousin harry hes english you know and has fits dont be alarmed constable we have a straitjacket at the hotel that would be their line or something like it and where would cock flashy be then poor thing at the bottom of the traun the same evening likely with a bag of coal at his feet and kralta dropping a sentimental tear so i played up as seldom before smiling politely talking wittily at ease breathing in the breezes of the distant mountains with every sign of content coaxing kralta to buy a monstrous hat in one of the boutiques drinking in a beergarden with willem and shaking my head ruefully as he cheated me at bezique laughing heartily at the drolleries of frosch the gaoler in fledermaus at the little theatre in the evening remarking at dinner that austrias contribution to civilisation must surely be the art of cooking cabbage decently rogering kralta to stupefaction when wed retired and lying awake later with her sleeping boobies across my chest cudgelling my wits for a way out i made the experiment of rising early next morning and dressing quietly while she was still asleep slipping out on to the landing and there was beefy squarebottomed on a chair glowering i bade him a civil goodday and sauntered down into the street and he simply followed a few paces behind as i strolled to the river and back for breakfast willem was already down he raised an eyebrow glancing at beefy and then asked me if id had a pleasant stroll no alarms no warning so they must be sure enough of their grip on me to delegate the task of watchdog to a single ruffian armed and ruthless no doubt but still just one man interesting and sufficient to raise my hopes a little and then on that second day in ischl the whole affair changed unbelievably and escape became unthinkable it was wednesday the day which willem had appointed for a scout in the direction of franzjosefs lodge it stood on rising ground on the other side of the town above and beyond the little river ischl secluded enough among woodland to give royalty privacy but an easy walk from the ischl bridges which span the river by way of a little island lying in midstream willem and i walked through the town and across the bridge to the island which was laid out as a park with pleasant gardens among the trees and bushes we found a quiet spot from which we could look across the river towards the high bank above which the lodge could be seen among the trees rudi scanned it through fieldglasses and then we crossed the farther bridge for a closer look strolling up the curving road circling the lodge itself and back to the road again here willem led the way north farther up the slope to a point slightly above the lodge and took a long slant through the glasses there were a few folk about tourists driving and strolling for a look at the royal residence but there wont be a soul this side of the river after dark says willem gad aint it made for murder though come across from ischl by day lie up in the woods he nodded to where the trees grew thicker above us then swoop down at night break in do old fjs business and flee any way you like across into the town to your hideyhole or back into the woods or down the ischl and then the traun by boat he passed me the glasses chuckling but since we shant give em the chance to flee that dont signify he lounged back on the turf chewing a blade of grass and shading his eyes against the autumn sun while i surveyed the lodge a white threestoreyed building with a highpitched roof to one side in which there were dormer windows odd little minarets decorated the gable ends and at what seemed to be the front of the house there was a large square porch with ivycovered pillars and a flat roof surrounded by a little balustrade the whole place had an informal almost untidy look not very grand for an emperor i thought i told you he liked to play the simple soul says willem all ceremony and etiquette at the hofburg or schonbrunn but hailfellow with the peasants when hes out of town provided he does the hailing and they knuckle their foreheads like good little serfs he acts the genial squire but hes a pompous prig at heart and god help anyone who comes the familiar with him or so im told youve met him i havent id thought him stiff and stupid on short acquaintance but what exercised me just then was that his lodge while modest enough was a sight too large to be guarded by a file of soldiers but not by two clever lads inside the place who stick close by his nibs night and day and know the geography says willem and who know also exactly where the holnup will try to break in i almost dropped the glasses how the devil can you know that he gave me his smartalec smile ive never set foot in that bijou residence but i know every foot of it like my own home builders plans old boy you dont think bismarck overlooks items like that i could find my way round it in the dark and probably will but you cant guess which way theyll come theres a secret stair leading down from the emperors bedroom to an outside door no doubt so that he could sneak out for a nights whoring in town without sissi knowing although why he should with that little beauty waiting to be bounced about beats me he added with fine irrelevance anyway even the servants dont know about the secret stair but you and bismarck do absolutely absolutely and its st pauls to the parish pump that the holnup know too heavens theyre not amateurs theyd be mad not to take advantage of it wouldnt you say and if they dont or if its locked as its bound to be he smote his forehead damn theyll never have thought of that so they wont bring picklocks or boltshears or anything useful will they ah well says the sarcastic brute we can tell bismarck hes fretting about nothing oh come along he got to his feet laughing at me the thing is where to take em at the door or inside or where well well have to think about that one thing at a time we walked down the hill and back across the bridges to ischl town and had just reached the spot where the landstrasse runs into the kreutzplatz when we were aware of some commotion ahead people on the landstrasse were drawing aside to the pavements with a great raising of hats and bobbing of curtsies as a smart open carriage came bowling up the street its occupant responding to the salutes of the whiffers by making stiff inclinations and tipping his tile a couple of hussars trotted ahead and as they came level with us willem drew me quickly back into a doorway the grand panjandrum himself says he and the less he sees of us just now the better dont want to spoil tomorrows surprise do we lets grin into our hats till hes past we doffed covering ourselves and as the carriage crossed the kreutzplatz to polite cheering willem laughed tell you what harry he looks more than half like you i dont care to be told that i resemble royalty it wakes too many unpleasant memories and in the case of franzjosef it was downright foolish for while he cut a fairish figure tall dark and wellmoustached and whiskered he had no more style than a clotheshorse and i aint got a hapsburg lip or the stare of a backward haddock he didnt have my shoulders or easy carriage either and as hed raised his hat id noted that his hair was receding and dyed by the look of it that aside he hadnt changed much in the fifteen years since id seen him hed be in his early fifties now eight years my junior its a solemn thought says willem as we resumed our walk down the landstrasse that as he drives serenely by the holnup lads will be watching he nodded at the fashionable shoppers thronging the pavements aye theyll be here biding their time for tomorrow night or the next too smart to try a shot or a bomb in open day though risky and not near so impressive as cutting his throat in his own bedroom he slipped his arm through mine little do they know eh i hardly heard him somehow the sight of franzjosef had driven it home to me that in a few hours id be embarked on the lunatic business of faking a game leg in his coverts being taken in as his guest and prowling his blasted house in the middle of the night in the company of this bloodthirsty young ruffian waiting for assassins to break in it was like some beastly dream there in this bustling sunny resort with respectable decent folk strolling by the women exclaiming at the shop windows their men pausing indulgently young people chattering gaily at the cafй tables dammit a pair of polizei twirling their moustaches at the next corner and willem must have had some sixth sense for his arm tightened on mine and he shot me a quick glance as we walked past them the urge to wrench free and run screaming for help lasted only an instant i darent and i knew i darent but oh lord somehow in the next few hours i must summon up the courage to try what the sweat was breaking out on me as we reached the golden ship and willem called cheerfully for coffee and cake and it was all wasted fear for the die was cast already by hands other than bismarcks and rolling in my direction we dined early that evening and for all his artless banter i sensed that willem was wound tight as was kralta she it was who proposed that we should visit the casino less from an urge for play i guessed than for some distraction from the strain of waiting willem said it was a capital notion and i forced a cheery agreement so then we waited while kralta donned her evening finery and presently we strolled through the lanternlit gardens to the new casino with beefy acting as rearguard and taking post at the entrance as we passed into the salon that feeling of unreality that had gripped me in the streets came back with a vengeance under the glittering chandeliers it was a scene from operetta like the princes reception wed seen at the theatre the previous night a swirl of elegant figures clustered round the tables or waltzing in the ballroom beyond all laughter and gaiety and heady music gallants in immaculate evening rig or dress uniform the ladies splendid in coloured silks bright eyes and white shoulders and jewels agleam in the candleshine glasses raised to red lips and whitegloved fingertips resting on stalwart arms the rattle of the wheel and the voices of the croupiers mingling with the cries of delight or disappointment the soft strains of la belle hйlene and blue danube from the orchestra ruritania come to life on a warm austrian evening that would go on flirting and laughing and dancing forever and a bare mile away the lonely lodge among the dark silent trees with its precious royal tenant all unguarded against the creeping menace that would come by night and only one desperate adventurer and one shivering poltroon to save the peace of europe unless at the eleventh hour that poltroon could streak to safety in the tall timber dyou wonder that while i retain a vivid image of the scene in that casino i havent the faintest recollection of the play not that im much in the punting line running a hell in santa fe convinced me that its money burned unless you hold the bank but if id been as big a gambling fool as george bentinck id not have noticed whether it was faro or roulette or vingtetun we wagered on i was too much occupied keeping down my fears mechanically holding kraltas stakes and muttering inane advice working up my courage with brandy while willem smoked and watched me across the table i know kralta won smiling coolly as her chips were pushed across and suggesting we escape from the noise and crowd into the garden willem nodded and she went off to find her stole and to tittivate while i collected her winnings from the caissier and sauntered out of the salon to the entrance my heart going like a triphammer for i knew it was now or never beefy was on the qv at the head of the steps so i told him offhand that her highness would come presently and i would wait for her at the little fountain yonder he scowled doubtfully and as i went leisurely down the steps to the gravel walk i saw him from the tail of my eye hesitating whether to wait or come after me sure enough he stuck to his orders and followed me i heard his beetlecrunchers on the gravel as i paused to light a cheroot and loafed on idly towards the fountain glittering prettily under the lanterns a few yards ahead there were clusters of light everywhere in the gardens but deep stretches of dark among the trees let me sidestep swiftly into one of these and be off to a flying start and if i couldnt give that lumbering oaf ten yards in the hundred even at my time of life id deserve to be caught and then id be in full flight with the length and breadth of europe before me kraltas winnings and my own cash to speed my passage by train or coach or on foot or on hands and knees if need be if ive learned one thing in life its to bolt at the first chance and let the future take care of itself so now i strolled unhurriedly high savvy that meant the prime minister in politicals lingo gladstone and higher still adds hutton sharply my god that could only mean the queen now understand this sir we know bismarcks plan down to the last detail for safeguarding the emperor starnberg must have put it to you very good tell me what he said precisely and quick as you like when youve been trained as a political by sekundar burnes you talk to the point and ask no questions in one short minute id been given staggering information demanding a thousand whys but that didnt matter what did was the joyous discovery that i was among friends and safe from bismarcks ghastly intrigues so i gave em what they wanted as terse as i knew how from my boarding the orient express omitting only those tender passages with kralta which might have offended their sensibilities and any mention of the pechmann blackmail my story was that willem had backed up his proposal with a pistol they listened in silence broken only once by a groan from the bushes at which hutton snarled over his shoulder hit him again cant you and go through the buggers pockets every last penny mind when id finished he asked did you believe it how the blazes could i tell it sounded wild but oh its wild he agreed its also gospel true though i dont blame you for doubting it why the dooce couldnt bismarck approach you open and aboveboard instead of humbugging you aboard that train best way to make you disbelieve em id say he shot me a leery look told starnberg to go to the devil did you by god i did and let me tell you but youre still with em so either youve changed your mind or are pretending youve changed it he was no fool this one well sir it makes no odds for from this moment youre with em in earnest and thats an order from downing street only paralysed disbelief at these frightful words prevented me from depositing my dinner at his feet he couldnt mean them surely but he did as i gaped in stricken horror he went on urgently its this way bismarcks right if these hungarian villains succeed god help the peace and hes right too that the emperor cant be warned it would be fatal the frog spoke for the first time there can be no confidence in his judgment he might well provoke a storm bismarcks plan is the only hope it not only preserves the emperor but deals those magyar fanatics a fatal blow says hutton suppose something arose to make this attempt impossible theyd just wait for another day but wipe out their best assassins now swift and sudden and theyll not come again i could see his eyes fairly gleaming in the shadows so it rests with you and von starnberg but now you know you have the blessing of our own chief and the french authorities too of course he added quickly no doubt to keep jean crapaud happy m grevy approves the plan and your participation says froggy and smiled grimly and your old copain of the legion bids you bonne chance camarade he could only mean macmahon and as i sat rooted and mute at all this appalling news which had whisked me in a twinkling from the heights of hope to the depths of despair it struck me that there had been some marvellous secret confabulating in high places lately hadnt there just but then tisnt every day that british and french intelligence learn of an idiotic plan by bismarck to save the austrian emperor and prevent bloody war is it gads me life and blue sacred they must have thought gladstone and grevy must hear about this and elder wiseacres like macmahon and probably disraeli and the queen god help us since its a royal crisis and because theyve no notion what to do they convince themselves that ottos plan is the only course all the more so because the renowned flashy secret diplomatic ruffian extraordinary former agent of palmerston and elgin veteran of desperate exploits in central asia and china and the back o beyond generally whos killed more men than the pox and is just the lad for the present crisis has been recruited to the good cause never mind how hes on hand loaded and ready to fire your majesty so dont trouble your royal head about it all will be well indeed it is most alarming and too shocking that subjects should raise their hands against their emperor whose royal person should be sacred to them and the empress is the prettiest and most charming creature and while i could wish that your hand dear lord beaconsfield was at the helm of the ship of state in this crisis i dare say that mr gladstone is right and the matter may be safely entrusted to colonel flashman such an agreeable man although my dear albert thought him a trifle brusque indeed mann a somewhat rough diamond but capable they say that would be the gist of it i could have wept for as i sat on the cold bench in the shadows with waltz music drifting from the casino and my mind numb from the pounding hutton and this frod had given it one thing at least was plain i was dished the irony was that in the very moment when id eluded willem and his bullies running had become impossible how could i tell hutton to go to hell with his foul instructions and have him bearing back to whitehall the shameful news that the hector of afghanistan hero of balaclava and cawnpore had said thankee but hed rather not save franzjosef and the peace of europe if you dont mind my credit my fame would be blown away id be disgraced ruined outcast the queen would be quite shocked no the doom had come upon me yet again and i could only cudgel my brains for some respectable alternative to the horror ahead trying to look stern as i met their eyes and talking brisk and manly like the gallant old professional they thought i was see here hutton says i you know me i dont croak but this thing aint only wild its plain foolish youve got men well then bushwhack these rascals in the grounds before they get near the lodge were seven all told we couldnt hope to cover the grounds and if we had more its odds the holnup would spot us and cry off to another time but dammit man two men in the house is too few suppose they come in force god knows im game but i aint young and starnbergs only a boy never fret about starnberg from what i hear hes al says hutton and laid a hand on my shoulder damn his impudence and id back you against odds however old you are now times short but you must picket the grounds somehow if something goes wrong seven of you could at least well be on hand colonel but only at a distance or theyll spot us sure as sin from this moment well have one cover dogging you every foot o the way but more than that we cant do now youd best rejoin starnberg and kralta before they miss you and how the hell do i do that when youve sandbagged my bloody watchdog what do i tell em hey youve blown on me you gormless ass dont you believe it sir he was grinning as he spoke over his shoulder how is he sleeping sound chuckles a voice from the dark and hutton turned back to me four more unlucky citizens will be assaulted and robbed this fine night so your cove wont seem out o place damnable these garotters bad as london so your best plan colonel is to discover our unconscious friend and raise the alarm see hows that for establishing your bona fides he called it bonnyfydes and why the devil i should remember that of all things you may well wonder time to go snaps hutton straightening up find another victim eh delzons off with you then his hand clapped my shoulder again all clear colonel not a word about this to starnberg mind youll see me again afterwards good hunting sir and so help me he and his lousy frog accomplice were gone like phantoms into the dark without another word leaving me in a rather disturbed state id have cried out after them if id been capable of speech as it was i had wit enough to see the wisdom of his advice anent beefy and after a few seconds frantic search in the bushes i found the brute dead to the world and was waking the echoes with shouts of helfen polizei ein mann ist tot helfen schnell helfen thereafter it seemed politic to run towards the casino repeating my alarm and guiding interested parties to the scene of the crime it worked perfectly of course willem was among the first on hand fairly blazing with unspoken suspicion which i allayed by explaining that id been waiting by the fountain for kralta when sounds of battery in the bushes had attracted my attention and on investigating id found beefy supine with two sturdy footpads taking inventory of his pockets they had fled i had pursued but lost them in the dark and returned to minister to beefy and raise the alarm and where the blazes were the police then it didnt convince him above half im sure not at first i could guess he was wondering why i hadnt taken the chance to vanish and coming slowly to the conclusion that i hadnt wanted to what sealed the thing was the discovery a few minutes later of another unfortunate wandering dazed on the gravel walks and gasping out a tale of armed footpads whod knocked him down and pinched his watch and purse half an hour afterwards a third was found unconscious by one of the casino gates similarly beaten and robbed by that time the peelers had arrived in force shepherding the frightened mob back into the casino where beefy and the other victims were being attended to plainly a gang of footpads had marked down the casino patrons as welllined targets and were making a lightning sweep of the grounds i made a statement to a most efficient young police inspector watched closely by a still puzzled willem with kralta at his elbow they were talking sotto voce and if id felt like laughing i dare say id have been amused at the slow change of expression on willems face for it was clear that she was insisting that here was proof of my sincerity since not only had i not made for the high hills id absolutely come to beefys aid and been first to holler for the law at last he nodded but i guessed he was still leery of me rudi would have been nothing was said though about my bonnyfydes as we returned to the golden ship kralta on my arm murmuring thanks that i hadnt been molested and willem snapping impatiently at beefy who brought up the rear with his head in a sling i gathered from their halfheard conversation that beefy was lamenting the loss of a lock of hair belonging to some bint called leni which hed carried in the back of his watch and getting scant sympathy prussians you know care not two dams about their inferiors neither do i but i know its good business to pretend that i do and looked in on beefy before retiring to lay a consoling hand on his thick skull he just gaped like a ruptured bullock one of the lessons that id impress on young chaps is this if you want to pull a bluff do it with your might no halfmeasures however unlikely the ploy if your neck is brazen enough its odds on youll get away with it take the time i was caught in flagrante in a calcutta hotel by an outraged husband and sold him on the idea that i was a doctor sounding her chest or the occasion when they found me climbing through jefferson daviss skylight and i pretended i was a workman come to fix his lightningrod a moments guilty hesitation and id have been done for indignant astonishment at being interfered with saw me through but ive never done better than willem von starnberg in franzjosefs woods above ischl that was a bravura performance and would have been a pleasure to witness if i hadnt been writhing in pain after hed dam near broken my leg his father would have been proud of him wed risen well before dawn and made a hurried breakfast schnapps mostly for me in a futile attempt to steady my nerves and kralta was on hand to bid the warriors farewell her cheek was like ice when she kissed me but her lips were hungry enough and there was moisture in the cold blue eyes and strain showing on the long proud face she was anxious for me you see the besotted little aristo its remarkable how even the most worldly of women can be rendered maudlin by adams arsenal willem was impatient to be off and it was more to annoy him than to comfort her that i folded her in a lingering embrace squeezing her bottom as i assured her that wed be back in fine trim in a day or two and then vienna haha the sun was not yet up and autumn mist was wreathing over the waters of the ischl as we crossed the bridges deserted at that hour and mounted the slope towards the woods skirting well to the right of the royal lodge which lay silent among its surrounding trees a cock was crowing somewhere the dew was thick on the short grass and there was that tang in the nostrils that comes only at daybreak we were attired as tourist walkers in tweeds boots and gaiters willem carrying a rucksack and i a flask and sandwichcase and it was only when we had reached the higher woods and paused to look back at the lodge and beyond and beneath it the distant roofs of ischl town gilded now by the first rays of the rising sun that it struck me i was without one necessary item of equipment when i asked was i to be armed for the fray not yet awhile smiles willem remember that presently youre going to be a limping invalid whos sure to be examined by a doctor and we dont want him blundering through your clobber and finding the likes of these do we he opened the rucksack to display two revolvers a webley and a levaux i like an english piece myself but the levaux s neat enough for your pocket and fires a slug guaranteed to give any marauder the deuce of a bellyache take your choice without thinking i indicated the levaux and so saved my life and franzjosefs and heaven knows how many million other lives as well if id chosen the webley europe would probably have gone to war in think im stretching wait and see well have twenty rounds apiece says willem stowing away the guns if we need more then we shall also need the austrian army his impatience had gone now that we were under way and he was in that insufferably jocular mood that his father had affected whenever dirty work was imminent now twill be curtain up in a little while so lets rehearse our cues shall we we found a dry fallen tree trunk in the margin of the woods and he repeated in detail the mad procedure which hed described on the train and again at the golden ship it still sounded devilish chancy suppose franzjosef hadnt got up this morning or didnt invite us to stay what then i asked he shook his head as at a mistrustful child and was just assuring me patiently that it would all fall out precisely as the genius otto had forecast when from somewhere in the woods above us there came the distant sound of a gunshot there you see cries he springing afoot our royal host is doin the local chamois a piece of no good how dye know its him it might be anyone it might be the aston villa brakeclub picnic but i doubt it in the emperors personal woods he swung up his rucksack and plunged into the trees come on we pushed rapidly uphill into the woods down into a little hollow and up again over a steep stony place and now there came two shots in quick succession much closer and off to our left wait here says willem and was off into the undergrowth at a run i breathed myself against a tree debating whether to rush blindly downhill away from this fatal nonsense remembered hutton and the queen and stood there sweating and gnashing my teeth and here he was again face alight with unholy joy slithering towards me over the fallen leaves and needles eureka hes there large as life havin a smoke while his loader measures the horns of some dead beast which i suppose hes shot couldnt be better he caught me by the shoulder nows the hour harry my boy this is where you rick your ankle and i holler for help ready youre raving mad says i through chattering teeth you and bismarck both oh christ for the swine had fetched me a sudden shattering kick above the ankle and i went down in agony fairly writhing on the leaves as i clutched my injured limb and damned him to hell and beyond it was as though id been shot and he stepped over me measured his distance and kicked me savagely again in almost the same place if youve hurt yourself the medicos got to have somethin to look at you know grins he not so loud you ass or theyll think youre dyin groan and try to look gallantly longsufferin i was too dizzy with pain to do anything but curse and weep and now he was away again yelling helfen mein herr while i tried to pull myself up by a tree wrenching at my gaiterbuttons and sock to reveal an ankle that was grazed bloody and already turning blue god had he broken it i nursed the injury with both hands feeling it beginning to puff and swell and now footsteps were approaching willems voiced raised in concern caught his leg between two stones i think i dont believe its broken but too badly wrenched to walk i fear on the first day of our expedition too you say your friend is an englishman it was a deep voice curiously flat and deliberate why yes an army acquaintance neither of us has been to the saltzkammergut before you see and we planned ah here he is how is it harry i say it looks bad he turned to his companion by the way i am count willem von starnberg herr he finished on a question the cunning young bastard letting on that he didnt know whom he was addressing and i gritted my teeth and tried to act up noting as i did so that it was a good job there were no highland regiments in the austrian service for the emperor franzjosef would have looked abominable in a kilt with those knobbly knockknees looking like knuckleends between his woollen stockings and his little black lederhosen he wore a shooting jacket and a ridiculous hat with a feather but there was nothing clownish about the austere frowning face with its heavy whiskers as he stooped to survey my damage nothing sympathetic either just bovine serious it needs attention was the royal diagnosis can you walk sir there must be an actor buried in me for as willem bent to help me and i met franzjosefs heavy stare i fairly gaped wideeyed and made as though to scramble up my god i croaked your majesty i i babble babble babble while willem looked suitably startled and clicked his heels and franzjosef made another of his lightning deductions you know me didnt i just though begging his pardon introducing myself with profuse apologies for coming adrift in his coverts doffing my tile while willem did likewise bowing like a clockwork doll while franzjosef registered amazement by blinking thoughtfully the officer of mexico says he you are he who attempted to save my unhappy brother i invested you with the order of maria theresa at corfu was it not after that it was old home week with a vengeance with franzjosef nodding gravely willem protesting that we were a hellish nuisance allhighest and wouldnt have dreamed of intruding if wed only known flashy clinging gamely to his tree and presently even more gamely to the stalwart back of the loader who was summoned to tote me downhill i lay there breathing in his aroma of rifleoil and cowdung wondering what the harvest might be and willem walked ahead with franzjosef making deferential noises of gratitude and apology and to my astonishment making his majesty laugh say that for the starnbergs they could charm birds from the trees when they wanted to and by the time we reached the lodge the emperor of austria was positively jocose issuing orders to flying minions and not going off to change his ghastly breeks until he had seen me installed on a couch in a gunroom with servitors rallying round with hot water and cold compresses and willem chivvying them aside while he attended to my bandages himself were there he murmured softly he knows my family by name anyway i could have said that if hed known any more of the starnbergs than that wed have been on our way to gaol this minute but held my peace play up when the doctor comes mind which i did with willem and franzjosef now respectable in a suit standing by the sawbones was a plump little cove with gooseberry eyes and trailing whiskers who prodded my injury and pronounced it ugly but seemed to think i ought to be able to hobble capital thinks i therell be no reason to offer us houseroom and we can scuttle back to ischl and let the holnup have a free run but willem had the answer to that rot him your thigh wound remember says he very sober a serious injury from my friends afghan days he assured the doctor which reacts to any distemper in the limb why harry you were laid up for a week in scotland i recall when youd done no more than stub your toe observe the guile of it he knew that if anything appealed to franzjosef it was an honourable scar he was soldierdaft and had himself risked life and limb with extraordinary stupidity during his various campaigns all of which hed lost by the way so now you find flashy lying trowserless while the doctor goggled at the impressive scar on my thigh and the knee wound id taken at harpers ferry and even the hole in my buttock where the slave catchers shot me while crossing the frozen ohio with willem murmuring to an impressed franzjosef that this wasnt the half of it you ought to see the rest of the buggers carcase not an inch of it whole i assure your majesty hell of a life the boys led honestly or words to that effect the emperor shook his head in respectful wonder and the linseed lancer taking his cue muttered about secondary reaction and delayed muscular lesions it might well be he opined that even a minor contusion might render a limb temporarily incapable at which willem played his masterstroke well old feller i can see well just have to carry you down to ischl is the thigh very painful neer mind ill whistle up a chair or something and a few handy chaps if your majesty says he with another bow and heelclick will be gracious enough to allow my friend to rest here while i make arrangements no more than an hour profound apologies great imposition there there old chap just bite on something it would have had scrooge piping his eye franzjosef glowered at the doctor and said it would be unwise to move me surely and the poulticewalloper agreed that it would be nothing short of bloody reckless richtig announced franzjosef then the gentleman stays here at least until he can walk without difficulty so fall in the loyal attendants willems protests were pretty to hear but franzjosef wouldnt even listen unthinkable that i should be moved in my present state it would be a privilege to entertain so gallant an officer to whom his majesty was already indebted for services to the royal family count starnberg must remain also if my injury permitted we would give the emperor the pleasure of our company at dinner in the meantime affairs required his attendance elsewhere by this time i was beginning to wonder if id ever walk again and it was with some relief that i discovered after id been borne upstairs between two servants and left in a comfortable chamber overlooking the garden that i could move without the least difficulty and was none the worse except for an uncomfortable bruise willem suggested that i should recover sufficiently to hobble by dinnertime were goin to be afoot tonight says he and it wouldnt do for you to be encountered walkin if you were meant to be bedbound you poor old cripple you he was in bouncy fettle inviting me to admire the way everything had gone exactly according to plan pacing up and down with his cigaretteholder at a jaunty angle a heavy limp i think with the aid of a stick too late for fj to turn us out of doors now what i asked how on earth hed known so much about my wounds and received his superior grin you cant get it into your head can you bismarck has a genius for detail why i know as much about your battle scars as you do he reached suddenly to tousle my hair curse him got yourself scalped by indians in the wild and woolly west even oh yes says the insolent pup ive seen a dossier on you that ill bet contains things youve forgotten perhaps never knew youve been about though my stars i hope ill see half as much by the end of the day he shook his handsome head and the admiring look of our first meeting was back again the guvnor was right youre the complete hand and no mistake on that train there you were wonderin what the dooce youd fallen into ensnared by a sinister adventuress menaced by a bravo with a pistol but did you cry havoc or bluster or vow to have the law on us well once and then mum as an oyster figurin chances listenin and bidin your time i didnt trust you an inch then kralta did though and shes no fool even if she is spoony about you but it took that business of gunther gettin scragged at the casino to convince me then i knew you must be with us he grinned tongue in cheek and it aint for franzjosef or the good o the peace is it its just for devilment he slapped his knee merry as a maggot i like you harry shot if i dont and well have some fun together just you wait and see he sprang up and tossed his cigarette into the fireplace now then im goin to take a scout about get the lie of the land and find out who does what and goes where and when and why rub an acquaintance with the aides if i can and take a professional interest in this sergeant and his file of sentinels this with a knowing wink you lie and rest your mangled pin and when i come back we can discuss ways and means eh he chewed his lip and tapped another gasper on his thumbnail looking keen dye know ive a notion tonight is goin to be the night cant tell why just an instinct you ever feel that sort of thing when i was young and green yes growls i to take the bounce out of him sign of nerves starnberg you just wish it was over and done with it didnt deflate him a bit nerves yourself scoffs he if you mean im lookin forward to it youre right i believed him for id seen the same brighteyed excitement at the prospect of slaughter in idiots like brooke and custer and its the last thing you need when your own fears are gullethigh that reminds me he went on time you were properly dressed he drew the levaux from his pocket spun it deftly and presented the butt five chambers loaded ill give you the other rounds later shove it out o sight for the moment being armed was some comfort but not much like his blasted instinct it was just a reminder of how close the doom was coming perhaps only a few short hours away in the meantime left to myself i could only wait fretting and resting my bogus injury on the sofa while softfooted orderlies came and clicked their heels and asked leave to arrange the room and see to the linen and mend the fire and stow away my effects which must have been sent for to the golden ship and bring me coffee which i shared with two sprightly youths who were franzjosefs aides come to pay their respects to the wounded guest i forget their names but thought of them as tweedledum and tweedledee one fair one dark but identical in gaiety indiscretion and breezy but deferential attention to me tweedledee knew of me by name and fame and was athirst for reminiscences but since tweedledums interest was merely polite and im an old hand at not being pumped it was childs play to steer the conversation elsewhere thus i learned in short order that ischl was a confounded bore and that it was common gossip that the emperor was only here because hed hoped to achieve a reconciliation with sissi who was in one of her fits of avoiding vienna but had halfagreed to come to ischl only she hadnt mores the pity for squiring her on horseback would have been a welcome diversion never mind theyd be back in vienna on sunday thank god and free of the tyranny of the chief equerry who was a muff and a sneak and of the ordeal of dining with the emperor and being used as errandboys by his secretary and why the old boy had to spend all day poring over papers when he was meant to be on holiday beat them altogether kept him out of the way of course even at luncheon which was a mercy since his usual fare was boiled beef and beer at his desk at least they were spared that here though my chum starnberg was a splendid fellow wasnt he just the chap to liven up a slow week and so on and so on it would be a dull world if there were no subalterns in it quieter mind you they went at last with noisy jests and good wishes and i was left to brood until an orderly brought luncheon on a tray not boiled beef as i recall but i was too blue and shaky to make much of whatever it was id barely finished when willem returned making a great show of closing the door silently tiptoeing to sit on my sofa and speaking in a whisper its too good to be true harry my boy i cant believe our luck why itll be childs play he rubbed his hands chuckling ive found the outer door to the emperors secret stairway im almost certain hows that for intelligence work he lighted one of his eternal black cigarettes and puffed in triumph i bumped into the sergeant of the guard accidentalapurpose a waxedmoustached old turniphead whos so damned military he probably rides his wife by numbers almost ruptured himself comin to attention when i happened by i played the condescendin junker commended his turnout complimented him on being chosen for such important duty he waved his holder airily you know the style the old fool was so flattered he confessed the job was mostly ceremonial mindin the front door salutin the emperor and so on but you mount night sentries surely says i one only herr oberst says he ah patrolling to be sure says i by no means herr oberst a fixed post at the sundial corner only why there cant tell the time at night says i gad i was genial harry he didnt know why said it was regulations since god was a boy he was so full of himself he couldnt be still jumping up and pacing to and fro that was enough for me i chatted a moment more as is my wont and strolled round by the sundial corner as he called it sentrybox sure enough and a few yards farther on an embrasure in the ivy with an old locked door the window of the emperors bedchamber is about twenty feet beyond on the storey above well cries he what dye think of that for scoutin too good to be true indeed yet why not it fitted if the secret stairway really existed and i had respect enough for bismarcks spy bandobast to be confident that it did so now cries willem we know just where to watch if it is the secret door and they come that way it is and they will says he impatiently im sure of it but well run no risks he pulled a chair beside the sofa and sat close ive thought it all out and im afraid says he with a mockrueful grin that you maynt like it cos youll miss most o the sport sorry old chap from that moment you may be sure i was all ears its this way my rooms next door here but were some way from the emperors quarters our corridor leads to the main part of the house which is like so many of these royal places one room opening on to another and then another and so on but then theres another passage to the emperors rooms an anteroom where his orderly sleeps and then the royal bedchamber overlookin the sundial garden theres a room off the passage for the aides ah youve met em couple of society buffoons so thats the lie o the land he paused to light another whiff you see the point there are only two ways to come at franzjosef either by the secret stair or along the passage leadin past the aides room to his quarters plug those and hes secure now says he leaning close ill lay odds the holnup will come through the garden in the dead watch around four lay out the sentry quietly jemmy the door then upstairs and goodnight franzjosef all hail crown prince rudolf but just in case they enter the house some other way one of us will lurk by the passage while tother is in the garden coverin the secret doorway you follow organisation i followed and relief was surging through me like the wave of the sea as he went on you at the passage et moi in the garden no shut up harry it must be so because once the smoke has cleared and the holnup are laid stiff and stark i can say i couldnt sleep and was just takin a stroll and ran into em see that wouldnt answer for you with your game leg whereas if youre watchin the passage inside and someone happens along you can always say you were lookin for the thundercloset that means says i frowning that youll tackle em alone one against perhaps three perhaps more no more than three if so many says he baring his teeth never fear harry theyre dead men his hands moved like lightning and there was the webley in one fist and the derringer in tother with all respect old fellow i doubt if youre as quick with a piece as i or as good a shot dont know about that says i looking glum while repressing an urge to sing hallelujah how many night ambushes have you laid enough says he jauntily cheer up perhaps theyll come through the house after all and afterwards how dyou explain that you went for a night stroll with a gun in your pocket i didnt discoverin miscreants tryin to break in with evil intent i gamely tackled em disarmed one and bobs your uncle as they say i still dont like it i lied wed be better with two in the garden no says he flatly one must be in the house you when you hear a shot make for your room and then emerge hobblin and roarin for enlightenment when i hear a shot ill be out o doors before you know it you may be good starnberg but ive forgotten more about night fighting than youll ever know and that my son is that its always been second nature with me to act sullenreluctant when ive been denied the prospect of battle and murder suits my character you see in the event that he had to tackle the holnup alone the last thing id dream of doing would be to hasten to his aid back to bed and snug down deaf as a post that would be the ticket for flashy and he could have the glory to himself which i realised was what hed intended all along id been necessary for gaining admittance and all the rest had been so much gas well good luck willem and i hope you kill a lot of hungarians in the meantime i looked sour vowing to be in at the death and he laughed and said well so be it my presence in the garden with my game leg might seem odd but with the emperor preserved no one would think twice about it likely then he took a big breath and sat back delighted with himself and his planning and fell to admiring bismarcks uncanny genius and how it was all falling out precisely as he had forecast but mostly he was nursing his blood lust i knew anticipating the pleasure of shooting assassins in the back no doubt he was what hickok called a killing gentleman was our willem just like dear old dad dinner at five with franzjosef would have been a dam dreary business no doubt if i hadnt been so full of inward rejoicing at my reprieve and consequently at peace with all mankind i made my appearance limping on a stick and his majesty combined his congratulations with a dour warning against overexertion he was one of these unfortunates who have been created stuffy by god and whose efforts to unbend create discomfort and unease in all concerned chiefly himself it reminded me of a pompous master condescending to the fags even when he had the words he couldnt get the tune at all for example when he informed me over the soup that he had only poor command of english he managed to convey that the fault lay not only with his boyhood tutors but with me for speaking the dam language in the first place even his compliment to my german sounded like a reproach i responded with a wheeze id once heard that a gift for languages was useful only to headwaiters and willem played up by saying hed been told that it was a sign of low intelligence franzjosef rolled a breadpill gloomily and said that wasnt what his tutors had told him and he had no experience of headwaiters after this flying start we ate in silence until franzjosef began to question me solemnly about indian army camp discipline and sanitary arrangements with particular reference to care of the feet in hot climates i did my best and like a fool ventured wellingtons joke when the queen asked him what was the aroma from the ranks of the guards and nosey replied esprit de corps maam that was met with a vacant stare so i guessed he didnt speak french too well either the only topics that seemed to bring him to life were horses and gameshooting he knew his business about the former and was im told an expert rider as for the latter about which he prosed interminably i can say only that my abiding memory of ischl lodge is of rank upon rank of chamois horns covering the walls from floor to ceiling wherever you went all shot by the royal sportsman there must have been thousands of them after dinner the real merriment began when we played a game of tarok a sort of whist and i can testify that to his linguistic shortcomings the austrian emperor added an inability to count and pondered each card at length before playing it i guess the fun was too much for him for after a couple of rubbers he went back to work at his desk and we were free to return to our rooms and wait i cant recall many nights longer than that one even though id been excused active service so to speak i was like a cat on hot bricks and willem was no better we played every twohanded game we knew in my room and he was too edgy to cheat even about eight oclock an orderly brought us tea when what i needed was brandy about a pint and a half and we learned that the emperor was used to retire to bed about nine and the establishment closed down accordingly sure enough we heard the tramp of the sergeant and sentry beneath the window marching round the house and distant words of command as the sentry was posted damned old martinet mutters willem as we heard the heavy tread of the sergeants return fading as he went round to the guardhouse at the front imagine barkin orders as if it were a parade i suppose its for franzjosefs benefit as he says his prayers the sentrys relieved every three hours by the way and you may be sure the holnup know that so between three and six will be their best time well be on the watch from ten though theyd hardly come before that the place is like a tomb what price ischl for high jinks eh id rather have stockholm on a sunday now ill take you along to your post which is in the last of the dayrooms from which the passage runs to the emperors billet and the aides quarters theres a nice shadowy corner where you can watch the passage entry and on tother side of the room theres a flight of stairs leading down to a little hall where ill get out by a window he paused thinking if they come tonight as i feel they will youd best use your judgment when the shootin starts a few quick shots will mean its all over if theres still firin after twenty seconds well twill mean there are more of em than i bargain for if they dont come back to bed with you when the house begins to stir ill be out takin the morning air he added with a wink all clear then all sereneo it wasnt of course but i gave him my resolute chinup look and got his approving nod best take your stick in case anyone comes on you unexpected in the small hours tho i doubt if therell be a soul about before dawn unless says he looking comical the holnup diddle us by coming through the house in which case well good huntin you lucky bastard he moved quickly to the door peeped out and slipped into the corridor motioning me to follow there was a light burning at the far end but not a sound in the building save the occasional creak of its timbers willem flitted ahead like a ghost and what wed have said if someone had popped a head out and found us roaming the darkened house god knows we crossed what hed called the dayrooms one after another they had lamps burning low and here and there the waning moon struck a shaft of light through a window and the embers of a fire glowed in the shadows at last he paused flicking a finger to his left and i saw a flight of stairs leading down into the blackness he pointed to his right and there was the dark opening of the passage leading to franzjosefs room a lamp gleamed dimly on a table at the passage entry and now willem pointed to a shadowy corner to the left of the passage and a few feet from it where i could see a big leather chair at his nod i moved quietly towards it then he blew out the passage light leaving the room in darkness i didnt hear him move but suddenly i sensed him beside me his hand gripping mine and his voice close to my ear good luck old un and then a whispered chuckle aint this the life though infernal idiot a second later his shadow was at the head of the stairs and soon after i heard below the faint noise of a sash being raised and closed again and good riddance and then well dyou know there was nothing to do but sit about a prey to what they call conflicting emotions id run a fair range of them in the past few days some damned disturbing a few delightful with kralta but mostly bewildering and now seated in that great leather contraption i tried to take stock of what was youll allow an unusual situation here was i in the summer residence of the emperor of austria loaded for bear waiting for bloody murder to break out in his policies but the odd thing was that now that the grip had come i wasnt more than half nervous let alone scared i was as well out of harms way as any man in the place willem could bear the brunt and the aftermath with everyone behaving like headless chickens should provide some entertainment hed be the hero of the hour but id garner some credit if only by limping about looking stern and impressing the excitable krauteaters with my british phlegm a little discreet lying when i saw hutton again would ensure that favourable reports reached london and paris and after an amiable parting from franzjosef it would be hey for vienna with a grateful and adoring kralta she was a happy thought as i sat cosily ensconced in the dark still warm from the dead fireplace odd female handsome enough in her horsy way with the body of a dahomey amazon and appetite to match but would she have boiled my kettle in the ordinary way of things perhaps twas the strange circumstances in which wed met or the contrast between her icy damnyou style and the passion with which she performed that had me drying my chin at my randy recollections that fur robe slipping to the floor like the unveiling of a lovely marble statue the long limbs entwining with mine the silky hair across my face aye vienna beckoned right enough and on those blissful imaginings i settled comfortably to my vigil in the hours ahead to awake with a start shivering against the cold that had stolen over the darkened room while i slept for how long the soft single chime of a clock might mean one oclock or a quarter but i had no feeling of cramp so i couldnt have been far under but what had wakened me the clock or the cold or some other disturbance and suddenly my hair bristled on my neck as i became aware of a faint scraping sound from the hall below followed by a rustle and a soft thump jesus there was someone moving there and the scrape had been the raising of the window by which willem had departed could he be returning no why the hell should he but who then and i froze in terror the sweat breaking out on me like ice for it could mean only one thing that the stupid swines calculations had been all wrong and the holnup had never heard of his confounded secret stair but were slipping into the house burglarstyle intent on their murderous errand and even now cloaked and sinister figures were at the foot of the stairs listening then gliding stealthily forward a stair creaked sharply and i started half out of my chair fumbling for the levaux straining eyes and ears against the dark another creak and a hissing whisper someone stumbled and cursed and then to my amazement a voice began croaking softly in drunken song about lieber klein matilde only to be hushed by a snarled oath and wo ist die kerze streichholz dummkopf followed by a giggling hiccup a match rasped in the gloom a faint glow appeared below and i almost collapsed with relief as slowly up the stairs lurched tweedledum holding a candle unsteadily aloft with tweedledee clinging to him for support they were in dress uniform and by the look of them had crawled through every pub in ischl ive seldom seen tighter subalterns but tweedledum at least was plainly alive to the danger of waking the emperor for he staggered with elaborate caution whispering to his mate to be quiet and must have seen me in my corner if tweedledee hadnt blown the candle out with an enormous belch this set him giggling again tweedledum dropped the matches they blundered whimpering in the dark and would most certainly have come to grief if tweedledum hadnt insisted that they proceed on hands and knees they crawled through the furniture more or less quietly and presently i heard their door close softly and peace returned to the royal lodge but not to me perhaps it was the cold or the unholy scare theyd given me but as i sat shivering in the dark envying those drunken pups their beds i was conscious of a growing unease which was quite at odds with the lustful moonings about kralta on which id dropped off i couldnt figure it nothing about my situation had changed and yet where id been fairly tranquil before i was now thoroughly rattled very well im a windy beggar whose hopes and fears go up and down like a jackinthebox but this wasnt so much fear as a presentiment that something was wrong damned wrong and i couldnt put my finger on it twasnt a logical foreboding but pure animal instinct and thank god for it cos it made me stir restlessly and my fidgeting changed the course of history at the recent alarm i had clutched at the levaux in my pocket and at some point must have drawn it for now i found i was nervously fiddling its patent safety catch on and off and turning the cylinder that reminded me with a nasty start that willem hadnt given me the promised extra rounds hed said it was loaded in five chambers and in sudden anxiety i probed with my pinky in the dark trying to feel the tips of the slugs in the cylinders but couldnt so i broke the piece open not knowing that it was one of the newfangled models with an extractor plate that whips all the shells out together and squealed with dismay as bullets flew broadcast clattering on the floor and rolling god alone knew where and there i was with an unloaded firearm my ammunition hopelessly lost in the dark and nothing for it but to grovel blindly in search of the bloody things cursing fate and the imbecility of french gunsmiths and their ridiculous patent gadgets as if anyone needed them frantic scrabbling round the chair brought one bullet to hand leaving four to find and since id no intention of having only a single shot between me and damnation i must have light whatever the consequences i had no matches but stay tweedledum had dropped his somewhere id heard them spilling all over the shop so now i went panting on all fours in quest of them lost my bearings altogether fell into the fireplace struggled out coated in dead ash fetched my head a shattering crash on a chairleg and only found the scattered matches when i knelt on them in a trice i had one lighted and was kindling the lamp and a moment later i had scooped up three of the fallen rounds near the chair and was casting about for the fourth it was lying close to the fender at least the case was but i drew in an astonished breath when i saw that the bullet itself had become detached and lay a few inches away in fifty years of handling firearms id never known the like what a slug clamped tight in the brass case coming asunder with a trembling hand i turned the little case to the light it was empty and there wasnt a trace of powder where it had fallen an icy hand gripped my stomach as i held each of the other whole rounds in turn close to the lamp every one bore marks on the edge of the case as though it had been pried back to remove the slug indeed i was able to pull one bullet free and saw to my horror that the case itself was empty willem had removed the charges from all five cartridges replacing the slugs in them so that they looked like live rounds and if one hadnt come loose in falling to the floor id never have known that i had in effect an empty revolver the discovery that youve been sold a pup is always disconcerting but your reaction depends on age and experience in infancy you burst into tears and smash something in adolescence you may be bewildered in riper manhood common sense usually tells you to bolt which was my instinct on the pearl river when i learned that my lorcha was carrying not opium as id supposed but guns for the taiping rebels but at sixtyone your brain works faster than your legs so you reflect and as often as not reach the right answer by intuition as well as reason kneeling in that cold shadowy chamber goggling at those five useless rounds gleaming in the dim lamplight i knew in a split second that willem himself was the assassin not the guardian and now that id served my turn by helping him to within striking distance of the emperor hed rendered me powerless to intervene in his murderous scheme but it was a staggering thought dammit why should he a german junker a trusted agent of bismarck want to kill franzjosef doing the dirty work of hungarian fanatics like kossuth and the holnup kossuth by god that was the bell that rang to confirm my conclusion as i remembered him telling me on the train that his own mothers name was kossuth and that he was parthungarian by blood aye and pure hungarian devil a doubt in heart and soul and allegiance flown with the wild dream of independence for his mother country and itching to fire the shot or wield the steel that would set her free and plunge europe into civil war all this surmised in an instant and whether twas all another great devilment of bismarcks or whether bismarck was guiltless and willem had duped him as hed duped me didnt matter one thing was sure i was implicated up to the neck and as i knelt there sweating my imagination was picturing willem out yonder full of spite and sin disposing of the hapless sentry humouring the lock of the secret door stealing up the secret stair knife in hand to the room where his royal victim was asleep or dead already i glanced in terror towards the passage entry quick or dead franzjosef was within forty feet of me oh christ how long had willem been gone i didnt know was it too late to stop him perhaps not but that was no work for me bigod not if id had ten loaded pistols and the royal marines at my back not for franzjosef and a dozen like him would i have gone up against willem von starnberg and as for europe but even as i took the first instinctive stride of panicstricken flight i came to a shuddering halt as the awful truth struck me i couldnt run it would be certain death for if willem had killed or was about to kill the emperor id be seen as his partner in crime and while he would have his own escape nicely planned id not have the ghost of a chance of avoiding capture with the whole country on the lookout and id never persuade them i was an innocent tool or acting under orders from downing street why it was odds on id be shot on sight or cut down on the spot before i could utter a word in my defence i didnt faint at the thought but only the knowledge that i must act at once enabled me to fight down my mounting panic should i raise the alarm god no i darent for if franzjosef was already a goner id be cooked the only hope was that willem hadnt done for him yet and that i could still and that was when my legs almost gave way and i found myself fairly sobbing with fear for i knew i must go out into the ghastly dark and find the murderous bastard and kill or disable him why even if franzjosef was already tuning up with the choir invisible i might wriggle clear if i could show that id flown to the rescue too late alas oh jesus theyd never believe me im innocent gentlemen i swear it i was bleating it softly in the darkness and time was racing by and id nothing but an empty pistol but suppose willem was still picking the lock or waiting for moonset or for his holnup confederates to arrive or pausing to relieve himself or have a smoke or for any other reason you like and i could just steel myself to sally forth and find him whispering raucously to identify myself well he might wonder what the blazes i was about but hed not shoot before asking questions and i still had the seamans knife id slipped into my boot on the orient express and hed be off guard he might even turn his back on me well it was that or the hangmans rope unless they still went in for beheading in austria on that happy thought i put up my empty piece transferred the knife from my boot to my pocket and crept as fast as might he down the stairs with my heart against my back teeth there was the window pale in the gloom i slipped over the sill to the ground and realised id no notion where the sundial corner was i forced myself to envisage the house from above there was the emperors room here was i on t other side and there the guardroom by the front porch so i must make my way cautiously by the back there was still faint moonlight casting shadows from the trees and bushes and the loom of the house just visible to guide me as i crept along my fingers brushing the ivy in my imagination the undergrowth was full of mad hungarians waiting to leap out and knife me and once i rose like a startled grouse as an owl hooted only a few yards away round one corner peering cautiously along the wall towards another and there was something glittering in the dark off to one side and i saw that it was the moonlight on a little puddle of rainwater that had collected on what might well be the surface of a sundial and in that moment from just beyond the corner i was approaching came a sound that sent shivers down my spine a faint clicking noise of metal and the rustle of someone moving i tried to whisper and failed gulped and tried again willem are you there its me harry dead silence save for the pounding of my heart and then the faintest of sounds a foot scraping the ground and after what seemed an age willems whisper was ist das harry is that you he was still outside relief flooded through me to be followed by a drench of fear at the thought of what i must do i drew the knife from my pocket holding it against my thigh and edged my way round the corner the ivy was thick on the wall just there but there was light enough to see a dark opening a couple of yards ahead the recess of the secret doorway and just within it the pale outline of a face i took another step and the face hissed at me what the hell are you doing here in his agitation he lapsed into german stimmt etwas nicht whats up man where the inspiration came from god knows the emperor aint in bed i whispered hoarsely he he got up his aides made a din and woke him arschloch whether he meant me or franzjosef i cant say but it was enough to assure me i was right he was bent on murder for if hed been the innocent guardian why the deuce should he care whether the emperor was abed or not the clicking id heard must have been his working on the lock gad if he decided to give up for the night i might not have to risk attacking him i could pour out my tale to the emperor in the morning denouncing willem clearing myself a whirlwind of wild hopes you see as i crouched peering at the dim face a yard away near soiling myself in agitation and then those hopes were dashed as he spoke again soft and steady back inside with you hes bound to go back to bed presently and they may still come go on man be off quickly and leave you to unpick the lock and do your business thinks i there was only one thing for it i gripped the hilt hard stepping closer and as he opened his mouth to speak again i struck upwards going for his throat he ducked like lightning the blade drove past missing by an inch his hand clamped on my wrist and as he twisted and i strove to wrench free clawing fingers came out of the darkness on my right fumbling for my throat a fist smashed against my left temple and i was hurled backwards and flung to the turf pinned helpless by a massive body while another seized my legs and a great stinking paw closed on my mouth they must have been there unseen in the gloom his holnup accomplices springing into action with the speed and silence of expert bravos i struggled like bedamned expecting to feel the agonising bite of steel but it didnt come the hands on my mouth and throat tightened and i felt rather than saw a bearded face snarling into mine in what may have been hungarian above us in the dark voices were whispering urgently willem seemed to be giving orders and for an instant the hand lifted from my mouth but before i could find the breath to bellow a cloth was thrust between my teeth and i was heaved over on to my face and my wrists pinioned behind me meanwhile the debate overhead was deteriorating into agitated bickering and since some of it was in german and my mind was most wonderfully concentrated i gathered that willem didnt know why id attacked him and didnt care but if the emperor was up and about theyd best ignore the secret stair and invade the house in force no no says another the englanders lying they always do and storming the house was too haphazard and the aroused guardroom would be too many for them to which a third voice said the hell with such timidity their lives would be well lost if they could only settle franzjosef theres always one like that you know full of patriotic lunacy and good luck to him the heavyweight atop of me weighed in with the sensible suggestion that since subduing me had caused enough row to wake the dead they should give over and come back tomorrow but before this could be put to the vote he was proved right by a challenge from the darkness a bawled order the pounding of boots and a stentorian command to stand in the name of the emperor willem exclaimed mist his webley cracked there was a yell of pain and then bedlam ensued with shots and oaths and screams the dark was split by flashes of fire i heard a clash of steel my incubus arose bawling in several languages and blazing away and i hastened to improve my position by scrambling up inadvertently butting him in the crotch he fell away howling and i managed to gain my feet and would have been going like a stag for the safety of the shrubbery if he hadnt staggered into me bewailing his damaged courting tackle and i fell full length only to rise again on steppingstones of my terrified self but not alas to higher things for something caught me an excruciating clout on the back of the skull and the din of shots and shouting faded as i fell again this time into merciful unconsciousness i suppose ive been laid out and come to with a head throbbing like an engineroom more often than most fellows and can testify that while one descent into oblivion is much like another there are two kinds of awakening after a dizzy moment in which you recall your last conscious memory and wonder where the devil you are realisation dawns and it may be blissful as at jallalabad or in the cave in the bighorn mountains when i knew that the hell and honor were behind me and it was bedtime and all well or you may come round hanging by the heels from a cottonwood with the apache ladies sewing circle preparing to tickle your fancy or strapped over a cannon muzzle with the gunners blowing on their fuses having known the last two i can tell you that waking to find yourself bound hand and foot on a campbed underground while alarming aint too bad by comparison and when your smiling captor inquires after your health and offers refreshment well hope springs eternal you know for willem von starnberg was bending over me all solicitude and sounding absolutely lighthearted the guvnor was right never forget that fellows like flashman always come at you when least expected usually from behind should ha paid more attention to the old chap shouldnt i he put a hand behind my head and i yelped hoarsely splittin to beat the band eh no wonder zoltan fetched you a dooce of a clip youve been limp as a dead fish for hours care for some schnapps where the hell am i what whats happened my voice came out in a quavering croak as he removed the flask from my lips and as i struggled into a sitting position with his help my questions trailed off in amazement as i took in my surroundings we were alone in an enormous cavern of what looked like limestone grey stone at any rate but with an odd sheen to its towering walls we were at one end close by the black mouth of a tunnel from which ran wooden rails bearing a couple of ancient wheeled bogie trucks the rails ran for about thirty yards into the cave to what looked like a cleft in the floor and there must have been a bridge once for i could see that the rails continued on the other side of the cleft before being lost in the gloom the place was like some cathedral made by nature huge and empty and utterly silent and staring up i saw that high overhead there was a fissure in the roof fringed by a tangle of growth from the world outside and this was the only source of light glistening dimly on those gigantic smooth curving walls the floor of the cavern was smooth too and innocent of loose rocks or rubble as though some giant housekeeper had swept the great chamber clean but the wonder of the place that made me catch my breath even in my groggy condition was the little lake that covered almost half the cavern floor on the far side away from the rails very well twas only water a natural bath in the stone but never was water so still or clear or silent the surface was like glass extending perhaps thirty yards in length by twenty across to the far wall and in its crystal depths undisturbed by current or eddy you could make out every detail of the stone bottom ten feet down as though no water had been there at all no fish could have swum in it or weeds grown it was immaculate like some enchanted mere of fairy tale an icewitchs mirror in the heart of a magic mountain only by the tunnel mouth where i lay were there signs of human occupation a rough stone fireplace and utensils palliasses and campbeds plain chairs and table a couple of packingcases and a litter of stores and gear but like ourselves these worldly things seemed out of place and dwarfed in the awful majesty of the cavern the cold was fit to freeze you to the bone youre in an old saltmine in the saltzkammergut in the mountains above ischl says willem jolly little tomb aint it harkaway he had raised his voice and the echo came back in an eerie whisper harkaway away away fading ever so softly in the unseen reaches of the cavern he stood cocking an appreciative ear very trim in riding boots breeches and shooting jacket and none the worse it seemed for the freeforall shooting match which was the last thing i remembered were near the surface here says he but god knows how far the tunnels go below the place hasnt been worked for years dye know when i was a nipper i pictured saltmines as hellish places where slaves with redrimmed eyes waded kneedeep in the stuff but its rather grand and spooky dont you think splendid bolthole too for clandestine plotters like the holnup my lads were camped here for a week but ive had to send em off now thanks to you he perched on a packingcase cradling his knee and gave me his quizzy look when did you twig i was the fox at the henroost then cut me loose first croaks i but he only grinned and repeated the question so i told him about finding the tampered cartridges and he swore and slapped his thigh laughing ill be damned thats what comes o bein too clever by half oh and bein in awe of your fearsome reputation ironic aint it i gave you a harmless pistol by way of insurance but if id given you a loaded one franzjosef would have been with his fathers by now or if youd come on the scene a minute later even oh aye we had the lock picked and i was about to go aloft when you arrived with your little snickersnee curse you and then that damned sergeant and his sentries and we had to shoot our way clear and lost two good men one of em your pal gunther youll be desolated to learn ah well cest la guerre youd have thought he was describing a rag in the dormitory chuckling with hardly a sign of irritation oh he was rudis boy all right cool as a trout and regarding me with amusement so there it is cries he franzjosef lives on two of my boys dont there aint a hope of a return match with half a regiment round the place by now i imagine supposin fj hasnt decamped for vienna already the conspiracy is kaput ive had to disperse the best band of nightrunners i ever hope to see and four weeks of dam good plannin have gone down the bogs he jumped down from his seat and stood before me hands on hips yes sir the guvnor was right you truly are an inconvenient sonofabitch still no hard feelins what not on my side leastways call me a sceptic if you will but i doubted it id come within a whisker of cutting his throat ruined his plot all unwitting and cost him two men dead and he didnt mind a bit no this could only be catandmouse in the best starnberg tradition and his claws would show presently in the meantime with my innards turning cartwheels i pretended to take him at face value glad to hear it says i then you wont mind cutting these infernal ropes certainly by and by says he when my arrangements for departure are complete austrias a trifle warm just now you see what with two dead desperadoes under the emperors window a sentry with a slit weasand and those two mysterious visitors flashman and starnberg vanished none knows whither it wouldnt surprise me says the sardonic pup if they started lookin for us which is why i intend to be over the italian border by daybreak tomorrow ive no inclination to grace an austrian gallows or rot in a brandenburg fortress which is whatll happen if bismarck ever learns the truth of our little soiree yestreen hed have my ballocks for breakfast that settled one thing so last night was off your own bat bismarck had nothing to do with it he stared with our gallant attempt to snuff franzjosefs wick you mean good lord no my word you do have a low opinion of our worthy chancellor he grinned at my bewilderment i see ill have to explain two months ago the holnup learned that fj was comin to ischl without his usual retinue and would be a sittin bird for assassination plans were laid for a night attack on the lodge but bismarck got wind of it from a spy in the holnup council and devised his great plan for guardin the emperor just as kralta and i told you what he didnt know when he entrusted it to me his loyal agent he went on looking waggish was that i happen to be a greatnephew of lajos kossuth himself and have been a member of the holnup since boyhood and that in choosin me to guard the great booby he was playin into our hands makin our task even easier by handin me on a plate the golden opportunity that every hungarian patriot has been prayin for this ten years past you may be sure he added that weve identified the spy in our council and have left him strictly alone for the time being he paused and just for a moment the bantering manner dropped from him like a cloak the boyish face was set and his eyes were far away as he said softly and we were so close another moment another few seconds and the blow would have been struck that would have freed hungary from the hapsburgs forever holnup holnuputan he gave a deep sigh and slowly unclenched his hands and then he was himself again shaking his head at me in mock reproach you really have been an uncommon nuisance you know for some reason despite my fears this infuriated me because i stopped you from committing murder why you dam fool i saved your lousy life more like bismarck would have had more than your ballocks hed have had your neck he regarded me pityingly oh ye of little faith dyou think im a halfwit it was all arranged once fj had kicked the bucket wed have fetched you out o the house quietlike tapped you gently on your great fat head laid you out beside the royal corpse with a bloody knife in your hand and left you to explain matters when you woke up he regarded my expression of stupefied horror with cheerful satisfaction of course theyd have hanged you if they hadnt finished you off on the spot but dont you see i could then have pleaded injured innocence to bismarck pointing out that it wasnt i who brought you into the business and that you must have gone berserk or been a holnup hireling all unsuspected or killed fj for love of the beauteous sissi or anythin at all hed ha swallowed it besides that would have been the least of his troubles with the dogs of war slippin all over the parish and everyone blamin perfidious albion as usual and gladstone havin apoplexy he shrugged aye me the bestlaid schemes what was the phrase young hawkins used in his book surely while youre above ground hell wants its master spoken of the fictitious image of rudi von starnberg but by god it fitted his abominable son even better sitting there while he lighted another of his blasted cigarettes was he mad perhaps and why had he brought me to this ghastly solitude it made no sense for if hed wanted me dead they could have done for me in the fight at the lodge was it possible that his geniality was genuine and that he didnt mean me harm after all no for why was i bound hand tomorrow the day after tomorrow and foot the evil bastard had brought me here to gloat and he must have read my thoughts for so what now you wonder says he well harry thats a hard one damned hard you see the fact is that i like you and none the less because youve baulked me altogether indeed all the more and its just a lost trick in the game anyway ill settle franzjosef one way or tother and before long too you may count on that and then twill all come right and hungary will be free soil but thats by the way he seated himself on his packingcase again blowing smokerings and watching them hang motionless in that windless cavern while my skin crawled the hard thing though is that while youre a man after my own heart just as you were after the guvnors and id like to clap hands and part friends and damned if he didnt sound as though he meant it you know too much you see at the moment what happened last night is all a great mystery officially what do they know franzjosefs people that someone was tryin to do him in theunlocked door and dead sentry tell em that and that it was a holnup job the other dead un we had to leave with gunther was a magyar and a notorious firebrand and that you and i were in the business some way or other what then whatever they suspect they cant prove a blessed thing against you and me unless were fool enough to let ourselves be collared in the next day or two while the trails hot and theyre still full of zeal after that theyll be quite thankful to forget about us and they can keep the whole unfortunate business quiet see i saw all right and was struck by the sinister significance of the words you know too much he continued which is why i shall lie low in italy for a spell before presentin myself to bismarck wholl have no earthly reason to suspect me au contraire hell welcome me with open arms on the face of it his great scheme will have worked to admiration dont you see he sat forward eyes shining the holnup struck failed and left two of their number stark and stiff bravo starnberg and flashy cries otto couldnt have done better myself thats what hes bound to think and i shant disillusion him if he wonders why we didnt stay to take the credit ill say it seemed ive never known as i told you what you and he were up to in strackenz all those years ago some stunt of otto bismarcks wasnt it but i do know that you had the deuce of a turnup at the last sabre to sabre in some castle or other and twas the guvnors lastin regret that it didnt go a loutrance i dont know what came between you but i wouldnt mind havin a quid for every time i heard the old chap say i only wish id settled flashman he was a strong swordsman and up to every foul trick but i was better aye if only i could ha finished it thats what he said he turned away to reach in among some gear piled on a case by the tunnel mouth and when he faced me again he had a dress sabre unsheathed in either hand the slim blades glittering wickedly in the pale light from the cavern roof so i feel bound to finish it for him says he but but i struggled for speech you must be crazy for gods sake man theres no need ive told you i shant breathe a bloody word ill be silent as the grave thats the ticket cries he couldnt ha put it better myself and speakin of graves you couldnt ask a grander mausoleum than this he flourished a point at our ghastly surroundings pretty gothic what oh shut up do dont tell me youd not squeal your head off when the traps got you cos its a lie and we both know it and it dont matter anyway im doin this out o filial piety he inserted the blade between my ankles and cut the cord there now you can frisk like a lamb and limber up for the fray harry be nimble eh youll need to be i promise damn you for a fool i struggled off the bed you cant mean it why its madness ive told you i shant talk havent i you can trust me i tell you i took an unsteady step and tumbled rolling on the floor loose my hands rot you and listen you ass your guvnor would never have stood for this we were chums dammit comrades rudi and i you said it yourself he told you i was a man after his own heart he did he also advised me to shoot you on sight so count yourself lucky come on upsadaisy he whacked me on the rump with the flat of the blade and i scrambled up cursing now then im goin to untie your wrists give you a moment to ease the cramps away and when youre ready youre goin to pick up that sabre he tossed one of them on to the bed and well take up where you and the guvnor left off savvy savvy be damned ill not do it heavens man wheres the sense to it you cant bear me any grudge i whined i didnt try to spoil your beastly plot apart from almost severin my jugular but i dont hold that against you all in the way o business he tapped his point on my breast so is this ill not fight i tell you i shouted almost in tears you cant make me true enough says he and i cant run a helpless man through can i his smile became wicked might persuade you though if youll just step this way he prodded me backwards along by the rails and perforce i retreated pleading and blaspheming by turn while he requested me to pass along the bus please before seizing my shoulder spinning me round and gripping my bound wrists steady the buffs dont want you fallin and hurtin yourself yet i dam near swooned we were on the very lip of the cleft where the rails ended and i was staring down aghast into a narrow chasm whose smooth walls were visible for only a few yards before they vanished into black nothingness i swayed giddily on the brink my crotch shrinking as i tried to rear back from that awful void but willem held me in an iron grip chuckling at my shoulder a soldiers sepulchre what thats where your mortal coil is goin when youve shuffled it off cant tell how deep it is but it looks as though it narrows a bit some distance down like those jolly french oubliettes so youll probably stick fast you wont mind bein dead on tother hand if you wont fight ill just have to drop you in alive and the stickin process might last some time wouldnt you think that was when i broke the horror of that gaping shaft the thought of falling into blackness the tearing agony of rasping to a flayed bloody stop between the confining walls jammed and helpless to die by inches rotting in the bowels of the earth i raved begging him to let me be promising never to tell struggling like a maniac until he pulled me away and i sank to my knees weeping buckets and babbling for mercy promising him a fortune if hed only spare me he listened in some wonder and then laughed as though a light had dawned ill be jiggered cries he its the flashman gambit grovel and whine then strike when your mans off guard didnt i tell you the guvnor warned me to beware when you started showin the white feather well youre doin it a shade too brown harry and twont answer you know im fly to you sides i probably have more cash in the bank than you do help i hollered help murder let me be you lousy bully you cruel bastard you i aint shamming you infernal idiot i swear im not oh please starnberg willem bill let me go and ill never tell help oh cheese it you daft dummy he grabbed my neck and pushed me prone and the cords at my wrists fell away as he cut them through he stepped swiftly back as though expecting me to go for him and watched me warily he absolutely wasnt sure whether i was bluffing or not thats what a reputation does for you then he wheeled about strode away to the campbed picked up the other sabre and sent it slithering and clinking over the stone in my direction playactor the guvnor called you didnt he says he well i dont know and whats more i dont much care but im gettin cold and if you dont take up that tool double quick ill pitch you down that hole without benefit of clergy dye hear so get up and come on you cant mean to butcher me i wailed my god man havent you any bowels neer mind about my bowels sneers he casting aside his jacket youll be admirin your own presently on guard theres a moment and ive faced it more often than i care to remember when youre ratinthecorner all your wriggling and lying and imploring have failed theres nowhere to run and your only hope is to do your damnedest and trust to luck and every dirty dodge you know for a split second i wondered if his last threat had meant that hed tackle me barehanded and if perhaps i was stronger than he but no in my lusty youth perhaps but not now against that lithe young athlete all steel and whipcord i must just take my chance with the blade i picked it up and somehow the feel of the wirebound grip steadied me not much but enough to face him as he waited poised on his toes sleek as a panther the fine tawny head thrown back and the arrogant smile on his lips and i felt the tiniest spark of hope whether my blubbering had truly made him wonder or not i couldnt tell but one thing was sure he hadnt fooled me oh he needed me dead for his skins sake right enough but he wasnt thinking of that now nor of sacrificing me to rudis shade which was so much eyewash no what was gripping master starnberg was the sheer wanton delight in killing of adding my distinguished head to his trophy room of proving his mastery and seeing the fear in the eyes of the beaten opponent at his mercy i know all about it you see for ive enjoyed it myself but while its a luxury that a wary coward can afford its a weakness in a brave man whos sure of his own superiority for he forgets what your coldblooded assassin never forget that killing is a business not a pleasure and you must keep your sense of fun well in check another thing he was an academic swordsman if ever i saw one beautifully balanced as he glided forward and saluted smirking falling into the sabre guard with an ease that would have done de gautets heart good to see well id taken the brilliant de gautet unawares and i doubted if starnberg was any smarter so i gripped my hilt tight like the rawest dragoon recruit took a hesitant shuffle forward and played my first card it aint fair i whined ive been trussed like a fowl and im an old man damn you by gad if i were your age youd think twice you prancing pimp aint you your fathers son though taking every mean advantage wait rot your boots i aint ready god he was quick one whip of his wrist and his blade was slicing at my neck and if i hadnt practised my favourite retire which is to fall backwards howling my head would have been on the carpet i scrambled up shaken one hope gone for id intended to move close mumping piteously and give him the point unexpected now he came in like a dancer unsmiling and bursting with bloodlust cutting left and right the blades clashing and grating and i had to break ground to avoid being driven back to that awful chasm sidestepping and tripping over those confounded rails tumbling down the smooth slope almost to the waters edge he bore up swearing dyou do all your fightin flat on your back then come on man get up and look alive i cant ive jarred my elbow ahh i think its broken no its not you lyin skunk you aint hurt so pick up your sword and stay on your feet and the callous swine pricked me on the leg drawing blood i damned his eyes and came afoot moving cautiously back to the level and as he cut high and low i gave back again towards the tunnel mouth if i could lure him in among the clutter of beds and cases hed be hampered and might even stumble but he knew a trick worth two of that and drove me clear of the obstacles and hope leaped within me for if i retreated into the tunnel at my back wed both be fighting in the dark and i could drop flat and slash at his ankles you damned old fox shouts he and with one lightning flurry of his blade he was past me while i cowered and scurried warding his cuts any old how and then he was after me again snarling with laughter as he harried me back into the cavern proper his sabre seemed to be everywhere at head and shoulder and flank and once he feinted low and gave me the point but i turned it with the forte and in desperation loosed a wild scything sweep which he parried well enough but paused eyeing me with some respect why you aint so old you faker cries he though how you troubled the guvnor blowed if i know he must ha been ill he was full o wind and piss like you i panted ran like a whippet aye he didnt tell you it ended with him turning tail did he no he wouldnt not slimy starnberg i reviled rudi with every insult i could muster wheezing hoarsely as he drove me ever back for i knew twas my only hope my lungs and legs were labouring and his young strength must prevail unless i could rile him into recklessness but he was as cool as his father damn him chuckling triumphantly as i staggered away swiping and swearing bellows to mend what says he best save your breath oh stop sprintin cant you come on you old duffer stand for once and lets see what youre made of so i did not from choice but cos i was too used up to run employing the rotten swordsmans last resort the khyberknife guard of the maltese cross updownacross with all your might no opponent can touch you but he dont need to since youll die of apoplexy from exertion as id discovered back in when old ghengiz the mongol and i repelled sam collinson s bannermen at the summer palace leastways old ghengiz did while i lit out for pastures new but there was no ghengiz now to bear the brunt and i knew i couldnt last but a few moments more and then my aching arm and shoulder must fail and this grinning handsome sadist would beat down my feeble guard and drive his old steel through my shrinking carcase and it would end here in this clammy cavern with the two tiny mannikins hacking away across its floor and the echoes of clashing swords resounding from the great stone arch overhead id be cut down to death in this forgotten desolation i who had survived balaclava and cawnpore and greasy grass fort raim dungeon and gettysburg and the guns of gwalior slaughtered by this mountebank who wasnt more than half a swordsman anyway for all his academic antics or hed have settled an old crock like me ages ago and the hellish injustice and meanness of it all was like gall to my craven soul as i felt my strength ebbing and gave voice yet again to what i dare say will be my dying words one day it aint fair i dont deserve this no no wait for gods sake not yet ahhh im done for the doctor was right and i dropped my sabre clutching at my heart face contorted in agony and sank to my knees what the devil cries willem as i clasped both hands to my bosom groaning in unutterable pain gaping wide to emit a croaking wheeze and he stopped dead sabre raised for the coup de grace youre shammin you old sod cries he but he came that vital step closer and i hurled myself forward my right fist aimed see flashman and the dragon at his groin and i missed god damn it to hell for my blow caught him on the thigh and sent him staggering but not disabled and as i grabbed my sabre and let go an almighty cut that should have taken his leg off the brute parried it and came in hand and foot eyes blazing i turned and ran shrieking in anticipation of his point in my back eyes closed in panic felt myself stumbling down an incline and plunged flat on my face in freezing water i was floundering in the shallows of the little lake and as he came bounding to the margin sabre raised for a downward cut i scrambled away until i was kneedeep and out of reach i darent go farther for the cold of that hellcreated tarn was fit to freeze grendel numbing my feet and calves in seconds and i knew that immersion would mean death in minutes he stopped on the brink measuring the distance but too wary to come after me for the water must hinder his feet he swore snaking his point at me and made as downright foolish a statement as ever i heard come out of that blast you you cant run forever you callous swine i yammered go away you dirty rotter let me alone cant you oh lor my legs are freezing you hound well come out then i aint stoppin you damned if i will youd cut me down foul while i was climbing out dont be an ass as if i needed to oh well freeze or drown as you please he backed up to the level and i took a step towards the brink where my sabre lay come on pick it up says he pon my soul youre as good as a play you are you wont take me unawares cries i crouching furtivelike extending a wary hand towards my sabre youll give me a moment bill please my feet are frozen solid wont answer god forbid that the renowned flashman should die with cold feet he laughed impatiently never fear ill wait and as i put a foot on the dry stone gasping elaborately he halfturned away in contempt and i thought now or never put my hand on forte of the blade grasped it and launched it spearfashion with all my remaining strength at his unguarded flank for an instant i thought id got him for the sabre flew true as an arrow but his speed saved him hed no time to dodge but his swordhand moved like lightning the blades rang together and the flying sabre was swept high into the air to fall clattering almost at the mouth of the tunnel by which time i was on him fists and cold feet flying grappling him and down we went together in a tangle of limbs flashy roaring and willem spitting curses i took a wild punch at his head and missed yelping as my knuckles struck the stone and as i rolled away blind with pain he was on his feet cutting down at me his sword struck sparks within an inch of my head i scrambled on to all fours and came erect and there he was extending himself in a lunge that there was no avoiding and i died in that split second as his point sank home in my unprotected body what is it like to be run through ill tell you for an instant nothing then a hideous tearing agony for another instant and then nothing again as you see the blade withdrawn and the blood welling on your shirt for the pain is lost in shock and disbelief as your eyes meet your assailants its a long moment that in which you realise that you aint dead and that hes about to launch another thrust to finish you and its remarkable how swiftly you can move then with a hole clean through you from front to back about midway between your navel and your hip and spouting gore like a pump well i moved as starnberg whirled up his sabre for a cut and the pain returned with such a sickening spasm that i was near paralysed and what should have been a backward spring became an agonised stagger clutching my belly and squealing like a stuck pig his cut came so close that the point ripped my sleeve and then the back of my thighs struck something solid and i went arse over tip into one of the bogie trucks standing on the rails and the force of my arrival must have jolted its ancient wheels loose from the dust of ages for the dam thing began to move for a moment all the sense was jarred out of me and then willem shouted with laughter and through waves of pain i remembered that the rails ran slightly downwards from the tunnel mouth and that the bogie must be rolling slowly at first but with increasing momentum towards that ghastly oubliette where the rails ended if ive sinned in my time wouldnt you say ive paid for it there i was on the broad of my back legs in the air leaking blood by the pint with my guts on are confined by the sides of the truck helpless as a beetle on a card as i trundled towards certain death bellowing with pain and panic i grabbed for the top of one side missed my hold regained it with a frantic clutch and heaved myself up bodily with an agonising wrench to my wound i had a glimpse of willem shouting in glee i wont swear he didnt flourish his sabre in a farewell salute the gloating kite and as i tried to heave myself clear the confounded truck lurched throwing me off balance it was gathering speed bumping and swaying over the last few yards of track and as the front wheels went over the edge with a grating crash i tumbled over the side my shoulder hit the stone with a numbing jar and my legs were kicking in empty air i flailed my arms for a hold on the stone and by the grace of god my left hand fell on the nearside rail and i was hanging on for dear life my chest on the stone my bleeding belly below the brink of the chasm and the rest of me dangling into the void far below the falling truck was crashing against the rock walls but ill swear it made less noise than i did feeling my grip slide on the worn wood i fairly made the welkin ring striving and failing to haul myself up getting my numbed right forearm on to the surface but powerless to gain another inch my whole right side throbbing with pain and willem was striding towards me sabre in hand grinning with unholy delight as he came to a halt above me and then he hunkered down and spoke the words which were a catchphrase of my generation employed facetiously when some terrible crisis was safely past will you have nuts or a cigar sir i doubt if the noise i made in reply was a coherent request for assistance for my sweating grasp was slipping on the rail i was near fainting with my wound and already falling in tortured imagination into the stygian bowels of the saltzkammergut but he got the point im sure for he stared into my eyes and then that devilish mocking smile spread over his young face and what he did then you may believe or not as you will but if you doubt me well you didnt know willem von starnberg or rudi for that matter he rested on one knee laid down his sabre and his right hand closed on my left wrist like a vice even as my fingers slipped from the rail with his left hand he brought his cigarette case from his breast pocket selected one of his funereal smokes pushed it between my yammering lips struck a match and said amiably no cigar alas but a last cigarette for the condemned man what you may say it was the limit of diabolic cruelty and ill not dispute it or you may say he was stark crazy and ill not dispute that either at the moment i had no thoughts on the matter for i was barely conscious with no will except that which kept my right forearm on the stone knowing that when it slipped id be hanging there by his grip on my other wrist alone until he let go i know he said something about cigars being bad for the wind anyway and then gad but you do give a fellow a run for his money and on those words he gripped my collar and with one almighty heave deposited me limp gasping and bleeding something pitiful on the floor of the cave for several minutes i couldnt stir except to tremble violently and when i had breath to spare from groaning and wheezing and lamenting my punctured gut which was now more numb than painful i know i babbled a blessing or two on his head which i still maintain was natural it didnt suit him a bit though he stood looking vexed and then flung away the gasper and demanded why the devil cant you die clean to which i confess i had no ready answer if i had a thought it was that having saved me he was now bound to spare me and i guess the same thing was occurring to him and putting him out of temper but i cant say what was passing in his mind indeed to this day i cant fathom him at all i can only tell you what was said and done that morning in that godforsaken saltmine above ischl it aint a reprieve you know cries he what dye mean says i i mean that its still the union jack for you flashman retorts he the only time i think hed ever used my surname formallike and with a sneer he added words he could only have heard from rudi the game aint finished yet playactor then he snapped something i didnt catch about how if he had let me fall down the cleft id likely have found a way out at the bottom so youll go the way i choose dye see when youre done pukin and snivellin youll get up and take that sabre and stand your ground for a change my rugby hero cos if you dont ill wer ist das my wail of protest was drowned by his shouted challenge and i saw he was staring towards the tunnel mouth suddenly on his guard crouched like a great cat and my heart leaped as i saw why someone was standing just within the tunnel mouth motionless and silent a dark figure clad in closefitting shirt and britches and peaked cap but too much in shadow for the features to be made out seconds passed without reply and willem started forward a couple of paces and stopped shouting again who are you what dye want still there came no reply but as the echoes resounded from the cavern walls and died away in whispers the figure stepped swiftly forward stooped to retrieve my fallen sabre and straightened again in a stance that left no doubt of his intentions for he stood like an epee fighter at rest between bouts left hand on hip point inclined downwards above the advanced right foot willem swore in astonishment and shot a glance at me lying bemused and bleeding but i was as baffled as he and my hopes were shooting skywards for this mysterious apparition was salvation surely issuing an unspoken challenge to my oppressor and i was mustering breath to bawl for help when speak up damn you cries willem who are you the newcomer said not a word but tilted up his point in invitation well enough then cries willem and laughed whoever you are well have two for the price o one what and he went in at a run cutting left and right at the head but the newcomer sidestepped nimbly parrying and riposting like an angelo so help me tossing aside the peaked cap to clear his vision and as the light from above fell full on his features i absolutely cried out in amazement either this was all a dream or the horrors id endured had turned my brain for i was staring at a stark impossibility a hallucination the face of the swordsman fresh and youthful under its mop of auburn curls was one that id last seen smiling wantonly up at me from a lace pillow five years ago the face of my little charmer of berlin caprice it was mad ridiculous couldnt be true and i was seeing things until willems startled oath told me i wasnt the graceful lines of the figure in its male costume the dainty shift of the small feet as much as the pretty little face so unexpectedly revealed fairly shouted her sex and he checked in midcut and sprang back exclaiming as she came gliding in at speed boot stamping and point darting at his throat it was sheer disbelief not gallantry that took him aback for theres no more chivalry in a starnberg than there is in me he recovered in an instant and went on the defensive for that first lightning exchange when shed turned his cuts with ease and came after him like a fury told him that suddenly he was fighting for his life woman or no i couldnt believe it but i didnt care it was my life in the balance too and even my wound was forgotten as i watched the shuffling figures and flickering blades clashclash and pause clashscrapeclash and pause again but the pauses were of a split seconds duration for she was fighting full tilt with a speed and energy id not have believed was in that slight body and with a skill to take your breath away im no great judge and am only as good a cutandthruster as the troopsergeant could make me but i know an expert when i see one theres an assurance of bearing and movement thats beyond technique and caprice had it when willem attacked suddenly hewing to beat her guard down by main force she stood her ground feet still and warding his cuts with quick turns of her wrist when he feinted and bore in at her flank she pivoted like a balletdancer facing me with her back to the lake and i saw that the girlish face was untroubled i remembered fencing against lakshmibai at jhansi the lovely fierce mask contorted and teeth gritted as she fought like a striking cobra but caprice was almost serene even when she attacked it was without a change of expression lips closed chin up eyes unwaver ing on willems as though all her emotions were concentrated in point and edge once i thought he had her when her foot slipped her blade faltered and he leaped in smashing at her hilt to force the sabre from her hand the bullyswordsmans trick that i favour myself but he hadnt the wit or experience to combine it with a left fist to the face and a stamp on the toes and she escaped by yielding to the blow dropping to one knee and rolling away like a gymnast cutting swiftly as she regained her feet at that moment a sudden spasm of excruciating pain in my side reminded me of more immediate troubles my head was swimming with that dizzying weakness that is the prelude to unconsciousness and in panic i clutched at the oozing gash in my side dear god i was lying in a pool of gore if i fainted now id bleed to death i pressed with all my might trying to stem the flow dragging myself up on an elbow with some idiot notion that if i could bend my trunk it would close the wound and sparing a stricken glance at the combatants joy was followed instantly by dismay willems left sleeve was bloody where shed caught him in rolling away but she was falling back now and he was after her relentlessly cutting high and low as she retreated her speed was deserting her her strength so much less than his to begin with was failing under those hammering strokes he had a sixinch advantage in height and as much in reach and he was making it tell he was laughing again harsh and triumphant and as she circled all on the defensive now he spoke for the first time the words coming out in a breathless snarl drop it you bitch give over youre done damn you my heart sank for her mouth was open now panting with sheer weariness and she fairly ran back several steps to avoid his pursuit halting flatfooted to parry a cut at her head before breaking away again towards the lake another wave of giddiness shook me i could feel myself going but as he wheeled and drove in and she was forced to halt guarding and parrying desperately i summoned the last of my strength to yell look out starnberg behind you he never even flinched let alone looked round the ironnerved swine and as she took a faltering sidestep that brought them sideon to me her blade swept dangerously wide in a hurried party exposing her head and he gave an exultant yell as he cut backhanded at her neck a finishing stroke that must decapitate her and she ducked the blade whistled an inch above her curls and she was dropping full stretch on her left hand like an italian driving her point up at his unprotected front he recovered like lightning his sabre sweeping across to save his body but only at the expense of his swordarm her point transfixed it just below the elbow he shrieked and his sword fell he tottered back a step and caprice came erect like an acrobat poised on her toes her point flickered up to his breast for a moment they were still as statues and then her knee bent and her arm straightened with academic precision as she deliberately ran him through the heart i saw the point come out six inches through his back vanishing as she withdrew in graceful recovery willem took a step his mouth opening soundlessly and then he fell sideways down the incline to the lake rolling into the shallows with barely a ripple sliding slowly out from the shore his body so buoyed by the salt water that his limbs floated on the surface while the crimson cloud of blood wreathed down like smoke into the transparent depths beneath him halfconscious as i was i could see his face ever so clear and i remember twasnt glaring or hanging slack or grinning as corpses often do but tranquil as a babes eyes closed like some sleeping prince in norse legend the cold stone beneath me seemed to be heaving and my vision was dimming and clearing and dimming in a most alarming way but i recall that caprice tossed her sabre into the lake as she turned and ran towards me calling something in french that i couldnt make out and her running shape blurred to a shadow with the light failing behind it and as the shadow stooped above me the light went out altogether and in the darkness an arm was round my shoulders and fingers were brushing my brow and my face was buried between her bosoms and my last conscious thought was not of going to find the great perhaps but rather what infernally bad luck to be pegging out at such a moment i dont remember asking the question but it must have been the first thing i uttered as i came to for hutton echoed it and when id blinked my eyes clear i saw that he was sitting by me trying to look soothing which aint easy with a figurehead like his where did she come from says he still in that saltmine are we let it wait colonel best lie quiet a spell quiet be damned i took in the pleasant little room with the carved wooden eaves beyond the window the pale sunlight flickering through the curtains and the cuckoo clock ticking on the whitewashed wall where the devil am i in bed for the last four days in ischl easy now youve stitches front and rear and you left more blood in that cave than youve got in your veins this minute the less you talk the better i can listen curse you but i sounded feeble at that and when i stirred my side pained sharply caprice how did she come there come on man tell me well if you must says he doubtfully remember in the casino garden i said wed put a cover on you well that was mamselle she was behind you every foot o the way didnt care for it myself id ha used a man but our french friend delzons swore she was the best said you and she had worked together before he paused in berlin was it unofficial she was french secret department it was weary work talking i didnt know her capabilities then capables the word starnberg aint the first shes taken off delzons says good biznai that saved the hangman a job and bismarck a red face what his star man a holnup agent hell be happy to keep that under the rose and small comfort to him that that same star man had his gas turned off by a dainty little piece from the beauty chorus sabres bigad he began to chuckle but checked himself here are you up to this colonel i can leave it you know i aint complaining says i but i closed my eyes and lay quiet my question had been answered and i was content to be left alone with my thoughts as hutton closed the door softly after him so la petite caprice formerly of the folies had been my cover damned odd until you reflected and saw that it wasnt odd at all why even five years ago according to blowitz shed been al in the french secret service a trained and expert amazon id known that in berlin but of course id never given it a thought during those golden hours in that snug boudoir on the jager strasse when id been in thrall to the lovely little laughing face beneath the schoolgirl fringe the eyes sparkling with mischief i must understand your humour nestce pas so le poissonier is a thief that amuses does it the perfect body in the lace negligйe silhouetted in the afternoon sun languidly astride my hips trickling smoke down her nostrils the saucy shrug to captivate to seduce is nothing he is only a man moist red lips and skilfully caressing fingers in a perfumed bed and the clash of steel echoing in a great stone cavern the stamp and shuffle of the deadly dance the reckless gamble of her disarming thrust and the pretty face set and unsmiling as she killed with cold deliberation aye a far cry between the two and middling tough to reconcile them ive known hard women show soft and soft women turn harpy but blowed if i remember another who was at such extremes a giggling featherbrained romp and a practised professional slayer thank god for both of em but as i drifted into sleep it was a comforting thought that she wouldnt be the one fetching my slippers in the long winter evenings remember i said there were two kinds of awakening my drowsy revival with hutton had been one of the good ones but next mornings was even better for while i was still weak as a hebrews toddy i was chipper in mind with all perils past and eager for news hutton brought a brisk sawbones who peered and prodded at my stitches dosed me with jalup refused my demand for brandy to take away the taste but agreed that i might have a rump steak instead of the beef tea which theyd been spooning into me in my unconscious state i told hutton to make it two with a pint of beer and when id attended to them and was propped up among my pillows pale and interesting he elaborated on what hed already told me she was on your tail at a safe distance from the moment you and starnberg set off for the lodge and talked yourselves in neat scheme of bismarcks that then when night came delzons and i and our four lads joined her in the woods a skeleton crew you may say but aint we always damn the treasury we picketed the place as best we could and near midnight delzons and his frogs who were on the side away from the town heard fellows skulking down from the hill and guessed they were holnups come to call he and his two men sat tight while mamselle trailed em close to the house good god he let her go alone shes a stalker delzons fellows call her le chaton french for kitten im told some kitten anyway there were three holnups gone to ground under a bush whispering away and she slid close enough to gather that they were an advance guard so to speak and there were others up the hill then comes a whistle from near the house and who should it be but friend starnberg summoning the three holnups if you please heres a go thinks mamselle and follows em in to eavesdrop she must says hutton in wonder be a bloody mohawk that girl from what she heard starnberg was plainly a wrong un but before she could slip back to delzons to report you came in view and went for him the row brought the emperors sentries and all at once there was a battle royal with more holnups arriving we heard it all but in the dark there was nothing to be done mamselle kept her head though and when starnbergs gang brushed off carrying you along she stuck to her task which was to cover you whatever happened he paused to ask how had you discovered that starnberg was a bent penny tampered cartridges neer mind that now what then she dogged em into the hills a few miles first to a steigers hut at the foot o the mountain where they rested a spell then they put you on a stretcher and went up the mountain to the mouth of the saltmine she judged it best not to follow em in but lay up in the rocks nearby and about dawn the whole crew as near as she could judge came out with their dunnage and scattered but no sign of you and starnberg which she couldnt figure neither can i what was he about settling a score with me in his own peculiar way he frowned i dont follow you dont have to it dont matter it was none of his business to know about rudi long ago or willems rum behaviour killing me one moment saving me the next nothing to do with this affair hutton a personal grudge you could call it go on he gave me a hard look but continued well she waited a while then she went in nick o time by the sound of it but you know more than i do about that she settled starnberg plugged the leak in you as best she could and then ran hellforleather down the hill seven or eight miles to the rendezvous wed fixed on beforehand delzons and i and a couple of our lads went back with her to the mine i thought you were a goner but mamselle put a few stitches in you from the firstaid kit and after dark we brought you down here to our bolthole shes nursed you these past few days too regular little nightingale he shook his head in admiration shes a trump and a half colonel blessed if i ever saw a female like her smiling sweet and pretty as a peach and she bowled out starnberg how the dooce did she do it nerve says i and by being a better fencer than he was where is she at the moment ischl police station with delzons helping the austrians trace the holnup fugitives doubt if theyll catch any no general alarm you see oh there was a fine hue and cry after you and starnberg at first but delzons and i had our cyphers away to london and paris soon after the whole tale starnberg and all that set the wires sparking to berlin and vienna his lean face twisted in a sour grin never knew our foreign office could shift steiger the foreman in a saltmine so spry but once theyd telegraphed our vienna embassy and the frogs and our ambassadors had requested an urgent audience with the emperor in person well silence fell no more hue and cry for you london directed me to call on the governor of upper austria no less and assure him of our entire discretion god knows what franzjosef thought of our presumption and bismarcks in saving his life behind his back but not a words being said publicly the austrian peelers have been advised to treat us and delzons people as tourists so presently we can all go home job well done he clapped his hands on his knees with finality and stood up taking a turn to the window no question of you making a report not officially on service but id be glad of your views on a couple o things he cleared his throat this princess kralta what about her what with this and that shed gone clean out of my mind shes bismarcks mistress or was why whats happened to her nothing what youve just said explains why the ischl police questioned her after the lodge fracas of course known companion of the missing starnberg no arrest though he gave an amused snort from what ive seen of the lady id as soon try to collar the queen very hoch und wohlgeboren anyway whatever she told em it brought a couple o bigwigs posthaste from berlin yesterday and i was summoned by the governor and presented to the lady as though she were the tsar of russias aunt care to guess what she wanted news of you even pokerfaced hutton couldnt keep the curiosity out of his eyes i told her you were indisposed and she started up white as paper not injured cries she i told her you were on the mend thank god says she and sat down again desired me to convey her wishes for your recovery and trusts youll call upon her in vienna when convenient he gave the ceiling a jaundiced glance grand hotel karnthner king drawing his own conclusions no doubt well honi soit to you hutton i felt better already for theres no finer tonic than the news that a splendid piece of rattle is turning white as paper and thanking god that youre on the mend we have vienna by gum shed truly meant it the little darling hutton says i how long before im on my feet few days the doctor says once the stitches are out we can take it then says he that the lady was not a holnup accomplice of starnbergs well berlin dont seem to think so nor the austrians i considered no id say shes a genuine bismarck agent and starnberg hoodwinked her as he did the rest of us the clever little bastard if shed been a holnup shed have been out of ischl long before the traps caught up with her wouldnt she the truth was i didnt care a rap and didnt want to know not when i thought of that voluptuous torso and long white limbs and the golden mane spilling over her shoulders all waiting in vienna what the devil you dont bed em for their politics do you he didnt argue but asked a few more questions about her which i answered with a discretion that didnt fool him for a moment i suspect the great long rat was jealous and not only where kralta was concerned for he reverted to caprice again with a warmth which i thought quite unbecoming in a treasury hatchetman the lecherous old goat never seen her like he repeated and sighed dear delight to look upon cold steel within mind you she has her soft side you should ha seen her chivvying us up to the mine to bring you down fairly shrilling at us to make haste swore you were dying by inches and wed be too late and when she stitched you up she was blubbing muttering in french quite a taking she was in he sounded almost piqued well you know what women are ministering angels and all that says i pretty smug aye says he pretty dry and added apropos of nothing that i could see she told delzons she killed starnberg in selfdefence i remarked that when a chap was trying to cut your head off it was a legitimate excuse to be sure we fished him out o that pool you know three wounds one clean through the pump a cut on his left wrist and the third through his right arm odd that whats odd about it you dont truss a mans swordarm after youve killed him id say he was already disarmed when she did him in i gave him my best countrybumpkin gape now i dont follow hes dead and good riddance aint he well then selfdefencell do id say does it matter not a jot says he and rose to depart but seeing how she mooned over you later it struck me she might have been paying him out on your account he turned towards the door you must ha known her pretty well in berlin about as well as you know that princess kralta hutton says i youre a nosey old gossip gossip never nosey thats my trade colonel well im used to the mixture of huff and perplexity and envious admiration that my success with the fair sex arouses in my fellow man seen it in all sorts from the saintly albert looking peeved when her fluttering majesty pinned the afghan medal on my coat to bully dawson my rugby fagmaster in a furious bait after id thoughtlessly boasted of my juvenile triumph with lady geraldine aforesaid most gratifying and doubly so in huttons case so dear little caprice had wept over me had she capital news for if the old fondness still lingered why shouldnt we resume our idyll of the jager strasse once i was up and doing stay though what about kralta panting in vienna a ticklish choice and i was torn on one hand there was an exciting variety about caprices boudoir behaviour the merry concubine performing for the fun of it on tother my horsey charmer was wildly passionate and spoony about me and there was more of her much to be said on both sides in the meantime caprice was on hand and when hutton gave me the office next day that she purposed to visit me in the evening i struggled into my shirt and trowsers cursing my stitches shaved with care gave my face furniture a touch of pomade practised expressions of suffering nobly borne before the mirror while lustfully recalling the soap bubbles of berlin and paused to wonder i confess how it would be meeting her again you see i dont care to be under obligation to a woman for anything except money of course and this one had saved my life at mighty risk to herself furthermore the harmless jolly little banger of five years ago had emerged as a skilled and ruthless killing lady on both counts she had the whip hand so to speak if she chose to use it and show me the woman that wont well caprice didnt being a clever actress and manager of men she took what might have been an awkward reunion in her sprightly stride bowling in without so much as a knock full of sass and nonsense and twas as though five years ago was only yesterday i have not forgiven you cries she dropping her cape and reticule on the table not a word of farewell not so much as a billet dadieu when you abandon me in berlin oh cest parfait ca well m jansenflashman what have you to say she tossed her head twinkling severely and i could have eaten her alive on the spot i am waiting msieur my dear ive been waiting five years says i playing up just for the adorable sight of you and here you are lovelier than ever she made that honking noise of derision that is so vulgarly french but i wasnt flattering the pretty girl had become a beauty the pert gamin face had refined and strengthened the classroom fringe had given way to the latest upswept style crowned with curls darker than i remembered but the cupids bow lips were as impudent and the blue eyes as mischievous as ever she was still la petite caprice if not so little an inch or two taller and fuller in her tightbodiced crimson satin that clung like a skin from bare shoulders to wasp waist and then descended to her feet in the fashionable rippling pleats of the time it hadnt occurred to me that female politicals might dress like evening fashionplates even when they were in the field so to speak and i sat lewdly agog i know that look says she and i am still waiting but darling i couldnt say goodbye it was blowitzs fault you see he had me on the train to cologne before i knew it and ah so blowitz is to blame fat little stefan overpowered you and carried you off eh some excuse that she advanced with that mincing sway that had never failed to have me clutching for the goods well it does not serve milord i am displeased and come only to punish you for your neglect your discourtoisie she struck a pose behold i wear my most becoming gown worth sil vous plait i dress my hair a la mode i devote care to my complexion a little powder here a little rouge there i choose my most costly perfume i put round my neck the velvet ribbon tralala which so aroused the disgusting shuvalov you remember i make my person attrayante altogether how do you say ravissante tres sйduisante alluring bigod scrumptious and then she bent forward to flaunt em and stepped away then i place myself at a distance out of reach she perched on the table edge crossing her legs with a flurry of lace petticoat and silk ankles and because you are invalide you must sit helpless like le pauvre m tana non m tanton ah peste comment sappelletil tantalus you mad little goose prйcisйment tantaloose oui you are condemned to sit like him unable to reach out and devour that which you most desire tres succulent non and the minx stretched voluptuously pursed her lips and blew me a kiss oh hйlas mйchant if only you were not wounded eh now that aint fair teasing an old man and a sick one too here tell you what lets kiss and make up and if youll forgive me for leaving you flat in berlin why ill forgive you for saving my life what it had to be said sooner or later and when better than straight away in the midst of chaff the laughter died in her eyes but only for an instant and she was smiling again shaking her immaculately curled head we will not talk of that says she and before i could open my mouth to protest we will not talk of it at all between good friends there is no need no need my dear girl theres every need no chйri she raised a hand and while she smiled still her voice was firm and calm if you please nonnon un moment let me oh how to say it those two in the caverne they were not you and i they were two others two agents secrets who did what they must do their devoir their duty you see what i saw was that this was a caprice i hadnt known before charming and merry as ever even more beautiful it made me slaver just to look at her but with a quiet strength youd never suspect until she softened her voice and spoke plain and direct gentle as gibraltar let us not speak of it then it is past you see and so are they but we are here in an instant she was sparkling again slipping down from the table fluttering her hands and laughing and it has been so long a time since berlin and i was so dйsolйe to be heft without a word oh and enraged you would not believe you remember the things i said of shuvalov that night of the bath she began to giggle well i said not quite as bad of you but almost is there a word in english for angry and sad together but that is past also she knelt quickly by my chair and here we are i say have you missed me chйri as ive said before damned if i understand women but if she wanted to forget the horror of that ghastly mine thank god and hurrah no doubt she had her reasons and since gratitude aint my long suit anyway and her bright eyes and laughing lips and pouting tits were pleading in unison i didnt protest missed you darling damnably and a sight more than you missed a creaky old codger like me ill lay it is not true why when you abandoned me in berlin i was inconsolable dйsolйe all day and what is this codgeur and creaky oh but your english it is ridiculous as to the other matter that we aint to talk about well ill just say a ridiculous english thankee and no more she commanded or i shall not what did you call it kiss and make up she gave a languorous wink and put on her husky voice are you strong enough try me says i reaching for her but she rose quickly and made a great business of having me put my hands palm down on my chair arms whereupon she laid her own hands over mine leaning down firmly to keep em pinned while i feasted my eyes on those superb poonts quivering fragrantly under my very nose and wondered if my stitches would stand the strain of the capital act performed in situ then the wanton baggage brought that soft smiling mouth slowly against mine teasing gently with her tongue but swiftly withdrawing when i broke free panting and tried to seize her bodily reckless of the darting pain in my flank nonnon cries she be still foolish you will injure your wound no desist idiot she slapped my hand away from her satin bottom it is not possible dont tell me whats not possible heavens dyou think ive never been pinked before taint but a hole in the gut i can hardly see the dam thing do not tell me what cannot be seen i have seen it for a moment she sounded truly angry eyes flashing as though on the edge of tears and then as quickly it had gone and she was playing the reproachful nursemaid with affected groans and rolling eyes and scathing gallic rebukes which i accepted like a randy but frustrated lamb promising to keep my hands to myself honest injun you behave word of honour says she not trusting me an inch ill prove it says i give us another kiss and youll see vaten menteur scoffs she so i sat on my hands and she consented warily i knew it was all i was fit for and made the most of those sweet lips for the few seconds she permitted before she broke away gratifyingly pink and breathless bon says she and drew some papers from her reticule then i may safely sit by you while you read to me from the present i have brought for you i coaxed them from an english tourist in the town pretending an interest in your culture anglaise his wife i think was not amused she sat on my chair arm allowing me to put a hand round her waist and laid the papers in my lap what do you say for old times sake non oh my god says i they were copies of punch you cruel little monster reminding me of the last time when you know im in no state to explain hankeypankey to you attention she rapped my wrist i know all about that but i do not know what is amusing about m gladstone dancing in the dress of a sailor or your policemen being given whistles to blow ah yes or why your sacrй m paunch has such malice against us in france with his bad jokes about madagascar and la chine and m de lesseps and oh such fun about frenchmen playing your blooded cricket bloody dearest not blooded and taint ladylike to ah yes and here further insult she stabbed an indignant fingernail at the page france is drawn as an ugly old paysanne with fat ankles and abominable clothes but who is this divine being so beautiful and elegant of shape in her fine drapery what does she represent ha the manchester ship canal quelle absurditй oh come france is mostly a peach in our cartoons and weve always made fun of you ever since crйcy and joan of arc and whatnot but you do the same to us dont you sans blague an example then well look at phileas fogg a prize muff if ever there was one that man verne is never done sniping at us aye those two british officers in that twaddling book about a comet hitting the earth what a pair of muttonheaded byjoves they are pompous illtempered caricatures all whiskers and hawhaw and crying balderdash and that is not true says she all innocence course its not stuff and nonsense nothing like us at which she began to giggle and flicked my whiskers in a marked manner i could only growl and point out that at least i wasnt in the habit of crying balderdash or hawhaw so we passed a pleasant hour soon discarding punch and talking about anything and everything except the past few days i told her about egypt and zululand and she talked of the places she had visited in the course of her work rome and athens and constantinople and cairo but never a word of the work itself fashions food customs society doings men shops hotels and journeys we compared notes about them all and even found acquaintances in common like liprandi to whom id surrendered rather informally at balaclava and whom shed waltzed with at st petersburg and the big sudanese with tribal cuts on his face who kept the cigale cafй in alex and blowitz naturally was an amusing topic i wasnt sorry though when suppertime came tкteatкte is ail very jolly but when you know dam well your voluptuous visavis is a culdesac and she sits on your chairarm with her udders in your ear and a bare shoulder begging to be nibbled and her perfume conjuring erotic notions and you darent stir a lecher ous finger for fear of bursting the needlework in your navel and suffering the indignity of having her remove your bloodsodden britches and upbraid you for a foresworn satyr none of which will do a thing for your future amorous relations well its trying i can tell you le pauvre m tantaloose didnt know what frustration was neer mind thinks i well make up for this in paris presently kraltall keep it was quite like old times to sit across the table from her in candlelight tucking into the cold ham and fruit and bernkastler she chattering gaily and i sitting easy and admiring the highlights on the dark curls and the perfect ivory curves of chin and neck and shoulder i could have imagined we were back in the jager strasse except for a brief moment when she peeled a plum and presented it to me laughing on a fork and i thought of those dainty fingers with their polished nails coiled round a sabre hilt and of the hidden strength of the slender white arm but when i looked the smiling lips and merry eyes were those of the caprice i knew so well exclaiming ohla gauche when i dropped the fork and a moment later rising and gleaming at me over the rim of her glass as she proposed a toast to our reunion ive a better toast than that says i halting round the table and nuzzling her neck to our next meeting when this dam scratch of mine has healed she clinked glasses but said nothing i asked when she was going back to paris tomorrow hйlas we go one at a time ever so discret delzons last of all either he or m hutton will remain until you are well enough to travel and then this house will be closed and the operation will be over she turned away and put her glass on the mantel her back to me you will return to london oh no hurry time for a week or two in paris then well see i stepped close to kiss her on the nape of the neck and she glanced round why paris says she lightly why dyou think says i and slipped my hands round to clasp her breasts she shivered and then very gently she removed my hands and turned to face me smiling still but a touch wary that might be difficult says she i do not think that charlesalain would approve and i am sure his family would not charles who charlesalain de la tour dauvergne says she and the smile had an impish twinkle to it my husband i have been madame de la tour dauvergne for six months now i must have looked like a fish on a slab husband you married my stars above well blow my boots and you never let on blow your boots you never noticed laughs she holding up her left hand and there was the gold band sure enough eh what well i never do i mean i didnt see well ill he damned of all things here though i must kiss the bride which i did and would have made a meal of it but she slipped away squeaking at me to mind my wound and taking refuge behind the table i bore up grinning at her across the board why you sly little puss le chaton right enough well well still it makes no odds she looked startled oh ill still come to paris never you fret he dont have to know this de la thingamabob it was her turn to stare and then would you believe it she went into whoops and had to sit down in the armchair helpless with laughter i asked what was the joke and when shed drawn breath and dabbed her eyes she shook her head at me in despair oh but you are the most dreadful adorable man no he would not have to know but i would know she sighed smiling but solemn and i have made my vows strewth you mean its no go just cos youre married no go says she gently ah chйri i am sorry but you do understand shot if i do and i didnt for twasnt as though she was some little bourgeois hausfrau dammit she was french and had sported her bum and boobies in the folies for the entertainment of lewd fellows and rogered with the likes of shuvalov pour la patrie and myself and god knew how many others for the fun of it and her behaviour this evening hadnt been marriedrespectable exactly dressed to the seductive nines and kissing indecorously i remarked on this and she sighed oh if you had been well i would not have come knowing you would wish to make love but knowing you were blessй and unable to she gestured helplessly oh you know i thought we might talk and be jolly as we used to be but without oh hankeypankey she shrugged in pretty apology and suddenly her face lit up because those were such happy days in berlin oh not only making love but being comfortable and laughing and talking and i wished to see you once again and remember those times and see if you had changed and oh i am so glad to find that you have not she rose and put a hand to my face and pecked me on the cheek but i have you see i am madame de la tour dauvergne now ever so respectable she pulled a face no more la gaie caprice i change myself i change my life and hйlas i must change my old friends so it is better you do not come to paris do you mind very much you are not angry a number of women have had the poor taste and bad judgment to give me the right about in my callow youth i resented it damnably and either thrashed em or went for em with a sabre or ran like hell in later years you learn to assume indifference while studying how to pay them out supposing you care enough with caprice id have been piqued no more if id believed her laughable excuse which i did not for a moment she a faithful wife come up love no the fact was that flashy five years on no longer aroused her amorous interest well i could take the jolt to my amourpropre the more easily because while shed been a prime ride and good company shed never had the magic that gets beneath your hide like yehonala or lakshmi or sonseearray or elspeth she was too young for that but old enough to know better than to play the saucy minx teasing me into a frustrated heat and then showing me the door oh some of the old affection lingered no doubt hence the fatuous tale of marital fidelity to let me down lightly i could have swallowed it if shed come right out with it first thing but she hadnt been able to resist her wanton instinct to set me panting even now there was a glint of mockery in the eversocontrite smile that told me she was enjoying feeling sorry for the randy old fool well pleased with her beautys power and doubtless convincing herself that she felt a touch of sentimental remorse the littie hypocrite even the best of them like to make you squirm i had a sudden memory of the saltmine and that cold steel being driven ruthlessly home and call it sour grapes if you like but i found myself warming to the thought of princess kralta angry little one not a bit of it cries i beaming like anything and pecked her back im sorry o course but jolly glad for you hes a lucky chap your charlie what is he a dashing hussar eh oh no but he is a soldier that is he is a professor of lhistoire militaire at st cyr i say he must be a bright spark blackboardwallahs are pretty senior as a rule she confessed that he was older than she and from an old service family the usual decayed frog nobility by the sound of the name but she wasnt forthcoming at all and i guessed that the mere thought of the raffish flashy being presented to dear charles parents as an old acquaintance even filled her with dismay i found myself wondering how much they knew about her and whether the arrival on papa dauvergnes breakfast table of that splendid photograph of his daughterinlaw baretitted among the potted palms and nigger stallions mightnt enliven his petit dйjeuner a passing thought and cheered me up no end but what do charles people think about your working for the secret department hardly the thing for a staid married lady what they did not approve of course but that is past now we agreed charles and i that i must resign before our marriage but here you are only because this was une crise an emergency and delzons was in despair to recruit agents for the occasion the dйpartement hike your own in england must make do with little and i could not refuse delzons i owe him too much and charles didnt mind well hes a sportsman of course it was an important affair international crisis and all that she hesitated he did not know i am at this moment visiting a school friend in switzerland better and better not the kind of thing to confide to a lover whos just been handed his travel warrant mind well god bless charles anyway id like to meet him one o these days she didnt clap her hands so i took them gently in mine and gave her my best wistful sigh like a ruptured uncle and bless you too my dear and since you dont want to talk about tother thing in that beastly cave non non well then i shant so there ill only say that im monstrous glad that you visited your school chum in switzerland what and that you came to see me this evening quite like old times eh well almost i winked and slid my hands round her rump kneading away to show there were no hard feelings and blowed if the sentimental little tart didnt start piping her eye oh you are the best man alive so kind so gйnйreux she clung to me bedewing my shirt and raised her face to mine and and never shall i forget berlin she threw her arms round my neck and kissed me none of your pecks this time but the full lascivious munch wet and wonderful and if you dont breathe through your nose you die of suffocation had to press my stitches hard until she came loose at last lips quivering dabbing at her eyes my goodness what would charles say i wondered playfullike i cant believe professors of lhistoire militaire approve o that sort of thing she looked uncertain and decided to be airy oh chacun a son goat you know well you mustnt shock him cant think when i was last kissed thataway not since the orient express anyway queestce que cest a moments perplexity and then the penny dropped and she went pink and took a step back oh la princesse i i did not ah youve met her then i have seen her with delzons when we were at the police commissariat she was confused but recovered smiling brightly but of course she and that other brought you from germany she is very beautiful fine figure of a woman says i looking her up and down more to the point she has no conscience where her husbands concerned i grinned and repeated her own words dyou mind very much youre not angry just for a moment her eyes flashed and then she laughed and riposted neatly by repeating mine angry not a bit of it i am jolly glad for you she is perhaps she made a little fluttering gesture how do you say more your style more my age you mean no such thing cries she merrily now you will take care of your wound and not make too much exertion oh beef tea and bedsocks thats my ticket dont you overexert yourself either or youll scandalise charles we smiled amiably on each other and when id helped her put on her cape she held out her hand not her lips adieu then says she i bowed to kiss her hand auvoir caprice oh pardon madame bonne chance she went and as i listened to her heels clicking on the stairs i was wondering where the devil id put that photograph saving flashys life is all very well but dont ever play fast and loose with his affections hes a sensitive soul the older you get the longer you take to heal the hole in my gut was as neat and handy as a wound can hope to be and thirty years earlier would have been right in a fortnight but now it turned angry no doubt from the strain imposed by my frustrating halfdalliance with madame de la tour dauvergne damn her wanton ways the stitches had come adrift and had to be replaced by my little medico i developed a fever which returned me to bed for more than a week and after that i was no better than walking wounded for i was weak as a rat and common sense demanded that i should go canny as elspeth would say she was much in my mind at that time but then she always is when ive passed through the furnace and am looking for consolation the thought of that loving smile the childlike innocence of the forgetmenot eyes the soft sweet voice and the matronly charms bursting out of her corset made me downright homesick and with caprice turning me off the stupid little trollop id have been tempted to set my sights on london if it hadnt been for the prospect of rattling kralta all over vienna i couldnt forego that in all conscience our railway idyll had given me an appetite and after it was satisfied would be time enough to cry off with the new love and on with the old so i bore my captivity into november glad to be alive and passing the time pondering on the mysteries of those few short days of strange adventure barely a week from the time when id been sitting in berkeley square gloating over kraltas picture to the awful moment when id pegged out in that hellish mine with caprice clucking over me like an anxious hen and starnbergs corpse floating in the limpid brine reviewing it all i knew what had happened but not why in all the confusion of lies and deceits and voltesface there were mysteries as i say which i didnt understand and still dont on the face of it bismarck had concocted a lunatic but logical scheme to save the austrian emperor from assassination and it had succeeded in a way he could never have foreseen with his gusted henchman proving traitor but being foiled by old flashys blundering well lucky old otto and lucky franzjosef and lucky europe knowing my opinion of bismarck you may wonder that i dont suspect him of some gigantic machiavellian doubledeal whereby hed invented the tale of a holnup plot so that starnberg could murder franzjosef with bismarcks blessing and start another war hed done it before god knows twice at least and wouldnt have scrupled to do it again if it had suited his book but it didnt you see hed built germany into a european power by blood and skulduggery and had nothing to gain by another explosion he could rest on his laurels and let nature take its usual disastrous course as it is doing if only imbeciles like asquith would notice well im past caring at a lesser remove i couldnt figure starnbergs behaviour in the mine why having done his level damnedest to kill me had he saved me from going down that awful chasm into the bowels of the earth cos hed wanted to put me away with his own steel to prolong my agony or from some mad quixotic impulse which he mightnt have understood himself search me folk like the starnbergs father and son dont play by ordinary rules i only hope there aint a grandson loose about the place i still wondered too why caprice had cut him down in cold blood and why she wouldnt talk of it even vanity would have tempted me to take huttons judgment that she was dead spoony on me and had done him in for that reason if she had not since handed me my marching orders my own view for what it was worth was that shed murdered starnberg because it struck her as the fitting and tidy thing to do and gave her the last word so there delzons her chief who knew her better than anyone had a different explanation which he gave me the day before we left ischl and you must make of it what you will hutton had gone back to london by then after assuring me that government was satisfied no official approval of course but no censure either my assistance had been noted and would be recorded in the secret papers aye im still waiting for my peerage delzons had stayed on to close the ischl house as soon as i was fit to take the open air paris was no keener on maintaining boltholes out of secret funds than london and the pair of us transferred to the golden ship myself to complete my convalescence and delzons to enjoy a holiday or so he said but i suspect he was keeping an eye on me to see that i didnt get into mischief i was glad enough of his company for he was the best kind of frog shrewd and tough as teak but jolly and with no foolish airs it would be late november when i was healed and feeling barely a twinge that we walked across the ischl bridges and up the hill to the royal lodge the trees were bare there was a little snow lying and the river was grey and sullen with icy patches under the banks the lodge itself was silent under a leaden sky with only a servant in sight sweeping leaves and snow from the big porch it would be months before franzjosef returned to add to the collection of heads in that dark panelled chamber where his aides had crawled about giggling in drink and id had conniptions as i stared at the doctored cartridges we circled the place and delzons pointed out the spot where hed lain doggo and caprice had slipped away to shadow the holnups i studied the open ground dotted with trees and bushes between where we stood and the lodge and remarked that a nightstalk would have been ticklish even for my old apache chums quick killer and yawner but not for la petite smiles delzons she has no equal is it not remarkable one so delicately feminine so pretty and vivace so much a child almost but of a skill and courage and and firm purpose beyond any agent i have seen he nodded thoughtfully we have a word colonel that i think has no equivalent in english which i apply to nothing and no one but her formidable shes all o that plainly he was as smitten with her as hutton had been but with delzons it was fond almost paternal where did she learn to stalk and so on in the breton woods as a child with her three elder brothers ile chuckled she was une luronne a tomboy no oui un garcon manquй six years younger than they but their match in all sport running climbing shooting oh and daring and they were no poules mouillйes no milksops those three lads yet when she was only twelve she was their master with foil and pistol some brothers would have been jealous but valйry and claude and jacques were her adoring slaves ah they were close those four you knew em well then says i as we strolled back their father was my copain in crimea before i joined the intelligence i was to them as an uncle when they were small and grew to love them caprice above all well a lonely bachelor engrossed in his work must have something to love non he paused musing a moment then went on but then i was posted abroad for several years and lost touch with the family until the terrible news reached me that the father and three sons had all fallen in the war of he was by then chef de brigade and the three boys had but lately passed through st cyr i was desolate above all for caprice so cruelly deprived at a stroke of all those she loved i wrote to her of my grief and condolence assuring her of my support in any way possible thus it was two years later when i came home to command the european section of the departement secret that she came to see me asking for employment mon dieu he heaved in emotion and at once became apologetic oh forgive me perhaps i weary you no then het us sit a moment we settled on a bench by the path overlooking the river and delzons lit his pipe gazing down at the distant snowpatched roofs you conceive my amazement not only to discover that my little gamine had become a lovely young woman but that she should seek an occupation so unsuitable mais inconcevable for one so chaste et modeste why dear child i asked i cannot be a soldier like my father and brothers i shall fight for france in my own way that was her reply as gently as might be i suggested that there were other ways to serve that the world of the dйpartement secret was a hard and dangerous one and highly unpleasant in ways which she a conventreared girl of eighteen could not conceive do you know what she said colonel uncle delzons i have studied the world from the tableaux vivants of the folies gaitйs and moved among its clientele who are also hard dangerous and unpleasant before i could even express my scandal for i had known nothing of this she added oh so quiet and demure with that laughter in her innocent eyes also i am fluent in languages and fence and shoot even better these days delzons took the pipe from his mouth looked at it and stuck it back what could i say i was shocked yes but i saw too that beneath the fresh lovely surface there was a metal that i had never suspected it is rare such metal and essential to the dйpartement secret and if i had refused her i knew there were other sections of the dйpartement which would not he laughed ruefully the truth was she was a gift to any chef dintelligence and so she proved in small things at first as translator courier embassy bricoleur what you call jackofalltrades and later as secret agent in the field and you know what that means yes she was the best i said he must have been sorry to lose her and he grimaced she told you yes sorry but i rejoiced also for six years i had lost sleep whenever she went into danger oh seldom enough our work as you are aware brings a moments peril in a year of routine but when that peril comes no i am glad she has gone when i think of the risks she ran of her facing a man like starnberg to the death my heart ceases to beat if we had lost her my friend i should have died it is true my heart would have ceased forever then the usual exaggerated froggy vapouring but delzons wasnt the usual frog and i guessed he believed it i took the opportunity to canvass his opinion well you neednt ha fretted he was a capital hand with a sabre but not in her parish i paused deliberately cant think ive ever seen a neater execution his head came round sharply ah you confirm m uttons opinion which i happen to share the evidence of starnbergs wounds was conclusive as you say an execution his eyes were steady on mine but in my report selfdefence as it must always be when an agent kills in the line of duty that reminded me of something hutton had said he told me starnberg wasnt the first shed sent down were the others selfdefence too he frowned and muttered a nasty word i have a great respect for our colleague utton but he talks too much he sucked at his dead pipe and continued rapidfire yes she has killed before twice in egypt in turkey one was a minor diplomat who had found out she was a french agent the other an informer whose silence was essential she was not under my control on either occasion my responsibility is for europe she was on detachment to another section i did not seek details abruptly he got to his feet his mouth set like a trap nor have she and i ever mentioned the incidents shall we walk on colonel and this was the girl who had giggled with me over punch i fell into step beside him as we walked down to the bridges his stick fairly cracking at each stride but there was a grim grin under his heavy moustache oh m utton cries he so talkative so shrewd no doubt he offered you his theory that she slew starnberg in cold blood because of a tendre for you bon sang de merde he gave a barking laugh enraged because he had wounded perhaps slain her lover perhaps you believe that yourself because you were lovers in berlin oh i know all about her holiday task for blowitz what you do not believe uttons theory i congratulate you he calmed after a few steps your affaire in berlin was an amour passant then not of the heart gad theyre a tactful tasteful lot the french not on my side i told him nor on hers whatever the soshrewd utton may think shall i tell you why she killed starnberg as she did ile had stopped on the bridge turned to face me i told you her father and brothers fell in the war of against the germans and what she said of fighting in her own way i did not tell you how they died papa and jacques were killed in the battle at gravelotte claude died of his wounds neglected in a german hospital valйry was in the intelligence he was captured at st privat on a mission despionnage he was shot by a firing squad of franseckys pomeranians the day after the signing of the armistice february the first suddenly the eyes in the bulldog face were bright with angry tears they knew the armistice had been signed but they shot him just the same just the same german chivalry it had started to snow and he was hunched up against the chill wind staring down at the river so they were gone all four it seemed in a moment as the poet says of a snowflake on the water did i mention that the diplomat in turkey and the informer in egypt were both germans no well caprice does not like germans as the count von starnberg discovered but i am keeping you standing in the cold colonel give me your arm my friend shall we seek a cafй and a cup of chocolate with a large cognac to flavour it eh some clever ass has said that if is the biggest word in the language but i say its the most useless there have been so many coincidences in my life good and bad that ive learned the folly of exclaiming if only they happen and thats that and if the one that brought my austrian odyssey to a close was uncommon disastrous and infuriating because id foreseen its possibility well i can be philosophic now because as ive observed before im still here at ninety more or less and you cant ask fairer than that but that dont mean ill ever forgive the drunk porter who mislaid my trunk at charing cross because if he hadnt there you see if almost got the better of me and no wonder when i think what came of that boozy idiots carelessness shocking state the railways are in however well come to charing cross all in good time id have been there weeks earlier if kralta hadnt been so amorously intoxicated and the circumstances of our reunion in vienna so different from what id expected when i took the train from ischl early in december i was looking forward to a couple of cosy and intimate weeks in which i rogered her blue in the face sparked her to the opera or whatever evening amusements vienna offered wined and dined of the best saw the sights took her riding viewed the blue danube from the warm comfort of her bedroom and back to the muttons again a modest enough ambition and would have had me home again by christmas well i was taken aback if not disappointed by what awaited me at the grand hotel and followed in the ensuing weeks id telegraphed from ischl to advise her that id be rolling in and when i arrived at the grand which was the newest and bestappointed of the leading hotels she was awaiting me in a suit of rooms that louis xiv might have thought too large and opulent for his taste viennas like that you see in most great cities the new districts are where the quality hang out but in vienna the old sections are the exclusive ones infested by the most numerous nobility in europe living in palaces and splendid mansions built centuries ago by ancestors who plainly felt that even a lavatory wasnt a lavatory unless it could accommodate a hunt ball with gilded cherubs on the ceiling and walls that looked like wedding cakes even new hotels like the grand were to match and the whole quarter reeked of money privilege and luxury in doubtful taste it was reckoned to be the richest upper ten outside london and the two hundred families of princes counts and assorted titled and cared not a rap for anything except their musical fame of which theyre wonderfully jealous not without cause id say when you think of the waltz id arranged to arrive in town late at an hour when kralta would he cleared for bed and action but when i reached the hotel close on midnight i saw that id been too long in the provinces the hall was thronged with revellers the dining salon was full and an orchestra was going full swing even so i was unprepared for the start i received when i was ushered into her drawingroom where id looked to find her alone there were thirty folk if there was one all ablaze in the pink of fashion and me in my travelling dirt and she whom id imagined flinging aside her fur robe and flying to my arms was magnificent in tiara long gloves and ivory silk the image of her photograph standing amidst her society gaggle waiting calmly for me to approach as though shed been royalty which of course she was european royalty leastways but i couldnt complain of her welcoming smile with a hand stretched out for me to kiss at last we meet in vienna says she softly and then i was being presented to prince this and baroness that and colonel von stuff and madame puff and this ill say for them there wasnt a sneer or a sniff at my tweeds such as youd get from frogs or dagoes or our own reptilia vienna wasnt only polite it was downright friendly and hospitable putting a glass in my hand coaxing me to the buffet inquiring after my journey asking how long id been in town exclaiming that i must call or dine or see suchandsuch the men frank and genial the women gay and easy some damned handsome pieces there were too and kralta smiling coolly with her hand on my sleeve guided me effortlessly through the crowd and out into a secluded alcove and then she was in my arms her mouth open under mine fairly writhing against me and i was making up for weeks of abstinence and wondering when we could get to work in earnest when suddenly she left off and buried her head on my shoulder thank god you are safe says she in a choking voice when i heard what that that vile traitor had done to you i thought i should run mad oh thank god thank god thank a nimble little parisienne cutthroat thinks i but all i did was murmur comfort kissing her again and swearing that id been baying the moon at the thought of her and when could we get shot of her guests she laughed at that holding my hands and regarding me fondly and i found myself marvelling that a woman whose looks didnt compare to half of those on view in her drawingroom could rouse such desire in me mind you there wasnt a shape among em to match the splendid body in its ivory sheath or a carriage to set beside that striking figurehead with its long gold tresses coiled beneath the diamond crown i had to bottle my ardour for more than an hour for while the fashionable crowd soon dispersed four who seemed to be her prime intimates stayed to sup with us they were an oddish group i thought some prince or other a distinguished greybeard with an order on his coat and three females all extremely personable one of em a countess was dark and soulful and softspoken and possessed of the most enormous juggs ive ever seen how she managed her soup heaven knows for ill swear she couldnt see her plate tothers were a prattling blonde who flirted out of habit even with the waiters and a slender redhaired piece who drank like a mississippi pilot with no visible effect the prince was plainly a big gun and most courteous to me and kralta was at her most stately so it was a decorous enough meal bar the blondes chatter and coquettish glances which no one deigned to notice good form the viennese we parted at last thank the lord with bows and nods and polite murmurs kralta led the way to her bedchamber and i was all over her at once with growls of endearment and a great wrenching of buttons it was a true meeting of minds for i doubt if a woman ever stripped faster from full court regalia and we revelled in each other like peasants in a hayrick from bed to floor and back again i believe but i aint sure and when we were gloriously done and i lay gasping while she wept softly and kissed the healed scar on my flank murmuring endearments i thought well this is why you came to europe flash and ischl was worth it she said not a word then or thereafter about starnberg or the plot and i was content to let it lie i staggered out presently to visit the little private lavatory in an antechamber off the drawingroom and was taken flat aback when who should come out of the thunderhouse but the prince clad in a silk robe with his beard in a net what the deuce he was doing on the premises i couldnt imagine but i admired his aplomb for id ventured out in a state of nature and he didnt so much as raise an eyebrow but waved me in with a courtly hand bade me gute nacht and disappeared through a door on the far side of the drawingroom i performed my ablutions in some bewilderment and my good angel prompted me to wrap a towel round myself before venturing out for when i did damned if the door hed used didnt open and a massive bosom emerged followed by the soulful countess in a nightrail fashioned apparently from a scrap of mosquitonet she gave a start at the sight of me murmured entschuldigung collared a decanter from the sideboard and with a sleepy smile and bis spater vanished whence she had come kralta was repairing the damage before her mirror when i rolled in much perturbed that prince and the women theyre out there large as life who is he for gods sake my husband says she you were presented to him well all id caught in the confusing moment of arrival had been von und zum umble rumble as so often happens i considered hard ah i see your husband eh and the women his mistresses says she carefully rouging her lip it is convenient that we share the apartment it is quite large enough you see she began to brush her hair while i struggled for an appropriate rejoinder and could think of only one mistresses eh well well she continued to brush calmly so i added another trenchant observation he has three of them yes the fair one fraulein boelcke i had not met before this evening she talks too freely dont you think but my conversational bolt was shot for once i was at a loss as who would not be on discovering that while he was bulling a chaps wife all over the shop and probably making a hell of an uproar the chap himself was virtually next door brushing his teeth or pomading his eyebrows and even now might be conducting an orgy just across the way with three trollops while the wife of his bosom was smiling tenderly on her bemused lover kissing him fondly leading him back to bed and settling into his arms for conversation and drowsy fondling which must lead inevitably to another outbreak of feverish passion and it did even noisier and more protracted than before for this time she occupied the driving seat if you know what i mean and rode herself into a sobbing frenzy they could have heard in berlin im an easygoing fellow as you know but it struck me as i lay there urging her on with ecstatic roars and the occasional slap on the rump and afterwards cradling her to sleep on my breast that this was a pretty informal household and would take getting used to im all for cuckolding husbands and dont give a dam if with the fair trio hes been using as though he were the sultan of swat well its novel and i wasnt sure that i cared for it above half it took me a few weeks to settle my thoughts on the subject and reflection was made no easier by the distractions vienna afforded ive never wallowed in such sumptuous indulgence in my life even being a crowned head in strackenz didnt compare to it the place was dedicated to sheer pleasure in those days and i guess i became intoxicated in a way that had nothing to do with drink although there was enough and to spare of that perhaps i was still fagged from my ordeal at all events i was content to be borne along on that gay dazzling tide idling and stuffing and boozing and viewing the capitals wonders by day consorting with kraltas vast social circle of an evening and letting her have her haughty head by night she was a demanding mistress and if shed hadnt been such a prime mount and besotted with me to boot i might have brought her to heel or tried to that she was an imperious piece i knew but now i saw it wasnt just her nature which was the root of her pride but the life she led which fostered that almighty growth vienna seemed to be at her feet she was deferred to on all sides and placed on a social level not far short of imperial toadeaten by the flower of society and ruling it with a tilted chin and cold eye the style in which she lived argued fabulous wealth and she spent it like a whaler in port on the slightest whim small wonder she liked to call the tune in bed speaking of imperial i had a taste of that when she took me with the prince and his hareem in tow to a gala ball at schonbrunn where the emperor and empress condescended to mingle with viennas finest that was a damned odd turn eerie almost for a moment came when with kralta standing by like a magnificent ringmistress i found myself face to face with franzjosef and the superb sissi he drew himself up to his imposing height whiskers at the high port and stared me straight in the eye for a long moment he said not a word but held out his hand and twasnt the usual touchandaway of royalty but a good strong clasp followed by a hearty shake before he passed on sissi following with a smiling turn of her lovely head thats his vote of thanks for services rendered thinks i and the most he can do or i can expect but i was wrong there was something more though whether twas his idea or sissis i cant say when the dancing began and i was restoring myself with a glass of tokay after whirling kraltas substantial poundage round the floor a lordly swell with a ribboned order presented himself and informed me that her imperial majesty would be graciously pleased to accept if i were to beg the honour of leading her out for the next dance it was unprecedented im told to a foreign stranger and a commoner at that you may be sure i complied with a beating heart i confess and so i waltzed beneath the chandeliers of old vienna under the eyes of the highest and noblest of the austrian empire with strauss himself flogging the orchestra and my partner was that magical ravenhaired beauty who had all europe at her feet and i didnt tread on em once afterwards i led her back to franzjosef and received his courteous nod and her brilliant smile well ive rattled the empress of china and her majesty of madagascar to say nothing of an apache princess and an indian rani and thats my business to be written about but not spoken of but i can tell my greatgrandchildren face to face that ive danced with the queen of hearts and she of course has danced with me we spent christmas at a castle of kraltas or her husbands i never found out which high in the snowy tyrolean mountains and toasted in the new year in a luxurious hunting lodge in a little valley whose inhabitants spoke a strange sort of german laced with scotch expressions the legacy im told of medieval mercenaries who never went home doubtless for fear of arrest both places were full of titled guests invited by kralta and we drove in sleighs and skated and tobogganed and revelled by evening and pleasured by night and it was vienna in the arctic with the prince always on hand bland and affable as ever with his popsies around him and it was all such enormous fun that i was heartily sick of it dont misunderstand me it wasnt a surfeit of debauchery and the high life although there does come a time when you find yourself longing for a pint and a pie and a decent nights sleep and it was only partly that i was beginning to miss english voices and english rain and all those things that make the old country so different thank god from the continent no i was beginning to realise what had irked me from the first being just another player iii their game having it taken for granted that id be a compliant member of kraltas curious mйnage as though i were the latest recruit if you know what i mean ive always been a free lance so to speak going my own way on my own terms and the notion that viennese society was raising its weary eyebrows and saying ah yes this englishman is new to her entourage how long will he last one wonders and that kralta probably thought of me as her husband did of his trollops no it didnt suit the final straw came on a night in the hunting lodge when id become so infernally bored that id gone to the village for a prose with the peasants at the tavern and came home in the small hours some of the guests were still about in the principal rooms drinking and flirting and casting odd looks in my direction i went up and was making for the chamber i shared with kralta when a soft voice called and i turned to see the princes maitresseentitre she of the heroic bosom standing in an open doorway in a silk nightrail that was never designed for sleeping the prince is with her highness tonight says she with an arch look is he by god thinks i and for a moment was seized with an impulse to stride in and drag him off her by the nape of h i s cuckolded neck or her off him more like the arrogant bitch countess grosbrusts was watching to see what i made of it so i looked her over thoughtfullike and she smiled and i grinned at her and she shrugged and i laughed and she laughed in turn which set em shaking and as she turned into her room casting a backward glance i sauntered after thinking what a capital change for my last night in austria it was the custom at the lodge for the whole troop to gather for a late breakfast in the main salon so i waited until all had assembled despatched a lackey to kraltas quarters with orders to pack my traps and send em to the station strolled down with lady bountiful on my arm and announced to the company that i was desolated to have to leave them that day as urgent affairs in london demanded my attention kralta seated in state by the fire with her toads clustered round stirring her chocolate for her went pale she was looking deuced fetching i have to say in a white fur robe which prompted happy memories of the orient express i made my apologies and her eyes were diamondhard as she glanced from me to my buxom companion and then to the prince but she would not have been kralta if she hadnt responded with icy composure regretting my departure without expression on that proud horse face i kissed her hand made my bow to the prince advised him to stick at it saluted the company and departed with a last smile at the splendid white figure seated in state her golden hair spilling over her shoulders inclining her head with the regal condescension shed used at our first meeting by and large i like to leave em happy but i doubt if she was three days later i was at charing cross station on one of those damp dismal evenings when the fog rolls inside the buildings and the heart of the returning traveller is gladdened by the sight and smell of it all london with its grime and bustle and raucous inhabitants and there aint a ja mein herr to be heard or a sullen frog face and not a plate of sauerkraut in sight i could even listen with fair good humour to the harassed excuses of the cockney porter carrying my valise as he protested that he didnt knaow nuffink abaht the trunk guv cos erbert ad gorn ter the guards van for it and where the ell ed got ter gawd ownly knew sid and fred were appealed to search parties were despatched and erbert was discovered in the leftluggage office reclining on a lower shelf in a state of merry inebriation my porter gave tongue blasphemously i knoo the barstid was arfseas over when e come on din i say din i well e can pick up is money if the super sees im an chance it serve the bleeder right an all im sorry guv look ill whistle a cab for yer and sid an fredll ave yer trunk run dahn in no toime it was music to my ears and i dawdled patiently drinking in the sights and sounds of home and even chuckling at the sight of the semicomatose erbert leaving off his rendition of fifteen men onna dead mans chest yowowow an a bottlarum to assure my porter whose name was ginger that e was a blurry good mate an a jolly ole pal before subsiding among the piled baggage stoopid sod cried ginger gawd knaows were es put it doant worry guv well foind it ere sid wot trains is goin aht jus naow cant ave the genmans trunk

mike shore an well ferret abaht rahnd the cabstands an that jus you wait guv well ave it in arf a tick i continued to loiter as fred set off for platform three and just then a neat little bottom tripped past making for the tearoom and i sauntered idly after it curious to see if the front view lived up to the trim ankles and waist no more than that but it changed my life for as i strolled along my eye caught sight of above a ticket gate and i changed course to see how fred was doing in his quest for my trunk the train was within a few minutes of leaving heavy bags were going into the guards van and fred was emerging shaking his head and at that moment i caught sight of a familiar face down the platform and strolled along to make sure he was carrying a bag and making for a group of fellows standing by a carriage door i hove up by him grinning hollo joe says i taken up portering have you he wheeled round and absolutely almost dropped the bag in astonishment good god flashman cries he why theyve found you then found me they cant even find my blasted trunk here whats the matter i aint a ghost you know for he was staring at me as though he couldnt believe his eyes or eye rather for hed only one ogle and it was wide in astonishment which you didnt often see in the imperturbable garnet wolseley stewart hes here cries he to the men by the carriage and as they turned to look my heart gave a lurch and my stick fell clattering to the platform the man addressed tall dark and grinning all over his face was striding forward to grip my hand young johnny stewart a cherrypicker long after my time but an old comrade from egypt wherever did you spring from cries he heavens ive been turning the town upside down for you at your clubs your house everywhere but i wasnt listening id recognised the others at once cambridge commanderinchief of the army with his grey moustache and high balding head granville the foreign secretary and jumping down from the carriage and hastening towards me with his quick neat step hand outstretched and eyes bright with joy the last man on earth i wanted to see the man id left england to avoid at all costs chinese charley gordon flashman old friend he was pumping my fin like a man possessed at the eleventh hour did you know oh but you must have surely where have you been stewart and i had given up all hope somehow i found my voice ive been abroad in austria austria laughs he that aint abroad ill tell you wheres abroad africa thats abroad he was grinning in disbelief you mean you didnt know i was going back to sudan i shook my head my innards like lead im this minute off the train from calais the very place were bound for stewart and i are off to suakim this very night hes my chief o staff and just guess he poked me in the chest who ive been moving heaven and earth to have as my intelligence bimbashi isnt that so garnet but you were nowhere to be found and now you drop from the skies and you never even knew i was going out twasnt confirmed until today after all says joe if flashman had been in town hed ha caught the scent a week ago cries gordon eyes and ears like a dervish scout he lifts i low dye think hes here he knew by instinct the game was afoot didnt you old fellow my word and i thought only we hreiandmen had the second sight he stepped closer and his eyes held that barmy mystic glitter that told me god was going to he hauled into the conversation providence guided you aye guided you to this very platform dont let anyone try to tell me theres nothing in the power of prayer if there had been id have been back in austria that minute or m wales or paisley even anywhere away from this dangerous maniac gripping my sleeve and not letting me get a word in edgewise i shot a wild glance at the others cambridge popeyed granville smiling but puzzled stewart alert and wondering and only joe having the grace to frown and chew his lip i was speechless at the effrontery of the thing but gordon of course couldnt nee an inch beyond what he thought was a priceless stroke of luck the selfish hound it was famous the happiest of omens and tit last i found my tongue but ive just arrived im going home i protested and any normal man would have been checked for a moment at least but no gordon drunk with enthusiasm you were and you shall one o these days but you dont think im letting you slip now not when fate has delivered you into my hands he was all jocularity and earnest an instant later gripping my coat flashman this is big believe me bigger than china even perhaps bigger than anything since the mutiny i dont k now yet but i do know it calls for the best weve got its going to he the hardest thing ive ever tackled and i need you old comrade he was a head shorter than i and having to stare up at me with those pale hypnotic eyes that made you feel like a rabbit before it snake see here i know its sudden and here i am springing it on you like a jackinthebox but the mahdis sudden too and osman digna and every minute counts let me tell you on the train too much to explain now and i dont even know how ill set about it only that weve got to set the sudan to rights before that madman destroys it it may mean a fight it may mean a rearguard action cant tell yet and neither can they he jerked his head at the others but theyre putting the power in my hands flashman and i can choose whoever i wish he stepped back and he was grinning again and i have no hesitation in asking leave of his grace the commanderinchief a duck of the head towards cambridge and the cabinet a nod to granville and our chief manatarms a flourish at joe who was trying to interrupt to enlist sir harry flashman and to the dickens with regulations and usual channels well harry what dye say before i could speak joe got his word in short notice he was beginning and got no further when did he ever need notice some notice he had at pekin didnt he remember garnet or at balaclava or cawnpore or kabul he wasnt softspoken at the best of times and in his excitement he was almost shouting and passengers were turning to stare at us he dont need more than a word and a clear road do you this was desperate but the suddenness of it all still had me at a loss for words that was the effect that gordon had you know when he was in full cry he was all over you beating you down by his vanityfed fervour blind to everything but his own point of view five minutes ago id been carelessly eyeing a jaunty backside while fred or ginger looked for my luggage and now i was being dragooned into god knew what horror by this arrogant zealot and they called the mahdi a fanatic hold on charley i blurted out i im looking for my traps dammit and and i havent seen my wife yet or or your traps can be sent on cries he why youre all packed and wolseleyll make your excuses at home wont you garnet we shant be away forever you know besides cries he merrily if i know bonny elspeth shell never let you hear the last of it if you dont fall in now why if she were here shed be bustling you aboard that was the gods truth by the way duty was elspeths watchword especially when it was my duty hadnt she shot me off to india more than once weeping i grant you but just the thought of her now not a couple of miles away and the radiant smile and glad cry with which shed run to me lovelier by far than those stale loves id been wasting my time on for weeks past and her adoring blue eyes no the hell with gordon the selfish lunatic having the impudence to buttonhole me in this outrageous fashion and i was bracing myself to put my foot down when cambridge spoke irregular i suppose says he shaking his fat head but not in denial but even so well nothing to hinder if youre sure gordon of course im sure he always was and not about to have his judgment questioned by a mere grandson of george the third he was absolutely frowning at them the army commander the foreign secretary and the greatest soldier of the age and they were helpless glancing resignedly at each other and apologetically at me because he was gordon you see what he was doing wouldnt have washed with them for a moment if he had been any other man but then no other man would have done it granville was raising his fine brows in a whynot fashion it rests with colonel flashman of course there was a silence and then joe wolseley gave me a shrug and a nod id be only too glad to explain to lady flashman if you he left it there they were all looking at me and i knew it was all up it was appalling and beyond belief and no fate was too dreadful for gordon damn his arrogant confidence as he stood there smiling triumphantly but i knew as id known so often what the answer must be the great christian hero had tapped my shoulder and id never live it down if i refused i could have wept at the cruelty of the malign fate that had guided me to platform three at that hour ten minutes later and the blasted train would have been away carrying gordon to hell or honolulu for all i cared but when the cards are dealt you must play em and with style for your reputations sake flashy has his own way of bowing t o the inevitable and i knew dam well it would run round horse guards and the clubs like wildfire in the morning i say you know chinese gordons gone to the sudan fact and taken flashman with him met him quite by chance at the station told wolseley and cambridge he must have him along appendix the emperor franzjosef and empress elisabeth the last european monarch of the old school was how the emperor franzjosef i described himself to theodore roosevelt with good reason for he enjoyed a longer full sovereignty than any other european ruler from the revolution when as a dashing prince of eighteen he succeeded to the throne abdicated by his uncle until the middle of the first world war by which time he had become the venerable bald bewhiskered grandpaternal figure which gazes benevolently out from his bestknown portrait a fine old austrian gentleman revered but remote from his subjects and the terrible conflict which he had helped to make it was a tragic climax to a reign which had been neither successful nor happy his empire had dwindled in size and power to the brink of extinction and his personal life had been darkened by misfortunes his adored empress had been assassinated his son had committed suicide his brother had died before a firing squad and the murder of his nephew and heir had plunged europe into war if he does not emerge as an attractive figure from his biographies or from flashmans brief sketch on short acquaintance it is still hard not to feel sympathy for franzjosef his own faults may have contributed to his ill luck in love and war and statecraft but it would have taken a ruler of unusual intelligence and political skill to bridge successfully the long imperial sunset from the end of europes ancien rйgime to the age of jazz and democracy and mechanised warfare and these he simply did not have he had tried to rule as an absolute monarch presiding over a centralised bureaucracy and suppressing nationalist ambitions among the illassorted races of his unwieldy empire changing times had forced him into reluctant concessions but his reactionary nature and passion for the detail of administration over which he laboured conscientiously had blinded him to those greater issues which he had neither the vision nor the temperament to understand such virtues as he had were physical rather than intellectual which befitted the romantic prince of his early days tall handsome recklessly brave if unsuccessful as a soldier a splendid horseman and ardent sportsman he seems to have been amiable and kindly at his best although one biographer writes of his haughty and offensive arrogance and quotes examples his personal tastes were spartan his manner dignified and formal and he was punctilious in matters of protocol a characteristic which was no help in his marriage franzjosefs chief recreation was in rural pursuits shooting above all and he was never happier than roving the woods above ischl with his gun leading the simple life his other love was the theatre and its ladies and the close companion of his old age was an actress frau schratt to whom he was so closely attached that he became known as herr schratt his marriage to elisabeth of bavaria the glamorous sissi or sisi began as a fairy tale and ended in unhappiness and tragedy we have flashmans authoritative word for it that she was a rare beauty although some of her portraits suggest that she was strikingly pretty rather than classically perfect franzjosef fell in love with her at first sight but he was not a faithful husband and while his teenage bride never paid him back in kind she was too lively and spirited to be a docile little empress quite apart from franzjosefs infidelities there were causes enough of disagreement sissi detested the ultraformal etiquette of a hostile court was disliked by her motherinlaw developed strong hungarian sympathies and had a decidedly eccentric streak in her nature all of which combined to bring about the imperial couples estrangement the adoration in which she was held especially in hungary probably did not help she took to wandering about europe cruising the mediterranean and hunting in england and ireland a royal gypsy admired not only for her looks and charm but for her generous interest in charitable causes and for that wayward independence which had so shocked vienna she was a fearless horsewoman an expert gymnast who worked out regularly in a portable gym a healthandbeauty fanatic who wrote poetry suffered periodic bouts of illhealth and depression and all too often gave signs of that instability which led flashman to doubt her sanity elisabeth bore franzjosef three daughters and a son rudolf who is remembered only as the chief actor in the tragedy of mayerling where he took his own life and that of his mistress in nine years later elisabeth was stabbed to death by an antiroyalist fanatic at geneva she was sixty years old notes t henri stefan oppert blowitz was paris correspondent of the times from to a bohemian jew born of a good family in what is now czechoslovakia he worked as a teacher in france before becoming a journalist almost by accident and showed that he possessed to a remarkable degree that combination of talents that makes a firstclass reporter immense energy and curiosity a nose for news and that mysterious gift of inspiring confidence which makes people talk he had contacts at the highest level all over europe a prodigious memory a brass neck and great ingenuity which together raised him to a unique position in his profession flashman has drawn him faithfully and plainly had some affection and considerable respect for the tiny rotund charming bombastic and rather comic eccentric whose love of good living susceptibility to female beauty delight in extravagant dress and generous good nature endeared him to many naturally he inspired considerable jealousy in his rivals and was not without detractors to question both his methods and ability that blowitz the brilliant and hardheaded reporter and interviewer was at the same time an incurable romantic with a taste for melodrama and love of the sensational is obvious from his memoirs a highly entertaining work made up of material published in his lifetime and episodes dictated in his last year he kept no diaries and is said to have taken a note only rarely how far the memoirs are to be trusted is a nice point flashman was familiar with them but is no guide to their reliability part of his story is identical in outline with one chapter of the memoirs but since blowitz is the source in both cases this means nothing the enthusiastic bohemian was never one to spoil a good tale for want of dramatic colouring and frank giles a later times paris correspondent whose biography of blowitz is admirably fair and meticulously researched describes the memoirs as a remarkable collection of fact and fiction and echoes the feeling of a former times proprietor that at times the facts have collapsed under the sheer weight of a powerful imagination much of what blowitz wrote can never be checked and there is no knowing how great a part his vivid imagination played in what he told flashman who seems to have believed him for what that is worth i do not hesitate to cite blowitz in these footnotes for whatever his failings he was at his best the most superior kind of journalist a real reporter blowitzs obsession with destiny etc his tales of adventures with marseilles communards mysterious european royalty and his kidnapping by gypsies are to be found in the memoirs the story that he and his lover threw the ladys husband overboard in marseilles harbour is told by prince von bulow later german chancellor who is not regarded as an invariably reliable source frank giles a prince of journalists prince von bulow memoirs which contains a fine picture of blowitz in his working clothes when and where flashman served in the french foreign legion has not yet emerged from his papers several references suggest north africa but it is not impossible that he was with the legion in mexico c when he was aidedecamp to the illfated emperor maximilian au jus was the cry of the coffee orderlies at reveille and the sausage music is presumably a reference to the legions march tiens voila du boudin the authority for grants meeting with macmahon and their total failure to communicate is grant himself at least they bowed and shook hands grants aversion to handshaking was notorious as was his taciturnity in sir stafford northcotes budget described as unambitious increased the duty on dogs and tobacco and raised income tax by d mrs brassey published the voyage of the sunbeam an account of her roundtheworld cruise by yacht the phonograph was a popular novelty and gilbert and sullivans hms pinafore had its first night on may at the opera comique the great hit of the show was he is an englishman which became almost a second national anthem as usual with his summaries of international affairs flashmans account of events in the balkans the russoturkish war and the treaty of san stefano is sketchy and racy but accurate in its broad essentials the treaty reflecting russias panslavic ambition to bring the balkans under russian control was hard on the defeated turks and was opposed by austria and britain a conference of the european powers had been in prospect for some time but was jeopardised by russias objection to a british demand that the san stefano settlement should be submitted to discussion by the powers largely through the honest broker efforts of bismarck the german chancellor an understanding was reached between britain and russia and the congress of berlin was held in june and july of to revise the treaty and achieve a balance in southeastern europe blowitzs opinion of shuvalov is echoed in von bulow count shuvalov was a clever skilful amiable and distinguished man but like so many russians he worshipped more than was fitting at the shrine of aphrodite pandemos the cartoons of the two english grooms and the crafty fishmonger and the article headed hankey pankey are to be found in punch of may the voluptuous figure entitled harlequin spring fashions really a very little addition to the tooscanty and bespangled costumes mr punch has noticed so often lately appeared in the previous week according to von bulow on one of his evening walks in the friederichstrasse which the berlin police supervised so discreetly to prevent any unpleasant incident he had made the acquaintance of a toofacile lady from whose arms it was difficult to entice him flashmans version of the congress of berlin tallies fairly well with blowitzs which does not differ in its essentials from other accounts from whom blowitz obtained the advance copy of the treaty is unknown waddington the french foreign minister has been suggested he was english by blood though born in paris and like flashman was educated at rugby but there is no evidence that he was the source of the leak what is certain is that blowitz had an excellent source at the heart of the congress and scooped his rivals in daytoday reporting as well as in obtaining the treaty much to their annoyance especially the germans he did interview bismarck and seems to have bluffed him into withholding the treaty from the german press by himself demanding an exclusive copy he left the congress early pretending to sulk dictated from memory a substantial portion to his secretary had the text telegraphed from brussels by his secretary and the following day had the satsifaction of an exclusive story in the times it was one of the greatest scoops in newspaper history although flashman is wrong in saying that all the clauses appeared in fact seven did not there is one important difference between flashmans version of the congress and that given by blowitz in his memoirs blowitz says that his information source and gobetween was a young foreigner who had approached blowitz for help and whom he infiltrated into the entourage of an unidentified statesman at the congress once installed he passed information to blowitz by means of the hat exchange this seems a highly unlikely story and it is reasonable to assume that blowitz in writing his memoirs invented it to protect the identities of flashman caprice and shuvalov it is worth noting that von bulows story of shuvalovs infatuation with a courtesan is consistent with flashmans version sir garnet wolseley confirmed his reputation as britains first soldier by his suppression in of the egyptian armys revolt against the khedive the rebellion was led by arabi pasha an ardent nationalist and antieuropean and after the massacre of more than a hundred foreigners at alexandria the ports defences were bombarded by the royal navy and egypt was invaded by wolseleys force which eventually numbered he gained control of the suez canal and when his advance guard was attacked by arabi at kassassin on august the egyptian infantry were routed by a moonlight charge of the british cavalry in which the life guards and the blues of the household brigade were prominent sir baker russells horse was shot under him but he mounted another presumably with flashmans assistance arabis army of about was strongly entrenched at telelkebir but after a remarkable night march of six miles in silence wolseleys force made a surprise dawn attack headed by the highland brigade who overwhelmed the egyptian position about of the defenders were killed for the loss of british dead and wounded and missing cairo was occupied after a forced march arabi was captured and exiled to ceylon and the rebellion had been crushed in days one can only take flashmans word for it that there was a strong shave in the clubs about gordon as early as the beginning of october the situation in the sudan did not begin to look critical until after the wipeout of hicks command by the mahdi at kashgil early in november and gordons name does not appear to have been mentioned in official circles until some weeks later when gordon himself was still contemplating service in the congo no doubt flashmans instinct for selfpreservation made him unusually prescient the first official journey of the famous orient express began at the gare de lest paris on the evening of sunday october the great train was the brainchild of georges nagelmackers of liege founder of the compagnie internationale des wagonlits and realised his dream of a through express of unsurpassed luxury which should run to the ends of europe that first train consisted of the locomotive two baggage cars two sleepingcars and a dining salon which was to become justly famous about forty passengers made the inaugural trip from paris to constantinople among them ministers of the french and belgian governments several journalists including blowitz a turkish diplomat mishak effendi and nagelmackers himself it is interesting in view of the alias supplied by blowitz for flashman in berlin five years earlier that on the orient express blowitz shared voiture with a dutchman named janszen blowitz got a book out of the trip which was a memorable one even by his standards for in constantinople he obtained the first interview ever granted by the ruler of the ottoman empire sultan abdulhamid ii in bucharest he also interviewed the king of roumania and being blowitz he thoroughly enjoyed the luxury and conviviality of the journey especially the dining salon one cannot blame him as all who have travelled on it agree there is no train like the orient express whoever princess kralta may have been she was obviously a lady of considerable attraction and character it is possible that blowitz concealed her real name since it is a device he employs elsewhere in his memoirs the only hint he gives of her origin is to describe her mother as an oriental flower but from flashmans description it would seem that her father at least was european and northern european at that be that as it may kralta appears to have occupied an influential position in continental diplomatic and royal society the account of her activities which blowitz gave to flashman tallies closely with the memoirs her acquaintance with bismarck his employment of her to discover how blowitz had got the berlin treaty the melodramatic incident of the candle in the draught which alerted blowitz to her treachery and the sensational tale of how at the german emperors request she soothed the distracted bismarck with some kind of diversion all these are in the chapter entitled with blowitzian panache the revenge of venus he does not state bluntly how she diverted bismarck but the inference could hardly be clearer for flashmans experiences with kralta we have only his own testimony as to her appearance and personality he is more detailed than blowitz but there are no contradictions between them both agree that she was imperious and charming and while flashman is more specific about what are called vital statistics he can have had no quarrel with the little bohemians romantic raptures blowitz was beglamoured on first sight of the princess at a dinner party to such an extent that he could not remember who else was present a most unusual lapse of his remarkable memory he enthuses about her beauty radiance exquisite elegance silky hair melodious voice blue eyes which lighted up one of the most fascinating faces i have ever seen and so on he even notes the brilliancy of her teeth there is something approaching awe in his description of her crossing a room with the vague rustle of her silken robes like a rapid vision and one gets the impression sometimes that he was rather afraid of her this is the first substantial reference in the papers to flashmans sojourn in mexico in the latter half of the s hitherto we have known only that he spent time in a mexican prison and was an aidedecamp to the unfortunate emperor maximilian younger brother of emperor franzjosef of austria maximilian an amiable and wellintentioned prince interested in botany was a pawn in the ambitious schemes of napoleon iii of france who took advantage of civil war in mexico to send in a french army ostensibly to collect war debts from the victorious liberals of benito juarez but in fact to establish a puppet empire under maximilian who was persuaded to accept the mexican crown in he set up a government and was planning social and educational reforms including freedom for the indians but juarezs forces remained hostile to the imperial regime and when napoleon withdrew his forces partly due to pressure from the americans who were sympathetic to juarezs republicans maximilian was left to his fate he made a brave fight of it but was captured by the juaristas in may and executed by firing squad in the following month what part flashman played in these events will no doubt be revealed when his mexican papers come to light we know that he was in the us with president lincoln a few days before the latters death in april so his mexican adventures were presumably confined to the next two years at most the reference to princess salmsalm the wife of prince felix salmsalm a german officer who served in the us civil war and was later chief adc to maximilian in mexico suggests that flashman was involved in the efforts which both the prince and princess made to save the emperors life she was a handsome and fearless lady who has left a spirited account of her adventures in mexico and of her later life in european royal circles and in the francoprussian war in which her husband was killed her ten years of my life and the princes my diary in mexico which she published after his death give invaluable details of maximilians last days that the emperor maximilian was a cricketer seems to be confirmed by a photograph in a brussels museum in which he is seen posing at the end of a match with members of the british legation in mexico city c the editor is indebted to colonel j m c watson for a copy of this picture flashman seldom elaborates on international affairs and it is probable that he has summarised with commendable accuracy the information given him by willem von starnberg touching on the state of the austrian empire and its ruler the hungarian question and the relations of emperor franzjosef the empress elisabeth and their son the crown prince rudolf in franzjosef of austria had escaped with a bad neck wound when he was stabbed by a hungarian apprentice whose knife was impeded by the emperors stiff military collar uniform also saved the life of the elderly german emperor in when the helmet which he insisted on wearing in accordance with regulations took the blast of a doublebarrelled shotgun he had survived another shooting attempt only three weeks earlier tsar alexander ii of russia was less fortunate he was killed by a second bomb in st petersburg in only minutes after an earlier device had wrecked his carriage p the quotation is from in ambush in stalky and co p which it still retains ischl in flashmans time had a population of fewer than and seems to have changed little since then its lack of size makes it a pleasant little gem among european resorts tranquil and unhurried in its grand surroundings and its shops and coffeehouses with their remarkable range of confections remain as attractive as ever it is appropriate that such a ruritanian setting should have been home to franz lehar his villa remains on the banks of the traun the golden ship was serving excellent cabbage a few years ago and frosch and his colleagues were still amusing audiences at the little theatre anyone visiting the kaiservilla the royal lodge at bad ischl will probably share flashmans abiding memory the lodge today is much as he describes it and the horns of the emperors quarries still adorn its walls in profusion there is in fact a secret stairway from the emperors rooms remarkably modest chambers simply furnished with among other items the plain iron bedstead which he used it is such an ordinary bedroom that it is hard to realise that this is where the first world war began flashmans brief acquaintance with franzjosef illustrates many of the emperors characteristics his passion for the military his poor grasp of languages other than his own his rather stuffy formality his devotion to administrative detail and the simplicity of his tastes boiled beef and beer was a favourite meal he enjoyed his rubbers of tarok and in his later years especially it was a regular evening pastime there is an old saltmine in the mountains of the saltzkammergut above ischl which corresponds so closely to flashmans description that it must surely be the same one the strange pool is still there and the bogies run on rails from the mine entrance into the great cavern the quoted line is spoken by rudolf rassendyll to count rupert of hentzau in the prisoner of zenda flashman claimed that he had told the story of his strackenz adventure to anthony hope hawkins and that the novelist used it as the basis for his famous romance modelling the count of hentzau on rudi von starnberg caprice must have charmed at least three copies of punch from her english tourist including the most recent issue in which france is depicted as a homely old woman the cartoon of gladstone dancing the hornpipe is from a september number and the alluring figure labelled manchester ship canal is earlier still punchs antigallic prejudice runs through all three numbers the blimpish british officers cited by flashman are characters in hector servadac one of jules vernes later sciencefiction novels police whistles came into use in there were many distinguished de la tour dauvergnes principally theophile maio corret of that name a french soldier renowned for his courage and chivalry who died in having consistently refused promotion beyond the rank of captain he was known as the first grenadier of france w pembroke fetridge was the author of the american travellers guide harpers handbook for travellers in europe which first appeared in flashman probably had the edition the unique position which chinese gordon held in the eyes of officialdom and the public was demonstrated by the fact that when he left charing cross station for the sudan the foreign secretary bought his ticket the duke of cambridge held the carriage door for him and lord wolseley carried his bag the subtleties of baccarat see here flashman says the prince of wales looking hunted and chewing his cigar as though it were plug tobacco you must get me out o this god knows what mother would say i couldnt think there was much she hadnt said already when youre a queen of unblemished virtue devoted to duty and the high moral tone and your son and heir to the throne is a notorious wastrel who counts all time lost when he aint stuffing swilling sponging off rich toadeaters and rogering everything in skirts youre apt to be censorious why shed once told elspeth that she was determined to outlive the brute cos he wasnt fit to be king so there but in the present instance so far as id gathered from his incoherent growls i was shot if i could see what he was in a stew about for once he appeared to be blameless yet here he was mangling his weed and twitching like a frightened falstaff we were alone and he was too fretful to be on his dignity so i guided him to a chair soothed him with a stiff b and s lit him a fresh smoke waited courtierlike while he coughed his innards out and invited him to restate his troubles as calmly as might be to sympathetic old flashy ive just told you snaps he wheezing and wiping his piggy eyes it is the most shocking business they say bill cumming has cheated at baccarat thats what id thought he said the first time and wondered if id misheard but he seemed sober and rational if agitated you mean last night sir in the billiardroom yes confound it and the night before you were there hang it all well i had been as an occasional spectator looking in from time to time to make sure my featherbrained wife wasnt slapping down her jewellery and crying banco but i wasnt having this i should explain that baccarat is the most imbecile of card games in which halfwits sit round a large table and the banker deals two cards to the crowd on his right two to those on his left and two to himself the object being to get as near a total of nine with your two cards as may be if your side gets two deuces youll ask for a third card wont you hoping for a four or a five and the banker has the same privilege if he gets closer to nine he wins if he doesnt you win endless fun my dear assuming you can count up to nine and if it dont rival chess exactly at least its simplicity leaves little room for sharp practice which was why i couldnt credit what his fat highness was telling me cheated at baccarat no sir it cant be done i told him well not unless youre the banker and even then with a fourpack deck more than two hundred cards why youd have to be the very devil of a mechanic i considered cant think ive ever seen it tried no not out west even mind you they dont go in for baccarat much vingtetun mostly and poker damn poker croaks he he cheated i tell you and i was the blasted banker come to think of it so he had been on both nights and for a happy moment i wondered if hed been slipping em off the bottom himself and was trying to shift the blame in true royal style but that wouldnt do he hadnt the spunk for it let me get this right sir you tell me gordoncumming cheated for gods sake who says so coventry and owen williams there can be no doubt about it i saw nothing wrong but they are quite positive since one of them was a deaf peer and tother a welsh majorgeneral i didnt put much stock in this they say they saw him sharping no no not they these dreadful wilson people the young ones our hosts children dammit four or five of them young wilson and that impossible fellow green and two of the ladies even they all saw him cheat i tell you he thumped his knee almost eating his cigar why did i ever allow myself to be prevailed upon to come to this infernal house it will be a lesson to me flashman i dont mind telling you did you ever hear anything so monstrous if its true sir how do they say he cheated why by adding to his stake putting on counters after the coups were declared in his sides favour and taking em off when hed lost they saw him do it time and again apparently on both nights when i groans he was holding the bank the more i heard the dafter it became im no gambling man myself much and have never had the skill or nerve for sharping anyway but in my time ive seen em all stud games in abilene livery stables with guns and goldpokes down on the blanket nap schools from ballarat to the bay pennyante blackjack in political country houses and watched the sharks at work with cold decks shaved edges marked backs and everything up their sleeves bar a trained midget and you may take my word for it the last place on gods earth youd want to sit on the queen of spades or try to juggle the stakes is grandmamas drawingroom after dinner you wont last five minutes as gordoncumming i was asked to believe had discovered and no one said anything at the time why why no he blinked in bearded bewilderment no they did not the ladies i suppose the ghastly scene that must have followed he made vague gestures with his cigar but they felt they could not keep silent altogether and told williams and coventry and they he fairly snarled have told me before dinner tonight why they felt obliged to drag me into the wretched business i cannot think its too bad sheer vapouring of course as prince of wales first gentleman of europe he was the bright particular star and pack leader of the genteel rabble assembled at tranby croft yorks for the doncaster races and knew perfectly well that any serious breach of polite behaviour by a fellow guest such as cardsharping was bound to land on his mat i reminded him of this tactfully and added that i didnt believe it for a minute some foolish mistake or misunderstanding i said depend upon it no such thing he heaved his guts out of the chair and began to pace about the young wilsons and green aye and that chap whatshisname levett who is in cummings own regiment for heavens sake all avow it they saw him cheat coventry and williams are in no doubt whatsoever its too frightful for words he gloomed at me all hangdog german jowls can you imagine the scandal if it should come out if it were to reach the queens ears that such a thing had happened in in my presence he took a step towards me my dear harry you know about these things what is to be done one thing was plain it wasnt cummings supposed sleight of hand that was putting him in a ferment but that it had happened in a game presided over by his royal grossness and whatever would mama say when she heard that hed been spreading the boards like faro jack tame stuff from where i stood compared to his whoremongering and general depravity but if it had shaken him to the point where i was his dear harry he must be desperate id steered him out of more than one scrape in the past and here he was again looking at me like an owl in labour so first things first what does gordoncumming say he denies it outright of course williams and coventry saw him before dinner and you havent spoken to him yourself then he shuddered no and i dread it you think i should not oh if i could avoid it how am i to face him an old friend an intimate of years a fellow officer a baronet dammit a a man of honour aye thats a word well hear more of before this is done thinks i tell me sir these eagleeyed youngsters how much do they claim cumming bilked em of he goggled at me what on earth has that to do with it if a fellow cheats what does the amount matter something id say now i didnt play either night but my elspeth said something about five and ten bob stakes so it cant have been much of a high game heavens no a friendly game to amuse the ladies why i set the bank limit at a hundred pounds both nights so cumming cant have won more than a hundred or two can he well i dont know what hes worth some say eighty thou pa but he has a place in scotland house in town halfcolonelcy in the guards moves in the top flight and ive never heard he was short o the ready have you he shook his head glowering well sir would he risk his good name his commission his place in society good lord everything he counts worth while for a few wretched quid that wouldnt keep him in cheroots for a year why sir it dont bear looking at even and it didnt im ready to believe evil of anyone usually with good cause and especially of sir william gordoncumming bart whose reputation id have been happy to blacken any day but this accusation made no sense at all quite apart from the mechanical difficulties of the thing the paltry sums involved and the ghastly risk hed have been running all of which id pointed out there was my knowledge of the mans character which was that of a toplofty prig with immense notions of his own dignity whod have regarded cheating as shocking bad form and never mind dishonesty no it wouldnt do but there was no persuading bertie the bounder of that he was in such a funk about the possible scandal that sweet reason was lost on him and those two duffers coventry and williams had convinced him that the evidence was overwhelming how they demanded when id prevailed on the prince to have em in so that i might hear their tale firsthand could five intelligent young people be mistaken not on one occasion only but on several hold hard a moment says i lets take it in order two nights ago monday you played baccarat in the smokingroom after dinner i was only in and out while you played but as i recall you had three card tables pushed together with a cloth over them to play at your highness had the bank williams was croupier cries bertie eager to share the guilt only on the second night sir says williams there was no croupier on the monday bertie scowled but couldnt deny it at all events there were two tableaux of players one to your right sir and one to your left where was gordoncumming sitting they consulted about this and decided hed been in the lefthand group or tableaux mrs arthur wilson our hosts wife had been first to the princes left then an empty chair then berkeley levett then round the corner young jack wilson the son of the house and gordoncumming next to him with one of the somersets beyond each staked individually and took turns at handling the cards dealt to their side how did they place their stakes precisely i asked with counters supplied by his highness says coventry looking at him as though he were an opium runner i think i see the case yonder sure enough there was a polished wooden box on the table and bertie opened it reluctantly to display the leather counters all stamped with his feathers crest brown ј chips bright red fivers blue oncers and so on tools of the devil i could hear the queen calling them they travelled with him everywhere i take it everyone staked before his highness dealt says i pushing their counter or counters forward on the table then the cards would be dealt your highness would declare the banks score and then youd pay out or rake in accordingly is that so sir bertie gave a furtive grunt he was hating this as much as i was enjoying it i dare say well then what happened they all stood mum waiting on each other come along gentlemen says i getting brisk who saw whom cheating and when and how it was like pulling teeth they hemmed and hawed or at least coventry did while williams contradicted him and bertie ground his teeth and flung his cigar in the fire at last they got it straight more or less on the very first deal young jack wilson had seen cumming stake ј and then looking again when their side won and the prince was preparing to pay out had seen to his astonishment that cummings stake had magically increased from one red counter to three ј where there had been only ј before he couldnt be mistaken because cumming placed his stake on a piece of white paper which he used for making notes of the play young wilson had thought it damned odd and later on the fifth or sixth deal when their side had won again hed seen cumming drop three red chips furtivelike on to the paper where there had originally been only one hed collected ј cool as dammit and young wilson had whispered to levett seated beside him the good news that his colonel was working a flanker levett had sworn wilson must be wrong but had watched himself and blowed if he hadnt seen cumming do the same thing again twice once hed added two ј chips and the second time hed added one on both occasions after his tableau had been declared the winner described like that in detail it sounded impressive i had to admit and the prince regarded me with piggy triumph there you see flashman two men one in his own regiment too and both sure of what they saw you saw nothing out o the way yourself sir certainly not i was occupied with the cards and the bank true enough he would be but there was something damned strange which theyd evidently overlooked if cumming was cheating i asked them why on earth did he use the brightest chips the red fivers i indicated the open box look at em they stand out a mile and to make em even more conspicuous he laid them on a white paper hang it all sir if hed wanted to be caught he couldnt have been more obvious they couldnt explain it and bertie said testily that what id said might very well be true but it didnt alter the fact that hed been seen padding his stakes whatever blasted colour they were and what was to be done eh i said id heard the stories of young wilson and levett but what about the other three williams said that after the first nights play young wilson had told his mother what he and levett had seen wilsons sister and her husband a chap called lycett green had also been informed and theyd resolved to keep an eye on cumming the next night tuesday young wilson had arranged for a long table to be set up in the billiard room covered with baize and with a chalk line round the margin beyond which the stakes would be placed that way they thought cumming wouldnt be able to cheat i couldnt believe my ears were they mad says i they were sure the man was a swindler yet they were prepared to play with him again and spy on him and they never thought to tell old wilson the father of the family or anyone senior coventry looked stuffed at this and bertie muttered about the shocking state of society nowadays ignorant upstarts who knew no better and he was a fool to have come within a hundred miles of the confounded place etc etc williams said that mrs wilson had wanted at all costs to avoid a scandal and if they hadnt played it would have looked odd and people might have talked and so on and so forth very well what happened on the tuesday night i asked was he seen juggling his chips again twice at least says williams he was seen to push a ј counter over the line after his highness had declared baccarat to the bank meaning the bank had lost on another occasion he used his pencil to flick a ј counter increasing his ј stake to ј which he added gloomily was what i as croupier paid him but you saw nothing irregular yourself no tho i recall that at one hand i cant tell which cumming called out to his highness there is another tenner due here sir and from what i have learned this evening i believe it may have been on an occasion when he when he played ah wrongly he was one of your decent asses williams and didnt like to say it plain i remember distinctly telling him to put his stakes where i could see ern says bertie but i suspected nothing who was sitting by him the second night coventry gave a start why my wife lady coventry but i believe she gave her place up to lady flashman for one or two coups did she not williams why so she did says williams turning to me i remember now cumming was advising your wife about her stakes flashman he gave a ruptured grin they were being rather jolly about it you know she was well i gathered she did not know much about the game and he was helping her i dont suppose she saw anything fishy says bertie bitterly i knew what he meant if cumming had worn a black mask and made em turn out their pockets at pistolpoint shed have thought it was all in the game well there you are flashman says bertie he flung down in a chair a picture of disgruntled anxiety you know as much as we do its past belief that gordoncumming of all men he gave a despairing shrug but there can be no doubt of it can there he was positively yearning at coventry and williams they are certain of what they saw sure as a gun they told him so i intruded the kind of question that occurs only to minds like mine and youre satisfied they aint lying says i and was met by exclamations of dismay paws in the air whatever next of course theyre not barks bertie heavens above man would they invent such a dreadful thing its about as likely as bill cumming cheating for a few sovs i reminded him but there it is one or tother unless levett and young wilson were drunk and seeing double really flashman cries williams and the other witnesses on the second night youll hardly suggest that mrs wilson or mrs lycett green were no general but i will suggest that people often see what they expect to see and im dam sure both those ladies and lycett green sat down last night convinced from what theyd been told that cumming was a wrong un very well i went on as they whinnied their protests and bertie told me i was talking bosh have it as you please i still say cumming hasnt been nailed to the wall hard enough to satisfy me but hes got a heap of explaining to do i grant you i set my sights on bertie and since your highness has done me the honour to ask my advice i respectfully suggest that you examine these five allseeing accusers yourself and gordoncumming before things go any further since this was plain common sense it earned me a couple of bovine looks and a royal glare and growl so i begged leave to withdraw and loafed off leaving the three wise men to blink at each other and resume their chorus of what is to be done five words which are as sound a motto for disaster as i know ive heard em at kabul before the retreat at cawnpore on the heights above the north valley at balaclava and i wont swear someone wasnt croaking them as we laboured up the greasy grass slope behind g a custer god rest his fatheaded soul no one ever knows the answer you see so everyone looks blank until the man in command makes up his mind in panic and invariably does the wrong thing i took a turn in the empty billiard room imbibing a meditative brandy and tickling the pills while i considered this unexpected but most welcome bit of mischief which promised to enliven what had been a damned dull visit so far ive never been any hand as you know at dancing attendance on royalty unless its young and female but especially not beastly bert nor do i enjoy the unsought hospitality of society parvenus in the wilds of yorkshire with nothing to do but watch horses run in the pouring rain racings well enough when youre young and riding yourself but now that i was in my seventieth year and disinclined to back anything more mettlesome than an armchair i found it quite as interesting as a sermon in gaelic so this baccarat nonsense with its splendid possibilities of scandal disgrace and general devilment looked made to order for diversion provided it was properly mismanaged which with bertie in a fine funk coventry and williams advising and myself ready to butter the stairs as chance offered it probably would be you may think this a tame enough occupation for one who has assisted at as many major catastrophes as i have and a poor setting after the camps and courts of the mighty but i was getting on you know and as the good book says theres a time for racketing about crying haha among the trumpets and a time for sitting back with your feet dipped in butter watching others fall in the mire and i may tell you not all adventures are to be found midst shot and shell thank god what happened at tranby croft that september week of was as desperate a drama in its quiet way as any ive struck and a mystery which has baffled the wise for twenty years but will no longer for i was in the thick of it and can tell you precisely what happened and why and since ill be snug in my long home ere this account meets the public eye you may rely on its truth incredible as it may appear a docile horse in the first place id never have gone near tranby croft but for elspeth she was a bosom chum of young daisy brooke who was half her age and one of the leading society fillies of the day but cast in the same eccentric mould well you know what elspeth s like and daisy who was known as babbling brooke was a sort of mad socialist even today when shes countess of warwick no less she still raves in a ladylike way about the workers enough said at the time of tranby she was a stunning looker rich as croesus randy as a rabbit and prince berties mount of the moment indeed i aint sure she wasnt the love of his life for hed thrown over lily langtry in her favour and remained uncommon faithful to her until keppel started wobbling her rump at him ill say this for him he had fine taste in bareback riders as i should know id shared langtry with him behind his back and done my duty by pretty daisy as who hadnt not la keppel though she was after my time worse luck not heaving in view until id reached what macaulay calls the years of chicken broth and flannel when you realise how dam ridiculous youd look chasing dollymops young enough to be your daughter and seek solace in booze baccy and books regrettable of course but less tiring and expensive anyway young daisy brooke had been first of the invited guests to tranby and had persuaded bertie that the party would be incomplete without her pal elspeth lady flashman i had my own jaundiced view of that born of fifty years marriage to my dear one who i had reason to believe had not been averse to male attentions in those years when id been abroad funking the queens enemies not that i could be certain mind you never have been and she may have been as chaste as st cecilia but i strongly suspected that the little trollop had been galloped by half the army list including hrh the prince of wales and william gordoncumming bart true twas only gossip that she and bertie had been at grips in a pottingshed at windsor in when i was off in maryland helping to start the yankees civil war but id seen him ogling her on and off ever since as to the louse cumming he was too tall and fair and greek godlike by half and had made a dead run at elspeth back in the sixties and him twenty years her junior the lecherous young rip no doubt hed been successful but id no proof shed basked in his admiration right enough but since she did that with every man she met it meant neither nowt nor somewhat the thing that set cumming apart from her other flirtations was that after twenty years acquaintance she had suddenly dropped him like a hot rivet even cut him dead in the row i never knew why and didnt inquire the less i knew of her transgressions the better i reckon thats why weve always been such a loving couple id run across cumming professionally in zululand where he was staffwalloping chelmsford while i was fleeing headlong from isanlwana and wed met here and there at home and been halfcivil as i always am to suspected old flames of elspeth wouldnt have anyone to talk to otherwise and you cant have em thinking youre a jealous husband by the time of tranby to be sure elspeth was of an age where it should have been unlikely that either bertie or cumming would try to drag her behind the sofa but i still didnt care to think of her within the fatfingered reach of one or the trim moustache of tother shed worn uncommon well middle sixties and still shaped like a turkish bellydancer with the same guileless idiot smile and wondrous blue eyes that had set me slavering when she was sixteen shed performed like a demented houri then and who was to say shed lost the taste in half a century why i remember reading of some french kings mistress pompadour or some such who was still grinding away when she was eighty well there you are so i wasnt best pleased when the tranby invitation arrived however i figured that with daisy on hand to keep bertie busy and cumming reportedly pushing about some american female i could stop at home with an easy mind then at the last minute blessed if one of daisys aged relatives didnt croak and since it would not have done for dear lady flashman to attend their foul houseparty unaccompanied i was dragooned cursing into service i doubt if our prince gave three cheers either for all the good toadying turns id done him he was still leery of me and didnt care to look me in the eye guilty conscience no doubt until now that is when he found himself taken unawares by the makings of a prime scandal and the prospect of being ritually disembowelled by our gracious sovereign when she heard of it and serve the fat blighter right i reflected on these matters as i shoved the ivories round the cushions and reviewed events since wed assembled at tranby two days earlier which was monday it was your middling country house owned by a shipping moneybags named wilson not society as youd notice but his place was convenient to doncaster where they were running the leger on the wednesday and if his family and friends were secondrun as these things are judged in the impolite world well prince bertie was a fellow vulgarian and right at home there were enough of his regular crawlers cumming and the somersets to keep him happy the wilson gang toadied him to admiration and as in most bourgeois establishments the rations liquor and appointments were firstrate none of your freezing baronial banquet halls where the soup arrives stone cold after being toted half a mile by gouty servitors and the bedsprings havent been seen to since richard the thirds day it was cosy and quite jolly the young folk were lively without being a nuisance bertie was at ease and affable and if it was all a dead bore it was comfortable at least elspeth was in her element flaunting her mature charms on the first evening in a paris rigout which drew glittering smiles of envy from the female brigade and an approving grunt and leer from bertie shed had the deuce of a struggle getting into the thing with me heaving at her stays but once all was fast and sheeted home she looked nothing like the grandmother she was with her hair artfully tinted and that milky complexion carefully enhanced but above all with that happy complacent radiance which she hasnt lost yet and shes close on ninety now aye shes always had the priceless gift of pleasing has elspeth and making people laugh for shes a damned funny woman when she wants to be a tophole mimic and all the more engaging because she plainly hasnt got two brains to rub together never see her but it sets me in humour palmerston used to say that was her talent to make folk happy she charmed bertie seated by her at dinner won admiring glances from the other men with her artless prattle and to my astonishment even exchanged pleasant banter with gordon cumming hollo thinks i has the old fire rekindled watching her at work i rather liked the look of her myself and that night waking in the small hours to find that plump excellence cuddled up against me i was amazed to find myself inspired to climb aboard puffing and creaking while she giggled drowsily saying i was a disgrace and would do myself a mischief at our age she murmured afterwards whatever would the children say oh harry lad dyou mind the madagascar forest harry harry my dear are you all right shall i fetch you a glass of water a little brandy perhaps i was thinking glory glory what a hell of a way to die being in no condition to move let alone answer but i remember noting that she hadnt minded a bit and saying to myself aye youll still bear watching ah but fond recollection has carried me ahead of events it was on that night after dinner that the prince had proposed baccarat and cumming had supposedly cheated for the first time id no inkling of this of course nor yet on the tuesday evening when hed been seen doctoring his stakes yet again the bounder they said now on the wednesday night the murder was out and i was in the pool room trying to fathom it and i confess wondering what i might do to jolly the mischief along well you know my style and between ourselves wouldnt you first though to the fathoming so far as i could judge there was a choice of three explanations each one so farfetched as to be nigh impossible odds on with the punters in the know was that cumming had cheated it didnt wash with me much though id have liked to believe it he was a prime tick and arrant snob a very model of military and social excellence cool handsome lordly rich and moustached wore his handkerchief in his sleeve looked down his nose at the world probably was too fastidious to shave in his bath might well be a former paramour of my beloved and on all these counts was ripe for any dirty turn i could serve him but that wasnt the point however detestable i might think him the plain fact was that swindling simply wasnt his style i told myself that even the unlikeliest folk do the damnedest things was it possible that cumming was the kind of reckless ass whod play foul in a trifling game not for gain but for the sheer mad fun of the thing to see if he could get away with it there are such fellows ive seen em rudi starnberg for one ah but he was a villain in love with knavery cumming wasnt and for all the boneheaded bravery hed supposedly shown at ulundi and in the sudan i couldnt see him bucking this tiger he had too much to lose and while i hate to say it he was a gentleman then the witnesses were either mistaken or lying but error must be discounted two or even three people might improbably be mistaken but five on two different nights so all that remained was a conspiracy to disgrace gordoncumming by five assorted perjurers ridiculous you say well i dont ive sworn truth out of england myself all too often and seen the saintliest specimens lie themselves black and blue for the unlikeliest reasons ive also known from the age of three that honour and solemn oath and word of a gentleman are mere piss in the wind of greed ambition and fear still you had only to look at the five witnesses to see that conspiracy was too farfetched altogether none of em even knew cumming all that well or had reason to dislike him let alone plot his ruin and one of them could be ruled out flat here they are arthur stanley wilson son of the house a bright young spark who lived off papa and hoped to be taken for a manabouttown fairly brainless and possibly capable of being wild id have thought but hardly vicious his sister mrs lycett green middling pretty inoffensive ordinary enough and decidedly not lucrezia borgia in the making her husband lycett green a stiffish old young man well pleased with himself and his position as master of foxhounds in some northern swamp in my experience there are dolts pompous dolts and mfhs but they aint the plotting kind berkeley levett a sound muttonhead in cummings regiment and presumably as well disposed to his chief as subalterns ever are given that guards officers are usually incapable of any feeling outside their bellies and loins four unlikely conspirators youll allow unless you conceived it possible that cumming a noted rake had ravished mrs lycett green before tea on the monday and provoked the other three into concocting a diabolic plot to avenge her honour but the fifth witness killed the plot notion stone dead she was mrs arthur wilson our hosts wife as respectable a matron as ever rebuked a cook nervously gratified beyond measure at the honour of having royalty to stay and the last person as bertie himself had remarked to wish to have scandal breaking over her roof if she said shed seen cumming jockeying his chips she meant it so there was no explanation and if i wanted to get to the bottom of the mystery which i confess was beginning to intrigue me for its own sake i needed more eyewitness information it would also be as well to discover if the scandal had leaked at all on both counts my best source would be the wife of my bosom who may be tripebrained but has the eyes ears and instincts of an afridi scout especially for things that dont concern her i made a leisurely patrol quartering ground and sniffing the wind the lycett greens were nowhere to be seen but mrs wilson was fretting at her fan and listening absentminded to lady coventry in the drawingroom and when i looked in at the smoke hole young wilson and levett were in deep confabulation instantly dropped when i appeared but not before i heard levett exclaim i cant touch it jack i tell you hes my chief dash it signs and portents thinks i and passed on to the musicroom where one of the females was butchering yumyum to the feigned admiration of the company and my quarry was ensconced in a corner fleecing some unfortunate foreigner at backgammon shaking the dice and her upper works the abandoned old tart in a way which plainly put him off his game altogether another double six count trills she all rosy triumph i declare i never threw so many oh and now a double four what luck why i am off entirely oh dear and you have a man on the bar still oh what a shame harry come and see i have a backgammon arent i lucky no no count i wont have it put your purse in your pocket we play for love not money says she looking roguish no no i shant take it really i assure you will you not play another game after two gammons and a backgammon in five games cries the ancient squarehead ah dear lady flashman against chance and skill i can struggle but when they are allied with beauty and charm i am overpowered altogether am i not right sir harry but i insist on paying my just debts says he planting his sovs in her palm which gave the old goat the chance to kiss her hand and take a last fond leer at her top hamper while she purred and protested och isnt he the wee duck sighs she jingling her loot as he hobbled away aye weel mony a mickle maks a muckle as papa used to say she slipped it into her bag and broke into civilised speech but you know harry it was quite embarrassing for i threw six and one and double one and double six ever so often im sure he believes i use loaded dice loaded tits more like i was so glad to see you for he breathes ever so hard i cant think why and i could see he hated losing and it was such a bore she lowered her voice as she took my arm indeed its all rather a bore dont you think will we be able to go home tomorrow would the prince be offended i feel i have had as much of tranby company as i can bear and im sure it can be no fun for you dearest the piano gang had begun to perform the last rites on three little maids with immense jollity and as we went out she pulled a face and whispered i mean the wilsons do their best and are ever so kind and and eager to please but they are not really quite the thing are they shes gods own original snob my little paisley princess as though her millowning father had been a whit better than the wilsons but the little skinflint had collared a peerage in his declining years you see and she seemed to think that his coronet and cash with my vc and military rank to say nothing of her own occasional intimacy with the queen raised us above the common herd which i guess they did in an odd way or if not above apart at least we aint topdrawer but theres no denying were different i told her if shed had enough of it we could be away on the morning train now that the legers run i doubt if hrh will linger but i thought youd been enjoying yourself old girl what with cheering on the winners and sporting your glad rags and most becoming you look i may tell you and being the life and soul and charming dirty bertie mention of her appearance had inevitably brought her to a halt at a mirror in the corridor and now she gave me a reproachful blue eye in the reflection i trust i know what is due to royal rank says she primly and i may tell you that mere polite affability is not charming in the odious way you mean it she patted her gilded tresses complacently and touched a gloved finger to her plump pink cheek sighing anyway i doubt my charming days are gone lang syne you dont think anything of the sort and neither does billy cumming by all accounts oh ive heard all about that flirting over the baccarat cards the two of you now was there or was there not an instant flicker in those glorious eyes before she widened them at me in mock indignation flirrrting i upon my word she tossed her head the very idea at my time of life flirting quo he goodness me i had a touch of your time of life tother night remember we were alone in the corridor and i stepped close behind her and gave em a loving squeeze she exclaimed oh and hit me with her fan that was not flirting says she i was a helpless victim a poor defenceless old buddy and you should think shame of yourself she gave her hair a last touch and turned to peck me on the cheek and who says i tried to fetch billy cumming i should like to know no stop it you bad old man and tell me owen williams an officer an a gent so there very jolly over the cards together you were he tells me hes an auld haver says she elegantly just because a gentleman helps a lady to make her bets well you know i cannae count except at backgammon apparently backgammon or no im a duffer at cards as well you know and i dare say i said something exceptionally foolish and made him laugh as for flirting harry flashman who are you to talk do i not remember mrs leo lade and kitty stevens names from fifty years ago god help me still green in her eccentric memory and i didnt even know who kitty stevens was uhhuh thats your eye on a plate my lad says she slipping her arm through mine as we passed on what else did that blether williams tell you now that was odd lightly asked too lightly oh just that says i i guess he was trying to take a rise out of me knowing i cant stand cumming but not knowing that you cant stand him either i gave her hand a squeeze reassuring like why you crossed him off our list years ago did i i dont recollect and that was odder still for if theres an elephantine memory in london wi it resides in the otherwise wayward mind of elspeth lady flashman suddenly i knew that something was up for all her banter shed been on the qv from the moment cummings name was mentioned the quick wary glint in the mirror her artless inquiry about what williams had said and the indifferent did i i dont recollect told me she was keeping something from me was it possible that cumming had been trying his lecherous hand again at her age damned unlikely yet then again queen ranavalona had been a grandmother and that hadnt stopped me by god if he had id see to it that he came out of his present pickle with his name and fame in the gutter but that could wait id another fish to fry at the moment and as we neared the drawingroom door i paused assuming a frown hold on though yes williams did say another thing yes at baccarat last night did you notice anything well out o the way about cummings play she looked bewildered but then on any subject that hasnt to do with money or erotic activity she usually is why harry whatever do you mean was there anything remarkable about his placing of the stakes my stakes dyou mean i told you he was helping me no his stakes how did he put em on the table she looked at me as though i were simpleminded why with his hand of course he just put them down yes dearest says i keeping a firm grip on myself but thats not quite what i mean those wee coloured counters with the feathers on them he just put them in front of him and mine too because you see he was advising me how to bet since i did not understand the rules or how much it would be safe to wager and i must say says she opening the floodgates it is quite the silliest game for theres no cleverness in it and indeed i told him so for how can we tell what to wager i said when we have no notion of what the princes cards may amount to why he may have a count of nine and then where shall we be he laughed and said we must take the risk for it was a gamble i know that i said but it would be more fun if we knew one of the princes cards and he knew one of ours for then we could judge how much to put on he said we must be like montrose and repeated that verse we used to recite at school you know the one about fearing our fate too much who will not put it to the touch to win or lose it all and i said that is all very well sir william but remember what happened to him and he laughed more than ever i love her dearly far beyond any creature ive ever known and i can prove it for never once in almost seventy years of married life have i taken her by the throat mind you its been a near thing once or twice and the court cards would you believe it count for nothing why then i asked him do they have them in the pack at all and he said he supposed it was to make weight whatever that may mean and i said it was a great annoyance to have to pay out to the bank when we had been dealt two kings and got another when we asked for a third card and the princes cards were the sorriest rags but they made eight and that was the better hand but it seems hard that three kings should be worth nothing at all i took her gently by the arm and steered her away from the drawingroom door to an alcove at the end of the corridor for i could see there was only one way and that was to come out with the thing plump and plain did you see cumming at any time add counters to his stake after the prince had declared the result of the hand she took her lower lip gently in her teeth a tiny gesture of puzzlement which has been turning my heart over since you mean after the prince had said who had won precisely she frowned but then it would be too late to add w his stake surely thats the whole point did he at any time after the result had been called place any counters beyond the line which line the line i replied through gritted teeth round the edge of the cloth on the table it was like talking to a backward bushman the line beyond which the stakes are placed oh is that what the line was for i thought it was just for the look of the thing she reflected for a moment and shook her head no i cannot think that i saw him putting out more counters after as realisation dawned the forgetmenot eyes opened wide and her lips parted why harry that would have been cheating begad youre right so it would but you never saw him do any such thing with his hands or a pencil gracious no why i should have checked him at once and told him it would not do that he had made a mistake and must and at that she stopped short staring at me and slowly her alarm changed into the oddest oldfashioned look and then she smiled that old teasing cherrylipped elspeth pout that used to have me thrusting the door to and wrenching at my breeches to my astonishment i saw that her eyes were suddenly moist as she shook her head and came close to me putting a gloved hand up to my whiskers oh harry my jo ye sweet old thing murmurs she is that why youre tasking me with all these daft questions because that clavering auld clype owen williams has told you that billy cumming put his hand on mine once or twice at the baccarat she laughed softly lovingsad and stroked my withered cheek to be sure he did but only to guide me in placing my wagers silly and youre still jealous for your old wife wild lad that you are well im glad so there come here and she kissed me in a way which any decent matron should have forgotten long ago as though ive ever wanted to fetch any man but you says she fondly straightening my collar supposing i still could now if youll give me your arm to the drawingroom i dare say mrs wilson will be serving tea the deuce of it is when elspeth turns a conversation topsyturvy all wideeyed innocence you can never be sure whether its witlessness or guile shes always been ivory from her delightful neck upwards but that dont mean she cant wheedle a duck from a pond when so minded knowing her vanity i didnt doubt that she believed my inquiries had been prompted by pure jealousy to her immense gratification lovingly expressed still there was something to do with cumming that she wasnt telling well perhaps it was something id be better for not knowing one thing seemed clear for what it was worth whoever had seen him cheating she had not i left her prattling over the cups to lady coventry and on the spur of the moment decided not to visit the prince to see how his fine frenzy was coming along but to call on the principal in the case as promising more information and entertainment faced with ruin and dishonour cumming should be an interesting spectacle by now and a little manly condolence from old comrade flashy might well lead him to do something amusing the more mischief the better sport as the great man said he was taking it well ill say that standing before his mantel every inch the guardee rock steady and looking down his aristocratic nose i guessed he was a volcano ready to erupt though and when hed dismissed his valet i took him flat aback by holding out my hand avoiding his grip and seeking his pulse i do love to startle em what the deuce cries he pulling free a touch fast not much youll do in fact i hadnt found his pulse seen the prince have you so youve heard yes i have seen his highness he eyed me with profound dislike i suppose you too believe this filthy slander why should you think that says i taking a chair those other idiots do williams and coventry and the prince and when did you ever believe good of anyone not often perhaps but then they dont often deserve it in your case as it happens im probably the only man in this house who is not convinced that you played foul his sneer vanished in astonishment and he took a pace forward only to stop in sudden doubt youre not why leery of me you see many people are because it makes no sense i told him my reasons which you know and with every word his expression lightened until he was looking almost hopeful in a frantic way have you said this to the prince what did he say in heavens name i shook my head didnt persuade him or coventry and williams cant blame em altogether you know the evidence is pretty strong on the face of it five witnesses witnesses cries he damned imbeciles two idiot women a parcel of boys who know nothing whats their word worth almost in an instant the cool guardee was gone and he was standing before me fists clenched and eyes wild voice shaking with fury strange how a man can show a calm front and a stiff lip when all the worlds agin him but drop a sympathetic word and all the rage and indignation will come bubbling out because he thinks hes found a friend to confide in how can they believe it he stormed my god flashman how can they men whove known me twenty years and more trusted friends as though i would stoop to this this damned infamy and for what there were tears in his eyes and if hed stamped and torn his hair id not have been surprised for a few paltry pounds by heaven ill throw it back in their faces not if youve any sense you wont says i and he stared might be taken for an admission of guilt you won it fair and square did you then you keep it sound advice by the way thats the whole point though i added sitting forward and giving him my eye now cumming dont start tearing the curtains but tell me straight out did you cheat he was breathing hard but at that he stiffened and answered straight i did not on my word of honour he was telling the truth no question not because he said so but because of what id seen and heard from the moment id entered the room i dont claim to be an infallible judge of my fellow man i can be deceived and put no faith in oaths and promises however solemn but ive been about and if i knew anything at all gordoncummings demeanour in and out of anger rang true very good now these witnesses are they lying that set him away again how the blazes should i know the whole thing is abominable whats it to me whether theyre lying or not pack of idiots and prying women who cares what they say let me tell you flashman their foul charges dont matter a straw to me theyre worthless but that men like williams and and the prince whom i counted a friend that they should turn against me that they can bring themselves to believe this vile thing my god and that you of all people should be alone in having having faith in me i dare say he didnt mean it to sound like an insult but it did and i found myself liking him even less than usual he had gulped himself silent with outrage so i resumed you havent answered are they lying i neither know nor care he paced about and stopped glaring at the wall oh i suppose not the damned fools must think they saw something wrong but who knows with ignorant young asses like those what do they know of card play even or how such games are conducted tyros and schoolboys that dummy levett that he should think for a moment stop vapouring and keep your head i told him dammit man im trying to help you i wasnt but there if you want to come out of this youd best stop ranting and think now then they werent lying you believe so they were mistaken how thats the thing what was there in your play the way you staked that made em think you were diddling them i offered him a cheroot and struck a match now settle down and think that over he puffed at the weed in silence made to speak thought better of it and then shrugged helplessly how can i tell what they think they saw minds like theirs stupid women and scatterbrains like young wilson that wont answer see here from what ive learned they claim that on two or three occasions you had a ј stake in front of you and then hey presto it was ј after the hand had been declared now how could that be think man unless they were seeing things you must have added another two red chips to the one already there did you could you no dont start bellowing think if you werent cheating how came those extra chips to be there he stood nursing his brow and turned to me a face that was haggard with frustration i dont know flashman it cant have been so i swear i never added to my stake after the and suddenly he stopped and his eyes and mouth opened wide and he gave a choking gasp oh my god of course the coup de trois thats it flashman the coup de trois and he let out a great wailing noise which i took to be relief the coup de trois what the hells the coup de trois my system his eyes were blazing why didnt i think of it at once i was tripling up dont you see look here he lugged a handful of coins from his pocket spilling em all over the shop and planked one on the table there thats my ј stake i win and am paid a fiver from the bank he clapped down a second coin i let em lie and add another fiver down went a third coin and thats my stake for the next hand ј its how i always play stake a fiver win another add a third the coup de trois he was laughing in sheer triumph why its as old as the hills every punter knows it but not those green monkeys wilson and levett they see a fiver staked look away look back again after the coups been declared and the bank has paid out and see three fivers my original stake my winning and the third which ive added for the next coup perfectly properly he let out a huge gasp of relief and subsided into a chair and because theyre ignorant novices brought up on old maid and halma they think its foul play the only thing is says i that theyre sure you added the extra chips after the coup was declared but before the bank paid out and that you accepted payment of ј then theyre wrong thats all its a question of of timing cant you see they say that on one coup you jockeyed your stake and demanded an extra tenner from the bank stuff and nonsense and that once you flicked a chip over the line with a pencil that is a lie he was on his feet again white with anger dammit man cant you see sense dont you see what has happened some young fool sees my coup de trois thinks its a fraud tells the other young fools and because theyre as dense as he is aye and as eager to believe the worst they see all manner of things that aint there flicking chips with pencils bah in his excitement he took me by the arm dont you see flashman in fact i did and was feeling much let down for what he said made some sort of sense perhaps halfbaked lads like levett and wilson knowing nothing of such systems as the coup de trois employed by seasoned gamesters like cumming might well misinterpret his actions it was as he said a question of timing and in an illregulated drawingroom game with no croupier on the first night and the bank paying out any old how it was possible that they might have thought cumming was still to be paid when in fact hed already got his winnings and was letting em lie with an additional fiver for the next coup now if the thing were explained to them theyd surely be bound to give him the benefit of the doubt for bertie would leap at the explanation as a lifeline and for decencys sake theyd have to admit that they might have been mistaken if there had been a cat handy id have kicked it what had promised to be a splendid scandal looked like fizzling out like the dampest of squibs and this damned baronet would walk away without a blot on his escutcheon or so it seemed to me just then from the first you see id feared that there might be a simple explanation and here was a plausible one rot it it was all most damnably deflating and worse because id guided him to his bloody loophole of escape dont you see cries he again impatiently heavens its as plain as daylight now you must see that its obvious to anyone above a halfwit even a muttonhead like williams cant fail to see it am i right i put on my judicial face and said that he probably was well thank god for that cries he sarcastically and if anything had been needed to convince me he was telling the truth it was his sneering tone not a hint of doubt that his explanation mightnt wash no palpitating hope of its acceptance only cold fury that he the soul of honour had been disgracefully traduced and that his peers had believed it two minutes since hed been in an agony of despair but now sir william gordoncumming bart was back in the saddle bursting with injured selfrighteousness and the arrogant certainty of his kind and youll note not a whisper of gratitude to your correspondent the prince must be told at once hes a man of sense unlike those clowns coventry and williams i dont doubt they persuaded him against his will but when i put it to him hell see the right of it he was at his dressingtable flourishing his silverbacked brushes improving his parting with a dab or two at the ends of his pathetic guardee moustache and shooting his cuffs while i marvelled at the human capacity for selfdelusion he was full of exultant confidence now and it never crossed his shallow mind that others might be less ready to take his view of the matter ive said his explanation was plausible but it wasnt near as castiron as he thought much would depend on how it was presented and how ready they were to believe it it may be a lesson to them against jumping to conclusions and on such flimsy evidence the babbling of those whippersnappers and my character my good name my record of honourable service were to count for nothing against their damned gossip the confounded little spies he was striding for the door in full raging fettle when he suddenly wheeled about no by heavens ill not do it he snapped his fingers pointing at me why should i why shouldnt you do what was all i could say for his anger had dropped from him like a shed cloak and he was smiling grimly as he came slowly back to me why should i humble myself with explanations im the injured party am i not im the one who has suffered this this intolerable affront i have been insulted in the grossest fashion on the word of a pack of mannerless brats and two elderly fools who i have no doubt persuaded his royal highness against his better judgment and honourable instincts drunk with vindictive justification he might be he wasnt ass enough to impugn saintly bertie he gave a barking laugh lord flashman in our fathers day id have been justified in blowing their imbecile heads off on calais sands am i to crawl to them and say please sir i can prove your informants ha informers i should say have been utterly in the wrong and will you kindly tell em so and condescend to forgive me for having conducted myself like a man of honour is that what im supposed to do talk about women scorned their fury aint in it with a scotch baronets wounded selfesteem had i ever i wondered encountered such an immortally conceited ass with a truer touch for selfdestruction george custer came to mind aye put him and gordoncumming on the edge of a precipice and id not care to bet which would tumble first into the void bellowing his grievance what says i keeping my countenance with proper gravity do you propose to do not a damned thing you stabbing me on the chest since youve thrust your spoon into the dixie can do it for me you can be my messenger flashman and have the satisfaction of showing them what asses theyve made of themselves youve got the gift o the gab dont we know it says he with a curl of his voice if not of his lip you can explain about the coup de trois and the rest of it because im damned if i will its not for me to make a plea to them let em come to me ill accept their apology coventry and williams i mean and those three guttersnipes not the ladies of course and certainly not his royal highness who has been most disgracefully imposed on im sure of that yes says he head up and shoulders square with exultation in his eye thats the way to do it so off you go old fellow and dont spare em seeing me stand thoughtful he frowned impatiently well will you would i not ive told you my score against gordoncumming a natural detestation of his supercilious vanity his unconcealed dislike of me above all the suspicion that hed ploughed with my heifer and now if you please the arrogant bastard was appointing me his messageboy throw into the scale his overweening certainty that hed cleared himself and must be grovelled to in consequence and youll understand that i would not have missed the chance to sink the swine not for my souls salvation for it was in my hands no error his coup de trois excuse had put the whole affair on a knifeedge if it were shrewdly urged the three wise men and the witnesses might be disposed for the sake of avoiding a horrid scandal to swallow it well by the time id done with it theyd spew it all over the floor so i consented to act as his gobetween and left him grinding his teeth at the prospect of accusers confounded and honour restored no time we agreed must be lost so i made for the princes apartments and whom should i meet on the way but the three leading witnesses plainly just come from a royal audience master wilson bright with excitement lycett green tightlipped and young levett plainly wishing himself in the outer hebrides no change on that front thinks i and the air of gloom in hrhs sittingroom most of it cigar smoke confirmed my conclusion that fellow is impossible bertie was croaking and i gathered he meant lycett green not a shadow of doubt according to him oh its intolerable what can we do but believe them as your highness says coventry sounded like a vicar at the graveside that being so we are bound to take he frowned as he dredged his vocabulary ah measures in regard to sir william lycett green wont keep quiet if we dont says williams selfrighteous ass snaps bertie no thats not fair hes a decent man no doubt i only wish he werent so infernally adamant he scowled at me well i said id seen gordoncumming and much good that will have done ive seen him myself and it was heartbreaking i tell you the man almost had tears in his eyes one of my closest friends id ha trusted him with my life but how can i credit his denial in the face of of he flourished a paw in the direction of the door theyre so sure even levett poor devil heavens we could hardly drag it out of him he sat down groaning drew on his cigar as though it were poisoned and regarded me dyspeptically what did cumming have to say to you denied it absolutely i suppose he gave your highness his explanation that brought him bolt upright what explanation i hesitated with an artistic frown and shook my head i dont know quite what to make of it myself i confess that i at that i stopped waiting for him to demand what the devil i was talking about which he did with considerable vigour well sir i began halfapologetic and then i gave him the coup de trois story plain and matteroffact but with dark doubt hovering over every word and was gratified to see coventrys face growing long as a coffin williams frowning in disbelief and the light of hope fading from berties bloodshot ogles dyou believe it cries he and i maintained the manly silence that damned gordoncumming as no words could but is it possible he insisted possible sir i made a lip and shrugged aye i dare say its possible but even if it were true broke in williams and you plainly dont think it is it still does not explain all the the irregularities the pencil that sort of thing he met berties despairing eye i regret to say it sir but it sounds to me like the feeble excuse of a desperate man and im sure he added that that is how green and the others will regard it coventry heaved a draughty sigh indeed it only confirms my belief that sir william ah that the witnesses the charges that hes a cheat and a liar cries bertie he growled down his temper gnashed on his cigar and faced us very well then god knows weve done our best to sift the thing and thats our conclusion hes played foul and been caught out now says he and for the first time that night he sounded royal how is it to be hushed up they stood mum so i put in my oar again fraid it cant be sir unless you and williams are prepared to risk a court martial if id said are prepared to steal the crown jewels and make a run for paraguay i couldnt have provoked a finer display of consternation but before bertie could explode i explained you and he both hold the queens commission sir im retired of course but as serving officers aware of dishonourable conduct by a brother officer youre obliged to bring it to the attention of your superiors since your highness is a field marshal im not sure who your superiors are exactly her majesty of course or i dare say the colonel of cummings regiment would do i was drowned out by a prolonged fit of princely coughing the result of outraged smoke going down the wrong way which gave him time to digest my warning and emerge mopping and wheezing to announce hoarsely that he didnt give a tinkers dam for courts martial or words to that effect and not a whisper was to be breathed to military superiors or anyone else was that clear it must not come out he croaks at all costs it must be confined to to ourselves the scandal he couldnt bring himself even to contemplate it a way must be found he sat down again thumping his knees it must which left us back at the startinggate three of us racking our brains and flashy looking perplexed but inwardly serene for all i was waiting for was a lead at last coventry gave it if some accommodation could be found says he which would signify ah disapprobation of sir williams conduct while satisfying the ah resentment of his accusers and of course ensuring that no word of this deplorable affair ever oh talk sense coventry barks bertie they want his head on a charger green made that plain enough and how youre to contrive that in secrecy i cannot imagine how dyou punish him without exposing him wonders williams and i saw it was time for the flashman compromise which had been taking shape in my mind over the past minute or two i made a judicial noise to attract their attention i wonder if lord coventry hasnt pointed the way sir says i suppose yes how would it do if cumming were to sign a paper you know an undertaking sort of thing pledging himself never to touch a card again eh they stood mute as ducks in thunder stiff penalty for a man in his position what id be surprised if that didnt satisfy green and his pals and in return i tapped the table impressively they would pledge themselves to silence as would we absolutely that would settle things without a breath of scandal there was a hole in it a mile wide but i knew bertie wouldnt spot it my last five words were all that mattered to him he was pointing like a setter coventry was in his customary fog but williams burst out cumming would never do such a thing why it would be tantamount to a confession of guilt not a bit of it owen says i he aint admitting a thing and if he were twould only be to us and his accusers who think hes guilty anyway no one else would ever know i turned to bertie his cigar now in tatters im sure hell agree sir what other choice has he public disgrace and worse than that i went on fixing coventry and williams with my sternest look would be the shameful burden of knowing that greater names than his had been tarnished by the publication of his dishonour that did the trick bertie started as though id put a bayonet into his leg and from williams expression i knew that if id said tell cumming that if he dont do as hes told and preserve our precious prince from scandal god help him i could not have been plainer coventry naturally was appalled but such a document supposing sir william should consent to sign it in return for a pledge of silence would it not bear a an odour of of conspiracy certainly not says i it would be a simple promise never to play cards again signed by him duly witnessed by his royal highness and by the accusers nothing smoky about it they would give their word of honour to his highness never to speak or write of the matter hereafter and that would be that tight as a drum bertie hadnt said a word for several minutes and when he did it was clear what was preoccupying him could we be sure those people would keep silence once theyd given their word to the prince of wales says i and that seemed to satisfy him for he sat in silence a moment and then asked the other two what they thought of the scheme they puffed doubtfully of course williams because he feared that cumming would refuse to sign and coventry out of general anxiety would lycett green and co agree he wondered and bertie let out a muffled snarl theyll agree says he grimly which settled that and they passed on to the wording of the document which was simple enough and then to considering how it might best be put to the guilty party bertie wondered if i should take part with coventry and williams but modesty forbade im no diplomat sir says i too blunt by half his lordship and owen will do it ten times better without me besides i added blunt honest old flashy the fact is he dont like me dunno why but there it is no point in putting his back up so the less im mentioned the better dyou know williams absolutely shook his head in sympathy and bertie went so far as to give my arm a clap before i withdrew he was even more demonstrative an hour later when i was summoned to his presence just as i was on the point of turning in and found him sitting on the edge of his bed in his dressinggown glass in hand cigar at the high port plainly dogweary but content at having laboured well in the vineyard well hes signed cries he jovially he picked up a paper and held it out just a few lines with a forest of names at the foot led by w gordoncumming and the princes scrawl not without the deuce of a struggle owen williams tells me swore it was tantamount to a confession but gave in when they told him it was that or ruin help yourself flashman indicating decanter and humidor and sit ye down gad i dont care if i never have such an evening again after dinner too shant sleep a wink he swigged comfortably dyou know i did not half believe hed put his signature to it but you knew downy old bird that you are he was positively twinkling well sir he really didnt have much choice did he all things considered hes come off dam lightly thats what lycett green thinks tho hed the grace not to say so oh aye theyve all put their names to it as you see he peered at the paper shaking his head i must say its a damning thing for an innocent man to sign and yet he screwed up his little eyes at me dyou think theres the least possibility hes telling the truth look at it this way sir would you have signed it knowing yourself innocent or would you have damned em for liars and offered to put em through every court in the land or taken a horsewhip to em and think what mama would have made of that i might have added he looked solemn wagging his head and then demanded almost peevishly what the devil possessed him to do it to cheat i mean was he off his head dyou think you know temporarily deranged one hears of such things dunno sir and i doubt if he does either he shook his head and rumbled a few philosophies while we sipped and smoked he was enjoying his relief and when we parted he was at his most affable pumping my fin and calling me harry again im obliged to you not for the first time this he tapped cummings paper was a brainwave and the sooner its safely bestowed the better not the sort of item wed care to see in the morning press what well goodnight to you old fellow thankee again aye and thank the lord well hear no more of it and if you believe that sweet prince you will indeed believe anything thinks i for if there was one stone cold certainty it was that we would hear more abundantly more and running over of the great baccarat scandal of tranby croft bertie blind to everything but the need to keep it from the queens ears and asses like coventry and williams might suppose that the vows of silence sworn by all and sundry would prove binding honour and all that you know i knew better at least a dozen folk two of em women were in the secret and the notion that theyd all hold their tongues was plain foolish it was bound to get out as id determined it should from the moment id stood in gordoncummings presence weighed him up and realised what a prime subject he was for shoving down the drain all it needed after that as you know was an inspiration and careful management now nature could take its course which it did and if it took longer to leak out than id expected the resultant row was worth the delay its still not established who blew the gaff but my firm belief is that it was bertie himself unlikely as that may seem but the fact is that the yankee papers named as their source none other than elspeths chum daisy brooke aforementioned and since she was warming the princely mattress in those days its odds on that he whispered the scandal to her more fool he daisy swore twasnt so and threatened to sue but never did whoever blabbed it was all over the clubs and messes before christmas that cumming had cheated chaps were cutting him dead and he was demanding retractions and apologies and not getting them so there he was reputation blasted and nothing for it youd have thought but to order a pint of port and a pistol for breakfast or join the foreign legion he did neither to the shocked murmurs and secret glee of society the delight of the public and ive no doubt the tenor of the prince of wales he brought an action for slander against his five accusers from tranby the trial came off in june of and its one of the regrets of my life that i was not present if only to see stout bertie in the witnessbox squirming under the inquisition of saucy jurors who didnt know their place unlike the judge and counsel who grovelled to him something servile and did everything but tote him in and out of court in a palankeen the proceedings lasted a week and by all accounts it was one of the finest legal circuses ever seen with the judge as ringmaster and nothing lacking but an orchestra and chorus girls knowing our revered lord chief justice of the day the ancient coleridge i wasnt surprised for he was a jolly old buck with a tremendous fund of good stories once made a speech lasting twentythree days they tell me and was responsible for the threemile limit in case youre interested you may be sure i was sorely tempted once or twice to view the spectacle but decided reluctantly to keep clear when youve had a hand in engineering a disaster its best to stand well out from under to avoid falling debris i knew bertie and co wouldnt advertise my part in the affair which was deplorable enough without the notorious flashy being dragged in and sure enough they didnt one or two who knew id been at tranby quizzed me but i took a stern and silent line you know shockin biznai old comrade beyond belief state o the army damnable altogether that sort of thing aside from the verdict which ill tell you presently in case you dont know the great sensation was the storm that burst over the head of our unfortunate heir apparent god forbid i should ever feel sorry for the fat bounder but even i was astonished at the way the press and pulpits laid into him youd have thought hed been kidnapping nuns and selling em to the port said brothels and all because hed been playing baccarat woe to the monarchy wailed one rag another spoke of a chorus of condemnation and the rest expressed shock and disgust denounced his taste for the lowest type of gambling and recoiled from the spectacle of the future king of england officiating at a gamblers orgy even the times went wild with terms like regret concern and distress a scotch journal decided that the prince is evidently not what he ought to be but the leader i liked best was the one that said the british empire was humiliated and the rest of civilisation was pointing the finger at us as to the trial itself you can go to the official record if youve a mind to but i flatter myself you wont learn much that i havent told you the lawyers went back and forth over every blessed moment of those three nights every shift of those damned counters every syllable of who said what to whom and what expressions they wore and what they thought and why over and over and i dare say at the end of it the jury were as fogged as the public the biggest guns of the day fought the case clarke the solicitorgeneral no less who appeared for cumming was reckoned the shrewdest mouthpiece of the day while the defendants were represented by two of the best hatchetmen in the business charles russell and young asquith you know the latter as the buffoon who infests number downing street at the moment and my recollection of him is as a shining morning face to which i once presented a prize at the city of london school but for all that he was accounted a sharp hand in court while russell was a human hawk and looked it reading the press reports i concluded that the evidence given didnt differ much from what i myself remembered of events and in nothing essential owen williams had drawn up a prйcis of what had happened at tranby in which various holes were picked there seemed to be uncertainty over the order of the interviews on the wednesday evening and some vagueness as to who had suggested presenting the damning document to cumming which wasnt surprising since it had been yours truly and they were keeping me out of it elspeth likewise id been worried that she might be called as a witness since on the first night shed sat as an onlooker and on the second had for a time taken lady coventrys place next to cumming but either theyd forgotten about her or more likely theyd remembered and had realised that the last thing the trial needed was her drivelling brightly in the witnessbox like several others of the party she wasnt even mentioned none of which mattered to the case cumming in evidence repeated his flat denial of the charges claiming that hed lost his head and signed the paper only because hed been persuaded that there was no other way to avoid a public scandal he got in a sly thrust at bertie by suggesting that hrh had been chiefly concerned to cover his own ample rear which as i knew was gospel true the five accusers stuck by their stories pretty well although clarke who was obviously a complete hand at confusing the issue with trivial questions claimed to find all kinds of discrepancies in their testimony he also hinted ever so delicately that a couple of them might have been tight had great fun about lycett greens being a master of foxhounds and took a nice injured line of surprise that in view of cummings pledged word stainless character and so forth they werent prepared to admit theyd been mistaken his final speech was four times as long as that of russell who simply went straight at cummings throat why hadnt he demanded to be brought face to face with his accusers as any honest man would have done he also reminded the jury that the five accusers werent alone in thinking cumming guilty the prince williams and coventry thought so too in all that i read i could put my finger on only one flat lie the defendants denial that there had been any arrangement to keep watch on cummings play the second night well i ask you youre told a man has been cheating and dont keep an eye on him next time pull the other one walker you watch him like a lynx according to owen williams theyd told him theyd agreed to watch but now in the witnessbox they were claiming theyd done no such thing their reason was plain enough they didnt want to be thought of as spying on a fellow guest and there was some fine wriggling under crossexamination one of em i think it was lycett green absolutely said knowing the man had cheated i looked but not with a view to watching which is as fine a piece of humbug as i could ha thought up myself not that it made a haporth of difference theyd seen what theyd seen and held by it by the morning of the seventh day with the cases of both sides completed the thing was on a knifeedge half the town was positive gordoncumming was the biggest cheat since jacob while tother half held that clarke had shown up the five accusers for unreliable idiots whose evidence wasnt worth stale beans perambulating from the park to the temple during the day i heard cumming damned and defended in the clubs but the farther east i walked the more i encountered a truly british phenomenon among the commonalty the anticummings wanted to see him done down for precisely the same reason that the procummings hoped hed win because he was a toff the lordhaters were full of righteous indignation about the pampered rich rioting and gaming while honest folk went hungry so to hell with cumming and the prince of wales and the lot of em on the other side were the forelocktuggers who thought it a bleedin disgrice that a proper gent wot ad fought for queen an country should be defamed by the likes o them nobodies no wonder the foreigners cant understand us no doubt because i hoped to see him sunk to perdition i could imagine several excellent reasons why the jury should find in his favour and award him thumping damages foremost in my mind still you see was the conviction that he couldnt have cheated spite and prejudice aside it wasnt in the mans nature but it was up to the jury now and no doubt all hung on the direction they would receive from the venerable coleridge the early editions were carrying his summingup at length and i studied it eagerly in the corner of a fleet street pub with a pie and pint to keep me company the days proceedings had begun with a protest from that ass owen williams demanding to make a statement against the solicitorgeneral clarke who says williams had accused him of an abominable crime of sacrificing an innocent man coleridge couldnt remember what exact words had been used but told williams that counsel could say what they dam well liked in court and would williams kindly keep quiet and give him coleridge some judgingroom or words to that effect after which williams presumably retired gnashing and coleridge addressed the twelve good men and true it must have been a sight to see for he apparently played the wise simple old codger peering over his glasses while he told the jury what brilliant chaps clarke and russell and asquith were he didnt say they were too clever by half exactly but he thought it no bad thing that the humble jogtrot of his summingup should intervene between their fireworks and the verdict having put the wigged brigade in their place he told the jury something that was news to me that cheating at cards was an offence for which you could be nailed in court he then went on to remind them that clarke had said cumming wasnt interested in soaking his accusers they would bear that in mind if the question of damages arose and another thing whether they disapproved of gambling or not was beside the point which was simply this did cumming cheat or not he rambled on fairly reasonably it seemed to me about the actual play and the witnesses testimony and caused some mirth by describing cummings system of betting as sounding like coup dйtat well he knew it couldnt be coup dйtat but it was some french expression or other oh coup de trois was it ah well on he went honest old coleridge as gentle and benign as could be drawing the jurys attention to various points reminding them that it didnt matter a hoot what he thought it was up to them and all he could do was raise questions for them which they must answer only once did he rouse himself to have a brief bicker with clarke for seeming to turn up his nose at the social standing of some of the accusers it wasnt lycett greens fault that his father was an engineer was it and if young jack wilson was a shiftless layabout what was wrong with that and if the wilsons toadate the prince why who did not clarke said he hadnt called lycett greens father an engineer and coleridge said well if he hadnt his junior had no he hadnt either says clarke but coleridge ignored him and said he didnt see why a chap should be laughed at because his father was an engineer and if a chap liked hobnobbing with the prince where was the harm eh it wouldnt prejudice him against gordoncumming anyway and that was the point furthermore this stuff about gordoncumming losing his head didnt impress the bench cumming had had lots of time to think before he signed the paper and knew what he was doing he hadnt asked to be confronted by his accusers either pretty rum that seemed to coleridge and he hadnt returned his winnings put em in the bank quids worth well well having read this far i felt the odds were shifting in the direction of the defendants but you still couldnt tell then the silly old buffer got on to a new tack the prince of wales well coleridge couldnt see the throne toppling simply because the prince had played baccarat the prince had a busy public life opening things and making speeches and listening to speeches and a hell of a bore it must be in coleridges view so if he wanted to enjoy himself of an evening why not some people might say why not read the bible instead of playing baccarat but it was a free country wasnt it sound stuff in its way interspersed with quotations from shakespeare and other authors with whom he didnt doubt the jury were familiar and a few latin tags to remind them that this was serious work and then at the end of his summingup when they must have been sitting in a restful fog he left off playing the genial philosophising old buffer and delivered the thrust that settled the case once and for all would an innocent man he wondered sign a document stating he had cheated simply to prevent its being known that the prince of wales had played baccarat would a man allow himself to be called a cardsharp rather than have it known that the prince had done something of which many people might disapprove no coleridge couldnt swallow that the jury retired and that blast it was as far as the report went so i set off for home and it was in the gentle evenfall that i came on a newsboy hollering verdict on the corner of bruton street and there it was in the stop press the jury had taken only thirteen minutes to find for the defendants so that was cumming ruined the twelve good men had declared him a cheat and a liar i confess it took me aback splendid news though it was how the devil had a jury of englishmen brought up to give a man the benefit of the doubt come to that conclusion still theyd been in court and i had not and theyd reached their decision double quick hadnt they just in hardly more time than it would take to call for votes round the table no doubts apparently and certainly no arguments strangely where opinion had been evenly divided before it swung violently to cumming after the verdict one learned journal opined that you wouldnt have hung a dog on the evidence that hed cheated and i heard it said on every side that the thing should never have come to trial at all it should have been settled at tranby and would have been but for illadvised zeal on the part of the princes friends to save him from scandal the irony was that in spite of all the reverential treatment and mayitpleaseyourroyalhighnessing hed received in court the trial did bertie more damage than any other incident in his wellspotted career the press as ive said damned him from belgrade to breakfast and when he issued a statement protesting that he had a horror of gambling and did his utmost to discourage it he was seen for the windy little hypocrite he was and hooted in the streets cumming was finished socially and professionally of course and had the sense to resign marry his american girl and retire to scotland if i knew him at all any shame he felt would be nothing to his rage against the society that had branded him and the prince whod betrayed him and i dare say hes brooding in his highland fastness this minute armoured in righteous wrath despising the world that cast him out small wonder for i can tell you now at the end of my little tale gordoncumming was railroaded he didnt cheat at baccarat i learned this within twentyfour hours of the verdict but there was nothing to be done even if id wanted to no one would have credited the truth for a moment i didnt myself at first for it beggared belief but there can be no doubt about it for it fits exactly with the evidence of both sides and the source is unimpeachable ive lived with her seventy years after all and know that while she may suppress a little veri and suggest a touch of falsi on occasion elspeth aint a liar we were at breakfast which for me in my indulgent age was russian style and for her the fodder of her native heath porridge ham eggs black pudding some piscine abomination called arbroath smokies oatcakes rolls and marmalade while we read the morning journals usually she reads and prattles together but that morning she was silent absorbing the cumming debacle when shed laid her eyeglasses aside she sat for a while stirring her tea in a thoughtful contented manner rum business that says i dye know old girl its beyond me granted hes a poisonous tick i still cant believe he cheated neither he did says she whats that oh i see you dont think it likely either well i dont suppose well ever know for certain but oh but i do know says she laying down her spoon he did not cheat at all well i think not on the first night and i know he did not on the second she sipped her tea while i choked on my brandy what dyou mean you know you dont know a thing about it why when i asked you that night at tranby remember whether hed been jockeying his stakes you didnt know what i meant even i knew perfectly well what you meant but it would not have been prudent to say anything just then it would not have suited says she calmly at all you mean youre saying you knew then he hadnt cheated in my agitation i overset my cup coffee all over the shop but how could you possibly what the blazes are you talking about there is no need to fly at me or take that crabbit tone says she rising swiftly quick put a plate under the cloth before it stains the table drat such a mess here let me tend to it and you ring for jane oh the best walnut damn jane and the walnut will you tell me what you mean she had the cloth back clucking and mopping the table with a napkin elspeth whats this rot about cumming not cheating how do you know dammit its a mercy your cup had gone cold oh how vexing itll have to be french polished she peered at the wood oh dear why did i not wait till you were settled guid kens i should know by now what youre like in the morning she discarded the napkin with dainty distaste and resumed her seat sir william gordoncumming did not cheat that is what i mean she sighed in a patient griselda sort of way the fact is you see i did lord knows what i looked like in that moment a cod on a slab likely she lifted a swift warning finger now please my love do not raise your voice or rage at me its done and there is no undoing it and the servants would hear if you are angry im sorry but if youll just bide quiet and hear me out you may not be too angry i hope she smiled at me as though i were an infant drooling in my crib and took a sip of tea now then it was i who added counters to his stakes just once or twice and not nearly as often as they said why i was quite shocked when i read in the papers last week the kind of evidence they were giving even mrs wilson dear me if there had been that much hankeypankey with the counters the whole world must have seen the prince and everyone the way folk deceive themselves but i suppose she shrugged that the general solicitor or whatever they call him was right and they saw what they wanted to see only they didnt if you know what i mean for it wasnt billy cumming cheating it was me or should it be i anyway i only did it now and then well three or four times perhaps im not sure but often enough to make them think he was cheating im glad to say she added complacently and you should not be angry i think because he deserved it and i was right its hard when your life has contained as many hellish surprises as mine to put em in order of disturbance gul shah appearing in that afghan dungeon cleonie whipping off her eyepatch meeting bismarck in his nightmare castle waking to find myself trussed over a gun muzzle at gwalior and any number of equally beastly shocks but ive never been more thoroughly winded than by those incredible words across the breakfast dishes on wednesday june th from elspeth of all people for a moment i wondered if she was making a ghastly joke or if that peabrain had given way at last but no i knew her artless prattle too well and that she meant every damned word and there was no point in bellowing disbelief i forced myself to be calm and sit mum while i downed my brandy and poured another stiff un before demanding no doubt in an incredulous croak youre telling me that he didnt cheat but you did and that you were laying a plant on him seeing her bewildered i translated making him look guilty dammit for the love of god woman why her eyes widened why to punish him to pay him out for his bad conduct his his black wickedness all of a sudden she was breathing fiery indignation boadicea in a lace dressinggown and so i did and now he is disgraced and a pariah and a hissing and serve him right he should be torn by wild horses so he should he is a base horrid man and i hope he suffers as he deserves she began to butter toast ferociously while i sat stricken wondering what the devil hed done horrid suspicions leaping to mind but before i could voice them she gave one of her wordless caledonian exclamations of impatience left off buttering tossed her head and regained her composure oh feegh harry i beg your pardon getting hetup in that unseemly way oh but when i think of him she took a deep breath and spooned marmalade on to her plate but its by with now thank goodness and hes paid for a villain deil mend him and im the happy woman thats done it for i never thought to have the chance and long i bided waiting the day as always when deeply moved she was getting scotcher by the minute but now she paused for a mouthful of toast and then at tranby when i heard that wilson loon whispering to his friend and understood what was what i soon saw in a blink how i might settle his hash for him once for all and i did that says she taking a grim nibble oh if only i could make marmalade like granny morrisons theres no right flavour to this bought stuff would you oblige me with the honey dearest i shoved it across in a daze the enormity the impossibility of what she said shed done her fury against cumming for heaven knew what unimaginable reason i still couldnt take it in but i knew that if youre to get sense out of elspeth you must let her babble to a finish in her own weird way giving what assistance you may i clutched at the nearest straw what did wilson whisper to whom when why on the first night when the prince said whos for baccarat everyone and they went to play in the smokingroom and count lutzow and i and miss naylor and lady brougham went to watch she frowned at the honey is it very fattening do you suppose oh well so the prince said shall you and i make a jolly bank together lady flashman but i said i did not know the rules and must watch till i got the hang of it and then i should be honoured to help him and he said quite jocose ah well one of these days then and count lutzow found me a chair next to that young fellow with the poker up his back like all the guardees whats his name berkeley levett you mean elspeth for mercys sake like enough he might have been berkeley square for all the sense i could get from him so then they played and after a wee while the wilson boy the one they call jack though his name is arthur i think or is it stanley anyway i heard him whisper to levett i say this is a bit hot which i thought odd when it wasnt at all i was quite chilly away from the fire and without my shawl but a moment later i saw he meant something quite otherwise for he whispered again that the man next to him was cheating and i saw he meant billy cumming harry dear would you ring for hot water the pot has gone quite cold im sure they dont make delft as they used to or perhaps the cosy is getting thin they stuff them with anything at all these days we always had a good thick woollen one at home that grizel knitted but they do tend to smell rather after a while husbands tend to lose their reason rather after a while too so lest you should suffer likewise ill relieve her account with a prйcis she had heard levett say wilson must be mistaken and wilson had told him to look for himself lady flashman scenting mischief breasthigh had also fixed her bonny blue gimlets on the suspect seen him drop red counters on his paper after coups had been called and heard levett mutter by jove it is too hot but unlike the two young men she had concluded that cumming was playing fair simple she may be but she has her countrys instinct for anything to do with money and sharp practice and her unerring eye had spotted what they had missed for i was positive harry that he did not drop his counters until after the prince had paid the wagers and what he was doing was laying his wager for the next coup well says she earnestly that was not cheating was it but they thought it was you see they did not understand that he was playing that french system of his the coup de thingamabob which was mentioned in court last week i did not understand it myself till i read about it in the papers and realised he was telling the truth when he said he did not cheat but at the time of course i did not know about the french coup thing and while i did not think he was cheating how could i be sure when they thought he was and i supposed they knew more about the game than i did in any event she concluded cheerfully it did not signify whether he had cheated or not so long as they thought he did do you see my love heaven forfend that i should ever fail to grasp something that was clear to her but as i gazed into those forgetmenot eyes fixed so eagerly on mine i had to confess myself somewhat buffaloed and begged her to continue which she did at length and gradually light began to dawn later that night after the game count lutzow had come to her like rumour painted full of tongues with news that a scandalous crisis was at hand sir william gordoncumming had been seen cheating and watch was to be kept on him the following night how lutzow had heard this god alone knows for according to what was said in court young wilson had confided his suspicions to no one on the monday night except levett and later his mother but there you are lutzow had got wind of it somehow sly bastards these squareheads of course he swore dear lady flashman to silence i could hold in no longer but dammit all girl why didnt you say something then you believed he hadnt cheated and that wilson and levett were mistaken and yet you let em lay a trap for him on the following night for thats what it was i should think i did cries she it was then i saw my chance to be revenged on him whether hed cheated or no the first night i could make sure he was seen to cheat on the tuesday when every eye would be on him it was ever so easy she went on serenely i begged lady coventry to give me her place beside him and forgive me dearest and do not be too shocked i put my knee against his and smiled couthie and slee to fetch him for he always had a fancy to me you know and men are so vain and silly even an old dame like me can gowk them well it was no work at all to have him put his hand on mine to guide me in making my bets and i saw to it that he kept it there and made a flirt of it our hands together whenever we wagered and that is how counters came to be on his paper when they should not have been this was too much of all the nonsense dont tell me you can palm a gamingchip as if you were klondike kate why it would take a top sharp a firstrate mechanic harry says she quietly and held out her hand the empty palm towards me take my hand love yours on the back of mine so and now we lay them down and then we take them away so help me god there was the little round lid of the mustard pot on the cloth which had been bare i gaped struggling for speech my god where on earth did you learn that oh ever so long ago from that friend of yours in the th hussars what was his name brand obrien its the simplest sleight of hand really bryant that damned toad please harry do not thunder he was the cleverest conjurer you remember he was a low conniving blackguard dyou know he once laid a plant on me made me out a cheat and swindler in front of bentinck and disraeli and half the bloody country a dreadful suspicion struck me had the loathsome bryant been another of her fancymen when the blue blazes did you know him oh how can i remember twas years and years since about the crimea time i think when we were acquainted with lord cardigan and obrien or brand was one of his officers and showed me ever so many diverting tricks surely you mind how i used to amuse havvy and wee selina with them no well you must have been from home at all events says she reasonably if obryant once embarrassed you with his jiggerypokery would that be the time papa sent you away to africa my he was a dour man when he wanted to be well you can see it was not hard for me to do the like by billy cumming was it there is a tide in the affairs of men when you simply have to chuck it as for example when you learn that the wife of your unsuspecting bosom is a practised thimblerigger who has used her flash arts to ruin an innocent man for it must all be true she could never have invented anything so wild and it fitted the facts and solved the mystery and while no normal being would even have thought of such a thing or had the audacity to attempt it elspeth has always been that alarming mixture of an idiot and a bearcat for nerve being a poltroon myself i blurted out the first thing that came into my head but dear god suppose youd been caught fiddlesticks have i not just shown you and who she looked droll would ever suspect dear old lady flashman once perhaps i was a wee bit gallus when he was playing with his pencil and i took his hand as though to write something between us and pushed a counter over the line and the silly gommerils all swore in court that he had done it why i was as safe as coutts dyou know looking at that angelic smile and contemplating what shed done i was almost scared of her for the first time in fifty years my elspeth whose kindly feckless good nature id taken for granted had confessed with shameless satisfaction to a crime that would have shocked delilah if shed burned cumming at the stake she couldnt have done worse by him and suddenly i found myself thinking of sonseearray and narreeman and the dragon empress and the amazons and ranavalona and their genius for finding a mans tenderest spot and twisting till he squeals and realising that my gentle helpmeet was their sister under her cream and roses skin well ex elspetho semper aliquid novi thinks i whod have believed it and thank god shes on my side but what in the name of all that was wonderful could cumming have done to drive her to such a monstrous revenge i dont care to say was her astonishing reply when i demanded to be told her smile had vanished it was too too outrй for words her vocabulary being what it is that might mean anything from farting to high treason i felt an icy clutch at my innards of rage against cumming for whatever atrocious offence he might have given her and of fear that i might be expected to do something dangerous about it like offering to shoot the swine but i couldnt leave it there having told her appalling tale with happy abandon she was now plainly uneasy at my question frowning and looking askance please do not ask me says she i knew roaring and pounding the table wouldnt serve so i waited pushed back my chair and patted my knee here old lady says i and after a moment she came round and seated herself on my creaking thigh now then youre bound to tell me you know and i shant be a bit angry either honest injun you can kick twenty cummings into the gutter and ill lose no sleep cos i know my girl wouldnt do such a such a thing without good cause but i must know why you paid him out and why you didnt tell me all about it that night at tranby i gave her a squeeze and a kiss and my quizziest flashy smile weve never had any secrets from each other have we ill fry in hell no doubt about it i couldnt tell you then says she nestling against my shoulder i feared you would be angry and might might tell people no no you would not do that but you might have done something i dont know what to to interfere and spoil it and prevent him meeting his just deserts the dirty beast only elspeth can talk like that with a straight face comes of paisley and reading novels her mouth was drooping and there were absolute tears in her eyes you see i knew what i had done was dreadful and and dishonourable and you are the very soul of honour she said it god help me the chevalier sans peur et sans reproche thats what the queen called you i heard her bless me did she and if i had told you at tranby why you would have been in such a fix on the horns of tantalus whether to speak out which i knew you wouldnt ever do for my sake or else be an an accomplice in my dishonourable deed and that would not have done she dabbed her eyes with her sleeve so i had to be silent and deceive you and im so sorry for that dearest i truly am but not for what i did to billy cumming and if you blame me i cant help it oh harry i have so wanted to confess it all to you so many many times but i was bound to wait until the trial was over you see for then it would be too late she had her arms round my neck eyes piteous in entreaty oh harry my jo can you forgive me if you dont i think ill die for i only did it for love of you and and your honour you understand now why i said that elspeth must be allowed to babble to a conclusion if youre to reach sense at last well we were getting on dear lass says i trying not to wince with my leg cracking under the strain whatever does my honour have to do with it and for heavens sake what did gordon cumming do to make you hate him so and serve him such a ghastly turn at last it came in a whisper her head bowed he he called you a coward i dam near let her fall on the floor what was that a coward her head came up and suddenly she was fairly blazing with rage he said it to my face he did oh i burn with shame to think of it the vile falsehood the evil wicked storyteller he said you had run away from the seekhs or the zulus or someone at that place in africa isalsomethingorother isanlwana god love us who didnt but she was too angry to hear me raging on in full spate about how the brazen rascal had dared to say that i had fled headlong and escaped in a cart while my comrades perished and had skulked in the hospital at rorkes drift and she had been so distraught by his slanders that she had removed from his presence nigh weeping and if she had been a man she would have slain him on the spot to hear him lying in his jealous teeth the toad defaming you the bravest gallantest best soldier in all the world as everyone knows that have won the vc and done ever so many heroic deeds the hector of afghanistan and the bayard of balaclava it said in the papers and i cut them out every one and keep them and didnt i see you fight like a lion against those disagreeable folk in madagascar and you brought me away safe and sound and had followed to the ends of the earth all for my sake and rescued me that didnt deserve it and you the dearest kindest valiant knight so you are at which point she buried her face in my neck and howled for a spell while i moved her fine poundage on to a convenient chair and massaged my numbed limb marvelling at the mysterious workings of the female mind she continued to cling to me uttering muffled anathemas against cumming and at last came to the surface moist and pink i would not have told you if you had not pressed me gulps she for it soils my lips to have to repeat his sinful lies he tried to dishonour you and i was resolved to dishonour him by hook or crook if it took a lifetime and if what i did was dishonourable too and underhand and sly i dont care a docken hes a cur and thats what he is and now every dog on the midden kens what he is it aint easy for a sonsy matron with blonde curls to look like the wrath of god but she was managing uncommon well she sniffed defiant and soulful together now you know the kind of woman you married and if you spurn me it will break my heart but i would do it again a thousand times ill swear she gritted her teeth no one no one speaks ill of my hero and thats the size of it and that dear reader is why william gordoncumming was cast into outer darkness because hed blown on flashys honour ironic wouldnt you say it had been his bad luck that where an ordinary wife would have treated his insults with icy disdain or at most urged her husband to call on the cad with a horsewhip my eccentric lady had nursed her vengeance for years before ruin ing him with a stratagem so dangerous that my blood still runs cold to think of it twenty years on social ruin aside the crazy bitch could have gone to gaol for criminal conspiracy not that that would enter her empty head or deter her if it had the only qualm shed felt was that if i learned the truth of the disgraceful way shed engineered cummings downfall i might recoil from her in virtuous disgust which only goes to show that after fifty years she knew no more of my true character than i apparently did of hers and shed done it all for a mere word coward aye and for the love of harry well i aint the most sentimental chap as you know but as i thought about that and considered her while she dried her tears dammit i was touched not many husbands are given such proof of loyalty and fidelity and devotion carried to the point of insanity not that im saying shes mad mind but well youre bound to agree theres something loose up yonder still barmy or not the little darling deserved every comfort i could give her and i was about to embrace her with cries of reassurance when a thought crossed my mind she was watching me with pinknosed anxiety oh harry can you forgive me oh why do you look so stern do you despise me eh oh lord no what despise you good god girl im proud of you and i hugged her slightly preoccupied are you sure oh my darling when i see you frown and i know that what i did was ignoble and and unladylike and not at all the thing and how could you be proud of me oh i fear that you disdain me please dear one tell me its not so she put her hands either side of my face imploring at pointblank which aint helpful when youre trying to think i forced myself to sound sincere and hearty of course i dont disdain you you little goose what for snookering gordoncumming so cleverly i should say not it was the smartest stunt since tones vedras and tones who and nothing ignoble about it so dont fret your bonny head hes well served damned right nothings too bad for the man who tells truth about flashy but that was by the way oh harry she was all over me arms round my neck fairly squeaking with joy then you are not angry and im truly forgiven oh you are the best the kindest of husbands she kissed me for all she was worth and all is truly well absolutely couldnt be better so you mustnt cry any more make your pretty nose red if you do now what about that tea you were going to ring for she kissed me again and fled from the room calling for jane but in fact to make repairs to her appearance as id known she would when i mentioned her nose i wanted a moment to reflect cumming was down the drain excellent elspeth was none the worse for her idiotic behaviour indeed shed done me proud in her misguided way championing my honour as she conceived it excellent again shes solved the tranby mystery too albeit her explanation was as staggering as it was undoubtedly true on only one little point had she been reticent and it was exercising me rather the whole world knew i was one of the few whod escaped the isanlwana massacre in but that was no disgrace since there were no living witnesses to my terrified flight and if cumming chose to make the worst out of it much good it would do him with my heroic reputation but that was by the way since id gathered that hed confided his opinion to elspeth alone the point was when precisely had he done so and in what circumstances i didnt doubt hed called me a coward you understand but it aint the kind of thing a fellow says by way of social chat over the teacups is it ah lady flashman delightful weather is it not and did you enjoy the gondoliers such jolly tunes no i fear the dear bishops health is not what it was by the by did i never tell you your husbands a bloody poltroon who ran screaming from isanlwana oh you hadnt heard no hardly in my experience which is considerable observations like coward are usually made fortissimo at the climax of a firstrate turnup between a lady and gentleman most intimately acquainted a lovers quarrel perhaps youll recall that cumming was among those id suspected of dancing the honeymoon hornpipe with my dear one in days gone by it had been no more than my normal suspicion of her and had gone clean out of my head during the tranby scandal but now it was back with a vengeance yestwould be about ten years since shed dropped cummings acquaintance abruptly and my lurid imagination could conjure up the scene in some silken nest of sin around south audley street circa cumming all moustachioed and masterful in his long combinations and my adulterous angel bursting proudly out of her corset as they slanged each other across the crumpled sheets of shame god knows ive been there often enough myself when passion has staled to moody discontent sullen exchanges wax into recrimination the errant wife makes odious comparisons to the lovers disadvantage and thats the moment when lothario cut to the quick speaks his mind of the cuckolded husband your precious harrys not so much of a man i can tell you followed by a shriek of indignation and the crash of a hurled utensil aye thats how it would have been devil a doubt try as i might i couldnt picture it any different cumming must have been the little trollops lover to call me a coward to her face if this wasnt proof nothing was i sat brooding darkly remembering the straw sticking to the back of her dress after shed been in the woods with that randy redskin spotted tail cardigan with his pants round his ankles and her in bare buff when i blundered boozily out of the cupboard where id been asleep the shiny black boots that had betrayed her assignation with that smirking swine watkins or watney or whatever the hell his name was her preening herself in her sarong before that oily pirate usman whod diddled me at cricket and heaven knew how many others of whom id feared the worst time and again id been torn by jealous unproven suspicion and resolved to have it out with her and shirked at the last cos id rather not know well not this time bigod i felt my anger rising as i remembered her protestations that shed only done the dirty on cumming to avenge my honour ha like as not her true reason for wreaking vengeance on him was because hed kicked her out of bed but if that were so shed never have said a word to me about laying a plant on him would she oh lord were my foul imaginings getting the better of me yet again was i judging her by my own murky lights so many times id faced this same hideous question elspeth true or false it was high time i had an answer and i was going red in the face and growling as she came tripping back into the room plump and radiant no sign at all of her recent distress jane is bringing fresh tea and some of those little german biscuits and oh youre not angry with me dearest and all is she stopped short in dismay why harry whatever is the matter why are you scowling so oh my love what is it i had risen in my jealous wrath now i sat down again marshalling my words while she viewed me in pretty alarm elspeth says i and stopped short in turn ah whats that bringing tea is she well now ah what about a pot of coffee for the old man eh scowling no no just this leg o mine giving me a twinge the old wound you know here you come and sit on tother one and give us a kiss as the black chap said in shakespeares play tis better as it is appendix it hardly seemed worth while to give footnotes to flashman s account of the tranby croft affair since almost all of them would have led the reader to the same authority w teignmouth shores the baccarat case gordoncumming v wilson and others in the notable british trials series it contains a full transcript of the trial with notes and comments and is the best and fullest work on the subject other books which touch on the case and related matters include margaret blunden the countess of warwick piers compton victorian vortex philippe julian edward and the edwardians and an anonymous work the private life of the king teignmouth shore published his book to win justice for the memory of a man much wronged and nailed his colours to the mast with his opening quotation from truth which asserted after the trial that a dog would not have been hanged on the evidence that convicted gordoncumming it was an opinion shared by many and if flashman is to be believed they were right his view of the verdict aside mr shore makes several points of interest he describes the outcry against the prince of wales as outrageous and one has to agree that whatever the faults of the future king edward vii he hardly deserved the storm which burst over his hapless head from a press which knew a ripe scandal when it saw one and was only too glad of a royal scapegoat mr shore wondered if any newspaper of high standing in would have been so censorious perhaps not he did not live to see the s at the same time the prince showed lamentable judgment when the cheating allegation was first brought to his notice and mr shore is plainly right when he suggests that the sensible thing would have been to insist on accused and accusers thrashing the matter out on the spot there was indeed a remarkable lack of common sense in the way the affair was handled and in the pathetic belief that it could be kept quiet obviously panic struck not only the prince and his advisers but gordoncumming also or he would never have signed the damning document mr shore is scathing on the conduct of the trial the court being turned by consent of the judge into a theatre and a shoddy theatre at that whether flashmans sensational disclosure finally settles the controversy is for his readers to decide it fits the known facts and if it seems unlikely that is perfectly in keeping with the rest of the baccarat case an entertaining experiment which i have made myself is to insert a cover over the introduction to mr shores book and over the last page which carries the verdict and invite someone who knows nothing of the case to read the trial and pronounce sir william gordoncumming guilty or not the reactions are interesting you think twice about committing murder when youre over seventy mind you its not something ive ever undertaken lightly for all that i must have sent several score of the queens enemies to their last accounts in my time to say nothing of various bad men and oddsbodies whove had the misfortune to cross me when my triggerfinger was jumpy more than a hundred easy i should think which aint a bad tally for a trueblue coward whod sooner shirk a fight than eat his dinner and has run from more battlefields than he can count ive been lucky i suppose and devilish quick but those were killings in the way of business as a soldier or in my many misadventures in the worlds wild places where it was me or tother fellow murders different you see it takes more courage than ive ever had to think it out and weigh the consequences and keep your hand steady as you thumb back the hammer and draw a bead on the unsuspecting back you need to be in a perfect fever of fear and rage as i was when i threw de gautet over the cliff in germany in or when i sicked on that poor lunatic steward to shoot john charity spring ma on the slaveship off the cuba coast thats always been more my style to get some idiot to do the dirty work for me but there comes a time when theres no scapegoat handy and you have to do the business yourself and thats when you sweat at the thought of the black cap and the noose at the end of the eightoclock walk it makes my teeth chatter on the glass just to write about it aye and suppose you bungle it and your victim turns on you full of spite and indignation that can easily happen you know when youre an old man with a shaky wrist and a cloudy eye too stiff in the joints even to cut and run what business have you got at your time of life to be trying to slaughter a man fifteen years younger than you are in the middle of civilised london especially when hes a hightailed gunslick with a beltful of scalps who can shoot your ears off with his eyes shut for thats what tiger jack moran was and no mistake so you understand why i say it takes a deal of thought before you determine to go after a man like that with fatal intent knowing that your speed and cunning have been undermined by a lifetime of booze and evil living and your white hairs coming out in handfuls dammit i wouldnt have tackled him in my prime when i had size and strength and viciousness to set in the balance against my yellow belly but there i was a hoary old grandfather full of years and dignity and undeserved military honours with my knighthood and vc as respectable an old buffer as ever shuffled down st jamess with a flower in my buttonhole pausing only to belch claret or exchange grave salutes with cabinet ministers and clubmen but there i was i say at a time when i ought to have had nothing to do but drink my way gently towards an honoured grave spend my wifes fortune gorge at the best places leer at the young women and generally enjoy a dissolute old age and suddenly i had to kill tiger jack nothing else for it what brought the beads out on my withered brow more than anything else was my recollection of our first meeting so many years before when id seen for myself what an icecold killing villain he was aye and it was in a place where sheer cool nerve and skill with a gun were the narrow margin between escape and horrible death youll remember the name isanlwana i can see it still the great jagged rock of the little house rearing up above the stony sunbaked african plain the scattered lines of our redcoated infantry joking and catcalling among themselves as they waited for the ammunition that never came the redcapped natal kaffirs scurrying back to take their positions on the rocky slope a blacktunicked rider of frontier horse leaping the gun limbers bellowing a fatuous order to laager the wagons which went unheeded and was too late by hours pulleine fumbling with his fieldglasses and shouting hoarsely is that a rider from lord chelmsford a coloursergeant frantically hammering at the lid of an ammunition box the puffs of smoke from our advanced line firing steadily at the zulu skirmishers the rattle of musketry over the ridge to the left the distant figures of dumfords men on the right flank falling back firing as they came a voice croaking oh dear god almighty and it was mine as i looked noreast over the ranks of the th and saw the skyline begin to move like a brown blanket stirred by something beneath it and then all along the crest there was the rippling twinkling flash of thousands of spearpoints and a limitless line of white and coloured shields with nodding plumes behind them rank after rank and down the forward slope came the black spilling tide of ketshwayos impis twenty thousand savages rolling towards our pitiful position with its farstretched line of defenders death sweeping towards us at that fearful thunderous jogtrot that made the earth tremble beneath our very feet while the spears crashed on the oxhide shields and the dust rolled up in a bank before them as they chanted out their terrible bass chorus uzitulele kagali muntu which youll be enchanted to know means roughly he is silent he doesnt start the attack which was a bloody lie from where i was standing petrified and the horrible thing was i wasnt even in the army but was there by pure chance much consolation that was you can imagine as that frightful black horde came surging across the plain towards our makeshift camp beneath isanlwana rock the great mass in the centre coming on in perfect formation while the flank regiments raced out in the horns which would encircle our position and there was poor old flashy caught behind the companies of the th as they poured their volleyfiring into the chest of the zulu army cheering and shouting for the ammunitioncarriers and durnford s bald forehead glinting in the sun above his splendid whiskers as he pulled his men back to the donga and blazed away at the left horn sweeping in towards them for one brief moment as i cast a frantic eye behind me to pick out the quickest line of retreat to the rorkes drift track i absolutely thought it might be touch and go you see while we were most damnably trapped without proper defences in spite of the warnings old paul kruger had given to chelmsford about laagering and trenching every night in zulu country and while we were only a few hundred white soldiers and loyal niggers against the whole zulu army well a few dozen martinihenrys in the hands of men who know how to use em can stop a whole lot of blacks with clubs and spears id been with campbells highlanders at balaclava when they broke the ruski cavalry with two volleys and i still bore the scars of little big horn where renos troopers held off half the sioux nation anyway as i watched the th companies on the isanlwana slope pouring their fire into the brown and the artillery banging away for dear life cutting great lanes in the impis i thought bigod well hold em yet and we would have done but the ammunition boxes hadnt been broken out and just as the great mass of zulus a bare furlong from our forward troops seemed to be wavering and hanging back why the th were down to their last packets and the yelling and cheering turned to desperate cries of ammunition there bring the boxes for gods sake our fire slackened the th took a step back the natal kaffirs came pouring away from the left under the lee of the hill flinging their arms aside as they ran the order fix bayonets rang out from the ranks immediately to my front and the zulus regiments rallied and came bounding in in a great mad charge the rain of throwing spears whistling ahead of them like hail and the stabbing assegais coming out from behind the white shields as they tore into our disordered front line the roar of suthu suthu giving way to their hideous hissing sjee sjee as the spears struck home time for the lunch interval thinks i lets be off once they were at close quarters there wasnt a hope and by the look of it through that hell of smoke and gunfire and fleeing men with kaffirs rushing past and the gunners and wagonmen frantically trying to inspan and flee the surviving remnants of the th werent going to hold that huge press of zulus more than a matter of minutes see flashman and the redskins thus far in the battle being only a wellmeaning civilian id made a tremendous show of trying to get the wagons to laager in a circle so that we could make a stand if our forward troops gave way it was the sensible thing to do and it also kept me at a safe distance from the fighting so i was well placed beside an inspanned cart when the dam burst and the nokenke regiment of ketshwayos army came tearing up the hill i was into that wagon in a twinkling bawling to the driver to go like blazes and blasting away over the tailboard with an adams sixshooter in each fist i wish id a pound for every time ive looked out at a charging barbarian horde with my guts dissolving and prayers babbling out of me but that one took the biscuit they came racing in huge blacklimbed monsters with their sixfoot shields up eyes and teeth glaring over the top like spectres the plumes tossing and those disgusting twofoot steel blades glittering and smoking with blood i saw three men of the th back to back swinging their clubbed rifles go down before the charge and the zulus barely broke stride as they ripped the corpses up with their assegais and rushed on i blazed away weeping and swearing thinking oh god this is the end and im sorry ive led such a misspent life and dont send me to hell whatever dr arnold says and my hammer clicked down on an empty chamber just as the first zulu vaulted over the side of the wagon howling like a dervish i screamed and closed with him seizing his right wrist as the spearpoint swung at my breast my hand slipping on that oily skin i drove a knee at his groin butting him for all i was worth and trying to bite his throat all i got was a mouthful of monkey skin collar and god how he stank a shot crashed right beside my ear and the zulu fell away his face a mask of blood i never even saw who had shot him nor did i pause to inquire for as i reeled away to the side of the wagon here came a gunteam thundering past with an artilleryman crouched on one of the leaders lashing at the beasts and at the zulus who raced alongside trying to spear him from the saddle behind the team the gun was bouncing over the ground with some poor devil clinging to the muzzle his feet trailing in the dust until a zulu leaping behind dashed his brains out with a knobkerrie you dont think twice at such moments you truly dont i had one glimpse that still stays in my memory of that rockstrewn slope covered with charging zulus spearing the last knots of defenders of men screaming and falling of a sergeant of the th rolling on the ground locked with a black warrior while the others paused to watch of a bullock lumbering past bellowing with an assegai in its flank of bloody corpses redcoated or blackskinned sprawled among the dusty ruin of broken carts ration boxes and fallen equipment of hatefilled black faces and polished black bodies all that in a split second and then i went over the side of that cart in a flying dive on to the gun that was racketing past clutching frantically at the hot metal almost slipping down between barrel and wheel but somehow managing to stay aboard as it tore onwards bouncing left and right towards the little saddle of ground that runs from isanlwana hill how i survived the next minute i dont know i clung to the gun keeping low hearing a spear glance clanging from the metal a club caught me a blow on the shoulder but i stuck like a leech and the gun must have picked up speed because the closest zulus were suddenly lost in the dustcloud and for a moment we were clear of the immediate pursuit the driver still holding his seat on the leader and yelling and quirting away as the team topped the crest and went careering down the far slope towards the rorkes drift track the slope was thick with fugitives white and black a few mounted but most on foot going pellmell down to the broken ground and distant scrub with only one thought in mind to get away from the merciless black vengeance behind us they seemed to be making for a deep ravine about half a mile to the left where it seemed to me they were sure to be caught by the left horn of the zulu army as it came circling in i struggled up astride the gun and bawled above the din to the driver to bear right for the rorkes drift road he cast a terrified glance over his shoulder pointing frantically and shaking his head i looked and my heart died already round the far side of the isanlwana hill the vanguard of the zulu right horn was streaming down like a black lancehead to cut the track i could make out the green monkey caps and plumes of the tulwana regiment five minutes at most and the ring of steel would have closed round isanlwana and god help anything white that was still inside there was nothing for it but the ravine and we rushed down the slope at breakneck speed the driver lashing the exhausted horses and flashy going up and down astride that damned barrel like a pea on a drum i stole a glance back and beyond the scattered groups of running fugitives i could see the first ranks of the zulu chest coming over the hill this wont do my lad thinks i well have to move a deal faster if we want to see piccadilly again the gun lurched under me sickeningly there was a yell of alarm from the driver ahead and by god the right rearwheeler had broken a trace and was veering madly off to the right head up and snorting she stumbled and went down as the second trace parted and i shot off the gun as it slewed round hit the ground with a fearful jar and went rolling arse over elbow tearing the skin off shoulder and knee on the rockhard earth before i fetched up winded within a yard of the fallen horse i had a hand on its mane as it thrashed up again hooves flying and you may be sure i wasnt the only one half a dozen fugitives had the same notion and one a sergeant gunner was halfaboard the beast mine damn you roars he she cant take two right you are my son says i and knocked him flying i got a limb across that heaving bare back and thats all i ever need thank god ive never seen the mount i couldnt master i wound my hands into the mane dug in my heels and went head down for the ravine just as the gun i had lately left went careering into it team driver and all it was a deep narrow cleft christ was it narrow enough to jump i tensed myself for the leap gave her my heel at the last moment and we went soaring over there was a horrible instant when we seemed to hang on the far lip but we scrambled to safety by our eyebrows i heard a scream behind me and turned to see a big grey failing to make the same jump she fell back into the ravine with her rider crushed beneath her the ravine and the bank i had just left looked like dantes inferno they were fleeing down it among the rock and thorn towards the buffalo river five miles away and those black devils were on the far lip sjee sjee and the assegais flashing up and down like pistons i looked to my right front where the tulwana were streaking across the track there was still a gap between them and the ravine and i went for it hellforleather the horse slithering on the loose rocks and me clinging like grim death she was only an artillery screw but there must have been a hunter ancestor in her somewhere for she outraced that zulu pincer with a hundred yards to spare and i was able to hold her in as we shot into the safety of the scrub with the screams and gunshots fading into the distance behind us that was how i made my strategic retreat then from the massacre of isanlwana the greatest debacle of british arms since the kabul retreat nearly forty years earlier oh aye id been in that too freezing and bleeding on that nightmare march which never reached the khyber but id been a thoughtless boy then at isanlwana i was an older much wiser soldier and i knew i was a long way from safety yet i couldnt tell how many others had won clear but i could guess that the next stop along the line for ketshwayos merry men would be rorkes drift eight miles away on the buffalo theyd gobble up the picquet there and be over the natal border by sundown it behoved flashy to bear away north and try to cross the river well beyond the reach of the impis the trouble was even i didnt know how fast zulus can travel with the blood smell in their nostrils it was about the middle of the afternoon when i came out of the scrub and boulders into a little kraal perhaps ten miles from isanlwana i reckoned i was clear of pursuit but my beast was tuckered out and i could have jumped for joy at the sight of an army wagon among the huts and a burly redcheeked sergeant puffing his cutty while he watched the native women tending a cookingpot close by it was a stray ammunition cart belonging to a flying column sent out north the previous day theyd had a brush with some zulu scouts last evening and there were two or three wounded on blankets laid across the ammunition boxes the cart was taking them down to rorkes drift the sergeant said not today you aint says i and told him briefly what had happened to most of chelmsfords force he goggled and dropped his pipe cripes says he why the rest of our column was makin for isanlwana this mornin ere tiger jacks got to ear about this major major sir come quick and that was when i got my first sight of tiger jack moran he came out of one of the huts in answer to the sergeants cry and as soon as i clapped eyes on him thinks i this is a killing gentleman he was perhaps forty as big as i was but leaner and he walked with a smooth pigeontoed stride like a great slim cat his face was lean too and nutbrown with a huge hooked nose a bristling black moustache and two brilliant blue eyes that were never still they slid over you and away and back again it was a strong face but mean even the rattrap mouth had an odd lift at one side which with the evershifting eyes made it look as though he knew some secret joke about you for the rest he wore a faded sapper jacket and a wideawake hat with a black sash round his hips when he turned i saw he had one of the new longbarrelled remington revolvers reversed through the sash over his right rump a gunfighters gun with the foresight filed away if you please well well thinks i heres one to keep an eye on chelmsfords wiped out you say the blue eyes looked everywhere but into mine i wouldnt have trusted this fellow with the mess funds in a hurry the whole command half of it anyway says i guzzling away at a plate of salt and mealies the sergeant had given me chelmsford himselfs off in the blue with number column and if hes wise hell stay there ketshwayos army must be cayoodling round rorkes drift by now thousands of the brutes theres no hope that way if it comes to that i doubt if therell be anything white and living between blood river and the tugela by sunrise tomorrow you dont say says he and you got away eh youre not army though not at the moment im retired but i imagine youve heard of me i didnt like his manner above half with his slippery eyes and halfsmile my names silence he threw up a hand and his head jerked round listening the sergeant and i held our breath listening with him i couldnt hear a thing beyond the noises of the kraal the fire crackling the soft shuffling of one of the nigger women a baby crying in one of the huts just hot silence in that baking sun and then moran says sharply to me you came on that horse how long did it take you two hours perhaps look here inspan that wagon he barked at the sergeant look alive now get that damned black driver sharps the word well have em on top of us before we know it and before i could protest he had swung away and was running between the huts jumping on to a great boulder and looking back the way i had come shading his eyes you dont waste time arguing with a man who knows his business i felt the hot prickle of fear down my spine as i helped the sergeant get the beasts inspanned they were horses thank god bullocks would have been useless if we were going to have to cut out as fast as moran seemed to think we must he jumped down from the rock and came striding back towards us his head turning left and right to scan the ridges either side of the village his hand twitching nervously at his right hip get those three wounded lying down and get aboard yourselves driver start that rig moving he glanced at me that sly grin turning the corner of his mouth id climb in mister if i were you unless my shikaris instinct is playing me false your black friends are closer than you think and i dont then it happened and if i hadnt seen it with my own eyes id not have believed it and i knew hickok in his prime remember before his eyesight went and john wesley hardin too the sergeant in the act of climbing over the tailboard let out a hell of a shriek i glimpsed his face red and staring and his arm flung out to point and then his eyes stared horribly and he slumped down into the dust with a throwing assegai between his shoulders his limbs thrashing wildly i turned and there not twenty yards away beyond moran standing on the boulder hed just left and poised in the act of throwing was a zulu warrior i could still tell you every detail of him the great black body behind the red and white shield the calfskin girdle the white cowtail garters the ringed head with its nodding blue plume even the little horn snuffbox swinging from his neck it was a nightmare figure and now there were two more either side of him leaping between the huts screaming sjee with their assegais raised to hurl at us moran had spun on his heel at the sergeants scream and i swear i never saw his right hand move but the remington was in his fist and the boomboomboom of its triple explosion was almost like one echoing shot the zulu on the rock jerked upright snatching at his face and toppled backwards the foremost of the two running towards us pitched headlong with half his head blown away in a sudden bloody spray and the third man stumbled crazily dropping his shield and rolling over and over to finish a bare two yards from us sprawled on his back there was a hole where his right eye had been and morans pistol was back in his sash twins by the look of em says he did you know the zulus think they make the best scouts well dont stand gawping old fellow therell be plenty of live ones on the scene presently mind the step and he was over the back of the moving wagon with me tumbling breathlessly after him shocked out of my wits by the speed and terror of it all id say from the moment the sergeant fell to our jumping into the wagon had been a good five seconds and in that time three men had died thank god and the man beside me was chuckling and pushing fresh shells into his revolver he was right about the live ones arriving too as our wagon wheeled out of the village on to a great empty stretch of plain beyond it we could see black figures gliding in among the huts on the far side and by the time we were a furlong out on the plain itself with the driver lashing like fury and the wagon rolling dangerously from side to side they were breaking cover in pursuit there must have been more than twenty of them and i dont recall a more fearful sight than that silent halfmoon of racing black figures each with his mottled red and white shield and fistful of glittering spears their white hide kilts and garters flying as they ran udloko unless im mistook says moran good regiment that lets add to their battle honours what he had got a martini from one of the wounded men who were lying pale and silent behind us in the jolting wagon and now he snuggled the butt into his shoulder keeping the barrel clear of the rattling tailboard and let off four shots as fast as he could eject and reload he hit three more zulus this at a range of two hundred yards from a wagon that was bucking like a ship at sea and at moving targets i tell you i was stricken between terror and sheer admiration damnation says he after his missed shot bet he felt the wind of it though he saw me staring and grinned dont be alarmed old boy just pass up the cartridge packets and ill have our gallant foes discouraged in half a jiffy just see if i dont but when i applied to the wounded for more cartridges damned if there was a round among them well were sitting on half a ton of the things says moran cool as you please and tapped the ammunition boxes lets forage shall we so we broke open a case and it was carbine ammunition quite unsuitable for martinis i swallowed my innards for about the twentieth time that day all the boxes carried the same stamp and there still loping across the sunscorched plain behind us not apparently having lost any distance were the twenty zulus looking as fit as fleas and a dam sight more unpleasant now thats vexing says moran laying down his rifle and unlimbering his remington again he spun the chamber six shots hmm well lets hope none of the horses breaks a leg what for gods sake man my voice came out in a dreadful squeak they cant keep up this pace forever who the horses or ketshwayos sporting and athletic club he gripped the tailboard and weighed the distance between us and our pursuers i think on the whole id put my money on the blacks more staying power dont you know by george cant they run though but my god were done for theyre gaining on us i tell you quite says he better think of something eh unless we want our hides stretched over some damned udloko wardrum that is lets see now he stood up in the swaying wagon clutching a support and peered ahead under the canvas cover resting a hand on the shoulder of the terrified nigger driver who was rolling his eyes and letting his team rip for all it was worth if i remember right this blasted plain ends in a deep gully about a mile ahead theres a crazy kind of bridge over it we came across it on the way up it took the wagon all right but very slowly fraid by the time we get across our friends will be calling on us an six shots wont go far among that crowd even if i make every one tell which i would of course wait though and he dropped down on one knee pushing one of the wounded men aside and ferreting among the ammunition boxes i was hardly listening to him my eyes were fixed on that line of steadilyrunning black figures coming on inexorably in our wake they were losing distance though it seemed to me yes there must be nearly a quarter of a mile between us now but our beasts were tiring too they couldnt keep up this speed much longer dragging a heavy wagon behind them when we reached the bridge would there be time for the wagon to make its careful way across before they caught up i scrabbled at morans arm yammering hopefully and he grinned as he straightened up from his search among the boxes holding up a large packet of waxed brown paper in one hand there we are sonny boy says he chuckling thought i remembered it blasting powder and a darling little primer now watch your uncle jack i dont want to live through another five minutes like those last agonising moments while we sped across the plain slower and slower with every yard straining our eyes back at those distant black figures behind even when we reached the gully a great rocky cleft that stretched as far as one could see on either side like a volcanic crack with a rickety plank bridge spanning its thirty feet there was the timeconsuming labour of getting the wounded out and across the nigger driver and i managed it between us and sinful hard it was for two of em had to be carried the whole way moran meanwhile coaxed the team on to the swaying bridge until the wagon was fairly in the middle of it then we outspanned the horses and led them across glancing back fearfully there they came those black fiends of the pit a bare hundred yards away sprinting full lick now that they saw we were halted and apparently stuck they set up a great yell of suthu as they tore in towards the bridge and moran who had been working in the wagon jumped down and ran across to the little cluster of boulders where we had laid the wounded he dropped down beside me looking back at the wagon it was perhaps thirty yards off with the waxed brown packet of gunpowder sitting on top of the ammunition boxes and the tiny white primer fixed to the side of the packet with a rifle i might have hit it myself all he had was a handgun well heres luck says he one shotll have to do it he was right i realised and my mouth was parched with fear if he missed the primer his shot would hit the powder packet but that wouldnt explode it it would just knock it over and the primer would go god knew where and the first zulu was racing on to the bridge shield aloft in triumph with his hideous legion shrieking at his heels gather round dear boys murmurs moran cocking his pistol get yourselves nice and comfy round the bonfire christ his head jerked up the colour draining from his face it may have been a puff of wind or perhaps the zulus swarming past the wagon on that shaky bridge had disturbed it but the front flap of the canvas cover suddenly swung across momentarily hiding the tiny white target it rapped again for a split second the primer was visible the first halfdozen zulus were past the wagon and within three strides of the solid ground assegais gleaming and knobkerries brandished howling black faces another flap of the canvas the crash of morans revolver and with a roar of thunder the wagon the bridge and everything on it dissolved in a great blast of orange flame i was hurled flat my ears deafened and singing a piece of timber clattered against the rock beside me i came dizzily to my feet to stare at the empty ravine with a great black cloud billowing in the air above it a few shreds of rope and timber dangling from the far lip and on this side lying in the dust a single assegai moran reversed his revolver in his hand and pushed it into the back of his sash then he tilted his hat back and flicked his forefinger at its brim bayete udloko says he softly i do like a snap shot though give the gentleman a coconut that was in my first acquaintance with tiger jack and it was to last only a few more feverish hours which ill describe at length some other day for they dont matter to the tigers tale which is strange enough without rorkes drift to interrupt it that was a nightmare in its own right if you like worse than little hand or greasy grass for at least at those id been able to run why at the drift there wasnt even room to hide and itll make a ghastly chapter of its own in my african odyssey if i can set it down before drink and senility carry me off enough for the moment to say that moran and i were driven absolutely into that beastly carnage you see with our wagon blown to pieces he and i lit out on two of the draught screws leaving the wounded in a dry cave moran intent on fetching help for them flashy merely fleeing in his wake and as dark fell we blundered slap into an impi for the hills were full of the brutes by now then it was head down and heels in nip and tuck for our lives through the zuluinfested night with the fiends howling at our heels and suddenly moran was yelling and making for a burning building dead ahead with all hell breaking loose around it zulus by the hundred and shots blazing and there was nothing for it but to follow as he went careering through scrub and bushes putting his beast to a stone wall and then a barricade where black bodies and red coats were hacking and slashing in the fireglare bayonet against assegai and my screw took the wall but baulked at the barricade which i cleared in a frantic dive launching myself from a pile of zulu corpses landing head first on the smoking veranda of what had been the post hospital going clean through the charred floor and being hauled halfconscious from the smouldering wreckage by a huge cove with a red beard who left off pistolling to ask me where the dooce id come from i inquired at the top of my voice where the hell i was and between shots he told me that briefly is how i came to join the garrison at rorkes drift and all the world knows what happened there a hundred warwickshire welshmen and a handful of invalids stopped four thousand udloko and tulwana zulus in bloody shambles at the mealiebag ramparts hammer and tongs and no quarter through that ghastly night with the burning hospital turning the wreckage of the little outpost into a fair semblance of hell and flashy seeking in vain for a quiet corner which i thought id found once on the thatch of the commissariat store and damned if they didnt set fire to that too eleven victoria crosses they won chard with his beard scorched bromhead stonedeaf and those ragged taffies halfdead on their feet but not too done to fight oh and talk as an unworthy holder of that cross myself ill say they earned them and as much glory as you like for there never was a stand like it in all the history of war for they didnt only stand against impossible odds you see they stood and won the garrulous little buggers and not just cos they had martinis against spears and clubs and a few muskets they beat em hand to hand too steel against steel at the barricades and john zulu gave them best well you know what i think of heroism and i cant abide leeks but i wear a daffodil as my buttonhole on davys day for rorkes drift but thats not to my purpose with tiger jack he was in the thick of it though i didnt even glimpse him from the time we jumped the barricades until next morning when the impis had drawn off leaving us to lick our wounds among the smoking ruins it was only then that we learned each others name when chelmsford whod been traipsing out yonder with his column rode in when everyone had done cheering he spotted me and made me known to chard and bromhead and that was when moran who was sitting by on a biscuit box cleaning his remington came suddenly to his feet and for once the sliding blue eyes stared straight at me in astonishment presently he came over flashman not sir harry kabul and the light brigade im used to it not the least irony of my undetected poltroonery is the awe my fearsome reputation inspires they always stare as moran did if not so intently for a moment he even paled and then the thin mouth was halfsmiling again and his eyes shifted away well think o that says he and chewed his lip id never have recognised you by jove and he gave a queer little laugh if id only known then he turned on his heel and walked away with that quick feline stride and the remington on his hip out of my life for the next fifteen years when he walked back in it was in a place as different from rorkes drift as anything on this earth could be instead of a smoking bloodstained ruin there was the plush and gilt of the circle bar at the st jamess theatre instead of the sapper jacket and revolver there was an opera cloak and silvermounted cane and instead of dead zulus for company there was oscar wilde it was pure chance i was at that theatre at all or even in london for it was still winter when elspeth and i prefer to snug up cosily at our leicestershire place where the drink and vittles are of the best and we can snarl at each other comfortably but she had insisted we go up to town for the macmillan christening being scotch herself and fancying that she occupied a place in society she was forever burdening other unfortunate caledonians with her presence and i didnt mind too much id heard rumours from friends in the know that there was to be a monstrous increase in death duties at the next budget and being in my seventysecond year by then with a fat sum in the bank it seemed sensible to squander as much among the fleshpots as we indecently could so to town we went and in between brandysoaked evenings with old comrades and hopeful prowlings after a new generation of loose women i allowed myself to be talked into escorting my granddaughter to the theatre to see mrs campbell drivelling abominably in mrs tanqueray id much have preferred going to watch nala damajanti and her amazing snakes at the palace or the corsetted fat bottoms and tits in george edwardes show but being a besotted grandparent id have let my little selina coax me into watching three hours of steady rain and been happy she was a little darling and the apple of my bleary old eye how my son as unpromising a prig as ever saddened a fathers heart by becoming a parson could have sired such an angel ive never been able to fathom i call her little but in fact she was one of your tall stately beauties with raven black hair eyes flashing dark as a gypsys and a face that could change from classical perfection to sparkling mischief in an instant she was just nineteen then a lovely lively innocent and i watched her like a jealous hawk where the society boys were concerned i know what i was like when i was their age and i wasnt having the dirty young rips lechering round my little selly besides she was officially affianced to young randall stanger a titled muttonhead in the guards and their forthcoming nuptials would be quite an event of the season she was chattering happily as we came out after the third act and caught the eye of the bold oscar who was holding forth languidly to a group of his fritillaries near the bar entrance looking as usual like an overfed trout in a toupй he and i had known each other more or less since the days when i was being pursued by lily langtry as i went past now trying not to notice him with selly on my arm he nudged one of his myrmidons and said sotto voce strange how desire doth so outrun performance and then pretending just to notice me why general flashman in london out of season that can only mean that all the hares and foxes have left the country or the french are invading it his group of harumphrodites all tittered at this and the fat posturer waved his goldtipped cigarette well pleased with his insolence i looked at him quoting shakespeare oscar says i pity you dont crib him more often get better notices what my dear says i to selly this is mr wilde who writes comic material for the halls my granddaughter miss selina flashman you grandchild incredible drawls he but delightful beautiful why if dear bosie were here instead of indulging himself so selfishly in italy he would write verses to you mamselle verses like purple blooms in a caliphs garden i would write them myself but my new play you know he pressed her hand with his fruity smile and i see dear miss flashman that you are discriminating as well as beautiful you have had the excellent taste to choose as your grandfather one of the few civilised generals in the british army he waited for her look of surprise he never won a battle you know may i present mr beasley mr bruce mr gaston colonel moran he turned her with a flutter of his plump hand to his toadies and gave me his drooping insolent stare do you know my dear sir harry i believe i have a splendid idea i might he poked his gilded cigarette at me i might confer on you an immortality quite beyond your desserts i might put you in a play assuming the lord chamberlain had no objection think what a stir that would create at the horse guards he gave a mincing little titter you do father oscar says i and ill certainly confer immortality on you how so cries he affecting astonishment ill kick you straight in the tinklers assuming youve got any says i think what a stir thatll create in the cafй royal i turned to selly who was out of earshot listening to what one of oscars creatures was saying come my dear our carriage will be and that was the moment when i found myself looking at moran he was on the fringe of oscars group and so out of place among that posy of simpering pimps that i wonder i hadnt noticed him earlier but now recognition was instant and mutual his hair had gone save a grey fringe about the ears the splendid moustache was snowwhite and the lined brown face had turned boozers red but there was no mistaking that hawk nose and the bright shifting eyes dress him how and where you liked he was still tiger jack he was looking at me with that odd quirky little smile at the corner of his thin mouth and then the blue eyes turned from me to selina who was laughing happily at what someone was saying fluttering her fan before her white shoulders teasing the speaker innocently moran looked at her for a moment and when his eyes came back to mine he was grinning and it wasnt a nice grin now all this happened in an instant while i was recognising him and realising that he had recognised me there was a seconds pause and then as i was about to move forward and greet him he stepped quickly back murmuring an excuse to selly and the others and slipped into the bar i didnt know what to make of it but it seemed damned odd behaviour however it didnt matter and selly was taking my arm and murmuring farewells so i exchanged another disgusted glare with wilde and led her away she had noticed though sharp little creature that she was why did that gentleman colonel moran hurry off so suddenly says she when we were in the carriage im sure he knew you he did says i at least we met once in a war but then so many of these people seem to behave most curiously says selly mr oscar wilde for instance is he not a very strange person gramps thats one way of putting it says i and dont call me gramps young woman im grandpapa now why the blazes should moran have avoided me lots of fellows do of course but he had no earthly reason that i could think of wed met only once as you know and been comradesinarms after a fashion indeed hed saved my life it seemed odd and i puzzled over it for a while but then gave it up and was snoozing in my corner of the carriage and had to be roused by a giggling selina when we reached home in berkeley square moran wasnt alone in giving me the cold shoulder at that time though only a couple of days after the theatre i was cut stone dead by someone a deal more important the prince of wales no less shied violently away from me in the united service cardroom and hightailed it as fast as his ponderous guts would let him giving me a shifty squint over his shoulder as he went that i confess i found pretty raw its embarrassing enough to be cut by the most vulgar man in europe but when he is also a prince who is deeply in your debt you begin to wonder what royaltys coming to for if ever anyone had cause to be grateful to me it was beastly bertie not only had i done my bit to guide his youthful footsteps along the path of vice and loose living id even resigned lily langtry in his favour turned a deaf ear to rumours that he and my darling elspeth had behaved indecorously in a pottingshed and only three years earlier had plucked him only slightly soiled out of the tranby card scandal if that wasnt enough he was still using a cosy little property of mine on hay hill to conduct his furtive fornications with the worst sort of women duchesses and actresses and the like well thinks i as i watched him rolling off if thats your gratitude you can take your trollops elsewhere id a good mind to charge him rent or corkage i didnt of course a bounder he might be but it dont pay to offend the heir to the throne such rubs apart i passed the next few weeks agreeably enough there was plenty of interest about town what with a society murder a young sprig of the nobility called adair getting himself shot mysteriously in the west end and a crisis in the government when that dodderer gladstone finally resigned i ran into him in the lavatory of the reform club not a place i belong to you understand but id been to a champagne and lobster supper in st jamess and just looked in to unload gladstone was standing brooding over a basin in a nonconformist way offensively sober as usual when i staggered along middling tight hollo old un says i marching orders at last hey neer mind it happens to all of us its this damned irish business i suppose for as you know he was always fussing over ireland no one knew what to do about it and while the paddies seemed to be in favour of leaving the place and going to america gladstone was trying to make em keep it something like that where you went wrong i told him was in not giving the place back to the pope long ago and apologising for the condition its in fact he stood glaring at me with a face like a doorknocker goodnight general flashman he snapped and i just sank my head on the basin and cried oh god what a loss palmerston was while he stumped off and took to his bed in brighton however thats by the way i must return to the matter of colonel tiger jack moran who had gone clean out of my mind after that fleeting glimpse of him at the theatre until a dirty night at the end of march when i was sitting up late reading elspeth having taken herself off to bed with the new serial story the house was still the fire almost out and i was drowsing over the paper which was full of interesting items about the matabele war and the sanitation conference in paris and news of an action by the frogs against my old chums the touaregs at timbuctoo in which large numbers of sheep had been captured when shadwell the butler came in all agog to say that my granddaughter was here and must see me at this hour says i and then she came fluttering into the room in a rush of pink ballgown her lovely little face staring with woe and fairly flung herself on my chest crying oh grandpapa grandpapa what shall i do oh gramps please helpme please in gods name selina says i staggered i waved the goggling shadwell out of the room and sat her down all trembling in a chair my dear child whatevers the matter for a moment she couldnt tell me but could only sit shuddering and sobbing and biting her lip so i pushed a tot of brandy into her and when she had coughed and swallowed she lifted her tearstreaked face and caught my hand oh gramps i dont know what to do it is the most dreadful thing i think i shall die she took a great sobbing breath it is randall and and colonel moran oh what are we to do moran i was dumfounded that fellow we saw at the theatre why what the dooce has he to do with you child it took some more sips of brandy punctuated by wails and tears to get the story out of her and it was a beauty if you like apparently moran was well known in gaming circles in town and made a practice of inveigling young idiots to play with him that solved the mystery of why hed been in oscar wildes company there was never any lack of rich and witless young gulls round oscar and among the spring lambs hed fleeced was selinas intended randall stanger by what she said moran had got into him for a cool few thou in gods name girl if its only money i was crying out in relief but it was worse than that fatally worse the halfwit randall afraid to tell his lordly papa had set out to recoup his losses using regimental money heaven help us and had lost that too which was black ruin and disgrace when the thing was detected as it would be however im an old hand at scandals as you may guess how much i asked her briskly and she bleated out picking her fan to pieces twelve thousand i swallowed hard and said well randall shall have it from my bank tomorrow he can pay off moran and put whatever is necessary back into his mess funds double quick and no onell be the wiser would you believe it she just wailed the louder shaking her head and sobbing that it wouldnt save him nothing would colonel moran knows he knows where randall has got the money from and promises to expose him unless she buried her face in the cushions bawling fit to break her stays unless what confound it what does he want except his money unless unless says she gazing at me with those great tearfilled eyes unless i oh gramps i must die first he will expose randall unless i submit oh god im his price dont you see oh what am i to do well this was act two of the villain still pursued her with a vengeance wasnt it just not that i disbelieved it for an instant show me melodrama and ill show you truth every time and i didnt waste effort clutching my brow exclaiming the villain he shall rue this day i could even see morans point of view id played wicked jasper myself in my time twirling my whiskers at beauty and chivvying em into bed as the price of my silence or good will but this was my own granddaughter and my gorge rose at the thought of her at the mercy of that wicked old rouй she must be saved at any cost when do you have to answer him i asked next week she sobbed he will wait only a few days and then then i must be ruined does randall know i asked and she shook her head snivelling into her handkerchief well dont let him know understand no one must know above all not your grandmother let me see first thing is an order on my bank for the twelve thousand so that this idiot youre going to marry can square his accounts but colonel moran she wailed beating her little fist ill see to him never fear now selly all is going to be well dyou see absolutely well and you dont have to worry your pretty head over it you understand me i took her hand and put my arm round her shoulders and rubbed my old whiskers against her brow as id done since she was a baby and she wept on my shoulder now you dry your eyes and lets see your best smile no your best one i said there thats my princess i wiped a tear from her cheek and she flung her arms round my ancient neck oh gramps you are the dearest grandpapa i know you will make it right she sniffed in my ear perhaps after all if you offered him more money he is such a greedy odious person but you will find a way wont you that of course remained to be seen and when id packed her off to bed and sent word round to her fond parents house that shed be staying the night with us i sought enlightenment in brandy i find it helps moran thinks i to myself evil lecherous skunk i thought of that shifty eye and wicked mouth aye he fitted the part hed written for himself trying to ruin virginity was he and my little sellys at that damn him well now if i was in his shoes what would make me forego my dirty designs threats of violence well theyd have worked on me but they wouldnt on moran that was certain he was all cold steel and courage that one id seen him money then aye i could have been bought off i had been in the past so flashys bank account was in for another rough shaking well if needs must so be it i couldnt see any other way not that i was resigned to tamely paying up you understand if i could find a way of foiling the swine id do it but i plied my wits through a bottle and a half by next afternoon without striking paydirt however until i saw moran himself there was nothing to be done so i sought out his direction by discreet inquiry and early evening found me round at his rooms off bond street sending in my card i was ushered up and there was the man himself very much at his ease in a most luxuriously fitted den all leather and good panels and big game trophies on the walls chinese carpet too rot him his price wasnt going to be a cheap one well well says he setting his back to the mantel very lean and cool i halfexpected youd be round if not quite so soon all right moran says i giving him my damnyou stare and keeping my tile on whats the game game my dear chap the only game im interested in is big game what reminds me have you seen that rubbish in the times sporting columns review of some book on shikar he sauntered forward to his desk and picked up a paper here we are no beast perhaps is more dangerous than the buffalo what tosh dont you agree why what buffalo that ever walked could compare with a wounded leopard eh or a tiger if it comes to that but maybe youve another opinion he gave a short laugh and the blue eyes slipped quickly over me what dye think of my collection by the way only the best of it here of course rather fine though that ibex head for example and the snow leopard beside the window my only interest in your collection i growled is that it isnt going to contain my granddaughter no says he lightly thought shed look rather well mounted wouldnt you think dont do anything foolish he added sharply as i started to plough forward snarling at his filthy insolence youre past the age when you can lift your stick to anyone not that you could ever have lifted it to me my rage was almost choking me as i glared at him standing so easy behind his desk mocking me listen you foul kite says i youll drop this vile affront youve put on my girl or by god itll be the worse for you ill make this town too hot for you so help me i will you think im helpless do you youll find out other drop it you old fool snaps he dyou think you can bluster at me think back to isanlwana and ask yourself if im the man to be browbeaten yes that makes you think twice he was right there i stood seething helplessly damn you all right then for i knew it had to come to this whats your price he laughed aloud money are you seriously trying to buy me off youve a poorer opinion of miss selinas charms than id have thought possible in a rake of your experience blast your lousy tongue how much he took a cigar from his pocket lit it coolly while i boiled with anger and blew out the match you havent got that much money he drawled not he blew smoke across the desk at me if you were moss abrahams in person oh dont think it wouldnt give me great pleasure to beggar you it would but ill enjoy your plump little granddaughter even more oh so much more shed be very much my meat in any circumstances but the fact that shes yours he poked his cigar at me grinning oh that makes her a prize indeed this was beyond all understanding i gaped at the man dumfounded what the devil dyou mean that shes my grandchild what has that to do with it in gods name what have i ever done to you i dont even know you hardly and you saved my skin in zululand didnt you aye says he if id only known though who you were remember i told you at rorkes drift but i didnt know by god if i had youd never have come over the buffalo alive and for once the eyes were steady glaring hate at me i couldnt fathom it what the blazes are you talking about good god above man what the devil have you got against me ive never injured you or if you think i have i swear i dont know about it what is it damn you he said not a word and whatever it is whats my selina to do with anything why should you want to harm her you bastard an innocent dear god have you no decency and i what have i done you dont know do you says he softly you truly dont but then how should you how would you remember out of all the vile things youve done why should you remember me this was beyond comprehension i wondered was the fellow a lunatic but mad or not there was that in his baleful stare that terrified me for selly as much as for myself shall i remind you says he and his voice grated like gravel you think we met for the first time in zululand do you he shook his head oh no flashman cast your mind back fortyfive years a long time eh dyou remember an african slaveship called the balliol college trading into the dahomey coast a ship commanded by a human devil called john charity spring ma a ship on which you flashman served as supercargo dyou remember did i not id never forget it but but what has that to do with you why you can only have been a child in those days aye a child he roared suddenly crashing his fist on the desk a child of fourteen thats what i was his face was crimson working with fury but he mastered himself and went on in a rasping whisper you remember an expedition upriver to the village of king gezo who sold niggers to spring you remember that deathhouse built of skulls and the human sacrifices and those savage amazon women who were gezos bodyguard dyou remember oh yes i see that you do and dyou remember the bargain that monster spring struck with that monster gezo half a dozen amazon women to be sold into slavery in exchange for a case of adams revolvers which you his finger stabbed out at me demonstrated for that black fiend as clear as day i could see it the hideous gezo leaping up and down on his stool slobbering in excitement with those great black fightingwomen ranged by his throne i could feel the adams kicking in my fist as i blew holes in the skull wall for his edification six women in exchange for a case of revolvers and what else morans face was terrible to see what turned the scale in that infamous bargain dyou recall again i see you do his voice was barely audible gezo demanded that springs cabinboy be left with him as a slave and spring and you and the rest of that hellships crew you agreed and left the child behind he straightened up from the desk i was that boy it was beyond belief it couldnt be true not for a minute but even as the denial sprang to my lips my wits were telling me that no one no one on earth could have known the details of that shameful transaction of springs unless hed been there and yet but thats moonshine i cried why i remember that boy a snivelling little cockney guttersnipe with a crosseye nothing like you and damnation you were educated at eton i looked you up in whos who quite true says he and like many a public school boy before me and many since i ran away dont tell me you never drove some panicstricken little fag to do the same at rugby oh yes i ran and thought it would be a fine thing to go for a ships boy and seek my fortune i was a good enough actor even then to fake a whitechapel whine the genteel captain spring would never have shipped a little gentleman as cabinboy now would he the sneer writhed at the corner of his mouth but he was ready enough to drug him with native beer and sell him as a slave to that unspeakable savage in exchange for a gaggle of halfnaked black sluts oh aye you were all willing enough for that its a lie cries i it was all springs idea i knew nothing of it why i even pleaded with him i remember but it was too late dont you see pleaded he scoffed when did you ever plead for anything except your own miserable self what did you care if a white child was left to the mercy of that that gross black brute his eyes were darting about the room as he spoke and his hand was shaking on the desktop two years i endured there two years in that rotting jungle hell praying for death kicked and scourged and tortured by those animals aye you can stare in horror you that left me to it two years before i had the courage to run again and by gods grace was picked up by portugee slavers who carried me to the coast portugee scum mark you they saved me from the fate id been doomed to by fellow englishmen but id no hand in that i tell you it was no fault of mine by god it must have been frightful moran i dont wonder youre well upset perfectly appalling on my word but it was all charity springs doing dont you see im clean innocent you cant bear me a grudge for what that scoundrel did why hed kidnapped me in the first place springs long gone to his account says he and laughed harshly so have several others oh yes i marked you all down for settlement for a fleeting second he met my eye you remember sullivan the yankee bucko mate i got him in galveston in and the surgeon what was his name an irishman he went in bombay i took em as i found em you see and while i was making my own career in the indian army i often thought about you but i never had the chance till now there was a moments silence while i stood like a snared rabbit too stunned and scared to speak and he went on but youre too old to be worth killing flashman oh it would be easy enough youve seen me and you possibly know im rated the best biggame shot in india if not the world if general flashman were found with his head blown off on his leicestershire estate whod ever suspect the eminent and respectable colonel john sebastian moran he sneered and shook his head poor sport but little miss selina theres a worthwhile quarry if you like i saw how to strike at you the night i saw her at the theatre and you you foul old tyke can do nothing about it for if she shrinks from me at the last well young stangers name will be blasted and her hopes with it and yours a splendid scandal therell be he leaned against the mantel again his thumbs in his weskit and gloated at me either way youll pay for what you did to me personally i think the young lady will save her lovers honour at the expense of her own i hope so anyway but i dont much mind this was appalling for the fellow was mad i was sure eaten up with his hatred and lust for vengeance and he had marked down selly to strike at me and he was right shed sacrifice herself to shame to save stanger and if she didnt his life and hers would both be ruined i could have wept at the thought of her frail tender innocence at the mercy of this crazy murderous ogre i absolutely did weep begging him to accept any price offering to ransom her as high as twenty thousand or thirty promising to use my influence to obtain him patronage or a title literally pleading at the swines feet and drawing his attention to my white hairs and old age and he simply laughed at me so i raged at him threatening vowing id be his ruin somehow id kill him i said even if i swung for it and he just jeered in my face oh how i wish youd try how i would admire to see that go home and get your pistol and your black mask and collect a gang of bullies why dont you or cross the channel with me and well shoot it out on the sands i can just see that you pathetic old corpse in the end he kicked me out and i slunk off home in a rage of such fear and frustration and misery as ive seldom felt before i was helpless he couldnt be bought he couldnt be moved he couldnt be bullied or bluffed he was even invulnerable against the last resort of violence oh he might be near sixty but his hand was still rocksteady and his eye clear and even if there had been such a thing as a hired gun in the home counties what chance would he have stood against the lightning skill id seen proved on ketshwayos zulus no moran held all the aces and selina my precious little darling was doomed i went home and drank myself blind you may think for a man who puts a fairly low price on maiden virtue that i was getting into a rare sweat at the thought of her being deflowered by moran but your own flesh and blood is something different she wasnt like the women of my youth most of whom had been a pretty loose set anyway she was sweet and gentle and from a different stable altogether the thought of moran subjecting her brought me out in a sweat of horror damn stanger for his idiocy and damn gezo for not cutting morans whelp throat when he had the chance careless old swine but there was no use cursing i had to think and if necessary to act and after an unconscionable amount of drink and heartsearching i realised that i was going to have to kill moran maybe it was senile decay that brought me to this awful conclusion i dont know ive been desperately driven in my time and done some wild things coward and all that i am i can only say that it seemed worth the risk for selinas sake risk certainty where moran was concerned and yet need it be so certain granted he was the deadliest hand with a gun id ever seen he was bound to turn his back sometime and london wasnt zululand or abilene of the old days no one expects to be shot in the back on half moon street a man in disguise on a dark april night if he shadowed his victim carefully and bided his time might get off the necessary shots and then slide into cover our bobbies aint used to that sort of thing thank god it was desperate but it was possible id had more experience of skulking and shooting from cover than i cared to think of and but dear god i was an old man and getting feeble and halffuddled with drink and scared blue into the bargain i sat there maudlin drivelling to myself and looking at sellys picture then i put the bottle away and went upstairs and rooted through my old clothes and found myself opening a certain drawer there they were the old german revolver with which id shot my way out of fort raim dungeon the navy colt that id blazed away with eyes shut at gettysburg the khyber knife id got from ilderim khan in the mutiny the scarred old doubleaction bulldog and the neat little galand pocket pistol it had four rounds in it too confound it well if i ever summoned up the nerve to draw a bead on moran id sure as hell not have the chance to use more than four rounds hed be blasting back after just one happy thought though maybe he didnt travel heeled not many london clubmen do by jove if he was unarmed that would be famous and then a quick hobble round the corner into the dark why not it was at this point as i said at the beginning of my story that i decided murder is a chancy thing for a septuagenarian coward i teetered on the brink fearfully and then i thought what the devil even if palmer gets his old age pension bill through i still wont qualify because it specifically excludes drunkards from benefit sellys worth it says i snuffling to myself and so the die was cast once im committed i dont do things by halves i would have to settle the business at night in the best disguise i could find so i sorted out some of the motley garments id brought back from my travels and set about turning myself into an elderly downatheel of the kind that slinks round the west end streets picking up cigar butts and sleeping in areas it wasnt difficult in my time ive impersonated everything from a bronco apache to a prince consort and with my grey hairs i was halfway there so that was easy the next thing was to decide where i was going to drygulch moran i had a week at most at my disposal so for three or four nights i set off stealthily after dark dressed in an ancient pea jacket and patched unmentionables with a muffler and billycock hat and cracked boots galand in one pocket and flask in tother skulking round conduit street to see what his movements were i was in a putrid state of funk of course but even so i felt downright ridiculous hanging about waiting to murder someone at my time of life for two nights i never saw hide nor hair of him and then on the tuesday he broke cover shortly after six and i trailed him to a cab on bond street and lost him for i couldnt take a cab in pursuit dressed as i was any selfrespecting cabby would have taken his whip to me and if id tried to run after him id have been lying on the pavement wheezing my guts up inside ten yards so that was another wasted night but on the wednesday he decided to walk jauntering out of his rooms in full evening fig and strolling all the way to st jamess where he spent four hours at the bagatelle dealing em off the bottom no doubt then he took a cab home and i was dished again this was desperate i decided there hadnt been a chance so far to do him more mischief than curse and nights spent hanging around streetcorners had sapped my resolution abominably as well as giving me the cold i was having the deuce of a job getting in and out undetected at home too and to make matters worse i had a distraught selly on my hands on thursday morning wanting to know what was to be done shed had a note from the swine it simply said well m the poor creature was nearly distracted with fear and it was all i could do to stop her having hysterics which my wife would certainly have heard but one thing the sight of her distress did for me i resolved that if tiger jack moran was still alive on friday morning it wouldnt be for want of effort on my part if the worst came to the worst id stalk him home that thursday night and kill him on his own frontdoor step and take my chance i was late on my beat that night though on account of being dragooned into standing up with the connaughts at the armys football challenge match at aldershot in the afternoons two sets of hooligans hacking each other in the mud and it was near eight before i got on post in my rags huddled in a doorway nipping at my pint flask of spirits with a quaking heart but just on nine moran came out in opera hat and lined cloak swinging his long cane jauntily he strolled by within a yard of me for a moment the gaslight fell on that fierce hawk profile and sprouting moustache and i felt my innards turn to jelly and then he was past one odd thing i noticed under one arm he carried a flat case but i was too taken up with considering the loose fit stride of the man and the graceful way he carried himself he looked as dangerous as they come to worry about trifles i thought he might be for the clubs again but to my surprise he turned up oxford street sauntering calmly along and then made north i couldnt figure why he hadnt taken a cab as it was i had to move sharper than i cared to keep him in view and when we got off oxford street and people were scarcer i had to hang back for fear of being spotted hurrying to catch up whenever he rounded a corner this was new territory to me but i remember we had crossed wigmore street and then i stopped with my heart racing as he paused beside the entrance to a darkened arch and looked back he glanced up and down the street there was hardly a soul about and then he turned under the arch and disappeared meanwhile i was having minor fits i couldnt begin to guess what he was up to but i knew it was now or never i couldnt hope for a better chance than this in a network of streets which were as near to being deserted as central london ever is with my quarry moving down a dark alley i hurried forward as fast as i could reached the archway with my lungs bursting peered cautiously round the corner and was in time to see him entering a doorway under a single guttering gasflare at the other end i waited a few seconds and then stole forward the butt of the galand greasy with sweat in my hand i reached the doorway on tiptoe and paused it was open i strained my ears and heard his feet creaking on stairs up up up turn and up again i didnt hesitate i couldnt if i waited there was no certainty hed come out again this way and if i was to follow him i must do it while his own footsteps would drown out the sound of mine i took one last pull at my flask for luck and went through the door the light filtering in showed me the foot of the stairs and then i was sneaking up into the stuffy darkness gun out keeping close to the rickety banisters its a strange thing but however funky you may be and ill take on all comers in that line once youre moving theres a kind of controlled panic that guides your feet i went up those stairs like an elderly ghost holding my breath until i nearly burst and crouched on the first landing i heard his feet across the top landing and then recede as though hed gone into a room then silence that was the worst part up there on the top floor was not only as dangerous a man as id ever met but a tophole shikari a nightbird a trained and skilful hunter who could catch the sound of grass growing i felt the bile come up in my throat with fear but i was armed wasnt i and he probably wasnt and id been a pretty useful nightskulker in my time too id make no more noise going up than down and i thought of selina and went on up slow step after slow step until my head was on a level with the top landing i peeped over the top step and that was as far as flashy was going no error directly ahead of me was what seemed to be a closet with the door ajar and to its left was an open door through this i could see clear across a room to the window on the far side and there with the streetlight beating in on his crouching figure was tiger jack he was down on one knee peering through the glass and keeping himself to the side under cover he had put off his hat and his bald dome shone like a beacon it was only now with a queer shock of surprise that i found myself wondering what the devil he was about creeping into an empty house in the middle of the night and staring out of windows by god it was fishy and then as i watched i saw him fumble with the case hed been carrying pick up his cane and unscrew its top there was a scraping sound and then a soft snap he reached out and eased up the sash of the window and gently pushed something out through the gap and my bowels did a cartwheel as i saw that what his cane had become was the barrel of a rifle petrified i could only watch and then i saw that he was surveying a window on the other side of the street a lighted window with a mans silhouette clear on the blind moran gazed at it steadily he was watching for movement of course and then he brought his madeup rifle up to his shoulder with his right arm stretched out to the side as he flexed the fingers of his triggerhand suddenly i realised that this was the moment the moment that would never occur again i didnt know what the hell he was up to or who his mysterious victim might be any devilment was nuts to moran and it didnt matter a dam what did was that he was within twenty feet of me with his back turned and every nerve concentrated on his deadly task your bird old flash thinks i and i brought up the galand cocked it with the trigger back to make no sound rested my gunwrist on the top step and drew a dead bead on the back of that great bald head it isnt often that ive had cause to bless my trembling nerves or my unsteady boozers hand but by god they saved my neck then for even as moran brought his right hand to the stock of his rifle and settled into his aim my faltering triggerfinger got a fit of the shakes my aim wavered and i paused sweating and in that moment i learned that old as i was i was a better shikari than moran would ever be for in that seconds pause i realised something that he hadnt noticed i cant explain it call it sixth sense or a cowards instinct shaped and refined over a lifetime but in that second i realised that we were not alone there was someone else in the room with him to the left in the space hidden from me watching him and waiting i lay still as death my hair rising on my scalp and then as moran hung on his aim there was a plop like a cork exploding from a champagne bottle and a distant crash of glass i nearly had a seizure as a hidden voice bawled now and as moran swung from the window there was a scramble of feet and two dark shapes hurled themselves on him fists swinging like billyho and the three of them went down in a swearing yelling tangle there was a cry from the street and a piercing whistle from the room where moran was locked in combat with those two fine chaps and then more whistles shrilled from below there was the crash of a door being hurled back feet racing on the stairs and general sir harry flashman vc kb kcie was into that closet like an electrified stoat hauling the door to behind him and silently gulping another precious mouthful from his flask to prevent apoplexy it sounded like the household brigade coming up the stairs pounding past my hidingplace into the room where the others were still wrestling and cursing away thats it tiger thinks i kick the bastards shins and good luck to you then the sounds faded and i heard a murmur of voices too indistinct to be made out i didnt mind crouched in my cupboard with my heart clattering against my ribs but then curiosity got the better of me as usual and i pushed my door open a crack to listen a highpitched nasal voice was talking and sounding well pleased with itself who else did you suppose it was inspector well well permit me to introduce colonel john sebastian moran formerly of the indian army and the deadliest game shot in either hemisphere tiger jack as i believe he was once known but now himself bagged at last then moran broke in and he was cursing like a steamboat pilot with his toes in the mangle until an official voice told him to hold his tongue and after some more confused cussing and conversation which i didnt catch the highpitched chap was heard again i believe a comparison of the bullet fired tonight with that which was found in the body of ronald adair who was murdered last month will prove instructive inspector it will be for you to decide but it seems to me that a charge of murder must certainly lie i went giddy at the words and the rest of them were lost in the gurgling of my flask as i clapped it to my lips murder i could have danced and sung in my closet theyd got the old swine i didnt understand it of course or why he should have murdered the chap adair whose death had been all through the papers but what did it matter tiger jack was for the newgate polka by the sound of it and selly was saved for even if he tried to blacken young stanger now out of spite whod mind the yelping of a convicted felon and i was out from under too i broke into a cold sweat at the thought of how close id been to squeezing my trigger it could have been me that they were hauling downstairs now with the darbies on full steam for the condemned cell i almost cried from relief in that stuffy closet as i heard them clattering down and out to the black maria the street door slammed i listened but there wasnt a sound very cautiously i peeped out all was still as sleep so i tiptoed carefully down to the first landing and leaned on the banisters to still my racing heart and get my breath back selly was safe moran was scuppered and the creak of a door overhead gave me such a start i nearly pitched headlong into the stairwell dear god there was someone still up there but of course my dear fellow you shall hear all about it come along it was the highpitched voice again and at the sound of it i was scuttling frantically down the last flight into the lane and wheezing at high speed towards the arch when i came to a shuddering stop plumb ahead in the archway was the unmistakeable silhouette of a police constable feet planted guarding my only escape if id had the wind left id have squealed aloud then i saw his back was to me unsuspecting but behind me in the empty house voices were descending the stairs in two seconds theyd be in view and i was trapped helpless in the alleyway between them and the law i suppose if id had time for reflection i could have told myself that i was doing no wrong had committed no offence and could have faced anyone with a clean conscience aye but there was the pistol in my pocket and the likelihood that those interfering bobbies would have wanted to know who i was and what business i had there god what a todo there would be if it was discovered that the celebrated sir harry flashman was creeping about disguised as a scarecrow with a shooting iron in his pocket at the scene of an attempted murder how could i hope to explain avoid scandal oh anyway when you go about feeling as permanently guilty as i do you dont waste time over niceties at all costs i must avoid detection there was only one thing for it i was dressed like a soupkitchen derelict and in a twinkling i had poured the rest of my flask down my coatfront sprawled down against a convenient grating and was lying there wheezing like an intoxicated grampus trying to look like a stupefied downandout who has crept in to doss for the night when the footsteps turned out of the house and came towards me if theyve any sense theyll just pass by thinks i well dont you when you see some ragged bummaree sleeping it off in the gutter but no curse their nosiness they didnt the footsteps stopped beside me and i chanced a quick look at em through halfclosed lids a tall slim cove in a long coat bareheaded and balding and a big hulking chap with a bulldog moustache and hard hat they looked like a poet and a bailiff whats this says the bailiff stooping over me a tramp says the poet one of the flotsam escaping his misery in a few hours of drunken slumber think hes all right says the bailiff rot him and blow me if he wasnt fumbling for my pulse going at full gallop says he and blast his infernal impudence he put a hand on my brow my goodness but hes feverish dyou think we should get help for him youll get no thanks beyond a flood of curses if you do says the poet carelessly really doctor even without close examination my nose can tell me more than your fingers the fellow is hopelessly under the influence of drink and rather inferior drink at that i fancy says he stooping and sniffing at the fumes which were rising from my sodden breast yes american bourbon unless i am mistaken the odour is quite distinctive you may have remarked that to the trained senses each spirit has its own peculiar characteristics i believe i have in the past drawn your attention to the marked difference between the rich sugary aroma of rum and the more delicate sweet smell of gin says this amazing lunatic but what now the bailiff having taken his confounded liberties with my wrist and brow was pausing in the act of trying to lift one of my eyelids and his next words filled me with panic good lord he exclaimed i believe i know this chap but no it cant be surely only hes uncommonly like that old general oh whatshisname you know made such a hash of the khartoum business with gordon yes and years ago he won a great name in russia and the mutiny vc and knighthood its on the tip of my tongue my dear fellow says the highpitched poet i cant imagine who your general may be it can hardly be lord roberts i fancy but it seems likely that he would choose to sleep in his home or his club rather than in an alley besides he went on wearily stooping a little closer and damned unnerving it was to feel those two faces peering at me through the gloom while i tried to sham insensible besides this is a nautical not a military man he is not english but either american or german probably the latter since he has certainly studied at a secondrate german university but undoubtedly he has been in america quite lately he is known to the police is currently working as a ships steward or in some equally menial capacity at sea for i observe that he has declined even from his modest beginnings and will unless i am greatly mistaken be in hamburg by the beginning of next week provided he wakes up in time more than that says the knowall ignoramus i cannot tell you from a superficial examination except of course for the obvious fact that he found his way here via piccadilly circus well says the other doubtfully im sure youre right but he looks extremely like old whatshisname but how on earth can you tell so much about him from so brief a scrutiny you have not forgotten my methods since we last met surely says the conceited ass who i began to suspect was some kind of maniac very well apply them observe he went on impatiently that the man wears a peajacket with brass buttons which is seldom seen except on seafaring men add that to the patent fact that he is a german or germanamerican i dont see began the bailiff only to be swept aside the duelling scars doctor observe them quite plain close to the ears on either side hed sharp eyes all right to spot those a gift to me from otto bismarck years ago they are the unfailing trademark of the german student and since they have been inexpertly inflicted you will note that they are too high it is not too much to assume that he received them not at heidelberg or gottingen but at some less distinguished academy this suggests a middleclass beginning from which obviously he has descended to at least the fringes of crime how can you tell that the fine silver flask in his hand was not honestly acquired by such a seedy drunkard as this surely it is safe to deduce that its acquisition was only one of many petty pilferings some of which must inevitably have attracted the attention of the police of course well i should have noticed that but how can you say he is a ships steward or that he has been in america or that hes going to hamburg his appearance although dissipated is not entirely unredeemed some care has been taken with the moustache and whiskers no doubt to compensate for the ravages which drink and evil living have stamped on his countenance i could have struck the arrogant prying bastard but i grimly kept on playing possum again the hands are well kept and the nails so he is not a simple focsle hand what then but a steward the boots although cracked are of exceptionally good manufacture doubtless a gratuity from some firstclass passenger as to his american sojourn we have established that he drinks bourbon whisky a taste for which is seldom developed outside the united states furthermore since i noticed from the shipping lists this morning that the liner brunnhilde has arrived in london from new york and will leave on saturday for hamburg i think we may reasonably conclude bearing in mind the other points we have established that here we have one of her crew misspending his shore leave amazing cries the bailiff and of course quite simple when you explain it my dear fellow your uncanny powers have not deserted you in your absence i trust they are still equal at least to drawing such obvious inferences as these and now doctor i think we have spent long enough over this poor besotted hulk who i fear would have furnished more interesting material for the meeting of the inebriation society than for us i think you will admit that this pathetic shell has little in common with your distinguished indian general unhesitatingly cries the other oaf standing up and as they sauntered off leaving me quaking with relief and indignation drunken ships dogsbody from a secondrate german university indeed i heard him ask but how did you know he got here by way of piccadilly he reeked of bourbon whisky which is not easy to obtain outside the american bar and his condition suggested that he had filled his flask at least once since coming ashore i waited until the coast was clear and then creaked to my feet and hurried homeward stiff and sore and stinking of brandy and if my besotted shell was in poor shape my heart was rejoicing it had all come right for little selly and me and as i limped my way towards berkeley square i was in capital fettle i was even whistling to myself as i loitered past the end of hay hill and then my roving eye chanced to fall on a certain lighted window and i bore up short thinking hollo whats this for it was my window in the chambers of my salad days which as ive told you had placed at the convenience of the prince of wales for the entertainment of his secret gallops i remembered seeing in the mornings paper that he had been due at charing cross that evening from france by george thinks i the randy little pig cant wait for his english muttons for all that he must have been panting after half the skirt dancers of paris this month past no sooner home than hes in the saddle again i was shaking my head sadly over such scandalous conduct when along comes a cab round the corner from grafton street pulling up at the very door to my hay hill place it was pretty late by now and all quiet very discreet aha thinks i heres his little macaroon lets see who it is this time so that we can tattle at the club in the morning so i shuffled close just as a heavilyveiled lady got out without paying the cab which rattled off at once that proved it and as she crossed the pavement and passed into the entry i was abreast glancing in she pulled off her veil and shook her hair just as i passed and for a split second i saw her face before she hurried on and i staggered as though from a blow clutching the railings and sinking to the pavement for there was no mistaking it was my own granddaughter little selina ive been hit hard in my time but that nearly carried me off my own granddaughter going up to that potbellied satyr i sprawled there against the railings dumfounded selina the wideeyed tender innocent mistress to the revolting bertie no no it couldnt be why only that morning shed been pleading with me to save her from the embraces of moran shed seemed almost out of her wits by george though well she might be if she was the prince of waless secret pet she couldnt afford to compromise herself with halfpay adventurers like tiger jack not if she was to keep in favour with her royal lover and she couldnt be mixed up in scandals over her fiancйs pilfering regimental funds neither she had had to get moran silenced if she was to stay topsides with bertie no wonder shed wailed on my bosom the designing wicked little hussy and id been in a lather about her honour her honour my own granddaughter that of course was the point she was my granddaughter and whats bred in the bone oh but shed hocussed me properly playing shrinking purity and id been ready to shell out half my fortune and id come within an ace of committing murder for her that was the far outside of enough i stared up at that lighted window bursting with outrage and then for all my fury i found i was grinning and then laughing as i clung to the railings say what you like consider that sweet innocent buttermelting beauty and the mind behind it oh she was flashys little grandchild all right every inch of her wots all the row then says a voice and there was a burly bearded copper shining his bullseye on me yore tight says he no guvnor not a bit i wheezed just resting dont gimme none o your sauce says he this eres a respectable neighbourood the likes o you can do yer boozin some place else you follow nah then op it yuss guvnor says i just goin honnist orta know better a man yore age look at yerself proper disgrace you are dont you old rummies never learn no says i we never do and i set off under his disapproving eye across berkeley square notes paul kruger later president of the south african republic claimed that if lord chelmsford had taken his advice on zulu fighting isandhlwana need not have been lost oom paul spoke from experience he had himself been caught by the speed of a zulu attack and survived only after handtohand fighting inside his laager in fairness to chelmsford the failure to laager was colonel durnfords rider haggard who knew durnford well advances an interesting theory on his tactics in the tale of isandhlwana but agrees with kruger that laagering would have saved the day in connection with flashmans defence of the wagon with his revolvers it is interesting to note that one of the zulu warriors a son of chief sirayo later described how he had seen one of the british force a very tall man keeping up a spirited revolver fire from an empty wagon we all said what a very brave man he was he kept his ground for a very long time this admittedly does not sound like flashman and mackinnon and shadbolt in the south african campaign of are probably correct when they identify the hero as captain younghusband of the th regiment this was not the only incident of its kind at isandhlwana the editor is indebted to colonel john awdry of fovant for drawing his attention to the experience of general smithdorrien one of the survivors of the battle during the rout smithdorrien came on a man who had been kicked by his horse and could not mount smithdorrien helped him into the saddle and gave him a knife and the rider having promised to catch a horse for smithdorrien promptly fled from the battlefield if flashmans account of his own evasion were not so precise one would be tempted to identify him with smithdorriens fugitive the battle of isandhlwana was fought on january when british and native troops of lord chelmsfords force invading zululand were overwhelmed by warriors of the impis of king cetewayo what flashman was doing there is a mystery earlier in the present volume he refers to a visit paid to south africa in connection with a mine belonging to a relative of lady flashmans and there is evidence elsewhere that later he took part in an expedition through unexplored territory in the interior but how he came to be involved in chelmsfords operations is still unexplained usually in his memoirs he is careful to give full military and political background to his activities but in this case he treats isandhlwana and the equally famous defence of rorkes drift as mere incidents in his story and clarification must wait on further study of the flashman papers or possibly of dawns and departures of a soldiers life should the missing volumes of that work come to light there it may be will be found some account of the preliminaries to the zulu war the border friction between the transvaal dutch and cetewayos people britains annexation of the transvaal and failure to settle the border question the decision to send in chelmsfords three columns the establishment of the base at isandhlwana and chelmsfords departure thence with part of his force in the hope of gaining a quick victory over the zulu army while major pulleine was left to defend the isandhlwana camp only to be wiped out by a zulu attack which was entirely unexpected why flashman treats this notable imperial disaster and its sequel at rorkes drift so cursorily is plain enough his chief concern in this extract is to tell the story of his dealings with the notorious colonel john sebastian moran and he does not hesitate to pass by great events with little more than a glance thus his description of the isandhlwana fighting is sketchy and highly personal reading it one might suppose that hardly any time elapsed between the first appearance of the zulus and their final assault on the camp but in fact there was much intervening activity following lord chelmsfords departure at dawn various detachments had been sent out from pulleines camp under the isandhlwana hill as advance pickets and to deal with small groups of zulus who had appeared the largest of these detachments colonel durnfords encountered a powerful impi and was forced to beat a fighting retreat towards the camp where pulleine was already under attack how flashman came to be within earshot of pulleine and have a view of durnford whose retreat had begun some miles away one can only guess no doubt he moved at his customary high speed and it is likely that in his recollection of his panicstricken confusion he has unwittingly telescoped events and time his description of the battles climax accords with other accounts but he does not mention that the zulu advance was held up and badly mauled at various points before the final overrunning of the british position the encircling chest and horns tactic was entirely successful and those of pulleines force who escaped the main action were hunted down the ravine to fugitives drift on the buffalo river see rider haggards account written for andrew lang colenso and durnford history of the zulu war

to travel with chelmsfords force in zululand with the british an interesting memoir of zululand during the war is the journal of cornelius vjin a trader who was in zulu hands for much of the time cetshwayos dutchman flashman was right that the zulus would attack rorkes drift but wrong in supposing that they would invade natal isandhlwana had been the most disastrous battle defeat suffered by british troops against native forces in the nineteenth century although it was to be matched by the wipeout of a brigade by afghan tribesmen at maiwand a year later but it had been a costly victory for the zulus who were finally beaten at ulundi in july for interesting information on zulu superstitions see frazers golden bough in fact moran was somewhat out of date the practice of sending twins first in battle appears to have died out earlier in the century in king chakas time the pursuing zulus were certainly soldiers of the udloko regiment part of the undi corps who formed the right wing of the impis at isandhlwana their red and white shields were distinctive the martinihenry was a singleshot weapon but a good rifleman could fire six rounds in half a minute the siege of the little buffalo river station at rorkes drift began only a few hours after isandhlwana and lasted through the night until the following morning the garrison was about strong and was commanded by lieutenant john chard of the royal engineers and lieutenant gonville bromhead of the th regiment largely recruited in wales and later renamed the south wales borderers the attacking zulu force consisting of the udloko tulwana and ndluyengwe regiments was at least strong both sides fought with the utmost bravery from late afternoon until the climax of the battle at midnight the zulus trying to break into the perimeter hastily improvised of mealiebags and biscuit boxes and being met by the volleys of the defenders martinihenrys savage closequarter fighting took place at the barricades and in the hospital which caught fire at about six oclock when the wounded had to be evacuated by midnight the perimeter had shrunk to sixtyfive yards in front of the storehouse following as it did on the disaster of isandhlwana the defence of rorkes drift became deservedly a victorian legend seventeen of the defenders died and at least zulus eleven victoria crosses were awarded flashmans account makes it clear that he and moran must have reached the drift about or eight or nine oclock while the hospital was still burning and entered the perimeter after jumping the stone wall and the mealiebag barricade which had been built to defend the hospital at the western end of the post the huge cove with the red beard was presumably chaplain george smith but flashman is probably mistaken in describing him as pistolling since the chaplain was foremost in the vital work of carrying ammunition the times of monday february carried under the name macmillan a notice of the birth of a boy the previous saturday

march elspeths serial may have been under the red robe by stanley j weyman which appeared in instalments in the illustrated london news early in this year elsewhere in his memoirs flashman has suggested that sullivan was killed by charity spring aboard the balliol college slaveship in during a fight with an american warship presumably the mate was only badly wounded and recovered to fall a victim to moran twenty years later flashman made reluctant use of an astonishing variety of weaponry during his adventurous life but although he makes frequent references to adams revolvers there is no evidence that he had any particularly favourite sidearm those listed here appear to have been kept for sentimental rather than for practical reasons the most interesting item is the scarred old doubleaction bulldog since it was just such a weapon that he used at little big horn he had borrowed it from custer himself and may even have accidentally shot the general with it in the heat of battle but that gun he flung away in panic and the mystery remains how did he acquire another like it only two of flashmans sidearms appear to have survived his khyber knife bequeathed to mr paget

old age pension proposals of did in fact exclude anyone convicted of a crime in the previous fifteen years or of drunkenness in the previous ten in the army cup final played on april the black watch beat the royal artillery the duchess of connaught apparently supported by general flashman presented the cup apart from a few minor discrepancies flashmans account of colonel morans movements and arrest on that thursday night corroborates the celebrated narrative of dr watson who has described the colonels capture in the adventure of the empty house it will be remembered that moran was apprehended by holmes and watson in the act of trying to murder the former morans motive was revenge flashman of course had no inkling of all this at the time as his story shows he was not to know that moran after retiring from the indian army had turned his uncanny marksmanship to account by becoming a professional assassin in the employ of holmess archenemy professor moriarty or that the colonel eked out his contract fees by cardsharping as in the case of stanger and adair after his arrest by holmes and watson moran was charged with the adair murder but presumably escaped the gallows since dr watson was still referring to him as living in and even suggested that he was alive in the main discrepancy between the watson and flashman versions is interesting rather than important watson says that moran fired from the ground floor of the empty house while flashman places him in an upper storey the error is probably watsons there has been much controversy among baker street addicts about angles of fire the laws of optics parabolas etc but to a rifleman it is obvious that moran would have preferred a direct horizontal shot to an upward one and this seems to have been the opinion of the artists who illustrated watsons account the celebrated sidney paget in the strand magazine of october shows moran looking straight across from his window and the drawing of the american illustrator joseph camana in has both marksman and target on the same level both watson and flashman are mistaken about morans age watson says he was born in flashman by stating that moran was fifteen years his junior implies that the date was but since moran himself states that he was fourteen in we must accept that he was born in which is in keeping with watsons description of him as elderly and a fierce old man in
