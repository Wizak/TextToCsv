servant of the runestaff book one chapter one count brass then the earth grew old its landscapes mellowing and showing signs of age its ways becoming whim sical and strange in the manner of a man in his last years the high history of the runestaff count brass lord guardian of the kamarg rode out on a horned horse one morning to inspect his territories he rode until he came to a little hill on the top of which stood a ruin of immense age it was the ruin of a gothic church and its walls of thick stone were smooth with the passing of winds and rains ivy clad much of it and the ivy was of the flowering sort so that at this season purple and amber blossoms filled the dark windows an excellent substitute for the stained glass that had once decorated them on his rides count brass always came to the ruin he felt a kind of fellowship with it for like him it was old like him it had survived much turmoil and like him it seemed to have been strengthened rather than weakened by the ravages of time the hill on which the ruin stood was a waving sea of tall tough grass moved by the wind the hill was surrounded by the rich seemingly infinite marshlands of the kamarga lonely landscape populated by wild white bulls herds of horn ed horses and the giant scarlet flamingoes so large that they could easily lift a grown man the sky was a light gray carrying rain and from it shone sunlight of watery gold touching the counts armor of bur nished brass and making it glow like flame the count wore a huge broadsword at his hip and a plain helmet also of brass was on his head his whole body was sheathed in heavy brass and even his gloves and boots were of brass links sewn upon leather the counts body was broad sturdy and tall and he had a great strong head on his shoulders with a tanned face that might also have been molded of brass from this head stared two steady eyes of golden brown his heavy mustache was red as was his hair in the kamarg as well as beyond it it was not unusual to hear the legend that the count was in fact not a true man at all but a living statue in brass a titan invincible indestructible immortal but those who knew count brass well enough knew that he was a man in every sense a loyal friend a terrible foe given much to laughter yet capable of ferocious anger a drinker of enormous capacity a trencherman of not indiscriminate tastes a wit a swordsman and a horseman without par a sage in the ways of men and history a lover at once tender and savage count brass with his rolling warm voice and his rich vitality could not help but be a legend for if the man was exceptional then so were his deeds count brass stroked the head of his horse rubbing his gauntlet between the sharp spiral horns of the animal and looking to the south where the sea and sky met far away the horse grunted with pleasure and count brass smiled leaned back in his saddle and flicked the reins to make the horse de scend the hill and head along the secret marsh path that led toward the northern towers beyond the horizon the sky was darkening when he reached the first tower and saw its guardian an armored silhouette against the skyline keeping his vigil though no attack had been made on the kamarg since count brass had come to replace the former corrupt lord guardian there was now a slight danger that roaming armies made up of those whom the dark empire of the west had defeated might wander into the domain looking for towns and villages to loot the guardian like all his fel lows was equipped with a flamelance of baroque design a sword four feet long a tamed riding flamingo tethered to one side of the battlements and a heliograph device to signal in formation to the other towers there were other weapons in the towers weapons the count himself had built and in stalled but the guardians knew only their method of opera tion they had never seen them in action count brass had assured them that they were more powerful than any weapons possessed even by the dark empire of granbretan and they believed him though they were still a little wary of the strange machines the guardian turned as count brass approached the tower the mans face was almost hidden by his black iron helmet which curved around his cheeks and over his nose his body was swathed in a heavy leather cloak he saluted raising his arm high count brass raised his own arm is all well guardian all well my lord the guardian shifted his grip on his flamelance and turned up the cowl of his cloak as the first drops of rain began to fall save for the weather count brass laughed wait for the mistral and then com plain he guided his horse away from the tower making for the next the mistral was the cold fierce wind that whipped across the kamarg for months on end its wild keening a continuous sound until spring count brass loved to ride through it when it was at its height the force of it lashing at his face and turn ing his bronze tan to a glowing red now the rain splashed down on his armor and he reached behind his saddle for his cloak tugging it about his shoulders and raising the hood everywhere through the darkening day the reeds bent in the breezeborne rain and there was a con stant patter of water on water as the heavy drops splashed into the lagoons sending out ceaseless ripples above the clouds banked blacker threatening to release a goodsized weight of water and count brass decided he would forego the rest of his inspection until the next day and instead return to his castle at aiguesmortes a good four hours ride through the twisting marsh paths he sent the horse back the way they had come knowing that the beast would find the path by instinct as he rode the rain fell faster making his cloak sodden and the night closed in rapidly until all that could be seen was the solid wall of blackness broken only by the silver traceries of rain the horse moved more slowly but did not pause count brass could smell its wet hide and promised it special treatment by the grooms when they reached aiguesmortes he brushed water from its mane with his gloved hand and tried to peer ahead but he could see only the reeds immediately around him hear only the occasional maniacal cackle of a mallard flapping across a lagoon pursued by a waterfox or an otter some times he thought he saw a dark shape overhead and felt the swish of a swooping flamingo making for its communal nest or recognised the squawk of a moorhen battling for its life with an owl once he caught a flash of white in the darkness and listened to the blundering passage of a nearby herd of white bulls as they made for firmer land to sleep and he no ticed the sound a little later of a marshbear stalking the herd his breath whiffling and his feet making the slightest sound as he carefully padded across the quaking surface of the mud all these sounds were familiar to count brass and did not alarm him even when he heard the highpitched whinny of frightened horses and heard their hoofbeats in the distance he was not unduly perturbed until his own horse stopped dead and moved uncertainly the horses were coming directly toward him charging down the narrow causeway in panic now count brass could see the leading stallion his eyes rolling in fear his nostrils flaring and snorting count brass yelled and waved his arms hoping to divert the stallion but it was plainly too panicstricken to heed him there was nothing else to do count brass yanked at the reins of his mount and sent it into the marsh hoping desperately that the ground would be firm enough to hold them at least until the herd had passed the horse stumbled into the reeds its hooves seeking purchase in the soft mud then it had plun ged into water and count brass saw spray fly and felt a wave hit his face and the horse was swimming as best it could through the cold lagoon bravely carrying its armored burden the herd had soon thundered past count brass puzzled over what had panicked them so for the wild horned horses of the kamarg were not easily disturbed then as he guided his horse back toward the path there came a sound that im mediately explained the commotion and sent his hand to the hilt of his sword it was a slithering sound a slobbering sound the sound of a baragoon the marsh gibberer few of the monsters were left now they had been the creations of the former guardian who had used them to terrorize the people of the kamarg before count brass came count brass and his men had all but destroyed the race but those which remained had learned to hunt by night and avoid large numbers of men at all costs the baragoons had once been men themselves before they had been taken as slaves to the former guardians sorcerous laboratories and there transformed now they were mon sters eight feet high and some five feet broad bilecolored and slithering on their bellies through the marshlands rising only to leap upon and rend their prey with their steelhard talons when they did on occasion have the good fortune to find a man alone they would take slow vengeance delighting in eat ing a mans limbs before his own eyes as his horse regained the marsh path count brass saw the the baragoon ahead smelled its stench and coughed on the odor his huge broadsword was now in his hand the baragoon had heard him and paused count brass dismounted and stood between his horse and the monster he gripped his broadsword in both hands and began to walk stifflegged in his armor of brass toward the baragoon instantly it began to gibber in a shrill repulsive voice rais ing itself up and flailing with its talons in an effort to terrify the count but to count brass the apparition was not unduly horrific he had seen much worse in his time however he knew that his chances against the beast were slim since the baragoon could see in the dark and the marsh was its natural environment count brass would have to use cunning well you illsmelling foulness he began in an almost jocular tone i am count brass the enemy of your race it was i who destroyed your evil kin and it is thanks to me that you have so few brothers and sisters these days do you miss them would you join them the baragoons gibbering shout of rage was loud but not without a hint of uncertainty it shuffled its bulk but did not move toward the count count brass laughed well cowardly creation of sorcery whats your answer the monster opened its mouth and tried to frame a few words with its misshapen lips but little emerged that could be recognized as human speech its eyes now did not meet count brasss with every appearance of casualness count brass dug his great sword into the ground and rested his gauntleted hands upon the crosspiece i see you are ashamed of terrorizing the horses i protect and i am in good humor so i will pity you go now and ill let you live a few more days stay and you die this hour he spoke with such assurance that the beast dropped back to the ground though it did not retreat the count lifted up his sword as if with impatience and began to walk decisively forward he wrinkled his nose against the stench of the mon ster paused and waved the thing away from him into the swamp into the slime where you belong i am in a merciful mood tonight the baragoons wet mouth snarled but he still hesitated count brass frowned a little judging his moment for he had known the baragoon would not retreat so easily he lifted his sword will this be your fate the baragoon began to rise on its hind legs but count brasss timing was exactly right he was already swinging the heavy blade into the monsters neck the thing struck out with both taloned hands its gib bering cry a mixture of hatred and terror there was a metallic squeal as the talons scored gashes in the counts armor sending him staggering backward the monsters mouth open ed and closed an inch from the counts face its huge black eyes seeming to consume him with their rage as he staggered he tugged his sword with him it came free he regained his footing and struck again black blood pumped from the wound drenching the count there was another terrible cry from the beast and its hands went to its head trying desperately to hold it in place then the baragoons head flopped half off its shoulders blood pumped again and the body fell count brass stood stock still panting heavily a look of grim satisfaction upon his face he wiped the creatures blood fastidiously from his face smoothed his heavy mustache with the back of his hand and congratulated himself that he appeared to have lost none of his guile or his skill he had planned every moment of the encounter intending from the first to kill the creature he had kept the baragoon bewildered until he could strike he saw no wrong in deceiving the thing if he had given the monster a fair fight it was likely that he and not the baragoon would now be lying headless in the mud count brass took a deep breath of the cold air and moved forward with some effort he managed to push the dead bara goon off the path with his booted foot sending it slithering into the marsh then count brass remounted his horned horse and rode back to aiguesmortes without further incident chapter two yisselda and bowgentle count brass had led armies in almost every famous battle of his day he had been the power behind the thrones of half the rulers of europe a maker and a destroyer of kings and princes he was a master of intrigue a man whose advice was sought in any affair involving political struggle he had been in truth a mercenary but he had been a mercenary with an ideal and the ideal had been to set the continent of europe toward unification and peace thus he had from pre ference leagued himself with any force he judged capable of making some contribution to this cause many a time he had refused the offer to rule an empire knowing that this was an age when a man could make an empire in five years and lose it in six months for history was still in a state of flux and would not settle in the counts lifetime he sought only to guide history a little in the course he thought best tiring of wars of intrigue and even to some extent of ideals the old hero had eventually accepted the offer of the people of the kamarg to become their lord guardian that ancient land of marshes and lagoons lay close to the coast of the mediterranean it had once been part of the nation called france but france was now two dozen duke doms with as many grandiose names the kamarg with its wide faded skies of orange yellow red and purple its relics of the dim past its barely changing customs and rituals had appealed to the old count and he had set himself the task of making his adopted land secure in his travels in all the courts of europe he had discovered many secrets and thus the great gloomy towers that ringed the borders of the kamarg now protected the territory with more potent lessrecognizable weaponry than broadswords or flamelances on the southern borders the marshes gradually gave way to sea and sometimes ships stopped at the little ports though travelers rarely disembarked this was because of the kam args terrain the wild landscapes were treacherous to those not familiar with them and the marsh roads were hard to find also mountain ranges flanked its three sides on land the man wishing to head inland disembarked farther east and took a boat up the rhone so the kamarg received little news from the outside world and what it did receive was usually stale this was one of the reasons why count brass had settled there he enjoyed the sense of isolation he had been too long involved with worldly affairs for even the most sensational news to interest him much in his youth he had commanded armies in the wars that constantly raged across europe now however he was tired of all conflict and refused all requests for aid or advice that reached him no matter what induce ment was offered in the west lay the island empire of granbretan the only nation with any real political stability with her halfinsane science and her ambitions of conquest having built the tall curved bridge of silver that spanned thirty miles of sea the empire was bent on increasing her territories by means of her black wisdom and her war machines like the brazen ornithop ters that had a range of more than a hundred miles but even the encroachment of the dark empire into the mainland of europe did not greatly disturb count brass it was a law of history he believed that such things must happen and he saw the ultimate benefits that could result from a force no matter how cruel capable of uniting all the warring states into one nation count brasss philosophy was the philosophy of experience the philosophy of a man of the world rather than a scholar and he saw no reason to doubt it while the kamarg his sole responsibility was strong enough to resist even the full might of granbretan having nothing himself to fear from granbretan he watched with a certain remote admiration the cruel and effi cient manner in which the nation spread her shadow farther and farther across europe with every year that passed across scandia and all the nations of the north the shadow fell along a line marked by famous cities parye munchein wien krahkov kerninsburg itself a foothold in the myste rious land of muskovia a great semicircle of power in the main continental land mass a semicircle that grew wider almost every day and must soon touch the northernmost princedoms of italia magyaria and slavia soon count brass guessed the dark empires power would stretch from the norwegian sea to the mediterranean and only the kamarg would not be under its sway it was partly with this knowledge in mind that he had accepted the lord guardianship of the territory when its previous guardian a corrupt and spurious sorcerer from the land of the bulgars had been torn to pieces by the native guardians whom he had commanded count brass had made the kamarg secure from attack from outside and from menace from within there were few bara goons left to terrorize the people of the many small villages and other terrors had been dealt with also now the count dwelt in his warm castle at aiguesmortes enjoying the simple rural pleasures of the land while the people were for the first time in many years free from anx iety the castle known as castle brass had been built some centuries before on what had then been an artificial pyramid rising high above the center of the town but now the pyramid was hidden by earth in which had been planted grass and gardens for flowers vines and vegetables in a series of ter races here there were wellkept lawns on which the children of the castle could play or adults stroll there were the grape vines that gave the best wine in the kamarg and farther down grew rows of harricots and patches of potatoes cauliflowers carrots lettuce and many other common vegetables as well as more exotic ones like the giant pumpkintomatoes celery trees and sweet ambrogines there were also fruit trees and bushes that supplied the castle through most of the seasons the castle was built of the same white stone as the houses of the town it had windows of thick glass much of it painted fancifully and ornate towers and battlements of delicate workmanship from its highest turrets it was possible to see most of the territory it protected and it was so designed that when the mistral came an arrangement of vents pulleys and little doors could be operated and the castle would sing so that its music like that of an organ could be heard for miles on the wind the castle looked down on the red roofs of the town and at the bullring beyond which had originally been built it was said many thousands of years ago by the romanians count brass rode his weary horse up the winding road to the castle and hallooed to the guards to open the gate the rain was easing off but the night was cold and the count was eager to reach his fireside he rode through the great iron gates and into the courtyard where a groom took his horse then he plodded up the steps through the doors of the castle down a short passage and into the main hall there a huge fire roared in the grate and beside it in deep padded armchairs sat his daughter yisselda and his old friend bowgentle they rose as he entered and yisselda stood on tiptoe to kiss his cheek while bowgentle stood by smiling you look as if you could do with some hot food and a change into something warmer than armor said bowgentle tugging at a bellrope ill see to it count brass nodded gratefully and went to stand by the fire tugging off his helmet and placing it with a clank on the man tel yisselda was already kneeling at his feet tugging at the straps of his greaves she was a beautiful girl of nineteen with soft rosegold skin and fair hair that was not quite blonde and not quite auburn but of a color lovelier than both she was dressed in a flowing gown of flameorange that made her resemble a fire sprite as she moved with graceful swiftness to carry the greaves to the servant who now stood by with a change of clothes for her father another servant helped count brass shed his breastplate backplate and other parts of his armor and soon he was pulling on soft loose trousers and shirt of white wool and wrapping a linen gown over that a small table heavy with steaks of local beef potatoes salad and a delicious thick sauce was brought up to the fire together with a flagon of mulled wine count brass sat down with a sigh and began to eat bowgentle stood by the fire watching him while yisselda curled up in the chair opposite and waited until he had taken the edge off his appetite well my lord said she with a smile how went the day is all our land secure count brass nodded with mock gravity it would seem so my lady though i was not able to visit any of the northern towers but one the rain came on and i decided to return home he told them about his encounter with the baragoon yisselda listened with wide eyes while bowgentle looked some what grave his kind ascetic face bowed and his lips pursed the famous philosopherpoet was not always approv ing of his friends exploits and seemed to think that count brass brought such adventures upon himself youll recollect said bowgentle when the count had finished that i advised you this morning to travel with von villach and some of the others von villach was the counts chief lieutenant a loyal old soldier who had been with him through most of his earlier exploits count brass laughed up at his dourfaced friend von villach hes getting old and slow and it would not be a kindness to take him out in this weather bowgentle smiled a little bleakly hes a year or two younger than yourself count possibly but could he defeat a baragoon singlehanded that is not the point bowgentle continued firmly if you traveled with him and a party of menatarms you would not need to encounter a baragoon at all count brass waved a hand dismissing the discussion i have to keep in practice otherwise i might become as mori bund as von villach you have a responsibility to the people here father yisselda put in quietly if you were killed i shall not be killed the count smiled scornfully as if death were something that only others suffered in the fire light his head resembled the war mask of some ancient barbar ian tribe cast in metal and it did seem in some way imperish able yisselda shrugged she had most of her fathers qualities of character including the conviction that there was little point indulging in arguments with such stubborn folk as count brass bowgentle had once written of her in a private poem she is like silk both strong and soft and looking at them now he noticed with quiet affection how the expression of one was reflected in the other bowgentle changed the subject i heard today that gran bretan took the province of koln not six months past he said their conquests spread like a plague a healthy enough plague count brass replied settling back in his chair at least they establish order political order perhaps bowgentle said with some fire but scarcely spiritual or moral their cruelty is without precedent they are insane their souls are sick with a love for all that is evil and a hatred for all that is noble count brass stroked his mustache such wickedness has existed before why the bulgar sorcerer who preceded me here was quite as evil as they the bulgar was an individual so were the marquis of pesht roldar nikolayeff and their kind but they were ex ceptions and in almost every case the people they led revolted against them and destroyed them in time but the dark empire is a nation of such individuals and such actions as they commit are seen as natural in koln their sport was to crucify every girlchild in the city make eunuchs of the boys and have all the adults who would save their lives perform lewd displays in the streets that is no natural cruelty count and was by no means their worst their entertainment is to debase all humanity such stories are exaggerated my friend you should realize that why i myself have been accused of from all i hear bowgentle interrupted the rumors are not an exaggeration of the truth but a simplification if their public activities are so terrible what must their private de lights be like yisselda shuddered i cant bear to think exactly bowgentle said turning to face her and few can bear to repeat what they have witnessed the order they bring is superficial the chaos they bring destroys mens souls count brass shrugged his broad shoulders whatever they do it is a temporary thing the unification they force on the world is permanent mark my words bowgentle folded his arms across his blackclad chest the price is too heavy count brass no price is too heavy what will you have the prince doms of europe dividing into smaller and smaller segments war a constant factor in the life of the common man today few men can ever know peace of mind from cradle to grave things change and change again at least granbretan offers consistency and terror i cannot agree with you my mend count brass poured himself a goblet of wine drank it down and yawned a little you take these immediate events too seriously bowgentle if you had had my experience you would realize that all such evil soon passes either from bore dom in those concerned or else it is destroyed by others in some way a hundred years will see granbretan a most up right and moral nation count brass winked at his daughter but she did not smile in return seeming to agree with bow gentle their sickness is too ingrained for a hundred years to cure it that can be told from their appearance alone those jeweled beast masks that they never doff those grotesque clothes they wear in even the most extreme heat their stance their way of moving all these things show them to be what they are they are insane by heredity and their progeny will inherit that insanity bowgentle struck his hand against a mantel pillar our passivity is acquiescence in their deeds we should count brass rose from his chair we should go to our beds and sleep my friend tomorrow we must appear at the bull ring for the beginning of the festivities he nodded to bowgentle kissed his daughter lightly on the forehead and left the hall chapter three baron meliadus at this season the people of the kamarg began their great festival the summers work being over flowers cov ered the houses the people wore clothes of richly embroidered silk and linen young bulls charged through the streets at will and the guardians paraded in all their martial finery in the afternoons the bull contests took place in the ancient stone amphitheatre on the edge of the town the seats of the amphitheater were of granite arranged in tiers close to the steep wall of the ring itself on the south side was a covered area consisting of carved pillars and a red slate roof this was hung with curtains of dark brown and scarlet within it sat count brass his daughter yisselda bowgentle and old von villach from their box count brass and his companions could see almost the whole of the amphitheater as it began to fill could hear the excited conversation and the thumps and snorts of the bulls behind the barricades soon a fanfare sounded from the group of six guardians in plumed helmets and skyblue cloaks on the far side of the amphitheater their bronze trumpets echoed the noise of the bulls and the cheering crowd count brass stepped forward the cheering grew louder as he appeared smiling to the crowd and raising his hand in greeting when the din had quieted he began the traditional speech that would open the festival ancient people of the kamarg who were preserved by fate from the blight of the tragic millennium you who were given life celebrate life today you whose ancestors were saved by the fierce mistral that cleansed the skies of the poisons that brought others death and malformation give thanks in this festival for the coming of the life wind again the cheering broke out and the fanfare blew for a second time then into the ring broke twelve huge bulls they stampeded round and round the arena tails high horns gleaming nostrils dilated and red eyes shining these were the prime fighting bulls of the kamarg trained the year through for their performance today when they would be matched against unarmed men who would try to snatch the several garlands that had been wound around their throats and horns next mounted guardians galloped out waving to the crowd and herded the bulls back into the enclosure under the am phitheater when with some difficulty the guardians had got every bull into the enclosure out rode the master of ceremonies clad in a rainbow cloak broadbrimmed hat of bright blue and a golden megaphone through which he would announce the first contest amplified by both the megaphone and the walls of the amphitheater the mans voice almost resembled the great roar of an angry bull he announced first the name of the bull cornerouge of aiguesmortes owned by pons yachar the famous bull breeder and then the name of the principal toreador mahtan just of aries the master of ceremonies wheeled his horse about and disappeared almost at once cornerouge appeared from below the amphitheater his huge horns digging at the air the scarlet ribbons that decorated them flying in the strong breeze cornerouge was a huge bull standing over five feet high his tail lashed from side to side like a lions his red eyes glared at the shouting crowd that honored him flowers were thrown into the ring and fell on his broad white back he turned swiftly pawing at the dust of the arena trampling the flowers then lightly unostentatiously a slight stocky figure ap peared dressed in a black cloak lined with scarlet silk tight black doublet and trousers decorated with gold kneehigh boots of black leather embellished with silver his face was swarthy young alert he doffed his widebrimmed hat to the crowd pirouetted and faced cornerouge though barely twenty mahtan just had already distinguished himself in three previous festivals now the women threw flowers and he gallantly acknowledged them blowing kisses as he advanced toward the snorting bull and drew off his cloak in a graceful movement displaying the red lining to cornerouge who took a few dancing steps forward snorted again and lowered his horns the bull charged mahtan just stepped aside and one hand reached out to pluck a ribbon from cornerouges horn the crowd cheered and stamped the bull turned speedily and charged again again just stepped aside at the last possible moment and again he plucked a ribbon he held both trophies in his white teeth and he grinned first at the bull then at the crowd the first two ribbons high on the bulls horns were com paratively easy to win and just knowing this had won them almost casually now the lower ribbons must be taken from the horns and this was much more dangerous count brass leaned forward in his box staring admiringly at the toreador yisselda smiled isnt he wonderful father like a dancer aye dancing with death bowgentle said with what amounted to selfmocking severity old von villach leaned back in his seat appearing bored with the spectacle it might simply have been that his eyes were not what they had once been and he did not want to admit it now the bull was stampeding straight at mahtan just who stood in its path with his hands on his hips his cloak dropped in the dust as the bull was almost upon him just leaped high into the air his body grazing the horns and somersaulted over cornerouge who dug his hooves into the dust and snorted in puzzlement before turning his head at justs laughing shout from behind him but before the bull could turn his body just had jumped again this time onto the back and as the bull bucked madly beneath him turned his attention to hanging on to one horn and disentangling a ribbon from the other just was soon dis lodged flung down to the ground but he displayed another ribbon in his waving hand rolled over and just managed to get to his feet as the bull charged at him a tremendous noise broke out from the crowd as it clapped shouted and flung a veritable ocean of bright blooms into the ring just was now running lightly around the arena pursued by the bull he paused as if in deliberation turned gradually on his heel and seemed surprised to see the bull almost upon him now just jumped again but a horn caught his coat and ripped it sending him off balance one hand came down on the bulls back and he vaulted to the ground but fell badly and rolled as the bull charged just scrambled away still in control of himself but unable to rise the bulls head dipped a horn lashed at the body droplets of blood sparkled in the sunlight and the crowd moaned with a mixture of pity and bloodlust father yisseldas hand gripped count brasss arm hell be killed help him count brass shook his head although his body had moved involuntarily toward the ring it is his own affair it is what he risks justs body was now tossed high into the air arms and legs loose like a rag dolls into the ring came the mounted guard ians with long lances to goad the bull away from his victim but the bull refused to move standing over justs still body as a predatory cat might stand over the body of its prey count brass leaped over the side of the ring almost before he realized what he was doing he ran forward in his armor of brass ran at the bull like a metal giant the riders pulled their horses aside as count brass flung his body at the bulls head grasping the horns in his great hands veins stood out on his ruddy face as he pushed the bull gradually back then the head moved and count brasss feet left the ground but his hands kept their grip and he shifted his weight to one side bearing the bulls head back so that gradually it seemed to bow there was silence everywhere from the box yisselda bowgentle and von villach leaned forward their faces pale all in the amphitheater were tense as count brass slowly exerted his strength cornerouges knees shook he snorted and bellowed and his body bucked but count brass shaking with the effort of holding the horns did not relent his mustache and hair seemed to bristle the muscles on his neck bulged and turned red but gradually the bull weakened and then slowly it fell to its knees men ran forward to drag the wounded just from the ring but still the crowd was silent then with a great wrench count brass flung cornerouge over on his side the bull lay still acknowledging its master acknowledging that it was without question beaten count brass stepped back and the bull did not move simply looked up at him through glazed puzzled eyes its tail shifting slightly in the dust its huge chest rising and falling now the cheering began now the cheering rose in volume so that it seemed the whole world would hear it now the crowd rose to its feet and hailed their lord guardian with unprecedented acclaim as mahtan just stag gered forward clutching at his wound and gripped count brasss arm for a moment in gratitude and in the box yisselda wept with pride and relief and unabashed bowgentle wiped tears from his own eyes only von villach did not weep but his head nodded in grim appro val of his masters feat count brass walked back toward the box smiling up at his daughter and his friends he gripped the wall and hauled himself back to his place he laughed with rich enjoyment and waved at the crowd as they cheered him then he raised his hand and addressed them as the cheering died do not give me the ovation give it to mahtan just he won the trophies see he opened his palms and displayed themi have nothing there was laughter let the festival continue count brass sat down bowgentle had recovered his composure he leaned toward count brass so my friend do you still say you prefer to remain uninvolved in the struggle of others count brass smiled at him you are indefatigable bow gentle this surely was a local affair was it not if your dreams of a united continent are still with you then the affairs of europe are local affairs bowgentle stroked his chin are they not count brasss expression became serious for an instant perhaps he began but then shook his head and laughed oh insidious bowgentle you still manage to con found me from time to time but later when they left the box and made their way back to the castle count brass was frowning as count brass and his retinue rode into the castle court yard a manatarms ran forward his pointing arm indicating an ornate carriage and a group of black plumed stallions with saddles of unfamiliar workmanship which the grooms were at that moment removing sire the manatarms breathed there have come visi tors to our castle while you were at the arena noble visitors though i know not if youll welcome them count brass looked hard at the carriage it was of beaten metal of dark gold steel and copper inlaid with motherof pearl silver and onyx it was fashioned to resemble the body of a grotesque beast with its legs extending into claws which clutched the wheel shafts its head was reptilian with ruby eyes hollowed out from above to form a seat for the coach man on the doors was an elaborate coat of arms displaying many quarterings in which were strangelooking animals weapons and symbols of an obscure but disturbing nature count brass recognized the design of the carriage and the coat of arms the first was the workmanship of the mad smiths of granbretan the second was the coat of arms of one of that nations most powerful and infamous nobles it is baron meliadus of kroiden count brass said as he dismounted what business could bring such a great lord to our little rural province he spoke with some irony but he seemed disturbed he glanced at bowgentle as the philosopher poet came and stood beside him we will treat him courteously bowgentle said the count warningly we will show him all castle brasss hospitality we have no quarrel with the lords of granbretan not at this moment perhaps said bowgentle speaking with evident restraint with yisselda and von villach behind them count brass and bowgentle ascended the steps and entered the hall where they found baron meliadus waiting for them alone the baron was almost as tall as count brass he was dressed all in gleaming black and dark blue even his jeweled animal mask which covered the whole of his head like a hel met was of some strange black metal with deep blue sap phires for eyes the mask was cast in the form of a snarling wolf with needlesharp teeth in the open jaws standing in the shadows of the hall his black cloak covering much of his black armor baron meliadus might have been one of the mythical beastgods that were still worshipped in the lands beyond the middle sea as they entered he reached up with blackgauntleted hands and removed the mask revealing a white heavy face with a welltrimmed black beard and mus tache his hair too was black and thick and his eyes were a pale strange blue the baron was apparently unarmed per haps as an indication that he came in peace he bowed low and spoke in a deep musical voice greetings famous count brass and forgive this sudden intrusion i sent messengers ahead but they arrived too late to reach you before you left i am the baron meliadus of kroiden grand constable of the order of the wolf first chieftain of the armies under our great kingemperor huon count brass inclined his head i know of your great deeds baron meliadus and recognized your arms on your carriage be welcome the castle brass is yours for as long as you wish to stay our fare is simple i fear in comparison with the richness i have heard may be sampled at the board of even the lowliest citizen of that mighty empire of granbretan but that too is yours baron meliadus smiled your courtliness and hospitality put those of granbretan to shame mighty hero i thank you count brass introduced his daughter and the baron ad vanced to bow low and kiss her hand evidently impressed by her beauty to bowgentle he was courteous showing familiarity with the poetphilosophers writings but in reply bowgentles voice shook with the effort of remaining polite with von villach baron meliadus reminded him of several famous battles in which the old warrior had distinguished himself and von villach was visibly pleased for all the fine manners and elaborately embellished state ments there was a certain tension in the hall bowgentle was the first to make his excuses and shortly afterward yisselda and von villach discreetly left to let baron meliadus discuss whatever business had brought him to castle brass baron meliaduss eyes lingered just a little while on the girl as she passed out of the hall wine and refreshments were brought and the two men settled themselves in heavy carved armchairs baron meliadus looked over the brim of his wine cup at count brass you are a man of the world my lord he said indeed you are that in every sense so you will appreciate that my visit is fostered by more than an urge to enjoy the sights of this pretty province count brass smiled a little liking the baron for his frank ness quite so he agreed though for my part it is an honor to meet so famous a peer of the great king huon that feeling is shared by myself toward you baron meliadus replied you are without doubt the most famous hero in europe perhaps the most famous in her history it is almost alarming to find you are made of flesh after all and not metal he laughed and count brass joined in the laughter ive had my share of luck count brass said and fate has been kind to me in seeming to collaborate my judgment who is to say whether the age we live in is good for me or i am good for that age your philosophy rivals that of your friend sir bowgentle said baron meliadus and supports what i have heard of your wisdom and judgment we in granbretan pride our selves on our own abilities in that direction but we could learn from you i believe i have only details count brass told him but you have the talent to see the general scheme he tried to guess from meliaduss face what the man was leading toward but the face remained bland it is the details we need baron meliadus said if our general ambitions are to be realized as swiftly as we should like now count brass understood why baron meliadus was here but he did not reveal that he only looked a little puzzled and politely poured more wine for his guest we have a destiny to rule all europe baron meliadus said that seems to be your destiny count brass agreed and i support in principle such an ambition i am glad count brass we are often misrepresented and our enemies are many spreading calumnies across the globe it sometimes seems i am not interested in the truth or falsehood of those rumors count brass told him it is only your general activities i believe in you would not then oppose the spread of our empire baron meliadus looked at him carefully only count brass smiled in particular in the partic ular case of this land i protect the kamarg you would welcome then the security of a treaty of peace between us i see no need for one i have the security of my towers hmmm baron meliadus glanced at the floor is that why you came my lord baron to propose a peace treaty to propose an alliance even of sorts nodded the baron an alliance of sorts i would not oppose or support you in most senses count brass told him i would oppose you only if you attacked my lands i support you only in my attitude that a unifying force is needed in europe at this time baron meliadus thought for a moment before speaking and if that unification were threatened he said at length count brass laughed i do not believe it can be there is none powerful enough to withstand granbretan now baron meliadus pursed his lips you are right in believing that our list of victories becomes almost a bore to us but the more we conquer the thinner we spread our forces if we knew the courts of europe as well for instance as yourself we should know better who to trust and who to distrust and thus be able to concentrate our attention on the weaknesses we have the grand duke ziminon as our governor in nor mandia for instance baron meliadus looked carefully at count brass would you say we are wise in our choice he sought the throne of normandia when his cousin jewelard possessed it is he content with the throne on our terms ziminon eh count brass smiled i helped defeat him at rouen i know but what is your opinion of him count brasss smile grew broader as baron meliaduss manner became more intense now he knew exactly what granbretan wanted of him he is an excellent horseman and has a fascination for women he said that does not help us know the extent to which we may trust him almost impatiently the baron put his wine cup on the table true count brass agreed he looked up at the large wall clock that hung over the fireplace its golden hands showed eleven oclock its huge pendulum swung slowly back and forth casting a flickering shadow on the wall it began to strike we go to our beds early in castle brass the count said casually we live the lives of country folk i am afraid he rose from his chair i will have a servant show you to your chambers your men have been placed in rooms adjoining the main suite a faint shadow clouded baron meliaduss face count brass we know of your skill in politics your wisdom your comprehensive knowledge of all the weaknesses and the strengths of the european courts we wish to make use of that knowledge in return we offer riches power security i have all i need of the first two and am assured of the third count brass replied gently as he pulled a bellrope you will forgive me if i claim tiredness and a desire to sleep i have had an exerting afternoon listen to reason my lord count i beg you baron meliadus was making an effort to appear in good temper i hope you will stay with us for some time baron and be able to tell us all the news a servant entered please show our guest to his chambers count brass told the servant he bowed to the baron good night baron meliadus i look forward to seeing you when we break our fast at eight oclock when the baron had left the hall following the servant count brass let some of his amusement show on his face it was pleasing to know that granbretan sought his help but he had no intention of giving it he hoped he could resist the barons requests politely for he had no wish to be on bad terms with the dark empire besides he quite liked baron meliadus they seemed to share certain qualities in common chapter four the fight at castle brass baron meliadus remained at castle brass for a week after the first night he succeeded in recovering his composure and never again betrayed any sign of impatience with count brass for his persistent refusal to listen to the inducements and requirements of granbretan perhaps it was not only his mission that kept the baron at castle brass for it was plain that he gave yisselda much of his attention with her in particular he appeared agreeable and courteous to such an extent that it was plain that yisselda unfamiliar with the sophisticated ways of the grand courts was not unattracted to him count brass seemed oblivious of this one morning as they walked in the upper terraces of the castle garden bowgentle spoke to his friend baron meliadus seems not only interested in seducing you for the cause of granbretan he said he has another kind of seduction in mind if im not mistaken eh count brass turned from his contemplation of the vines on the terrace below what else is he after your daughter bowgentle answered softly oh come now bowgentle laughed the count you see malice and evil intention in the mans every action he is a gentleman a noble and besides he wants something from me he would not let that ambition be jeopardized by a flir tation i think you do baron meliadus an injustice ive grown rather to like him then it is high time you involved yourself in politics again my lord said bowgentle with some fire but all the time speaking softly for it would seem your judgment is not as sharp as it was count brass shrugged be that as it may i think you are becoming a nervous old woman my friend baron meliadus has behaved with decorum since his arrival admittedly i think he wastes his time here and wish he would decide to leave soon but if he has intentions toward my daughter i have seen no sign of it he might wish to marry her certainly in order to make a blood tie between myself and granbretan but yisselda would not consent to the idea and neither would i what if yisselda loved baron meliadus and he felt passion for her how could she love baron meliadus she sees few men as handsome and sophisticated in kamarg hmm grunted the count dismissively if she loved the baron shed tell me wouldnt she ill believe your tale when i hear it confirmed from yisseldas lips bowgentle wondered to himself if the counts refusal to see the truth were sponsored by a secret wish to know nothing at all of the character of those who ruled granbretan or it was simply a fathers common inability to see in his child what was perfectly evident to others bowgentle decided to keep a careful eye on both baron meliadus and yisselda in future he could not believe that the counts judgment was correct in the case of the man who had caused the massacre of liege who had given the order for the sack of sahbruck and whose perverse appetites were the horror of every whis pering scullion from north cape to tunis as he had said the count had lived too long in the country breathing the clean rural air now he could not recognize the stink of corruption even when he smelled it though count brass was reticent in his conversations with baron meliadus the granbretanian seemed willing to tell him much it appeared that even where granbretan did not rule there were discontented nobles and peasants willing to make secret treaties with the agents of the dark empire in promise of power under the kingemperor if they helped destroy those who opposed granbretan and granbretans ambitions it seemed extended beyond europe into asia beyond the mediterranean there were wellestablished groups ready to support the dark empire when the time came for attack count brasss admiration for the tactical skills of the empire increased every day within twenty years said baron meliadus the whole of europe will be ours within thirty all arabia and the countries that surround it within fifty we shall have the strength to attack that mysterious land on our maps that is called asiacommunista an ancient and romantic name smiled count brass full of great sorceries its said is that not where the rune staff lies aye thats the tale that it stands on the tallest mountain in the world where snow swirls and winds howl constantly protected by hairy men of incredible wisdom and age who who are ten feet high and have the faces of apes baron meli adus smiled but there are many places that the runestaff is said to be in amarehk even count brass nodded ah amarehk do you include that land in your dreams of empire amarehk was the great con tinent said to lie across the water to the west ruled by beings of almost godlike powers they were reputed to lead lives that were abstracted tranquil and remote theirs so the tales went was the civilization that altogether missed the effects of the tragic millennium when the rest of the world collapsed into various degrees of ruin count brass had jested when he mentioned amarehk but baron meliadus looked at him sidewise a gleam in his pale eye why not he said i would storm the walls of heaven if i found them disturbed count brass left him shortly thereafter for the first time wondering if his resolution to remain neutral were as well advised as hed believed yisselda though as intelligent as her father lacked both his experience and his normally good judgment of character she found even the barons infamous reputation attractive and at the same time could not believe that all the stories about him were true for when he spoke to her in his soft cultivated voice flattering her beauty and grace she thought she saw a man of gentle temperament forced to appear grim and ruthless by the conventions of his office and his role in history now for the third time since his arrival she slipped at night from her bedchamber to keep an assignation with him in the west tower which had been unused since the bloody death there of the previous lord guardian the meeting had been innocent enough a clasping of her hand a brushing of her lips with his the whispering of love words talk of marriage though still unsure of the latter suggestion for she loved her father and felt it would hurt him deeply if she married baron meliadus she could not resist the attention the baron gave her even she was not sure that it was love she felt for him but she welcomed the sense of ad venture and excitement that these meetings gave her on this particular night as she sped lightfooted through the gloomy corridors she did not know that she was being followed behind her came a figure in a black cloak a long dagger in a leather sheath in his right hand heart beating red lips parted slightly in a half smile yis selda ran up the winding steps of the tower until she came to the little turret room where the baron already awaited her he bowed low then caught her in his arms caressing her soft flesh through the thin silken nightgown she wore his kiss was firmer this time almost brutal and her breathing became deeper as she returned it clutching at his broad leatherclad back now his hand moved down to her waist and then to her thigh and for a moment she pressed her body closer to his and then tried to tug away as she felt a growing unfamiliar panic he held on to her panting a beam of moonlight entered the narrow window and fell across his face revealing frowning brows and heated eyes yisselda you must marry me tonight we can leave castle brass and be beyond the towers by tomorrow your father would not dare follow us to granbretan my father would dare anything she said with quiet con viction but i feel my lord that i have no wish to put him to the trouble what do you mean i mean that i would not marry without his consent would he give it i believe not then she tried to tug away completely from him but his strong hands gripped her arms now she was frightened wondering how her former passion could turn so swiftly into fear i must go now no yisselda i am not used to my will being opposed first your obstinate father refuses what i ask now you id kill you rather than let you leave without promising to come with me to granbretan he pulled her toward him his lips forcing a kiss from her she moaned as she tried to resist then the dark cloaked figure entered the chamber un sheathing the long dagger from its case the steel shone in the moonlight and baron meliadus glared at the intruder but did not relinquish his hold on the girl let her go said the dark figure for if you do not ill forsake all principle and slay you now bowgentle yisselda sobbed run for my fatheryou are not strong enough to fight him baron meliadus laughed and threw yisselda to the corner of the turret room fight it would not be a fight with you philosopher it would be butchery stand aside and ill leave but i must take the girl leave alone bowgentle replied by all means do that for i have no wish to have your death on my conscience but yisselda stays with me shes leaving with me tonight whether she wills it or no meliadus flung back his own cloak revealing a short sword high at his waist aside sir bowgentle for unless you move i promise you that you will not live to write a sonnet about this affair bowgentle stood his ground dagger held point outward at baron meliaduss chest the granbretanians hand gripped the hilt of the sword and drew it from the scabbard in a blur of movement one last chance philosopher bowgentle did not reply his halfglazed eyes did not blink only the hand holding the dagger shook slightly yisselda screamed the scream was highpitched and pene trating echoing through the castle baron meliadus turned with a grunt of rage raising the sword bowgentle leaped forward stabbing clumsily with the dagger which was deflected by the tough leather the baron wore meliadus turned with a laugh of contempt his sword struck twice at bowgentle once at his head and once at his body and the philosopherpoet fell to the flagstones his blood staining the floor again yisselda screamed this time in terror and pity for her fathers friend baron meliadus stooped and grabbed the struggling girl by her arm twisted it so that she gasped and flung her over his shoulder then he left the turret room and began to descend the steps swiftly he had to cross the main hall to get to his own quarters and as he entered it there came a roar from the other side by the light of the dying fire he saw count brass clad only in a loose robe his great broadsword in his hands blocking the door through which baron meliadus meant to go father yisselda cried and then the granbretanian had flung her to one side and brandished his short sword at count brass so bowgentle was right count brass rumbled you abuse my hospitality baron i want your daughter she loves me so it seems count brass glanced at yisselda as she climbed to her feet sobbing defend yourself baron baron meliadus frowned you have a broadsword my blades little better than a bodkin besides ive no wish to fight a man of your years we can make peace surely fatherhe killed bowgentle count brass trembled with rage at this he strode to the wall where a rack of swords was placed took the largest and best balanced from the rack and flung it to baron meliadus it clattered on the flagstones meliadus dropped his own blade and picked up the broadsword now he had the advantage for he wore stout leather and the count wore only linen count brass advanced the broadsword raised then swung at baron meliadus who met the swipe with a parry like men hewing at a great tree they swung the heavy blades this way and that the clangor rang through the hall and brought servants scurrying as well as the barons menatarms who looked disconcerted and uncertain what to do by that time von villach and his men had arrived the granbretanians saw that they were heavily outnumbered and decided to do noth ing sparks scattered into the darkness of the hall as the two big men dueled the broadswords rising and falling swinging this way and that every stroke parried with masterly skill sweat covered both faces as the swords swung both chests heaved with the exertion as they fenced back and forth across the hall now baron meliadus cut at count brasss shoulder but succeeded only in grazing it next count brasss sword fell on baron meliaduss side but was blocked by the thick leather of the barons doublet there was a series of swift strokes in which it seemed both men must be cut to pieces but when they stepped back and resumed their guard all count brass had was a light cut across his forehead and a tear in his gown and baron meliaduss coat was ripped down the front and one arm of it hung in tatters the sound of their panting and the scrape of their feet on the floor blended with the great clash of blades as they met again and again then count brass tripped over a small table and fell back ward legs sprawling one hand losing its grip on the sword baron meliadus smirked and raised his weapon count brass rolled over swiped at the barons legs brought the man thumping down beside him the blades forgotten for the moment they wrestled over and over on the flagstones fists battering at one another lips snarling swords still attached to them by wrist thongs then baron meliadus flung himself backward and jumped up but count brass was up again too he swung his sword suddenly and knocked the barons blade clear across the hall where it stuck point first in a wooden pillar and thrummed like a metal organ reed count brasss eyes showed no pity they held only an intention to kill baron meliadus you slew my true and greatest friend he growled as he raised his broadsword baron meliadus slowly folded his arms across his chest and waited for the blow eyes downcast an almost bored expression on his face you slew bowgentle and for that i slay you count brass the count hesitated the sword raised above his head the voice was bowgentles count brass he did not kill me the flat of his sword stunned me and the wound in my chest is by no means mortal bowgentle came forward through the crowd his hand on his wound a livid bruise on his forehead count brass sighed thank fate for that bowgentle nonetheless he turned to contemplate baron melia dus this villain has abused my hospitality insulted my daughter injured my friend baron meliadus raised his eyes to meet the counts for give me count brass moved by a passion for the beauty of yisselda as i was it clouded my brain possessed me like a demon i would not beg when you threatened my life but now i ask you to understand that only honest human emotions moved me to do what i did count brass shook his head i cannot forgive you baron ill listen to your insidious words no longer you must be gone from castle brass within the hour and off my lands by morning or you and yours will perish youd risk offending granbretan count brass shrugged i do not offend the dark empire if they hear anything like the truth of what passed this night they will punish you for your mistakes not come against me for having seen justice done you have failed in your mission you have offended me not i granbretan baron meliadus said no more but fuming left to prepare himself for his journey disgraced and enraged he was soon in his bizarre carriage and the carriage was rolling through the castle gates before half an hour had passed he made no farewells count brass yisselda bowgentle and von villach stood in the courtyard watching him leave you were right bowgentle muttered the count both yisselda and i were beguiled by the man ill have no more emissaries from granbretan visit castle brass you realize that the dark empire must be fought de stroyed bowgentle asked hopefully i did not say that let it do what it will we will have no further trouble from granbretan or baron meliadus you are wrong bowgentle said with conviction and in his dark carriage as it bumped through the night toward the northern borders of the kamarg baron meliadus spoke aloud to himself and swore an oath by the most myste nous sacred object he knew he swore by the runestaff that lost artifact said to contain all the secrets of destiny that he would get count brass into his power by any means possible that he would possess yisselda and that the kamarg would become one great furnace in which all who inhabited it would perish this he swore by the runestaff and thus the destiny of baron meliadus count brass yisselda the dark empire and all who were now and would be later concerned with the events in castle brass was irrevocably decided the play was cast the stage set the curtain raised now the mummers must enact their destiny book two chapter one dorian hawkmoon those who dare swear by the runestaff must then benefit or suffer from the consequences of the fixed pattern of destiny that they set in motion some several such oaths have been sworn in the history of the runestaffs existence but none with such vast and terrible results as the mighty oath of vengeance sworn by the baron meliadus of kroiden the year before dorian hawkmoon van koln set foot into the pages of this ancient narrative the high history of the runestaff baron meliadus returned to londra gloomytowered capital of the dark empire and brooded for almost a year before he settled on his plan other affairs of granbretan occupied him in that time there were rebellions to put down examples to be made of newly conquered towns fresh battles to be planned and fought puppet governors to be interviewed and placed in power baron meliadus fulfilled all these responsibilities faithfully and with imagination but his passion for yisselda and his hatred of count brass were never far from his thoughts although he had suffered no ignominy for his failure to win the count to granbretans cause he still felt thwarted be sides he was constantly finding problems in which the count could have helped him easily whenever such a problem arose baron meliaduss brain became clogged with a dozen different schemes of revenge but none seemed suited to do everything he required he must have yisselda he must get the counts aid in the affairs of europe he must destroy the kamarg as he had sworn they were incompatible ambitions in his tall tower of obsidian overlooking the bloodred river tayme where barges of bronze and ebony carried cargo from the coast baron meliadus paced his cluttered study with its tapestries of timefaded browns blacks and blues its oraries of precious metal and gemstones its globes and astrolabes of beaten iron and brass and silver its furniture of dark polished wood and its carpets of deep pile the colors of leaves in autumn around him on all the walls on every shelf in every angle were his clocks all were in perfect synchronization and all struck on the quarter half and full hour many with musical effects they were of various shapes and sizes in cases of metal wood or certain other less recognizable substances they were ornately carved to the extent sometimes that it was virtually impossible to tell the time from them they had been collected from many parts of europe and the near east the spoils of a score of conquered provinces they were what baron meliadus loved most among his many possessions not only this study but every room in the great tower was full of clocks there was a huge fourfaced clock in bronze onyx gold silver and platinum at the very top of the tower and when its great bells were struck by lifesize figures of naked girls holding hammers all londra echoed with the din the clocks rivaled in variety those of meliaduss brotherinlaw taragorm master of the palace of time whom meliadus loathed with a deep attachment as rival for his strange sisters perverse and whimful affections baron meliadus ceased his pacing and picked up a piece of parchment from his desk it contained the latest information from the province of koln a province that nearly two years previously meliadus had made an example of it seemed now that too much had been done for the son of the old duke of koln whom meliadus had personally disemboweled in the public square of the capital had raised an army of rebellion and almost succeeded in crushing the occupying forces of granbretan had not speedy reinforcements in the shape of ornithopters armed with longrange flamelances been sent koln might have been temporarily taken from the dark empire but the ornithopters had demolished the forces of the young duke and he had been taken prisoner he was due soon to arrive in londra to pleasure the nobles of granbretan with his suf ferings here again was a situation where count brass might have helped for before he showed himself in open rebellion the duke of koln had offered himself as a mercenary com mander to the dark empire and had been accepted had fought well in the service of granbretan at nurnberg and ulm winning the confidence of the empire gaining command of a force comprised mainly of soldiers who had once served his father then turning with them and marching back to koln to attack the province baron meliadus frowned for the young duke had provided an example that others might follow already he was a hero in the german provinces by all accounts few dared oppose the dark empire as he had done if only count brass had agreed suddenly baron meliadus began to smile a scheme seeming to spring instantly and complete into his mind perhaps the young duke of koln could be used in some way other than in the entertainment of his peers baron meliadus put down the parchment and pulled at a bellrope a girlslave entered her naked body rouged all over and fell on her knees to receive his instructions all the barons slaves were female he allowed no men into his tower for fear of treachery take a message to the master of the prison catacombs he told the girl tell him that baron meliadus would interview the prisoner dorian hawkmoon von koln as soon as he arrives there yes master the girl rose and backed from the room leaving baron meliadus staring from his window at the river a faint smile on his full lips dorian hawkmoon bound in chains of gilded iron as befitted his station in the eyes of the granbretanians stum bled down the gangplank from barge to quay blinking in the evening light and staring around him at the huge menacing towers of londra if he had never before needed proof of the congenital insanity of the inhabitants of the dark island he had to his mind full evidence now there was something un natural about every line of the architecture every choice of color and carving and yet there was also a sense of great strength about it of purpose and intelligence no wonder he thought it was hard to fathom the psychology of the people of the dark empire when so much of them was paradox a guard in white leather and wearing the white metal deathshead mask that was uniform to the order he served pushed him gently forward hawkmoon staggered in spite of the lightness of the pressure for he had not eaten for almost a week his brain was at once clouded and abstracted he was hardly aware of the significance of his circumstances since his capture at the battle of koln no one had spoken to him he had lain most of the time in the darkness of the ships bilges drinking occasionally from the trough of dirty water that had been fixed beside him he was unshaven his eyes were glazed his long fair hair was matted and his torn mail and breeches were covered in filth the chains had chafed his skin so that red sores were prominent on his neck and wrists but he felt no pain indeed he felt little of anything moved like a sleepwalker saw everything as if in a dream he took two steps along the quartz quay staggered and fell to one knee the guards now on either side of him pulled him up and supported him as he approached a black wall that loomed over the quay there was a small barred door in the wall and two soldiers in rubycolored pigmasks stood on either side of it the order of the pig controlled the prisons of londra the guards spoke a few words to each other in the grunting secret language of their order and one of them laughed grabbing hawkmoons arm saying nothing to the prisoner but pushing him forward as the other guard swung the barred door inward the interior was dark the door closed behind hawkmoon and for a few moments he was alone then in the dim light from the door he saw a mask a pigmask but more elaborate than those of the guards outside another similar mask ap peared and then another hawkmoon was seized and led through the foulsmelling darkness led down into the prison catacombs of the dark empire knowing with little emotion that his life was over at last he heard another door opened he was pushed into a tiny chamber then he heard the door close and a beam fall into place the air in the dungeon was fetid and there was a film of foulness on flagstones and wall hawkmoon lay against the wall and then slid gradually to the floor whether he fainted or fell asleep he could not tell but his eyes closed and obliv ion came a week before he had been the hero of koln a champion against the aggressors a man of grace and sardonic wit a warrior of skill now as a matter of course the men of gran bretan had turned him into an animal an animal with little will to live a lesser man might have clung grimly to his humanity fed from his hatred schemed escape but hawk moon having lost all wanted nothing perhaps he would awake from his trance if he did he would be a different man from the one who had fought with such insolent courage at the battle of koln chapter two the bargain torchlight and the glinting of beast masks sneering pig and snarling wolf red metal and black mocking eyes diamond white and sapphire blue the heavy rustle of cloaks and the sound of whispered conversation hawkmoon sighed weakly and closed his eyes then opened them again as footsteps came nearer and the wolf bent over him holding the torch close to his face the heat was un comfortable but hawkmoon made no effort to move away from it wolf straightened and spoke to pig pointless speaking to him now feed him wash him restore his intelligence a little pig and wolf left closing the door hawkmoon closed his eyes when he next awoke he was being carried through cor ridors by the light of brands he was taken into a room lighted by lamps there was a bed covered in rich furs and silks food laid out on a carved table a bath of some shim mering orange metal full of steaming water two girl slaves in attendance the chains were stripped from him then the clothes then he was picked up again and lowered into the water it stung his skin as the slaves began to lave him while a man entered with a razor and began to trim his hair and shave his beard all this hawkmoon took passively staring at the mosaic ceiling with blank eyes he allowed himself to be dressed in fine soft linen with a shirt of silk and breeches of velvet and gradually a dim feeling of wellbeing overcame him but when they first sat him at the table and pushed fruit into his mouth his stomach contracted and he retched dryly so they gave him a little drugged milk then put him on the bed and left him save for one slave at the door watching over him some days passed and gradually hawkmoon began to eat began to appreciate the luxury of his existence there were books in the room and the women were his but he still had little inclination to sample either hawkmoon whose mind had gone to sleep so soon after his capture took a long time to awaken and when at length he did it was to remember his past life as a dream he opened a book one day and the letters looked strange though he could read them well enough it was simply that he saw no point in them no importance in the words and sentences they formed though the book had been written by a scholar once one of hawkmoons favorite philosophers he shrugged and dropped the book onto a table one of the girl slaves seeing this action pressed herself against his body and stroked his cheek gently he pushed her aside and went to the bed lying down with his hands behind his head at length he said why am i here they were the first words he had spoken oh my lord duke i know not save that you seem an honored prisoner a game i suppose before the lords of granbretan have their sport with me hawkmoon spoke without emotion his voice was flat but deep even the words seemed strange to him as he spoke them he looked out from his inward turned eyes at the girl and she trembled she had long blonde hair and was wellshaped a girl from scandia by her accent i know nothing my lord only that i must please you in any way you desire hawkmoon nodded slightly and glanced about the room they prepare me for some torture or display i would guess he said to himself the room had no windows but by the quality of the air hawkmoon judged that they were still underground probably in the prison catacombs somewhere he measured the passing of time by the lamps they seemed to be filled about once a day he stayed in the room for a fortnight or so before he again saw the wolf who had visited him in his eel the door opened without ceremony and in stepped the tall figure dressed in black leather from head to foot with a long sword in a black leather scabbard the black wolfmask hid the whole head from it issued the rich musi cal voice he had only halfheard before so our prisoner seems restored to his former wit and fit ness the two girl slaves bowed and withdrew hawkmoon rose from the bed on which he had lain most of the time since his arrival he swung his body off the bed and got to his feet good quite fit duke von koln aye hawkmoons voice contained no inflection he yawned unselfconsciously decided there was little point in standing after all and resumed his former position on the bed i take it that you know me said the wolf a hint of impatience in his voice no you have not guessed hawkmoon made no reply the wolf moved across the room and stood by the table which had a huge crystal bowl of fruit on it his gloved hand picked up a pomegranate and the wolfmask bent as if in specting it you are fully recovered my lord it would seem so answered hawkmoon i have a great sense of wellbeing all my needs are attended to as i be lieve you ordered and now i presume you intend to make some sport with me that does not seem to disturb you hawkmoon shrugged it will end eventually it could last a lifetime we of granbretan are inventive a lifetime is not so long as it happens the wolf told him tossing the fruit from hand to hand we were thinking of sparing you the dis comfort hawkmoons face showed no expression you are very selfcontained my lord duke the wolf continued strangely so since you live only because of the whim of your enemies those same enemies who slew your father so disgracefully hawkmoons brows contracted as if in faint recollection i remember that he said vaguely my father the old duke the wolf threw the pomegranate to the floor and raised the mask the handsome blackbearded features were revealed it was i baron meliadus of kroiden who slew him there was a goading smile on the full lips baron meliadus ah who slew him all the manliness has gone from you my lord baron meliadus murmured or do you seek to deceive us in the hope that you may turn traitor upon us again hawkmoon pursed his lips i am tired he said meliaduss eyes were puzzled and almost angry i killed your father so you said well disconcerted meliadus turned away and paced toward the door then wheeled around again that is not what i came here to discuss it seems however strange that you should profess no hatred or wish for vengeance against me hawkmoon himself began to feel bored wishing that meli adus would leave him in peace the mans tense manner and his halfhysterical expressions discomfited him rather as the buzzing of a mosquito could be distracting to a man wishing to sleep i feel nothing hawkmoon replied hoping that this would satisfy the intruder you have no spirit left meliadus exclaimed angrily no spirit defeat and capture have robbed you of it perhaps now i am tired i came to offer you the return of your lands meliadus went on an entirely autonomous state within our empire more than we have ever offered a conquered land before now just a trace of curiosity stirred in hawkmoon why is that he said we wish to strike a bargain with youto our mutual benefit we need a man who is crafty and war skilled as you are baron meliadus frowned in doubt or seemed to be and we need someone who would be trusted by those who do not trust granbretan this was not at all the way meliadus had intended to present the bargain but hawkmoons strange lack of emotion had disconcerted him we wish you to perform an errand for us in return your lands i would like to go home hawkmoon nodded the meadows of my childhood he smiled in reminiscence shocked by a display of what he mistook for sentimental ity baron meliadus snapped what you do when you return whether you make daisy chains or build castles is of no interest to us you will return however only if you perform your mission faithfully hawkmoons introverted eyes glanced up at meliadus you think i have lost my reason perhaps my lord im not sure we have means of discovering that our sorcererscientists will make certain tests i am sane baron meliadus saner maybe than i ever was you have nothing to fear from me baron meliadus raised his eyes to the ceiling by the runestaff will no one take sides he opened the door we will find out about you duke von koln you will be sent for later today after baron meliadus had left hawkmoon continued to lie on the bed the interview was quickly gone from his mind and only halfremembered when in two or three hours pig masked guards entered the chamber and told him to accom pany them hawkmoon was led through many passages marching steadily upward until they reached a great iron door one of the guards banged on it with the butt of his flamelance and it creaked open to admit fresh air and daylight waiting beyond the door was a detachment of guards in purple armor and cloaks with the purple masks of the order of the bull covering their faces hawkmoon was handed over to them and looking about him saw that he stood in a wide courtyard that but for a gravel path was covered by a fine lawn a high wall in which was set a narrow gate surrounded the lawn and on it paced guards of the order of the pig behind the wall jutted the gloomy towers of the city hawkmoon was guided along the path to the gate through the gate and into a narrow street where a carriage of gilded ebony fashioned in the shape of a twoheaded horse awaited him into this he climbed accompanied by two silent guards the carriage began to move through a chink in its curtains hawkmoon saw the towers as they passed it was sunset and a lurid light suffused the city eventually the carriage stopped hawkmoon passively allowed the guards to lead him out of it and saw at once that he had come to the palace of the kingemperor huon the palace rose tier upon tier almost out of sight four great towers surmounted it and these towers glowed with a deep golden light the palace was decorated with basreliefs depicting strange rites battle scenes famous episodes in gran bretans long history gargoyles figurines abstract shapes the whole a grotesque and fantastic structure that had been built over centuries every kind of building material had been used in its construction and then colored so that the building shone with a mixture of shades covering the entire spectrum and there was no order to the placing of the color no attempt to match or contrast one color flowed into the next straining the eye offending the brain the palace of a madman over shadowing in its impression of insanity the rest of the city at its gates yet another set of guards awaited hawkmoon these were garbed in the masks and armor of the order of the mantis the order to which king huon himself belonged their elaborate insect masks were covered in jewels with antennae of platinum wire and eyes faceted with a score or more of different gemstones the men had long thin legs and arms and slender bodies encased in insectlike plate armor of black gold and green when they spoke their secret language to each other it was the rustle and click of insect voices for the first time hawkmoon felt disturbed as these guards led him into the lower passages of the palace the walls of which were of deep scarlet metal that reflected distorted images as they moved at last they entered a large highceilinged hall whose dark walls were veined like marble with white green and pink but these veins moved constantly flickering and changing course the length and breadth of the walls and ceiling the floor of the hall which was the best part of a quarter of a mile long and almost as wide was filled at intervals by devices that hawkmoon took to be machines of some de scription though he could not understand their function like everything he had seen since arriving in londra these ma chines were ornate much decorated built from precious metals and semiprecious stones there were instruments set into them unlike anything he knew and many of the instruments were active registering counting measuring tended by men who wore the serpentmasks of the order of the snake the order that consisted solely of sorcerers and scientists in the service of the kingemperor they were shrouded in mottled cloaks with cowls halfdrawn over their heads down the central aisle a figure paced toward hawkmoon waving to the guards to dismiss hawkmoon judged this man high in the order for his serpent mask was much more ornate than those of the others he might even be the grand constable by his bearing and general demeanor my lord duke greetings hawkmoon acknowledged the bow with a slight one of his own many of the habits of his former life still being with him i am baron kalan of vitall chief scientist to the king emperor you are to be my guest for a day or so i under stand welcome to my apartments and laboratories thank you what do you wish me to do hawkmoon asked abstractedly first i hope you will dine with me baron kalan signaled graciously for hawkmoon to precede him and they walked the length of the hall passing many peculiar constructions until they arrived at a door that led to what were obviously the barons private apartments a meal was already laid it was comparatively simple judged against what hawkmoon had been eating over the past fortnight but it was well cooked and tasty when they had finished baron kalan who had already removed his mask to reveal a pale middleaged face with a whispy white beard and thinning hair poured wine for them both they had scarcely spoken during the meal hawkmoon tasted the wine it was excellent my own invention the wine said kalan and smirked it is unfamiliar hawkmoon admitted what grape no grape but grain a somewhat different process it is strong stronger than most wines agreed the baron now duke you know that i have been commissioned to establish your sanity judge your temperament and decide whether you are fit to serve his majesty the kingemperor huon i believe that is what baron meliadus told me hawk moon smiled faintly i will be interested in learning your observations hmm baron kalan looked closely at hawkmoon i can see why i was asked to entertain you i must say that you appear to be rational thank you under the influence of the strange wine hawkmoon was rediscovering some of his former irony baron kalan rubbed at his face and coughed a dry barely heard cough for some several moments his manner had contained some nervousness since he removed the mask hawkmoon had already noticed how the people of granbre tan preferred to keep their masks on most of the time now kalan reached toward the extravagant snakemask and placed it over his head the coughing stopped immediately and the mans body relaxed visibly although hawkmoon had heard that it was a breach of granbretanian etiquette to re tain ones mask when entertaining a guest of noble station he affected to show no surprise at the barons action ah my lord duke came the whisper from within the mask who am i to judge what sanity is there are those who judge we of granbretan insane surely not it is true those with blunted perceptions who cannot see the grand plan are not convinced of the nobility of our great crusade they say you know that we are mad ha ha baron kalan rose but now if you will accompany me we will begin our preliminary investigations back through the hall of machines they went entering another hall only slightly smaller than the first this had the same dark walls but these pulsed with an energy that grad ually shifted along the spectrum from violet to black and back again there was only a single machine in the hall a thing of gleaming blue and red metal with projections arms and attachments a great belllike object suspended from an intri cate scaffold affair that was part of the machine on one side was a console attended by a dozen men in the uniform of the order of the snake their metal masks partially reflecting the pulsing light from the walls a noise filled the hall emanating from the machine a faintly heard clatter a moan a series of hissings as if it breathed like a beast this is our mentality machine baron kalan said proudly this is what will test you it is very large said hawkmoon stepping toward it one of our largest it has to be it must perform complex tasks this is the result of scientific sorcery my lord duke none of your hitandmiss spell singing you find on the con tinent it is our science that gives us our chief advantage over lesser nations as the effect of the drink wore off hawkmoon became increasingly the man he had been in the prison catacombs his sense of detachment grew and when he was led forward and made to stand under the bell when it was lowered he felt little anxiety or curiosity at last the bell completely covered him and its fleshy sides moved in to mold themselves around his body it was an ob scene embrace and would have horrified the dorian hawk moon who had fought the battle of koln but this new hawkmoon felt only a vague impatience and discomfort he began to feel a crawling sensation in his skull as if incredibly fine wires were entering his head and probing at his brain hallucinations began to manifest themselves he saw bright oceans of color distorted faces buildings and flora of unnat ural perspective it rained jewels for a hundred years and then black winds blew across his eyes and were torn apart to reveal oceans that were at once frozen and in motion beasts of infinite sympathy and goodness women of amazing hum anity interspersed with these visions came clear memories of his childhood of his life up until the moment he had entered the machine piece by piece the memories built up until the whole of his life had been recalled and presented to him but still he felt no other emotion save the remembrance of the emotion he had had in that past time when at last the sides of the bell moved back and the bell itself began to rise hawk moon stood impassively feeling as if he had witnessed the experience of another kalan was there and took his arm leading him away from the mentality machine the preliminary investigations show you to be rather more than normally sane my lord duke if i read the instruments correctly the mentality machine will report in detail in a few hours now you must rest and we shall continue our tests in the morning the next day hawkmoon was again given over to the embrace of the mentality machine and this time he lay full length within its belly looking upward while picture after picture was flashed before his eyes and the pictures that they first reminded him of were then flashed onto a screen hawk moons face hardly altered its expression while all this went on he experienced a series of hallucinations where he was thrown into highly dangerous situations an ocean ghoul attacking him an avalanche three swordsmen as opponents the need to leap from the third story of a building or be burned to death and in every case he rescued himself with courage and skill though his reflexes were mechanical unin spired by any particular sense of fear many such tests were made and he passed through them all without ever once showing any strong emotion of any kind even when he was induced by the mentality machine to laugh weep hate love and so on the reactions were chiefly physical in expression at length hawkmoon was released by the machine and faced baron kalans snakemask it would seem that you are in some peculiar way too sane my lord duke whispered the baron a paradox eh aye too sane it is as if some part of your brain has disap peared altogether or has been cut off from the rest however i can only report to baron meliadus that you seem eminently suited to his purpose so long as certain sensible precautions are taken what purpose is that hawkmoon asked with no real interest that is for him to say shortly afterward baron kalan took his leave of hawk moon who was escorted through a labyrinth of corridors by two guards of the order of the mantis at length they arrived outside a door of burnished silver that opened to reveal a sparsely furnished room entirely lined with mirrors on walls floor and ceiling save for a single large window at the far end that opened on to a balcony overlooking the city near the window stood a figure in a black wolfmask who could only be baron meliadus baron meliadus turned and motioned for the guards to leave then he pulled a cord and tapestries rippled down the walls to hide the mirrors hawkmoon could still look up or down and see his own reflection if he desired instead he looked out of the window a thick fog covered the city swirling greenblack about the towers obscuring the river it was evening with the sun al most completely set and the towers looked like strange unnatural rock formations jutting from a primordial sea if a great reptile had risen from it and pressed an eye to the grimy moisturestreaked window it would not have been surpris ing without the wall mirrors the room became even gloomier for there was no artificial source of light the baron framed against the window hummed to himself ignoring hawkmoon from somewhere in the depths of the city a faint distorted cry echoed through the fog and then faded baron meliadus lifted his wolfmask and looked carefully at hawkmoon whom he could now barely see come nearer to the window my lord he said hawkmoon moved forward his feet slipping once or twice on the rugs that partially covered the glass floor well meliadus began i have spoken to baron kalan and he reports an enigma a psyche he can hardly interpret he said it seemed that some part of it had died what did it die of i wonder of grief of humiliation of fear i had not expected such complications i had expected to bargain with you man to man trading something you desired for a service i required of you while i see no reason not to continue to obtain this service i am not altogether sure now how to go about it would you consider a bargain my lord duke what do you propose hawkmoon stared beyond the baron through the window at the darkening sky you have heard of count brass the old hero yes he is now lord guardian protector of the province of the kamarg i have heard that he has proved stubborn in opposing the will of the king emperor he has insulted granbretan we wish to encourage wisdom in him the way to do this will be to capture his daughter who is dear to him and bring her to granbretan as a hostage however he would trust no emissary that we sent nor any common stranger but he must have heard of your exploits at the battle of koln and doubtless sympathizes with you if you were to go to the kamarg seeking sanctuary from the empire of granbretan he would almost certainly welcome you once within his walls it would not be too difficult for a man of your resourcefulness to pick the right moment abduct the girl bring her back to us beyond the borders of the kamarg we should naturally be able to give you plenty of support the kamarg is a small territory you could easily escape that is what you desire of me just so in return we give you back your estates to rule as you please so long as you take no part against the dark empire whether in word or deed my people live in misery under granbretan hawkmoon said suddenly as if in revelation he spoke without passion but rather like one making an abstract moral decision it would be better for them if i ruled them ah baron meliadus smiled so my bargain does seem reasonable yes though i do not believe you will keep your part of it why not it is essentially to our advantage if a trouble some state can be ruled by someone whom it trustsand whom we may trust also i will go to the kamarg i will tell them the tale you sug gest i will capture the girl and bring her to granbretan hawkmoon sighed and looked at baron meliadus why not discomfited by the strangeness of hawkmoons manner unused to dealing with such a personality meliadus frowned we cannot be absolutely sure that you are not indulging in some complex form of deceit to trick us into releasing you although the mentality machine is infallible in the case of all other subjects who have been tested by it it could be that you are aware of some secret sorcery that confuses it i know nothing of sorcery so i believe almost baron meliaduss tone became somewhat cheerful but we have no need to fear there is an excellent precaution we can take against any treachery from you a precaution that will bring you back to us or kill you if we have reason no longer to trust you it is a device recently discovered by baron kalan though i understand it is not his original invention it is called the black jewel you will be supplied with it tomorrow tonight you will sleep in apartments prepared for you in the palace before you leave you will have the honor of being presented to his majesty the kingemperor few foreigners are granted so much with that meliadus called to the insectmasked guards and ordered them to escort hawkmoon to his quarters chapter three the black jewel next morning dorian hawkmoon was taken to see baron kalan again the serpentmask seemed to bear an al most cynical expression as it regarded him but the baron said hardly a word merely led him through a series of rooms and halls until they reached a room with a door of plain steel this was opened to reveal a similar door that when opened revealed a third door this led into a small blinding ly lighted chamber of white metal that contained a machine of intense beauty it consisted almost entirely of delicate red gold and silver webs strands of which brushed hawkmoons face and had the warmth and vitality of human skin faint music came from the webs which moved as if in a breeze it seems alive said hawkmoon it is alive baron kalan whispered proudly it is alive is it a beast no it is the creation of sorcery i am not even sure what it is i built it according to the instructions of a grimoire i bought from an easterner many years ago it is the machine of the black jewel ah and soon you will become much more intimately acquainted with it lord duke deep within him hawkmoon felt a faint stirring of panic but it did not begin to rise to the surface of his mind he let the strands of red and gold and silver caress him it is not complete kalan said not complete it must spin the jewel move closer to it my lord move in to it you will feel no pain i guarantee it must spin the black jewel hawkmoon obeyed the baron and the webs rustled and began to sing his ears became confounded the traceries of red gold and silver confused his eyes the machine of the black jewel fondled him seemed to enter him become him and he it he sighed and his voice was the music of the webs he moved and his limbs were tenuous strands there was pressure from within his skull and he felt a sense of absolute warmth and softness suffuse his body he drifted as if bodiless and lost the sense of passing time but he knew that the machine was spinning something from its own sub stance making something that became hard and dense and implanted itself in his forehead so that suddenly he seemed to possess a third eye and stared out at the world with a new kind of vision then gradually this faded and he was looking at baron kalan who had removed his mask the better to regard him hawkmoon felt a sudden sharp pain in his head the pain vanished almost at once he looked back at the machine but its colors had dulled and its webs seemed to have shrunk he lifted a hand to his forehead and felt with a shock something there that had not been there before it was hard and smooth it was part of him he shuddered baron kalan looked concerned eh you are not mad are you i was sure of success you are not mad i am not mad hawkmoon said but i think that i am afraid you will become accustomed to the jewel that is what is in my head the jewel aye the black jewel wait kalan turned and drew aside a curtain of scarlet velvet revealing a flat oval of milky quartz about two feet long in it a picture began to form hawkmoon saw that the picture was that of kalan staring into the quartz oval into infinity the screen revealed exactly what hawkmoon saw as he turned his head slightly the picture altered accordingly kalan muttered in delight it works you see what you perceive the jewel perceives wherever you go we shall be able to see everything and everyone you encounter hawkmoon tried to speak but he could not his throat was tight and there seemed to be something constricting his lungs again he touched the warm jewel so similar to flesh in texture but so unlike it in every other way what have you done to me he asked eventually his tone as flat as ever we have merely secured your loyalty chuckled kalan you have taken part of the life of the machine should we so desire we can give all the machines life to the jewel and then hawkmoon reached out stiffly and touched the barons arm what will it do it will eat your brain duke of koln it will eat your brain baron meliadus hurried dorian hawkmoon through the glittering passages of the palace now hawkmoon had a sword at his side and a suit of clothes and mail much like those he had worn at the battle of koln he was conscious of the jewel in his skull but of little else the passages widened until they covered the area of a goodsized street guards in the masks of the order of the mantis were thick along the walls mighty doors a mass of jewels making mosaic patterns towered ahead of them the throne room murmured the baron now the king emperor will inspect you slowly the doors moved open to reveal the glory of the throne room it blazed halfblinding hawkmoon with its magnificence there was glitter and music from a dozen galleries that rose to the concave roof were draped the shim mering banners of five hundred of granbretans noblest families lining the walls and galleries rigid with their flame lances at the salute were the soldiers of the order of the mantis in their insectmasks and their plate armor of black green and gold behind them in a multitude of different masks and a profusion of rich clothing were the courtiers they peered curiously at meliadus and hawkmoon as they entered the lines of soldiers stretched into the distance there at the end of the hall almost out of sight hung something that hawkmoon could not at first make out he frowned the throne globe whispered meliadus now do as i do he began to pace forward the walls of the throne room were of lustrous green and purple but the colors of the banners ranged the spectrum as did the fabrics metals and precious gems that the courtiers wore but hawkmoons eyes were fixed on the globe dwarfed by the proportions of the throne room hawk moon and meliadus walked with measured pace toward the throne globe while fanfares were played by trumpeters in the galleries to left and right eventually hawkmoon could see the throne globe and he was astonished it contained a milkywhite fluid that surged about sluggishly almost hypnotically at times the fluid seemed to contain iridescent radiance that would gradually fade and then return in the center of this fluid reminding hawkmoon of a fetus drifted an ancient ancient man his skin wrinkled his limbs apparently useless his head over large from this head stared sharp malicious eyes following meliaduss example hawkmoon abased himself before the creature rise came a voice hawkmoon realized with a shock that the voice came from the globe it was the voice of a young man in the prime of health a golden voice a melodic vi brant voice hawkmoon wondered from what youthful throat the voice had been torn kingemperor i present dorian hawkmoon duke von kohl who has elected to perform an errand for us youll remember noble sire that i mentioned my plan to you meliadus bowed as he spoke we go tomuch effort and considerable ingenuity to secure the services of this count brass came the golden voice we trust your judgment is sound in this matter baron meliadus you have reason to trust me on the strength of my past deeds great majesty meliadus said again bowing has the duke von koln been warned of the inevitable penalty he will pay if he does not serve us loyally came the youthful sardonic voice has he been told that we may destroy him in an instant from any distance meliadus stroked his sleeve he has mighty kingem peror you have informed him that the jewel in his skull con tinued the voice with relish sees all that he sees and shows it to us in the chamber of the machine of the black jewel aye noble monarch and you have made it clear to him that should he show any signs of betraying us any slight sign which we may easily detect by watching through his eyes the faces of those he speaks towe shall give the jewel its full life we shall release all the energy of the machine into its sibling have you told him baron meliadus that the jewel possessed of its full life will then eat its way through his brain devour his mind and turn him into a drooling mindless creature in essence great emperor he has been so informed the thing in the throne globe chuckled by the look of him baron the threat of mindlessness is no threat at all are you sure hes not already possessed of the jewels full life it is his character to seem thus immortal ruler now the eyes turned to peer into those of dorian hawk moon and the sardonic golden voice issued from the infinitely aged throat you have contracted a bargain duke von koln with the immortal kingemperor of granbretan it is a testament to our liberality that we should offer such a bargain to one who is after all our slave you must serve us in turn with great loyalty knowing that you share a part in the destiny of the greatest race ever to emerge on this planet it is our right to rule the earth by virtue of our omniscient intellect and omni potent might and soon we shall claim this right in full all who help serve our noble purpose will receive our approval go now duke and win that approval the wizened head turned and a prehensile tongue flickered from the mouth to touch a tiny jewel that drifted near the wall of the throne globe the globe began to dim until the fetuslike shape of the kingemperor last and immortal descendant of a dynasty founded almost three thousand years before ap peared for a few moments in silhouette and remember the power of the black jewel said the youthful voice before the globe took on the appearance of a solid dull black sphere the audience was ended abasing themselves meliadus and hawkmoon backed away a few paces and then turned to walk from the throne room and the audience had served a purpose not anticipated by the baron or his master within hawkmoons strange mind in its most hidden depths a tiny irritation had begun and the irritation was caused not by the black jewel that lay imbedded in his forehead but by a less tangible source perhaps the irritation was a sign of hawkmoons humanity returning perhaps it marked the growing of a new and al together different quality perhaps it was the influence of the runestaff chapter four journey to castle brass dorian hawkmoon was returned to his original apart ments in the prison catacombs and there waited for two days until baron meliadus arrived bearing with him a suit of black leather complete with boots and gauntlets a heavy black cloak with a cowl a silverhilted broadsword in a black leather scabbard simply decorated with silver and a black helmetmask wrought in the likeness of a snarling wolf the clothes and equipment were evidently modeled on meliaduss own your tale on reaching castle brass meliadus began will be a fine one you were made prisoner by myself and managed with the aid of a slave to drug me and pose as me in this disguise you crossed granbretan and all the provinces she controls before meliadus recovered from the drug a simple story is the best and this one serves not only to answer how you came to escape from granbretan but also to elevate you in the eyes of those who hate me i understand hawkmoon said fingering the heavy black jacket but how is the black jewel explained you were to be the subject of some experiment of mine but escaped before any serious harm could be done to you tell the story well hawkmoon for your safety will depend on it we shall be watching the reaction of count brass and particularly that wily rhyme maker bowgentle though we shall be unable to hear what you say we can read lips well enough any sign of betrayal on your part and we give the jewel its full life i understand hawkmoon repeated in the same flat tone meliadus frowned they will evidently note your strange ness of manner but with luck they will explain it by the misfortunes you have suffered it could make them even more solicitous hawkmoon nodded vaguely meliadus looked at him sharply i am still troubled by you hawkmoon i am still unsure that you have not by some sorcery or cunning deceived us but nonetheless i am certain of your loyalty the black jewel is my assurance he smiled now an ornithopter is waiting to take you to deauvere and the coast ready yourself my lord duke and serve granbretan faithfully if you are successful you shall soon be master of your own estates again the ornithopter had settled on the lawns beyond the city entrance to the catacombs it was a thing of great beauty fashioned in the shape of a gigantic griffin all worked in cop per brass silver and black steel squatting on its powerful lionlike haunches the fortyfoot wings folded on its back below the head in the small cockpit sat the pilot dressed in the birdmask of his order the order of the crow which was comprised of all flyers his gloved hands on the jeweled controls with some wariness hawkmoon now clad in the costume that so resembled meliaduss climbed in behind the pilot finding difficulty with his sword as he tried to seat himself in the long narrow seat eventually he settled into a position of comparative comfort and gripped the ribbed metal sides of the flying machine as the pilot depressed a lever and the wings clashed open and began to beat the air with a strange echoing boom the whole ornithopter shuddered and listed to one side for an instant before the pilot cursing had it under control hawkmoon had heard that there were dangers in flying these machines and had seen several that had attacked him at koln suddenly fold their wings behind them and hurtle to the ground but in spite of their instabilities the orni thopters of the dark empire had been the chief weapon in conquering so speedily the mainland of europe for no other race possessed flying machines of any kind now with an uncomfortable jerking motion the metal griffin slowly began to ascend the wings thrashed the air a parody of natural flight and they climbed higher and higher until they had cleared the tops of londras tallest towers and were circling toward the southeast hawkmoon breathed heavily disliking the unfamiliar sensation soon the monster had passed above a heavy layer of dark cloud and sunshine flashed on its metal scales his face and eyes protected by the mask through whose jeweled eyes he peered hawkmoon saw the sunlight refracted into a million rainbow flashes he closed his eyes time passed and he felt the ornithopter begin to descend he opened his eyes and saw that they were deep within the clouds again breaking through them to see ashgray fields the outline of a turreted city and the livid rolling sea beyond clumsily the machine flapped toward a great flat stretch of rock that rose from the center of the city it landed with a heavy bumping motion wings beating frenetically and at last halted close to the edge of the arti ficial plateau the pilot signaled for hawkmoon to get out he did so feeling stiff his legs shaking while the pilot locked his con trols and joined him on the ground here and there were other ornithopters as they walked across the rock beneath the lowering sky one began to flap into the air and hawkmoon felt wind slap against his face from the wings as the thing passed close above his head deauvere the crowmasked pilot said a port given over almost wholly to our aerial navies although ships of war still use the harbor soon hawkmoon could see a circular steel hatch in the rock ahead of them the pilot paused beside it and tapped out a complicated series of beats with his booted foot eventually the hatch swung downward revealing a stone stairway and they descended while the hatch swung shut above them the interior was gloomy with decorations of glowering stone gargoyles and some inferior basreliefs at last they emerged through a guarded door into a paved street between the square turreted buildings that filled the city the streets were crowded with the warriors of gran bretan groups of crowmasked flyers rubbed shoulders with the fish and seaserpentmasked crews of the menowar the infantrymen and the cavalry in a great variety of masks some of the order of the pig others of the orders of wolf skull mantis bull hound goat and many more swords slapped armored legs flamelances clashed in the press and every where was the gloomy jingle of military gear pushing through this throng hawkmoon was surprised that it gave way so easily until he remembered how closely he must resemble baron meliadus at the gates of the city there was a horse waiting for him its saddle panniers bulging with provisions hawkmoon had already been told about the horse and which road he must follow he mounted the animal and rode toward the sea very soon the clouds parted and sunshine broke through them and dorian hawkmoon saw for the first time the silver bridge that spanned thirty miles of sea it flashed in the sun light a beautiful thing seemingly too delicate to withstand the merest breeze but actually strong enough to bear all the armies of granbretan it curved away over the ocean beyond the horizon the causeway itself measured almost a quarter of a mile across flanked by quivering networks of silver hawsers supported by pylon archways intricately molded in military motifs across this bridge passed to and fro a splendid variety of traffic hawkmoon could see carriages of nobles so elaborate that it was hard to believe they could function squadrons of cavalry the horses as magnificently armored as their riders battalions of infantry marching four abreast with unbeliev able precision trading caravans of carts and beasts of burden with swaying stacks of every conceivable kind of goods furs silks meat carcasses fruit vegetables chests of treasure candlesticks beds whole suites of chairs much of which hawkmoon realized was loot from states like koln recently conquered by those same armies who passed the caravans war engines too he could see things of iron and copper with cruel beaks for ramming high towers for the siege long beams for hurling massive fireballs and boulders marching beside them in masks of mole and badger and ferret were the engineers of the dark empire with squat powerful bodies and large heavy hands all these things took on the aspect of ants dwarfed as they were by the majesty of the silver bridge which like the ornithopters had contributed greatly to the ease of granbretans conquests the guards on the bridges gateway had been told to let hawkmoon pass and the gateway opened as he neared it he rode straight onto the vibrating bridge his horses hooves clattering on the metal the causeway seen at this range lost some of its magnificence its surface had been scored and dented by the passage of the traffic here and there were piles of horse dung rags straw and less recognizable refuse it was impossible to keep such a wellused thoroughfare in perfect condition but somehow the soiled causeway symbolized something of the spirit of the strange civilization of gran bretan hawkmoon crossed the silver bridge across the sea and came after some time to the mainland of europe making his way toward the crystal city so lately conquered by the dark empire the crystal city of parye where he would rest for a day before beginning his journey south but he had more than a days journey before he came to the crystal city no matter how hard he rode he decided not to stay in karlye the city closest to the bridge but to find a village where he might rest for that night and then continue in the morning just before sunset he reached a village of pleasant villas and gardens that bore the marks of conflict indeed some of the villas were in ruins the village was strangely quiet though a few lights were beginning to burn in windows and the inn when he reached it had its doors closed and there were no signs of revelry from within he dismounted in the inns courtyard and banged on the door with his fist he waited for several minutes before the bar was withdrawn and a boys face peered out at him the boy looked frightened when he saw the wolfmask reluctantly he drew the door open to let hawkmoon enter as soon as he was inside hawkmoon pushed back the mask and tried to smile at the boy to give him reassurance but the smile was artificial for hawkmoon had forgotten how to move his lips correctly the boy seemed to take the expression as one of disapproval and he backed away his eyes halfdefiant as if expecting a blow at very least i mean you no harm hawkmoon said stiffly only take care of my horse and give me a bed and some food ill leave at dawn master we have only the humblest food murmured the boy partly reassured the people of europe in those days were used to occupation by this faction or that and the con quest of granbretan was not in essence a new experience the ferocity of the people of the dark empire was new however and this was plainly what the boy feared and hated expecting not even the roughest justice from one who was evidently a noble of granbretan ill take whatever you have save your best food and wine if you will i seek only to satisfy my hunger and sleep sire our best food is all gone if we hawkmoon silenced him with a gesture i am not inter ested boy take me literally and you will serve me best he looked about the room and noted one or two old men sitting in the shadows drinking from heavy tankards and avoiding looking at him he went to the center of the room and seated himself at a small table stripping off his cloak and gauntlets and wiping the dust of the road from his face and body the wolfmask he dumped on the ground beside his chair a most uncharacteristic gesture for a noble of the dark empire he noticed one of the men glance at him in some surprise and when a murmur broke out a little later he realized they had seen the black jewel the boy returned with thin ale and some scraps of pork and hawkmoon had the feeling that this was indeed their best he ate the pork and drank the ale and then called to be taken to his room once in the sparsely furnished chamber he stripped off his gear bathed himself climbed between the rough sheets and was soon asleep during the night he was disturbed without realizing what had awakened him for some reason he felt drawn to the window and looked out in the moonlight he thought he saw a figure on a heavy warhorse looking up at his window the figure was that of a warrior in full armor his visor covering his face hawkmoon believed he caught a flash of jet and gold then the warrior had turned his horse and disappeared feeling that there was some significance to this event hawkmoon returned to his bed he slept again quite as soundly as before but in the morning he was not sure whether he had dreamed or not if it had been a dream then it was the first he had had since he had been captured a twinge of curiosity made him frown slightly as he dressed himself but he shrugged then and went down to the main room of the inn to ask for some breakfast hawkmoon reached the crystal city by the evening its buildings of purest quartz were alive with color and every where was the tinkle of the glass decorations that the citizens of parye used to adorn their houses and public buildings and monuments such a beautiful city it was that even the war lords of the dark empire had left it almost wholly intact preferring to take the city by stealth and waste several months rather than attack it but within the city the marks of occupation were everywhere from the look of permanent fear on the faces of the common folk to the beastmasked warriors who swaggered the streets the flags that flowed in the wind over the houses once owned by paryes noblemen now the flags were those of jarak nankenseen warlord of the order of the fly adaz promp grand constable of the order of the hound mygel hoist archduke of londra and asrovak mikosevaar renegade of muskovia mercenary warlord of the vulture legion pervert and destroyer whose legion had served granbretan even before her plan of european conquest became evident a madman to match even those insane nobles of granbretan he allowed to be his masters asrovak mikosevaar was always at the forefront of granbretans armies pushing the bound aries of empire onward his infamous banner with the words stitched in scarlet on it death to life struck fear into the hearts of all who fought against it asrovak mikosevaar must be resting in the crystal city hawkmoon decided for it was unlike him to be far from any battle line corpses drew the muskovian as roses drew bees there were no children in the streets of the crystal city those who had not been slaughtered by granbretan had been imprisoned by the conquerors to ensure the good behav ior of those citizens who remained alive the sun seemed to stain the crystal buildings with blood as it set and hawkmoon too weary to ride on was forced to find the inn meliadus had told him of and there sleep for the best part of a night and a day before resuming his journey to castle brass there was still more than half of that journey to finish beyond the city of lyon the empire of granbretan had so far been checked in its conquests but the road to lyon was a bleak road lined with gibbets and wooden crosses on which hung men and women young and old girls and boys and even perhaps as an insane jest domestic pets such as cats dogs and tame rabbits whole families rotted there entire households from the youngest baby to the oldest servant were nailed in attitudes of agony to the crosses the stench of decay inflamed hawkmoons nostrils as he let his horse plod miserably down the lyon road and the stink of death clogged his throat fire had blackened fields and forests razed towns and villages turned the very air gray and heavy all who lived had become beggars whatever their former station save those women who had become whores to the empires soldiery or those men who had sworn groveling allegiance to the kingemperor as curiosity had touched him earlier now disgust stirred faintly in hawkmoons breast but he hardly noticed it wolf masked he rode on toward lyon none stopped him none questioned him for those who served the order of the wolf were in the main fighting in the north and thus hawkmoon was safe from any wolf addressing him in the secret language of the order beyond lyon hawkmoon took to the fields for the roads were patrolled by granbretanian warriors he stuffed his wolfmask into one of his now empty panniers and rode swiftly into the free territory where the air was still sweet but where terror still blossomed save that this was a terror of the future rather than of the present in the town of valence where warriors prepared to meet the attack of the dark empire when it came discussing hopeless stratagems building inadequate war engineshawk moon told his story first i am dorian hawkmoon von koto he told the captain to whom the soldiers took him the captain one thighbooted foot on a bench in the crowded inn stared at him carefully the duke von koln must be dead by now he was captured by granbretan he said i think you are a spy hawkmoon did not protest but told the story meliadus had given him speaking expressionlessly he described his capture and his method of escape and his strange tone convinced the captain more than the story itself then a swordsman in battered mail pushed through the crowd shouting hawk moons name turning hawkmoon recognized the insignia on the mans coat as his own the arms of koln the man was one of the few who had fled the koln battlefield somehow he spoke to the captain and the crowd describing the dukes bravery and ingenuity then dorian hawkmoon was her alded as a hero in valence that night while his coming was celebrated hawkmoon told the captain that he was bound for the kamarg to try to recruit the help of count brass in the war against granbretan the captain shook his head count brass takes no sides he said but it is likely he will listen to you rather than anyone else i hope you are successful my lord duke next morning hawkmoon rode away from valence rode down the trail to the south while grimfaced men passed him riding north to join forces with those preparing to withstand the dark empire the wind blew harder and harder as hawkmoon neared his destination and saw at length the flat marshlands of the kamarg the lagoons shining in the distance the reeds bent beneath the mistrals force a lonely lovely land when he passed close to one of the tall old towers and saw the helio graph begin to flash he knew that his coming would be newsed to castle brass before he arrived there coldfaced hawkmoon sat his horse stiffly as it picked its way along the winding marsh road where shrubs swayed and water rippled and a few birds floated through the sad old skies shortly before nightfall castle brass came in sight its terraced hill and delicate towers a blackandgray silhouette against the evening light chapter five the awakening of hawkmoon count brass passed dorian hawkmoon a fresh cup of wine and murmured please continue my lord duke as hawkmoon told his story for the second time in the hall of castle brass sat yisselda in all her beauty bowgentle thoughtful of countenance and von villach who stroked his mustache and stared at the fire hawkmoon finished the tale and so i sought help in the kamarg count brass knowing that only this land is secure from the power of the dark empire you are welcome here count brass said frowning if refuge is all you seek that is all you do not come to ask us take arms against granbre tan it was bowgentle who spoke halfhopefully i have suffered enough from doing so myselffor the time being and would not wish to encourage others to risk meeting a fate i only narrowly missed myself replied hawk moon yisselda looked almost disappointed it was plain that all in the room save wise count brass wanted war with gran bretan for different reasons perhaps yisselda to revenge herself against meliadus bowgentle because he believed such evil must be countered von villach simply because he wished to exercise his sword again good said count brass for im tired of resisting arguments that i should help this faction or that now you seem exhausted my lord duke indeed i have rarely seen a man so tired we have kept you up too long i will personally show you to your chambers hawkmoon felt no triumph in having accomplished his deception he told the lies because he had agreed with mel iadus that he would tell such lies when the time came for kidnapping yisselda he would pursue the task in the same spirit count brass showed him into a suite consisting of bed chamber washing room and a small study i hope it is to your taste my lord duke completely hawkmoon replied count brass paused by the door the jewel he said the one in your foreheadyou say that meliadus was unsuccessful in his experiment that is so count aha count brass looked at the floor then after a moment glanced up again for i might know some sorcery that could remove it if it troubles you it does not trouble me said hawkmoon aha said the count again and left the room that night hawkmoon awoke suddenly as he had awak ened in the inn a few nights since and thought he saw a figure in the room an armored man in jet and gold his heavy lids fell shut for a moment or two and when he opened them again the figure was gone a conflict was beginning to develop in hawkmoons breast perhaps a conflict between humanity and the lack of it perhaps a conflict between conscience and the lack of conscience if such conflicts were possible whatever the exact nature of the conflict there was no doubt that hawkmoons character was changing for a second time it was not the character he had had on the battlefield at kohl nor the strange apathetic mood into which he had fallen since the battle but a new character altogether as if hawkmoon were being born again in a thoroughly different mold but the indications of this birth were still faint and a catalyst was needed as well as a climate in which the birth would be possible meanwhile hawkmoon woke up in the morning thinking how he might most speedily accomplish the capture of yiss elda and return to granbretan to be rid of the black jewel and sent back to the land of his youth bowgentle met him as he left his chambers the philosopherpoet took his arm ah my lord duke perhaps you could tell me something of londra i was never there though i traveled a great deal when i was younger hawkmoon turned to look at bowgentle knowing that the face he saw would be the same as the nobles of gran bretan would see by means of the black jewel there was an expression of frank interest in bowgentles eyes and hawk moon decided that the man did not suspect him it is vast and high and dark hawkmoon replied the architecture is involved and the decoration complex and various and its spirit what is the spirit of londra what was your impression power said hawkmoon confidence insanity i am incapable of knowing what is sane and what is not sir bowgentle you find me a strange man perhaps my manner is awkward my attitudes unlike those of other men surprised by this turn of the conversation bowgentle looked carefully at hawkmoon why yes but what is your reason for asking because i find your questions all but meaningless i say that without without wishing to insult hawkmoon rubbed his chin i find them meaningless you see they began to descend the steps toward the main hall where breakfast had been laid and where old von villach was already serving himself to a large steak from a salver held by a servant meaning murmured bowgentle you wonder what insanity is i wonder what meaning is i do not know hawkmoon answered i only know what i do your ordeal has driven you into yourself abolished mor ality and conscience bowgentle said with sympathy it is not an unfamiliar circumstance reading ancient texts one learns of many who under duress lost the same senses good food and affectionate company should restore them to you it was lucky you should come to castle brass perhaps an inner voice sent you to us hawkmoon listened without interest watching yisselda descend the opposite staircase and smile at himself and bow gentle across the hall are you well rested my lord duke she asked before hawkmoon could reply bowgentle said he has suffered more than we guessed it will take our guest a week or two i should think before he is fully recovered perhaps you would like to accompany me this morning my lord yisselda suggested graciously i will show you our gardens even in winter they are beautiful yes replied hawkmoon i should like to see them bowgentle smiled realizing that yisseldas warm heart had been touched by hawkmoons plight there could be no one better he thought than the girl to restore the dukes injured spirit they walked through the terraces of the castle gardens here were evergreens there winterblooming flowers and vegetables the sky was clear and the sun shone down and they did not suffer much discomfort from the wind muffled as they were in heavy cloaks they looked down on the roofs of the town and all was at peace yisseldas arm was linked in hawkmoons and she conversed lightly expecting no reply from the sadfaced man at her side the black jewel in his forehead had disturbed her a little at first until she had decided that it was scarcely different from a jeweled circlet such as she sometimes wore to keep her long hair from her eyes she had much warmth and affection in her young heart it was this affection that had turned to passion for baron meliadus for it needed as many outlets as it could have she was content to offer it to this strange stiff hero of koln and hope that it might heal the wounds of his spirit she soon noticed that the only time that a hint of expression came into his eyes was when she mentioned his homeland tell me of koln she said not as it is now but as it was as one day it might be again her words reminded hawkmoon of meliaduss promise to restore his lands he looked away from the girl and up at the windblown sky folding his arms across his chest koln she said softly was it like the kamarg no he turned to stare down at the rooftops far below no for the kamarg is wild and as it has always been since the beginning of time koln bore the mark of man everywhere in its hedged fields and its straight watercourses its little winding roads and its farms and villages it was only a small province with fat cows and wellfed sheep with hayricks and meadows of soft grass that sheltered rabbits and fieldmice it had yellow fences and cool woods and the smoke from a chimney was never far from sight its people were simple and friendly and kind to small children its build ings were old and quaint and as simple as the people who lived in them there was nothing dark in koln till gran bretan came a flood of harsh metal and fierce fire from across the rhine and granbretan also put the mark of man upon the countryside the mark of the sword and the torch he sighed an increasing trace of emotion entering his tone the mark of the sword and the torch replacing the mark of the plow and the harrow he turned to look at her and the cross and gibbet were made from the timber of the yellow fences and the carcasses of the cows and sheep clogged the watercourses and poisoned the land and the stones of the farmhouses became ammunition for the catapults and the people became corpses or soldiers there was no other choice she put her soft hand on his leathern arm you speak as if the memory were very distant she said the expression faded from his eyes and they became cold again so it is so it is like an old dream it means little to me now but yisselda looked at him thoughtfully as she led him through the gardens thinking that she had found a way to reach him and help him for his part hawkmoon had been reminded of what he would lose if he did not carry the girl to the dark lords and he welcomed her attention for reasons other than she guessed count brass met them in the courtyard he was inspecting a large old warhorse and talking to a groom put him out to graze count brass said his service is over then he came toward hawkmoon and his daughter sir bowgentle tells me you are wearier than we thought he said to hawkmoon but you are welcome to stay at castle brass for as long as you like i hope yisselda is not tiring you with her conversa tion no i find it restful good tonight we have an entertainment i have asked bowgentle to read to us from his latest work hes promised to give us something light and witty i hope you will en joy it hawkmoon noticed that count brasss eyes looked at him acutely though his manner was hearty enough could count brass suspect his mission the count was renowned for his wisdom and judgment of character but surely if his character had baffled baron kalan then it must also confuse the count hawkmoon decided that there was nothing to fear he allowed yisselda to lead him into the castle that night there was a banquet with all castle brasss best laid out on the large board around the table sat several leading citizens of the kamarg several bull breeders of repute and several bullfighters including the nowrecovered mahtan just whose life count brass had saved a year before fish and fowl red meat and white vegetables of every kind wine of a dozen varieties ale and many delicious sauces and garnishes were heaped upon the long table on count brasss right sat dorian hawkmoon and on his left sat mahtan just who had become that seasons champion just plainly adored the count and treated him with a respect that the count seemed to find a trifle uncomfortable beside hawkmoon sat yisselda and opposite her bowgentle at the other end of the table was seated old zhonzhac ekare greatest of the famous bull breeders clad in heavy furs and with his face hidden by his huge beard and thick head of hair laughing often and eating mightily beside him sat von villach and the two men seemed to enjoy each others company a great deal when the feast was almost complete and pastries and sweetmeats and rich kamarg cheese had been cleared each guest had placed before him three flagons of wine of different kinds a short barrel of ale and a great drinking cup yisselda alone was given a single bottle and a smaller cup though she had matched the men for drinking earlier and it seemed to be her choice rather than the form to drink less the wine had clouded hawkmoons mind a little and given him what was perhaps a spurious appearance of normal hu manity he smiled once or twice and if he did not answer his companions jest for jest at least he did not offend them with a sour expression bowgentles name was roared by count brass bowgentle the ballad you promised us bowgentle rose smiling his face flushed like the others with the wine and the good food i call this ballad the emperor glaucoma and hope it will amuse you he said and began to speak the words the emperor glaucoma passed the formal guardsmen at the far arcade and entered the bazaar where the ornamental remnants of the last war knights templar and the ottoman hosts of alcazar and mighty khan lay in the shade of temple palms and called for alms but the emperor glaucoma passed the lazar undismayed while pipes and tabor played in honor of the emperors parade count brass was looking carefully at bowgentles grave face a wry smile on his own lips meanwhile the poet spoke with wit and many graceful flourishes the complex rhyme hawkmoon looked about the board and saw some smiling some looking puzzled fuddled as they were by the drink hawkmoon neither smiled nor frowned yisselda bent toward him and murmured something but he did not hear it the regatta in the harbor set off a cannonade when the emperor displayed stigmata to the vatican ambassador what does he speak of grumbled von villach ancient things nodded old zhonzhac ekare before the tragic millennium id rather hear a battle song zhonzhac ekare put a finger to his bearded lips and silenced his friend while bowgentle continued who made gifts of alabaster damascusblade and paris plaster from the tomb of zoroaster where the nightshade and the oleaster bloom hawkmoon hardly heard the words but the rhythms seemed to have a peculiar effect on him at first he thought it was the wine but then he realized that at certain points in the recitation his mind would seem to shudder and forgotten sensations would well up in his breast he swayed in his chair bowgentle looked hard at hawkmoon as he continued his poem gesticulating in an exaggerated way the poet laureate in laurel and orange brocade chased with topaz and opal and lucent jade fragrant of pomander redolent to myrrh and lavender the treasure of samarcand and thrace fell prostrate in the marketplace are you well my lord asked yisselda leaning toward hawkmoon and speaking with concern hawkmoon shook his head i am well enough thanks he was wondering if in some way he had offended the lords of granbretan and they were even now giving the black jewel its full life his head was swimming insensate and while choral anthems told his glory the emperor majestical in slippers of gold and ivory upon him trod and throngs applaud the mortal god now all hawkmoon saw was the figure and face of bow gentle heard nothing but the rhythms and the vowel rhymes and wondered about enchantment and if bowgentle were seeking to enchant him what was his reason from windows and towers gaily arrayed with garlands of flowers and fresh bouquets the children sprayed showers of meadowrue roses and nosegays of hyacinth into the crossways where glaucoma passed down to the causeways from steeples and parapets children threw violets plum blossoms lilies and peonies and last themselves when glaucoma passed hawkmoon took a long draft of wine and breathed deeply staring at bowgentle as the poet continued with his verse the moon shone dim the hot sun swayed and still delayed the noon the stars bestrewn with seraphim upraised a hymn for soon the emperor would stand before the sacred ruin sublime and lay his hand upon that door unknown to time that he alone of mortal man may countermand hawkmoon gasped as a man might when plunged into icy water yisseldas hand was on his sweatwet brow and her sweet eyes were troubled my lord hawkmoon stared at bowgentle as the poet went relent lessly on glaucoma passed with eyes downcast the grave ancestral portal inlaid with precious stone and pearl and bone and ruby he passed the portal and the colonnade while trombone sounds and trumpets blast and earth trembles and above a host assembles and the scent of ambergris is burning in the air dimly hawkmoon glimpsed yisseldas hand touching his face but he did not hear what she said his eyes were fixed on bowgentle his ears were concentrated on listening to the verse a goblet had fallen from his hand he was plainly ill but count brass made no move to help count brass instead looked from hawkmoon to bowgentle his face halfhidden behind his winecup an ironic expression in his eyes now the emperor releases a snowwhite dove o a dove as fair as peace is so rare that love increases everywhere hawkmoon groaned at the far end of the table von villach banged his winecup on the table id agree with that why not the mountain bloodletting its a good the emperor released that snowwhite dove and it flew till none could sight it flew through the bright air flew through fire flew still higher still flew higher right into the sun to die for the emperor glaucoma hawkmoon staggered to his feet tried to speak to bow gentle fell across the table spilling wine in all directions is he drunk von villach asked in a tone of disgust he is ill called yisselda oh he is ill he is not drunk i think count brass said leaning over hawkmoons body and raising an eyelid but he is certainly insensible he looked up at bowgentle and smiled bow gentle smiled back and then shrugged i hope you are sure of that count brass he said hawkmoon lay all night in a deep coma and awoke the next morning to find bowgentle who acted as physician to the castle bending over him whether what had happened had been caused by drink the black jewel or bowgentle he still could not be sure now he felt hot and weak a fever my lord duke bowgentle said softly but we shall cure you never fear then yisselda was there seating herself beside his bed she smiled at him bowgentle says it is not serious she told him i will nurse you soon you will be in good health again hawkmoon looked into her face and felt a great flood of emotion fill him lady yisselda yes my lord i thank you he looked about the room in bewilderment from behind him he heard a voice speak urgently it was count brasss voice say nothing more rest control your thoughts sleep if you can hawkmoon had not realized count brass was in the room now yisselda put a glass to his lips he drank the cool liquid and was soon asleep again the next day the fever was gone and rather than an absence of emotion dorian hawkmoon felt as if he were numbed physically and spiritually he wondered if he had been drugged yisselda came to him as he was finishing breakfast and asked if he were ready to accompany her on a walk through the gardens since the day was fine for the season he rubbed his head feeling the strange warmth of the black jewel beneath his hand with some alarm he dropped his hand do you still feel ill my lord asked yisselda no i hawkmoon sighed i dont know i feel odd its unfamiliar some fresh air perhaps will clear your head passively hawkmoon got up to go with her into the gardens the gardens were scented with all kinds of pleasant smells and the sun was bright making the shrubs and trees stand out sharply in the clear winter air the touch of yisseldas arm linked in his stirred hawk moons feelings further it was a pleasant sensation as was the bite of the wind in his face and the sight of the terraced gardens and the houses below as well as these he felt fear and distrust fear of the black jewel for he was sure that it would destroy him if he betrayed any sign of what he was now going through and distrust of count brass and the rest for he felt that they were in some way deceiving him and had more than an inkling of his purpose in coming to castle brass he could seize the girl now steal a horse and perhaps stand a good chance of escaping he looked at her suddenly sweetly she smiled up at him has the air made you feel better my lord duke he stared down into her face while many emotions con flicted within him better he said hoarsely better i am not sure are you tired no his head had begun to ache and again he felt afraid of the black jewel he reached out and grasped the girl thinking that he was falling from weakness she took his arms and tried to support him his hands went limp and he could do nothing yon are very kind he said you are a strange man she replied half to herself you are an unhappy man ayehe pulled away from her and began to walk over the turf to the edge of the terrace could the lords of granbretan know what was going on within him it was un likely it was likely on the other hand that they were sus picious and might give the black jewel its life at any moment he took a deep breath of the cold air and straightened his shoulders remembering the voice of count brass from the night before control your thoughts he had said the pain in his head was increasing he turned i think we had better return to the castle he told yisselda she nodded and took his arm again and they walked back the way they had come in the main hall count brass met them his expression was one of kindly concern and there was nothing in his face to confirm the urgency of tone hawkmoon had heard last night hawkmoon wondered if he had dreamed that or if count brass had guessed the nature of the black jewel and was acting to deceive it and the dark lords who even now watched this scene from the palace laboratories in londra the duke von koln is feeling unwell yisselda said i am distressed to hear it count brass answered is there anything you need my lord no hawkmoon replied thickly no i thank you he walked as steadily as he could toward the stairs yisselda went with him supporting one arm until they reached his rooms at the door he paused and looked down at her her eyes were wide and full of sympathy she lifted a soft hand to touch his cheek for an instant the touch sent a shudder through him and he gasped then she had turned and half run down the passage hawkmoon entered the room and flung himself on his bed his breathing shallow his body tense desperately trying to understand what was happening to him and what was the source of the pain in his head at length he slept again he awoke in the afternoon feeling weak the pain had nearly gone and bowgentle was beside the bed placing a bowl of fruit on a nearby table i was mistaken in believing the fever had left you he said what is happening to me hawkmoon murmured as far as i can tell a mild fever brought about by the hardships you have suffered and i am afraid by our hospit ality doubtless it was too soon for you to eat rich food and drink so much wine we should have realized that you will be well enough in a short time however my lord privately hawkmoon knew this diagnosis to be wrong but he said nothing he heard a cough to his left and turned his head but saw only the open door leading to the dressing room someone was within that room he looked question ingly back at bowgentle but the mans face was blank as he pretended an interest in hawkmoons pulse you must not fear said the voice from the next room we wish to help you the voice was count brasss we understand the nature of the jewel in your forehead when you feel rested rise and go to the main hall where bowgentle will engage you in some sort of trivial conversation do not be surprised if his actions seem a little strange bowgentle pursed his lips and straightened up you will soon be fit again my lord i take my leave of you now hawkmoon watched him leave the room and heard another door close also count brass leaving how could they have discovered the truth and how would it affect him even now the dark lords must be wondering about the odd turn of events and suspecting something they might release the full life of the black jewel at any moment for some reason this knowledge disturbed him much more than it had hawkmoon decided that there was nothing he could do but obey count brasss command though it was just as likely that the count if he had discovered the purpose of hawkmoons presence here would be as vengeful as the lords of granbretan hawkmoons situation was an un pleasant one in all its possibilities when the room darkened and evening came hawkmoon got up and walked down to the main hall it was empty he looked around him in the flickering firelight wondering if he had not been induced to enter some sort of trap then bowgentle came through the far door and smiled at him he saw bowgentles lips move but no sound came from them bowgentle then pretended to pause as if listening to hawkmoons reply and hawkmoon realized then that this was a deception for the benefit of those who watched through the power of the black jewel when he heard a footfall behind him he did not turn but instead pretended to reply to bowgentles conversation then count brass spoke from behind him we know what the black jewel is my lord duke we understand that you were induced by those of granbretan to come here and we believe we know the purpose of your visit i will explain hawkmoon was struck by the oddness of the situation as bowgentle mimed speech and the counts deep voice came as if from nowhere when you first arrived here at castle brass count brass continued i realized that the black jewel was something more than you said it was even if you did not yourself realize it i am afraid that those of the dark empire do me little credit for i have studied quite as much sorcery and science as they and have a grimoire in which the machine of the black jewel is described however i did not know whether you were a knowing or unknowing victim of the jewel and i had to discover this without the granbretanians realizing it thus on the night of the banquet i asked sir bowgentle there to disguise a rune as a pretty set of verses the purpose of this rune would be to rob you of consciousness and thus rob the jewel also so that we could study you without the lords of the dark empire realizing it we hoped that they would think you drunk and not connect bowgentles pretty rhymes with your own sudden infirmity the rune speaking began with its special rhythms and cadences designed for your ears it served its purpose and you passed into a deep coma while you slept bowgentle and i managed to reach through to your inner mind which was buried deeply like a frightened animal that digs a bur row so far underground that it begins to stifle to death already certain events had brought your inner mind a little closer to the surface than it had been in granbretan and we were able to question it we discovered most of what had happened to you in londra and when i learned of your mission here i almost dispatched you but then i realized that there was a conflict in you which even you were scarcely aware of if this conflict had not been evident i would have killed you myself or let the black jewel do its work hawkmoon pretending to reply to bowgentles nonexistent conversation shuddered in spite of himself however count brass went on i realized that you were not to blame for what had occurred and that in killing you i might destroy a potentially powerful enemy of gran bretan though i remain neutral granbretan has done too much to offend me for me to let such a man die thus we worked out this scheme in order to inform you of what we know and also to say that there is hope i have the means of temporarily nullifying the power of the black jewel when i have finished you will accompany bowgentle down to my chambers where i will do what must be done we have little time before the lords of granbretan lose patience and release the jewels full life into your skull hawkmoon heard count brasss footfalls leave the hall and then bowgentle smiled and said aloud so if you would care to accompany me my lord i will show you some parts of the castle you have not as yet visited few guests have seen count brasss private chambers hawkmoon realized that these words were spoken for the benefit of the watchers in granbretan doubtless bowgentle was hoping to whet their curiosity and thus gain time bowgentle led the way out of the main hall and into a passage that ended at what appeared to be a solid wall hung with tapestries pushing the tapestries aside bowgentle touched a small stud set in the stone of the wall and imme diately a section of it began to glow brightly and then faded to reveal a portal through which by stooping a man could pass hawkmoon went through followed by bowgentle and found himself in a small room the walls hung with old charts and diagrams this room was left and another entered larger than the first it contained a great mass of alchemical appara tus and was lined with bookshelves full of huge old volumes of chemistry sorcery and philosophy this way murmured bowgentle drawing aside a curtain to reveal a dark passage hawkmoons eyes strained as he tried to peer through the darkness but it was impossible he stepped cautiously along the passage and then it was suddenly alive with blinding white light revealed in silhouette was the looming figure of count brass a strangely wrought weapon in his hands pointed at hawkmoons head hawkmoon gasped and tried to leap aside but the passage was too narrow there was a crack that seemed to burst his eardrums a weird melodious humming sound and he fell back losing consciousness awakening in golden half light hawkmoon had a sense of astonishing physical wellbeing his whole mind and body felt alive as if it had never been alive before he smiled and stretched he was lying on a metal bench alone he reached up and touched his forehead the black jewel was still there but its texture had changed no longer did it feel like flesh no longer did it possess an unnatural warmth instead it felt like any ordinary jewel hard and smooth and cold a door opened and count brass entered looking down at him with an expression of satisfaction i am sorry if i alarmed you yesterday evening he said but i had to work rapidly paralyzing the black jewel and capturing the life force in it i now possess that life force imprisoned by means both physical and sorcerous but i can not hold it forever it is too strong at some time it will escape and flow back into the jewel in your forehead no matter where you are so i am reprieved but not saved hawkmoon said how long does the reprieve last i am not sure six months almost certainly perhaps a year perhaps two but then again it could be a matter of hours i cannot deceive you dorian hawkmoon but i can give you extra hope there is a sorcerer in the east who could remove the black jewel from your head he is opposed to the dark empire and might help you if you could ever find him what is his name malagigi of hamadan of persia then this sorcerer aye nodded count brass so far away as to be almost out of your reach hawkmoon sighed and sat up well then i must hope your sorcery lasts long enough to sustain me for just a little while i will leave your lands count brass and go to valence to join the army there it gathers against granbretan and cannot win but at least i will take a few of the kingemper ors dogs with me by way of vengeance for all they did to me count brass smiled wryly i give you back your life and you immediately decide to sacrifice it i would suggest that you think for a while before you take any action of any kind how do you feel my lord duke dorian hawkmoon swung his legs off the bench and stret ched again awake he said a new man he frowned aye a new man he murmured thoughtfully and i agree with you count brass vengeance can wait until a subtler scheme presents itself in saving you count brass said almost sadly i took away your youth you will never know it again chapter six the battle of the kamarg they spread neither to east nor west said bow gentle one morning some two months later but carve their way directly south there is no doubt count brass that they realize the truth and plan revenge upon you perhaps their vengeance is directed at me hawkmoon said from where he sat in a deep armchair on one side of the fire if i were to go to meet them they might be satisfied no doubt they think of me as a traitor count brass shook his head if i know baron meliadus he wants the blood of all of us now he and his wolves lead the armies they will not stop until they reach our bound aries von villach turned from the window where he had been looking out over the town let them come we will blow them away as the mistral blows the leaves from the trees let us hope so said bowgentle doubtfully they have massed their forces for the first time they seem to have ignored their usual tactics aye the fools muttered count brass i admired them for the way they spread out in a widening semicircle that way they could always strengthen their rear before advancing now they have unconquered territory on both flanks and enemy armies capable of closing off their rear if we beat them theyll have a hard time retreating baron meliaduss vendetta against us robs him of his good sense but if they win hawkmoon said softly they will have built a road from ocean to ocean and their conquering will be the easier for that possibly that is how meliadus justifies his action bow gentle agreed i fear he could be right in anticipating such an outcome nonsense von villach grumbled our towers will resist granbretan they were designed to withstand an attack from land bowgentle pointed out we did not reckon for the aerial navies of the dark empire we have our own army of the air count brass said the flamingoes are not made of metal bowgentle replied hawkmoon rose he still wore the black leather doublet and breeches given him by meliadus the leather creaked as he moved within a few weeks at most the dark empire will be at our door he said what preparations must be made bowgentle tapped the large map he had rolled under his arm first we should study this count brass pointed spread it on yonder table as bowgentle spread the map using wine cups to keep the edges down count brass von villach and hawkmoon gathered round the map showed the kamarg and the land surrounding it for some hundred miles they are more or less following the river along its eastern bank count brass said indicating the rhone from what the messenger said they should be here his finger touched the foothills of the cevennes within a week we must send out scouts and make sure we know their movements from moment to moment then when they reach our borders we must have our main force grouped at exactly the right posi tion they might send in their ornithopters ahead hawkmoon said what then well have our own air scouts circling and be able to anticipate them von villach growled and the towers will be able to deal with them if the air riders cannot your actual forces are small hawkmoon put in so you will be depending heavily on these towers fighting an almost entirely defensive action that is all we shall need to do count brass told him we shall wait at our own borders with ranks of infantry filling in the spaces between the towers using heliographers and other signalers to direct the towers to where their power will be most needed we seek only to stop their attack on us bowgentle said with a hint of sarcasm we have no intention of doing more than withstand them count brass glanced at him and frowned just so bow gentle we should be fools to press an attack our few against their many our only hope of survival is to depend on the towers and show the kingemperor and his minions that the kamarg can resist anything he cares to try whether open battle or long siege attack from land sea or air to expend men on warfare beyond our borders would be senseless and what say you friend hawkmoon bowgentle asked you have had experience of battle with the dark empire hawkmoon paused consulting the map i see the sense of count brasss tactics i have learned to my cost that any formal battle with granbretan is out of the question but it occurs to me that we could weigh the odds further to our advantage if we could pick our own battleground where are the defenses strongest von villach pointed to an area southeast of the rhone here where the towers are thickest and there is high ground where our men could group at the same time the ground over which the enemy would have to come is marshy in this season and would cause them some difficulty he shrugged but what point is there in such wishful discussion they will pick the point of attack not we unless they could be driven there hawkmoon said what would drive them a storm of knives count brass smiled would hawkmoon told him with the aid of a couple of hundred mounted warriors never engaging them in open battle but constantly nibbling at their flanks we could guide them with luck to that spot as your dogs drive your bulls at the same time we should have them always in sight and be able to send messages to you so that you would know at all times exactly where they were count brass rubbed at his mustaches and looked at hawk moon with some respect a tactician after my own heart perhaps im becoming overcautious after all in my old age if i were younger i might have conceived a similar scheme it could work young hawkmoon with a great deal of luck von villach cleared his throat aye luck and endurance dyou realize what youre taking on lad thered be scant time for sleeping youd have to be on your guard at all hours its a grueling task youre considering would you be man enough for it and could the soldiers you take stand it then theres the flying machines to consider wed only need to keep watch for their scouts hawk moon said for wed strike and run before they could get their main force into the air your men know the terrain know where to hide bowgentle pursed his lips theres another consideration the reason theyre following the river is to be near their water carried supplies theyre using the river to carry provisions spare mounts war engines ornithopters which is why they move so rapidly how could they be induced to part company with their barges hawkmoon thought for a moment then grinned not too difficult a question to answer listen next day dorian hawkmoon went riding across the wild marshland the lady yisselda at his side they had spent much time together since his recovery and he was deeply attached to her though he seemed to show her little attention content enough to be near him she was yet sometimes piqued that he made no demonstration of affection she did not know that he wanted nothing more than to do so but he felt a responsibility toward her that made him control his natural desire to court her for he knew that at any moment of the night or day he might become in the space of a few minutes a mindless sham bling creature bereft of his humanity he lived constantly in the knowledge that the black jewels power could burst the bonds count brass had cast around it and that shortly after ward the lords of granbretan would give the jewel its full life and it would eat his mind so he did not tell her that he loved her and that this love had first stirred his inner mind from its slumber and that because he saw this count brass had spared his life and she was for her part too shy to tell him of her love they rode together over the marshes feeling the wind in their faces tugging at their cloaks galloping faster than was wise through the winding hidden causeways through the la goons and swamps disturbing quail and duck sending them squawking into the skies coming upon herds of wild horses and stampeding them alarming the white bulls and their wives galloping to the long lonely beaches where the cold surf spread splashing through the spray beneath the shadows of the watchful guard towers laughing up at the lowering clouds horses hooves beating on the sand and at length bringing their steeds to a halt to stare out to sea and shout above the song of the mistral you leave tomorrow bowgentle tells me she called and the wind dropped for a moment and all was suddenly still aye tomorrow he turned his sad face to her then quickly turned away again tomorrow it will not be long before i return do not be killed dorian he laughed reassuringly its not my fate i think to be killed by granbretan if it were id be dead several times over she began to reply but then the wind came roaring in again catching her hair and curling it about her face he leaned over to disentangle it feeling her soft skin and wishing with all his heart that he could hold her face cupped in his hands and touch her lips with his she reached up to grasp his wrist and keep his hand where it was but he withdrew it gently wheeled his horse and began to ride inland toward castle brass the clouds streamed across the sky above the flattened reeds and the rippling water of the lagoons a little rain fell but hardly enough to dampen their shoulders they rode back slowly both lost in their own thoughts clad in chain mail from throat to feet a steel helm with nasals to protect head and face a long tapering broadsword at his side a shield without insignia dorian hawkmoon raised his hand to bring his men to a halt the men bristled with weapons bows slings some flamelances throwing axes spears anything that could be hurled from a distance they were slung across their backs over their pommels tied to the sides of their horses carried in their hands and at their belts hawkmoon dismounted and followed his outrider to ward the crest of the hill bending low and moving cautiously reaching the top he lay on his belly and looked down into the valley where the river wound it was his first sight of the full might of granbretan it was like a vast legion out of hell moving slowly south ward battalion upon battalion of marching infantry squad ron after squadron of cavalry every man masked so that it seemed that the entire animal kingdom marched against the kamarg tall banners sprouted from this throng and metal standards swayed on long poles there was the banner of asrovak mikosevaar with its grinning swordwielding corpse on whose shoulder a vulture perched beneath it were stitched the words death to life the tiny figure swaggering in his saddle close to this standard must be asrovak mikosevaar himself next to baron meliadus he was the most ruthless of all the warlords of granbretan nearby was the cat standard of duke vendel grand constable of that order the fly banner of lord jarak nankenseen and a hundred other sim ilar flags of a hundred other orders even the mantis banner was there though the grand constable was absent he was the kingemperor huon but in the forefront rode the wolf masked figure of meliadus carrying his own standard the snarling figure of a rampant wolf even his horse caparisoned all in armor with fancifully wrought chamfron resembling the head of a gigantic wolf the ground shook even at this distance as the army moved on and through the air came the jingle and clatter of its arms the stench of sweat and of animals hawkmoon did not look for long at the army proper he concentrated on the river beyond noting the vast numbers of heavily laden barges that lay side by side so thick that they almost hid the water he smiled and whispered to the scout at his side it suits our plan you see all their watercraft bunched together come we must circle their army and get a good distance behind it they ran back down the hill hawkmoon climbed into his saddle and waved for his men to move on following him they rode at speed knowing there was little time to spare they rode for the best part of that day until the army of granbretan was merely a cloud of dust to the south and the river was free of the dark empires ships here the rhone narrowed and became shallow running through an artificial watercourse of ancient stone with a low stone bridge span ning it the ground on one side was flat and on the other it sloped gently down to form a valley wading through this part of the river as evening came hawkmoon looked carefully at the stone banks looked up at the bridge and tested the nature of the river bed itself while water rushed around his legs chilling them as it crept between the links of his mail stockings the watercourse was in poor repair it had been built before the tragic millennium and hardly repaired since it had been used to divert the river for some reason now hawkmoon intended to put it to a new use on the bank waiting for his signal were grouped his flame lancers holding their long unwieldy weapons carefully hawkmoon climbed back to the bank and began pointing out certain spots on the bridge and the banks the flame lancers saluted and began to move in the directions he had indicated raising their weapons hawkmoon stretched his arm toward the west where the ground fell away and called to them they nodded as the sky darkened red flame began to roar from the tapering snouts of the weapons cut its way into stone turned water into boiling steam until all was heat and tumbling chaos through the night the flamelances did their work then suddenly there was a great groan and the bridge collapsed into the river in a great cloud of spray sending scalding water in all directions now the flamelancers turned their attention to the western bank carving out blocks that tumbled down into the dammed river which was beginning to spread out around the bridge that blocked it by morning water rushed down a new course into the valley and only a small stream flowed along the original bed tired but satisfied hawkmoon and his men grinned at one another and mounted their horses turning away in the direc tion whence they had come they had struck their first blow against granbretan and it was an effective blow hawkmoon and his soldiers rested in the hills for a few hours and then went to look at the dark empires army again hawkmoon smiled as he lay beneath the cover of a bush and looked down into the valley at the scene of confusion there the river was now a morass of dark mud and in it like so many stranded whales lay the battle barges of granbretan some with prows jutting high and sterns buried deep in the stuff of the riverbed some on their sides some bowfirst in the mud some upsidedown war engines scattered livestock in panic provisions ruined and wading among all this the sol diers attempted to haul the mudencrusted cargoes to land free horses from their entangling ropes and straps and rescue sheep pigs and cows that struggled wildly in the morass there was a great noise of bellowing animals and shouting men the uniform ranks that hawkmoon had seen earlier were now broken on the banks proud cavalrymen were being forced to use their horses like dray animals to haul barges closer to firm ground elsewhere camps had been erected as meliadus had realized the impossibility of moving on until the cargoes were rescued although guards had been posted around the camps their attention was on the river and not on the hills where hawkmoon and his men waited it was coming close to dark and since the ornithopters could not fly at night baron meliadus would not know the exact reason for the rivers sudden drying up until the next day then hawkmoon reasoned he would dispatch engin eers upriver to try to put right the damage but hawkmoon was prepared for this now it was time to ready his men he crept back down to the depression in the hillside where his soldiers were bivou acked and began to confer with his captains he had a partic ular objective in view one he hoped might help demoralize the warriors of granbretan nightfall and by the light of brands the men in the valley continued their work manhandling the heavy war engines to the bank dragging cases of provisions up the steep sides of the riverbed meliadus whose impatience to reach the kamarg allowed his men no rest rode among the weary sweating soldiers urging them on behind him each great circle of tents surrounded the particular standard of its order but few of the tents were fully occupied since most of the forces were still at work no one saw the approaching shapes of the mounted war riors whose horses walked softly down from the hills each man swathed in a dark cloak hawkmoon drew ms horse to a halt and his right hand went to his left side where the fine sword meliadus had given him was scabbarded he swept the sword out raised it for a moment then pointed it forward it was the signal to charge without warcries their only sound the thunder of their horses hooves and the clank of their accoutrements the kamargians plunged forward led by hawkmoon who leaned across his horses neck and made straight for a surprised guard his sword took the man in the throat and with a gurgling murmur the guard collapsed through the first of the tents they went slashing at guy ropes cutting down the few armed men who tried to stop them and still the granbre tanians had no idea who attacked them hawkmoon reached the center of the first circle and his sword swung in a great arc as he chopped at the standard that stood there the stan dard of the order of the hound the pole cracked groaned and fell into a cooking fire sending up a great shower of sparks hawkmoon did not pause he urged his horse on into the heart of the huge camp on the riverbank there was no alarm for the invaders could not be heard over the din the gran bretanians themselves made three halfarmored swordsmen ran toward hawkmoon he yanked his horse sideways and swung his broadsword left and right meeting their blades and striking one from its owners hand the other two pressed in but hawkmoon chopped at a wrist severing it the remaining warrior backed away and hawkmoon lunged at him his sword piercing the mans breast the horse reared and hawkmoon fought to control it forcing it through another line of tents his men following he broke out across an open space to see his way blocked by a group of warriors dressed only in nightshirts and armed with swords and bucklers hawkmoon shouted an order to his horsemen and they spread out to charge full tilt at the line their swords held straight before them almost in a single movement they killed or knocked flying the line of warriors and were through into the next circle of tents guy ropes twisting in the air as they were cut tents collapsing upon their occupants at last his sword glistening with blood hawkmoon fought his way to the center of this circle and there stood what he sought the proud mantis banner of the order of which the kingemperor himself was grand constable a band of warriors stood round it pulling on helmets and adjusting their shields on their arms without waiting to see if his men followed hawkmoon thundered toward them with a wild yell a shiver ran up his arm as his sword clanged against the shield of the nearest warrior but he lifted it again and the sword split the shield gashing the face of the man behind it so that he reeled back spitting blood from his ruined mouth another hawkmoon took in the side and anothers head was shorn off clean his blade rose and fell like some relent less machine and now his men joined him pressing the warriors farther and farther back into a tighter and tighter ring about the mantis banner hawkmoons mail was ripped by a swordstroke his shield was struck from his arm but he fought on until only one man stood by the banner hawkmoon grinned leaned forward tipped the mans helmet off his head with a movement of his sword and clove the skull in twain then he reached out and yanked the mantis banner from the earth raised it high to display it to his cheer ing men and turned his horse about riding for the hills again the steed leaping corpses and tangled tents with ease he heard a wounded warrior yell from behind him did you see him he has a black jewel imbedded in his skull and he knew that before long baron meliadus would under stand who had raided his camp and stolen his armys most precious standard hawkmoon turned in the direction of the shout shook the banner triumphantly and laughed a wild mocking laugh hawkmoon he cried hawkmoon it was the ageold battleshout of his forefathers it sprang unconsciously to his lips now bidden by his will to let his great enemy meliadus the slayer of his kin know who opposed him the coalblack stallion on which he rode reared up red nostrils flaring eyes glaring was wheeled around on its hind legs and plunged through the confusion of the camp behind them came mounted warriors hastily riding in pursuit goaded on by hawkmoons infuriating laughter hawkmoon and his men soon reached the hills again and headed for the secret encampment they had already prepared behind them blundered meliaduss men looking back hawkmoon saw that the scene on the driedup riverbank had turned into even greater confusion torches moved hurriedly toward the camp knowing the country as they did hawkmoons men had soon outdistanced their pursuers and at length come to a rocky hillside where they had camouflaged a cave entrance the previous day into this cave they now rode dismounting and replacing the camouflage the cave was large and there were even larger caverns beyond it big enough to take their whole force and stable their horses a small stream ran through the farthest cave which held provisions for several days other secret camps had been prepared all the way back to the kamarg someone lit brands and hawkmoon dismounted hefting the mantis standard and flinging it into a corner he grinned at roundfaced pelaire his chief lieutenant tomorrow meliadus will send engineers back to our dam once his ornithopters have reported we must make sure they do not destroy our handiwork pelaire nodded aye but even if we slay one party hell send another hawkmoon shrugged and another doubtless but i rely upon his impatience to reach the kamarg at length he should realize the pointlessness in wasting time and men in trying to redivert the river then he will press on and with luck if we survive we should be able to drive him southeast to our borders pelaire had begun to count the numbers of the returned warriors hawkmoon waited until he had finished then asked what losses pelaires face was a mixture of elation and disbelief none master we have not lost a man a good omen hawkmoon said slapping pelaire on the back now we must rest for we have a long ride in the morning at dawn the guard they had left at the entrance came back to report bad news a flying machine he told hawkmoon as the duke washed himself in the stream it has been circling above for the last ten minutes do you think the pilot has guessed something made out our tracks perhaps pelaire put in impossible hawkmoon said drying his face the rock would show nothing even to someone on the ground we must bide our time those ornithopters cannot remain airborne for long without returning to repower but an hour later the guard returned to say that a second ornithopter had come to replace the first hawkmoon bit his lip then reached a decision time is running out we must reach the dam before the engineers can begin work we shall have to resort to a riskier plan than id hoped to employ swiftly he drew one of his men aside and spoke to him then he gave orders for two flamelancers to come forward and last he told the rest of his men to saddle their horses and be prepared to leave the cavern a little later a single horseman rode out of the cavern entrance and began slowly to ride down the gentle rocky slope watching from the cave hawkmoon saw the sun glance off the body of the great brazen flying machine as its mech anical wings flapped noisily in the air and it began to descend toward the lone man hawkmoon had counted on the pilots curiosity now he made a gesture with his hand and the flamelancers brought their long unwieldy weapons up their ruby coils already beginning to glow in readiness the disad vantages of the flamelance were that it could not be operated instantly and it often grew too hot to handle now the ornithopter was circling lower and lower the hidden flamelancers raised their weapons the pilot could be seen leaning over his cockpit crowmask peering downward now murmured hawkmoon as one the red lines of flame left the tips of the lances the first splashed against the side of the ornithopter and merely heated the armor a little but the second struck the pilots body which almost instantly began to flare the pilot beat at his burning garments and his hands left the delicate controls of the machine the wings flapped erratically and the ornith opter twisted in the air keeled to one side and plunged earthward with the pilot trying to bring the flying machine out of its dive it struck a nearby hillside and crumpled to pieces the wings still beating for an instant the pilots broken body flung some yards away then it burst apart with a strange smacking sound it did not catch fire but pieces were scattered widely over the hillside hawkmoon did not understand the peculiarities of the power unit used for the ornithopters but one of them was the manner in which it exploded hawkmoon mounted the black stallion and signaled his men to follow him within moments they were galloping down the rocky slope of the hill heading for the dam they had made the day before the winters day was bright and clear and the air was exhilarating they rode with some confidence cheered by their success of last night they slowed down eventually when the dam was close saw the river flowing on its new course watched from the top of the hill as a detachment of warriors and engineers inspected the broken bridge that successfully block ed the water from its earlier course and then charged down the mounted flamelancers in the lead leaning back in their stirrups while they operated their temperamental weapons ten lines of fire poured toward the surprised granbretan ians turning men into living brands that ran screaming for the water fire swept across the ranks of men in the masks of mole and badger and the protecting force in their vulture masks asrovak mikosevaars mercenaries then hawk moons men had clashed with them and the air rang with the clangor of their weapons bloody axes swung in the air swords swept back and forth men screamed in death agonies horses snorted and whinnied with hooves flailing hawkmoons horse protected by chain armor staggered as a huge man swung a great doublebladed waraxe at it the horse fell dragging hawkmoon with it its body trapping him the vulturemasked axeman moved in raising the weapon over hawkmoons face hawkmoon pulled his arm from beneath the horse and there was a sword in his hand that swept up just in time to take the main force of the blow the horse was clambering to its feet again hawkmoon sprang up and grabbed its reins while at the same time protecting him self from the swinging ax once twice thrice the weapons met until hawkmoons sword arm ached then he slid his blade down the shaft and struck the axemans fists hawkmoons adversary let go of the weapon with one hand a muffled oath coming from within the mask hawkmoon smashed his sword against the metal mask denting it the man groaned and staggered hawkmoon got both hands on the grip of the broadsword and brought the blade around to chop deep into the head again the vul ture mask split and a bloodied face was revealed the bearded mouth screaming for mercy hawkmoons eyes narrowed for he loathed the mercenaries more than he loathed the gran bretanians he delivered a third blow to the head staving in all of one side so that the man waltzed backward already dead and crumpled against one of his fellows who was engag ed with a kamargian horseman hawkmoon remounted and led his men against the last of the vulture legion hacking and thrusting in a fever of blood letting until only the engineers armed with short swords remained these presented little opposition and were shortly all slain their bodies strewn across the dam and drifting down the river they had sought to redivert pelaire glanced at hawkmoon as they rode away toward the hills you have no mercy in you captain aye hawkmoon replied distantly none man woman or child if they be of or for granbretan they are my enemies to be slain eight of their number were dead considering the strength of the force they had destroyed they had again known great luck the granbretanians were used to massacring their ene mies they were not used to being attacked in this manner perhaps this explained the few losses the men of the kamarg had suffered so far four more expeditions meliadus sent to destroy the dam each expedition of increasing numbers each was destroyed in turn by sudden attacks from the horsemen of the kamarg and of the original two hundred riders who followed dorian hawkmoon nearly a hundred and fifty remained to carry out the second part of his plan and harry the armies of granbretan so that they turned slowly encumbered as they were by their landborne war engines and supplies toward the southeast hawkmoon never afterward attacked by day when the ornithopters circled the skies but would creep in by night his flamelances burned scores of tents and their occupants his arrows cut down dozen upon dozen of the men assigned to guard the tents and the warriors who went out by day to seek for the kamargians secret camps sword scarcely dried before they were wetted again axes became blunt with their deadly work and heavy kamarg spears were in short supply among their original owners hawkmoon and his men became hag gard and redeyed hardly able to keep their saddles at times often coming within a hairsbreadth of discovery by the orni thopters or search parties they ensured that the road from the river was lined with granbretanian corpses and that that road was the one they chose for the dark empire forces to tread as hawkmoon had guessed meliadus did not spend the time he should trying to seek out the guerilla riders his impatience to reach the kamarg dominated even his great hatred for hawkmoon and doubtless he reasoned that once he had vanquished the kamarg there would be time enough to deal with hawkmoon once and only once they came close to confronting one another as hawkmoon and his riders moved among the tents and cooking fires stabbing at random and preparing to leave since dawn was close meliadus mounted came up with a group of his wolf cavalry saw hawkmoon butchering a couple of men entangled in a fallen tent and charged toward him hawkmoon looked up raised his sword to meet meliaduss and smiled grimly pushing the sword gradually backward meliadus grunted as hawkmoon forced his arm farther and farther back my thanks baron meliadus said hawkmoon the nurturing you gave me in londra seems to have improved my strength oh hawkmoon meliadus replied his voice soft but shaking with rage i know not how you escaped the power of the black jewel but you will suffer a fate many thousand times greater than the one you have avoided when i take the kamarg and once again make you my prisoner suddenly hawkmoon moved his blade in under the brass quillions of meliaduss sword turned the point and sent the others weapon spinning away he raised the broadsword to strike then realized that too many granbretanians were coming up time to be away baron i regret ill remember your promise when youre my prisoner he wheeled his horse about and laughing was away leading his men out of the chaos that was the camp with an angry motion of his hand meliadus dismounted to retrieve his sword upstart he swore hell crawl at my feet before the month is past the day came when hawkmoon and his riders made no further attacks on meliaduss forces but galloped swiftly through the marshy ground that lay below the line of hills where count brass leopold von villach and their army awaited them the tall dark towers almost as ancient as kamarg itself loomed over the scene packed now with more than one guardian snouts of bizarre weapons jutting from almost every slit hawkmoons horse climbed the hill approaching the soli tary figure of count brass who smiled with great warmth and relief when he recognized the young nobleman i am glad i decided to let you live duke von koln he said humorously you have done everything you planned and kept the best part of your force alive im not sure i could have done better myself in my prime thank you count brass now we must prepare baron meliadus is hardly half a days march behind us below him now on the far side of the hill he could see the kamargian force primarily infantry drawn up at most a thousand men they looked pitifully few com pared with the vast weight of warriors marching to meet them the kamargians were outnumbered at least twenty to one probably by twice that amount count brass saw hawkmoons expression do not fear lad we have better weapons than swords with which to resist this invasion hawkmoon had been mistaken in thinking granbretan would reach the borders in half a day they had decided to camp before marching on and it was not until noon of the following day that the kamargians saw the force approach moving over the flat plain in a spreadout formation each square of infantry and cavalry was made up of a particular order each member of the order pledged to defend every other member whether that member was alive or dead this system was part of granbretans great strength for it meant that no man ever retreated unless specifically ordered to do so by his grand constable count brass sat on his horse and watched the enemy ap proach on one side of him was dorian hawkmoon on the other leopold von villach here it was count brass who would give the orders now the battle begins in earnest thought hawkmoon and it was hard to see how they could win was count brass overconfident the mighty concourse of fighting men and machines came eventually to a halt about half a mile away then two figures broke from the main body and began to ride toward the hill as they came closer hawkmoon recognized the standard as that of baron meliadus and realized a moment later that one of the figures was meliadus himself riding with his herald he held a bronze megaphone symbolising the wish for a peaceful parley surely he cant wish to surrender or expect us to von villach said in a tone of disgruntlement i would think not smiled hawkmoon doubtless this is one of his tricks he is famous for them noting the quality of hawkmoons smile count brass counseled be wary of that hatred dorian hawkmoon do not let it possess your reason the way it possesses meliaduss hawkmoon stared straight in front of him and did not reply now the herald lifted the heavy megaphone to his lips i speak for baron meliadus grand constable of the order of the wolf first chieftain of the armies under the most noble kingemperor huon ruler of granbretan and destined ruler of all europe tell your master to lift his mask and speak for himself count brass called back my master offers you honorable peace if you surrender now he promises that he will slay nobody and will merely appoint himself as governor of your province in king huons name to see justice done and order brought to this unruly land we offer you mercy if you refuse all the kamarg will be laid to waste everything shall be burned and the sea let in to flood what remains the baron meliadus says that you well know it is in his power to do all this and that your resist ance will be the cause of the deaths of all your kin as well as yourselves tell baron meliadus who hides behind his mask too abashed to speak since he knows that he is a graceless cur who has abused my hospitality and been beaten by me in a fair fight tell your master that we may well be the death of him and all his kind tell him that he is a cowardly dog and a thousand of his ilk could not bring down one of our kamarg bulls tell him that we sneer at his offer of peace as a trick a deception that could be seen for what it is by a child tell him that we need no governor that we govern ourselves to our own satisfaction tell him count brass broke into a jeering laugh as baron meliadus angrily turned his horse about and with the herald at his heels galloped back toward his men they waited for a quarter of an hour and then they saw the ornithopters rise into the air hawkmoon sighed he had been defeated once by the flying machines would he be defeated for a second time count brass raised his sword in a signal and there was a great flapping and snapping sound looking behind him hawkmoon saw the scarlet flamingoes sweeping upward their graceful fight exceedingly beautiful in comparison with the clumsy motions of the metal ornithopters that parodied them soaring into the sky the scarlet flamingoes with their riders in their high saddles each man armed with a flame lance wheeled toward the brazen ornithopters gaming height the flamingoes were in the better position but it was hard to believe that they would be a match for the machines of metal however clumsy red streamers of flame hardly visible from this distance struck the sides of the orni thopters and one pilot was hit killed almost instantly and falling from his machine the pilotless ornithopter flapped on then its wings folded behind it and it plunged downward to land birdlike prow first in the swamp below the hill hawk moon saw an ornithopter fire its twin flamecannon at a fla mingo and its rider and the scarlet bird leaped in the air somersaulted and crashed to earth in a great shower of feathers the air was hot and the flying machines noisy but count brasss attention was now on the granbretanian cavalry which was advancing toward the hill at a charge count brass made no movement at first he merely watched the huge press of horsemen as they came nearer and nearer then he lifted his sword again yelling towers open fire the nozzles of some of the unfamiliar weapons turned toward the enemy riders and there came a shrieking sound that hawkmoon thought would split his head but he saw nothing come from the weapons then he saw that the horses were rearing just as they reached the swampland every one was bucking now eyes rolling and foam flecking its lips riders were flung off until half the cavalry was crawling in the swamp slipping on the treacherous mud trying to control their animals count brass turned to hawkmoon a weapon that emits an invisible ray down which sound travels you heard a little of it the horses experienced its full intensity shall we charge them now hawkmoon asked no no need wait curb your impatience the horses were falling stiff and senseless it kills them unfortunately in the end count brass said soon all the horses lay in the mud while their riders cursed and waded back to firm ground standing there uncertainly above them flamingoes dived and circled around the orni thopters making up in grace for what they lacked in power and strength but many of the giant birds were falling more than the ornithopters with their clanking wings and whirring engines great stones began to crash down near the towers the war machines theyre using their catapults von villach growled cant we patience said count brass apparently unperturbed then a great wave of heat struck them and they saw a huge funnel of crimson fire splash against the nearest tower hawkmoon pointed a fire cannon the largest ive ever seen it will destroy us all count brass was riding for the tower under attack they saw him leap from his horse and enter the building which seemed doomed moments later the tower began to spin faster and faster and hawkmoon realized in astonishment that it was disappearing below the ground the flame passing harmlessly over it the cannon turned its attention to the next tower and as it did so this tower began to spin and retreat into the ground while the first tower whirled upward again came to a halt and let fire at the flame cannon with a weapon mounted on the battlements this weapon shone green and purple and had a bellshaped mouth a series of round white objects flew from it and landed near the flame cannon hawkmoon could see them bouncing amongst the engineers who manned the weapon then his attention was diverted as an ornithopter crashed close by and he was forced to turn his horse and gallop along the crest of the hill until he was out of range of the exploding power unit von villach joined him what are those things hawkmoon asked but von villach shook his head as puzzled as his comrade then hawkmoon saw that the white spheres had stopped bouncing and that the flame cannon no longer gouted fire also the hundred or so people near the cannon were no longer moving hawkmoon realized with a shock that they were frozen more of the white spheres shot from the bellshaped mouth of the weapon and bounced near the catapults and other war engines of granbretan shortly the crews of these were also frozen and rocks ceased to fall near the towers count brass left the tower he had entered and rode back to join them he was grinning we have still other weapons to display to these fools he said but can they fight such a weight of men hawkmoon asked for the infantry were now moving forward their num bers so vast that it seemed not even the mightiest weapons could stop their advance we shall see count brass replied signaling to a lookout on a nearby tower the air above them was black with fighting birds and machines red traceries of fire crisscrossing the sky pieces of metal and bloody feathers falling all around them it was impossible to tell which side was winning the infantry was almost upon them when count brass waved his sword to the lookout and the tower turned wide muzzled weapons toward the armies of granbretan glass spheres shimmering blue in the light hurtled toward the ad vancing warriors and fell among them hawkmoon saw them break formation begin to run about wildly flailing at the air and ripping off the masks of their respective orders what has happened he asked count brass in amaze ment the spheres contain a hallucinatory gas count brass told him it makes the men see dreadful visions now he turned in his saddle and waved his sword to the waiting men below they began to advance the time has come to meet granbretan with ordinary weapons he said from the remaining ranks of infantry arrows flew thickly toward them and flamelances sent searing fire count brasss archers retaliated and his flamelancers returned the attack arrows clattered on their armor and several men fell others were struck down by the flamelances through the chaos of fire and flying arrows the infantry of granbretan steadily advanced in spite of depleted numbers they paused when they came to the swampy ground choked as it was with the bodies of their horses and their officers furiously urged them onward count brass ordered his herald forward and the men ap proached bearing the simple flag of his master a red gaunt let on a white field the three men waited as the infantry broke ranks and began to clamber through the mud and over the corpses of the horses struggling to reach the hill where the forces of the kamarg waited to meet them hawkmoon saw meliadus some distance in the rear and recognized the barbaric vulturemask of asrovak mikosevaar as the huge muskovian led his vulture legion on foot and was one of the first to cross the swamp and reach the slopes of the hill hawkmoon trotted his horse forward a little so that he would be directly in the path of mikosevaar when he ap proached he heard a bellow and the vulturemask glared at him with eyes of ruby aha hawkmoon the dog that has worried at us for so long now lets see how you conduct yourself in a fair fight traitor call me not traitor hawkmoon said angrily you sniffer of corpses mikosevaar hefted his great war ax in his armored hands bellowed again and began to run toward hawkmoon who jumped from his horse and with shield and broadsword prepared to defend himself the ax shod all in metal thundered against the shield and sent hawkmoon staggering back a pace another blow followed and split the top edge of the shield hawkmoon swung his sword around and it struck mikosevaars heavily armored shoulder with a great ringing sound sending up a shower of sparks both men held their ground giving blow for blow as the battle raged around them hawkmoon glanced at von villach and saw him engaged with mygel hoist arch duke of londra wellmatched in age and strength and count brass was plowing through the lesser warriors trying to seek out meliadus who had plainly decided to supervise the battle from a distance from their advantageous position the kamargians with stood the dark empire warriors holding their line firm hawkmoons shield was a ruin of jagged metal and useless he flung it from his arm and seized his sword in both hands swinging it to meet the blow mikosevaar aimed at his head the two men grunted with exertion as they maneuvered about in the slippery earth of the hill now jabbing to try to make the other lose his footing now slashing suddenly at the legs or torso or battering from above or the side hawkmoon was sweating heavily in his armor and he grunted with effort then suddenly his foot slid from under him and he fell to one knee mikosevaar lumbering forward to raise his ax and decapitate his enemy hawkmoon flung himself flat toward mikosevaar and grabbed at the mans legs pulling him down so that both men rolled over and over toward the swamp and the mounds of dead horses punching and cursing they came to a halt in the filth neither had lost his weapon and now they stumbled to their feet preparing to continue the fight hawkmoon braced him self against the body of a warhorse and swung at the musk ovian the swing would have broken mikosevaars neck had not he ducked but it knocked the vulture helm from his head revealing the white bushy beard and glaring insane eyes of the muskovian who brought his ax upward toward hawk moons belly and had the blow blocked by the sword whistling down releasing his grip on the sword hawkmoon pushed with both hands at mikosevaars chest and the man fell backward as he tried to scramble up hawkmoon took a fresh hold of his broadsword raised it high and plunged it into the musk ovians face the man yelled the blade rose and descended again asrovak mikosevaar shrieked and then the sound was suddenly cut off once more hawkmoon stabbed at his oppo nent until little recognizable was left of the head then he turned to see how the battle went it was hard to tell everywhere men were falling and it seemed that the great majority were granbretanians the fight in the air was almost over and only a few ornithopters circled the sky while there seemed to be many more flam ingoes was it possible that the kamarg was winning hawkmoon turned as two warriors of the vulture legion ran toward him recklessly he stooped to drag up the blood ied mask of mikosevaar he laughed at them look your grand constable is slain your warlord is destroyed the warriors hesitated then backed away from hawkmoon and began to run the way they had come the vulture legion did not have the discipline of the other orders hawkmoon began to clamber wearily over the bodies of the dead horses which were now liberally heaped with human corpses the battle was thin in this area but he could see von villach on the hill kicking the fallen corpse of mygel hoist and roaring in triumph as he turned to deal with a group of hoists warriors who ran at him with spears von villach seemed to need no aid hawkmoon began to run as best he could up to the top of the hill to get a better idea of how the battle turned his broadsword was bloodied thrice before he could reach his objective and look at the field the huge army that mel iadus had brought against them was now scarcely a sixth of its former size while the line of karmargian warriors still held fast half the banners of the warlords were down and others were sorely beset the tight formations of the granbretanian infantry were largely broken and hawkmoon saw that the unprecedented was happening and that the orders were be coming mixed together thus throwing their members in confusion since they were used to fighting side by side with their own brothers hawkmoon saw count brass still mounted engaged with several swordsmen down the hill he saw the standard of meliadus some distance away it was surrounded by men of the order of the wolf meliadus had protected himself well now hawkmoon saw several of the commanders adaz promp and jarak nankenseen among themride toward meliadus evidently they wanted to retreat but must wait for meliaduss order to do so he could guess what the commanders told meliadus that the flower of their warriors was being destroyed that such destruction was not worth suffering for the sake of one tiny province but no call came from the trumpets of the heralds who waited nearby meliadus was evidently resisting their pleas von villach came up riding a borrowed horse he pushed back his helm and grinned at hawkmoon were beating them i think he said where is count brass hawkmoon pointed he is making good account he smiled should we hold steady or begin to advancewe could if we wished it i think the granbretanian warlords are faltering and want to retreat a push now and it might make up their minds for them von villach nodded ill send a messenger down to the count he must decide he turned to a horseman and muttered a few words to him the man began to race down the hillside through the con fusion of embattled warriors hawkmoon saw him reach the count saw count brass glance up and wave to them wheel his horse and begin to return within ten minutes count brass had managed to regain the hill five warlords i slew he said with a satisfied air but meliadus slunk away hawkmoon repeated what he had said to von villach count brass agreed with the sense of the plan and soon the kamarg infantry began to advance steadily pushing the granbretanians down the hill before them hawkmoon found a fresh horse and led the advance yelling wildly as he chopped about him striking heads from necks limbs from torsos like apples from the bough his body was covered from head to foot in the blood of the slain his mail was ragged and threatening to fall from him his whole chest was a mass of bruises and minor cuts his arm bled and his leg ached horribly but he ignored it all as the bloodlust seized him and he killed man after man riding beside him von villach said in a moment of com parative peace you seem decided to kill more of the dogs than the rest of our army put together i would not cease if the blood of granbretan filled this whole plain hawkmoon replied grimly i would not cease until everything that lived of granbretan was destroyed your bloodlust matches theirs von villach said iron ically mine is greater hawkmoon called driving forward for half theirs is sport and butchering on he rode at last it seemed that his commanders convinced him for meliaduss trumpets shouted the retreat and the survivors broke away from the kamargians and began to run hawkmoon struck down several who threw away their weapons in attitudes of surrender i do not care for living granbretanians he said once as he stabbed a man who had ripped his mask from his young face and begged for mercy but at length even hawkmoons bitterness was satiated for a while and he drew up his horse beside those of count brass and von villach and watched as the granbretanians reformed their ranks and began to march away hawkmoon thought he heard a great scream of rage rise from the retreating army thought he recognized the vengeful sound as that of meliadus and he smiled we shall see meliadus again in some way he said count brass nodded agreement he has found the kamarg invin cible to attack by his armies and he knows that we are too clever to be deceived by his treachery but he will find some other way soon all the lands about the kamarg will belong to the dark empire and we shall have to be on our guard the whole time when they returned to castle brass that night bowgentle spoke to the count now do you realize that granbretan is insane a cancer that will infect history and will set it on a course that will not only lead to the destruction of the entire human race but will ultimately result in the destruction of every intelligent or potentially intelligent creature in the universe count brass smiled you are exaggerating bowgentle how could you know so much because it is my calling to understand the forces that go to work to make up what we call destiny i tell you again count brass the dark empire will infect the universe unless it is checked on this planetand preferably on this con tinent hawkmoon sat with his legs stretched out before him doing his best to work the ache from his muscles i have no understanding of the philosophical principles you base your beliefs upon sir bowgentle he said but instinctively i know you to be right all we think we see is an implacable enemy that means to rule the world there have been other races like them in the past but there is something different about the dark empire forget you not count brass that i spent time in londra and was witness to many of their more excessive insanities you have seen only their armies which like most armies fight fiercely and to win using conventional tactics because they are best but there is little conventional about the kingemperor immortal corpse that he is in his throne globe little conventional about the secret way they have with one another the sense of insanity that underlies the mood of the entire city you think we have not then witnessed the worst of what they can do count brass asked seriously that is what i think hawkmoon said it is not only the need for vengeance that makes me slay them as i do it is a deeper thing within me that sees them as a threat to the forces of life itself count brass sighed perhaps you are right i do not know only the runestaff could prove you right or wrong hawkmoon got up stiffly i have not seen yisselda since we returned he said she went to her bed early i think bowgentle told him hawkmoon was disappointed he had looked forward to her welcome had wanted to tell her of his victories it sur prised him that she had not been there to greet him he shrugged well i think ill to mine he said good night gentlemen they had spoken little of their triumph since returning now they were experiencing the reaction to their days work and it all seemed a trifle remote though tomorrow doubtless they would celebrate when he reached his room it was in darkness but hawk moon sensed something odd and drew his sword before fumbling his way to a table and turning up the lamp that stood there someone lay on his bed smiling at him it was yisselda i heard of your exploits said she and wanted to give you a private welcome you are a great hero dorian hawkmoon felt his breathing become more rapid felt his heart begin to pound oh yisselda slowly step by step he advanced toward the prone girl his conscience in conflict with his desire you love me dorian i know she said softly do you deny it he could not he spoke thickly you are very bold he said trying to smile ayefor you seem extraordinarily shy i am not im modest i i am not shy yisselda but no good could come of this i am doomed the black jewel what is the jewel hesitantly he told her everything told her that he did not know how many months count brasss sorcerous chains could hold the life force of the jewel told her that when its power was released the lords of the dark empire would be able to destroy his mind so you seeyou must not become attached to me it would be worse if you did but this malagigi why do you not seek his aid the journey would take months i might waste my re maining time on a fruitless quest if you loved me she said as he sat down on the bed beside her and took her hand you would risk that aye he said thoughtfully i would perhaps you are right she reached up and drew his face toward hers kissing his lips the gesture was artless but full of sweetness now he could not restrain himself he kissed her passion ately held her close i will go to persia he said at length though the way will be perilous for once i leave the safety of the kamarg meliaduss forces will seek me out you will come back she said with conviction i know you will come back my love will draw you to me and mine to you he stroked her face gently aye that could be so tomorrow she said leave tomorrow and waste no time tonight she kissed him again and he returned her passion fiercely book three chapter one oladahn the histories then tell how leaving the kamarg hawkmoon flew eastward on a giant scarlet bird that bore him a thousand miles or more before it came to the mountains bordering the lands of the greeks and the bulgars the high history of the runestaff the flamingo was surprisingly easy to ride as count brass had assured him it would be it responded to commands in the manner of a horse by means of the reins attached to its curved beak and was so graceful that never once did hawkmoon fear falling in spite of the birds refusal to fly when it rained it carried him ten times more swiftly than a horse needing to rest only for a short time at midday and sleeping like hawkmoon at night the high soft saddle with its curved pommel was com fortable and from it hung panniers of provisions a harness secured hawkmoon in this saddle its long neck stretched straight before him its great wings beating slowly the scarlet bird bore him over the mountains valleys forests and plains hawkmoon always tried to let the bird come down near rivers or lakes where it could find food to its liking occasionally hawkmoons head would throb reminding him of the urgency of his mission but as his winged mount took him farther and farther eastward and the air grew stead ily warmer hawkmoons spirits began to rise and it seemed that the possibilities of returning soon to yisselda were increasing about a week after he had left the kamarg he was flying over a range of craggy mountains looking for a place to land it was late evening and the bird was wearying dropping lower and lower until the gloomy peaks were all around them and still no water could be seen then suddenly hawkmoon saw the figure of a man on the rocky slopes below and almost instantly the flamingo screamed flapping its wings wildly rocking in the air hawkmoon saw a long arrow jutting from its side a second arrow thudded into the birds neck and with a croak it began to fall rapidly toward the ground hawkmoon clung to the pommel of his saddle as the air tore through his hair he saw the rock rise up felt a great concus sion and then his head had struck something and he seemed to tumble sickeningly into a black bottomless well hawkmoon awoke in panic it seemed that the black jewel had been given its life and was even now gnawing at his brain like a rat at a grain sack he put both hands to his head and felt cuts and bumps realizing with relief that the pain was physical resulting from his crash to earth it was dark and it seemed that he lay in a cave peering forward he saw the flicker of firelight beyond the caves entrance he got up and began to make his way toward it near the opening his foot stumbled against something and he saw his gear piled on the floor everything was neatly stacked saddle panniers sword and dagger he reached for the sword and softly withdrew it from its scabbard then he went out his face was struck by the heat from a great bonfire a short distance away over it a spit had been constructed and on the spit turned the huge carcass of the flamingo trussed plucked and bereft of head and claws turning the spit by means of a complicated arrangement of leather thongs which he dampened from time to time was the stocky figure of a man almost half hawkmoons size as hawkmoon approached the little man turned yelled when he saw the blade in hawkmoons hand and jumped away from the fire the duke of koln was astonished the little mans face was covered with fine reddish hair and thicker fur of the same color seemed to cover his body he was dressed in a leather jerkin and a leather divided kilt sup ported by a wide belt on his feet were boots of soft doeskin and he wore a cap into which were stuck four or five of the fittest flamingo feathers doubtless purloined from the birds plumage during the plucking he backed away from hawkmoon hands raised in a placatory gesture forgive me master i am deeply regretful i assure you had i but known that the bird bore a rider i would not of course have shot it but all i saw was a dinner not to be missed hawkmoon lowered the sword who are you indeed what are you he put one hand to his head the heat from the fire and the exertion had made him dizzy i am oladahn kin to the mountain giants began the little man wellknown in these parts giant giant hawkmoon laughed hoarsely swayed and fell losing consciousness again next time he awoke it was to sniff the delicious smell of roasting fowl he savored it before he realized what it meant he had been propped up just within the cave entrance and his sword had vanished the little furry man came hesitantly forward offering him an enormous drumstick eat master and youll feel better said oladahn hawkmoon accepted the great piece of meat i suppose i might as well said he since you have robbed me almost certainly of everything i desired you were fond of the bird master no but i am in mortal danger and the flamingo was my only hope of escape hawkmoon chewed at the tough flesh someone pursues you then something pursues me an unusual and disgusting doom and hawkmoon found himself telling his tale to the creature whose action had brought that doom closer even as he spoke he found it hard to understand why he confided in oladahn there was something so grave about his halfhuman face something so attentive about the way he cocked his little head his eyes widening at each new detail that hawkmoons natural reticence was forgotten and now here i am he concluded at last eating the bird that was to be my possible salvation it is an ironic tale my lord oladahn sighed wiping grease from his whiskers and it clouds my heart to realize that it was my greedy stomach that brought about this last misfortune tomorrow i will do what i can to rectify my mistake and find you a steed of some sort to carry you on to the east something that can fly sadly no a goats the beast i had in mind before hawk moon could speak oladahn continued i have a certain influence in these mountains being regarded as something of a curiosity i am a crossbred animal you see the result of a union between an adventurous youth of peculiar tastes a sorcerer of sorts and a mountain giantess alas i am an orphan now for mother ate father one hard winter then mother was eaten in turn by my uncle barkyos the terror of these parts largest and fiercest of the mountain giants since then i have lived alone with only my poor fathers books for company i am an outcasttoo strange to be accepted either by my fathers race or my mothers living on my wits if i were not so small doubtless i should have been eaten also by uncle barkyos by now oladahns face looked so comic in its melancholy that hawkmoon could no longer bear him even a trace of malice besides he was feeling tired from the heat of the fire and the large meal he had eaten enough friend oladahn let us forget what cannot be rectified and sleep now in the morning we must find a new mount for me to ride to persia and they slept to awaken at dawn to see the fire still nickering under the carcass of the bird and a group of men in fur and iron breakfasting off it in some glee brigands oladahn cried springing up in alarm i should not have left the fire where did you hide my sword hawkmoon asked him but already two of the men smelling strongly of ancient animal fat had swaggered toward them drawing crude swords hawkmoon rose slowly to his feet ready to defend himself as best he could but oladahn was already speaking i know you rekner he said pointing at the largest of the brigands and you should know that i am oladahn of the mountain giants now that you have had your meal be off or my kin will come and slay you rekner grinned unperturbed picking his teeth with a dirty fingernail i have heard of you indeed littlest of giants and i see nothing to fear though ive been told that the villagers hereabouts avoid you but villagers are not brave brigands eh hush now or well kill you slowly instead of quickly oladahn seemed to wilt but he continued to stare hard at the brigand chieftain rekner laughed now what treasures have you got in that cave of yours oladahn was swaying from side to side as if in terror crooning softly to himself hawkmoon looked from him to the brigand and back again wondering if he could dash into the cave and find his sword in time now oladahns crooning grew louder and rekner paused the smile freezing on his face and a glassy look coming into his eyes as oladahn peered into them suddenly the little man flung up a hand pointing and speaking in a cold voice sleep rekner rekner slumped to the ground and his men cursed starting forward then stopping as oladahn kept his hand raised beware my power scavengers for oladahn is the son of a sorcerer the brigands hesitated glancing at their prone leader hawkmoon looked in astonishment at the furry creature who held the warlike men at bay then ducked into the cave and found his sword rescabbarded he drew the belt that held it and the dagger about his waist and buckled it pulling forth the blade and returning to oladahns side the little man muttered from the corner of his mouth bring your prov isions their steeds are tethered at the bottom of the slope well use them to escape for rekner will waken any instant and i cannot hold them after that hawkmoon got the panniers and he and oladahn began to back down the slope their feet scraping on the loose rock and scrub rekner was already stirring he gave a groan and sat up his men bent to help him to his feet now said oladahn and turned to run hawkmoon followed and there to his surprise were half a dozen goats the size of ponies each animal with a sheepskin saddle oladahn swung himself up onto the nearest and held the bridle of another for hawk moon the duke of koln hesitated for a moment then smiled wryly and climbed into the saddle rekner and his brigands were racing down the hill toward them with the flat of his sword hawkmoon slapped at the rumps of the remaining goats and they began to spring away follow me cried oladahn urging his goat down the mountain toward a narrow trail but rekners men had reached hawkmoon and his bright sword met their dull ones as they hacked savagely at him he stabbed one man through the heart struck another in the side managed to slam the side of his blade down on rekners pate then was riding the leap ing goat in hot pursuit of the strange little man the brigands roaring oaths and staggering after him the goat moved in a series of leaps jolting the bones of his body but soon they had reached the trail and were riding down a tortuous path around the mountain the cries of the brigands growing fainter and fainter oladahn turned with a grin of triumph we have our mounts lord hawkmoon eh easier than even i expected a good omen follow me ill lead you to your road hawkmoon smiled in spite of himself oladahns company was intoxicating and his curiosity about the little man coupled with his growing respect and gratitude for the manner in which he had saved their lives made hawkmoon forget almost completely that the furry kin of the mountain giants had been the initial cause of his new troubles oladahn insisted on riding with him for several days all the way through the mountains until they reached a wide yellow plain and oladahn pointed saying that is the way you must go i thank you hawkmoon said staring now toward asia it is a shame that we must part aha grinned oladahn rubbing at the red fur on his face id agree with that sentiment come ill ride with you a way to keep you company on the plain and with that he urged his goat forward again hawkmoon laughed shrugged and followed chapter two the caravan of agonosvos it began to rain almost as soon as they reached the plain and the goats which had borne them so well through the mountains were unused to the yielding earth and moved slowly for a month they traveled hunched in their cloaks shivering from the damp that chilled them to their vitals and hawkmoons head throbbed often when the throbbing came he would not speak to the solicitous oladahn but would bury his head in his arms his face pale and his teeth clenched tormented eyes staring at nothing he knew that back at castle brass the sentience of the jewel was beginning to break the bonds the count had wrought and he despaired of seeing yisselda again rain beat down and a cold wind blustered and through the sweeping curtain of water hawkmoon saw vast stretches of fenland ahead of them broken by clumps of gorse and black shrunken trees he had little idea of his bearings for most of the time clouds obscured the sky the only rough indication of direction was in the manner in which the shrubs grew in this part of the world leaning almost invariably to ward the south he had not expected to meet such country so far to the east and he gathered that its characteristics were the result of some event that had taken place during the tragic millennium hawkmoon brushed his damp hair from his eyes feeling the hard touch of the black jewel imbedded in his forehead he shivered glancing at oladahns miserable face then back through the rain there was a dark outline in the distance that might indicate a forest of some kind where they would at least have some protection from the rain the pointed hooves of the goats stumbled through the swampy grass hawkmoons head began to tingle and again he felt the gnawing sensation in his brain and a nausea in his chest he gasped pressing one forearm against his skull while oladahn looked on in mute sympathy at length they reached the forest of lowlying trees they found the going even slower than it had been and avoided the ponds of dark water that had formed everywhere the trunks and branches of the trees seemed malformed twisting toward the ground rather than away from it the bark was black or dark brown and at this season there was no foliage in spite of this the forest seemed thick and hard to penetrate at its edge water glinted a shallow moat protecting the trees their mounts hooves splashed through the muddy water as they entered the forest bending low to avoid the curling branches even here the ground was swampy and pools had formed at the bases of the trunks but there was little shelter after all from the perpetually falling rain they camped that evening on relatively dry ground and although hawkmoon made some attempt to help oladahn build a fire he was soon forced to lie with his back against a tree trunk panting and clutching his head while the little man finished the work the next morning they moved on through the forest oladahn leading hawkmoons mount for the duke of koln was now slumped across its neck toward the latter part of the morning they heard human voices and turned their beasts toward the sound it was a caravan of sorts laboring through the mud and water between the trees some fifteen wagons with rain soaked silk canopies of scarlet yellow blue and green mules and oxen strained to haul them and their feet slipped in mud and their muscles bulged and rippled as they were goaded on by their drivers who stood beside them with whips and spiked sticks at the wheels of the wagons other men sweated to help turn them and at the backs of the wagons leaned more who pushed with all their might yet in spite of all this great effort the wagons hardly moved it was not so much this sight that made the two travelers wonder but the nature of the people of the caravan through his clouded eyes hawkmoon saw them and wondered without exception they were grotesque dwarves and midgets giants and fat men men with fur growing all over them rather like oladahn save that the fur of these was un pleasant to look upon others pale and hairless one man with three arms another with one two clovenfooted peoplea man and a woman children with beards hermaphrodites with the organs of both sexes others with mottled skins like snakes and others with tails misshapen limbs and warped bodies faces with features missing or else abnormally pro portioned some hunchbacked some without necks some with foreshortened arms and legs one with purple hair and a horn growing from his forehead and only in their eyes was there any similarity for every expression was one of dull despair as the bizarre band toiled to move the caravan a few feet through the wooded marsh it seemed that they were in hell and looked upon the damned the forest smell of damp bark and wet mold was now mingled with other scents harder to identify there was the stink of men and beasts of heavy perfume and rich spices but besides these there was something else that lay over them all and made oladahn shudder hawkmoon had raised himself up from his mounts neck and sniffed the air like a wary wolf he glanced at oladahn frowning the deformed creatures did not seem to notice the newcomers but continued to work in silence there was only the sound of the wagons creaking and the animals snorting and splashing in their yokes oladahn tugged at his reins as if to pass the caravan by but hawkmoon did not follow his example he continued to stare thoughtfully at the weird procession come said oladahn there is danger here lord hawk moon we must get our bearings find out where we are and how far we must travel over this plain hawkmoon said in a harsh whisper besides our provisions are almost gone we might come upon some game in the forest hawkmoon shook his head no also i think i know to whom this caravan belongs who a man i have heard of but never encountered a country man of mine a kinsman even who left koln some nine centuries ago nine centuries impossible not so agonosvos is immortal or nearly if it be he then he could help us for i am still his rightful ruler he would have loyalty to koln after nine hundred years let us see hawkmoon urged his beast toward the head of the caravan where a tall wagon swayed its canopy of golden silk its carriage carved in complicated patterns painted in bright primaries ill at ease oladahn followed less rapidly in the front of the wagon seated well back to avoid the greater part of the drifting rain was a figure huddled in a rich bearskin cloak a plain black helm covering its whole face save for the eyes it moved as it saw dorian hawkmoon re garding it and a thin hollow sound came from the helm lord agonosvos hawkmoon said i am the duke von koln last of the line begun a thousand years since the figure answered in a low laconic tone a hawkmoon i can see that landless now eh granbretan took koln did it not aye and so we are both banished myself by your ancestor and you by the conqueror be that as it may i am still the last of my line and thus your master hawkmoons tormented face stared hard at the figure master is it authority over me was renounced when i was sent to the wild lands by duke dietrich not so as you well know no man of koln can ever refuse his princes will can he not agonosvos laughed quietly can he not hawkmoon made to turn away but agonosvos raised a thin slimfingered hand that was bonewhite stay i have offended you and must make amends how can i serve you you admit your loyalty to me i admit to impoliteness you seem weary i will stop my caravan and entertain you what of your servant he is not my servant but my friend oladahn of the bulgar mountains a friend and not of your race still let him join us agonosvos leaned from his wagon to call languidly to his men to stop their labors instantly they relaxed standing where they were their bodies limp and their eyes still full of dumb despair what do you think of my collection agonosvos asked when they had dismounted and climbed into the gloom of the wagons interior such curiosities once amused me but now i find them dull and they must work to justify their existence i have one at least of almost every type he glanced at oladahn including yours some i crossbred myself oladahn shifted his position uncomfortably it was unnat urally warm within the confines of the wagon yet there was no sign of a stove or any other heating apparatus agonosvos poured them wine from a blue gourd the wine too was a deep lustrous blue the ancient exile of koln still wore his black featureless helm and his black sardonic eyes looked at hawkmoon a trifle calculatingly hawkmoon was making a great effort to appear in good health but it was plain that agonosvos guessed the truth when he handed him a golden goblet of wine and said this will make you feel better my lord the wine did in fact revive him and soon the pain had gone again agonosvos asked him how he had come to be in these parts and hawkmoon told him a considerable part of his tale so said agonosvos you want my help eh for the sake of our ancient kinship hm well i will brood upon that in the meantime i will set a wagon aside so that you may rest we will discuss the matter further in the morning hawkmoon and oladahn did not sleep immediately they sat up in the silks and furs agonosvos had lent them and discussed the strange sorcerer he reminds me uncommon much of those dark empire lords you told me of oladahn said i think he means us ill perhaps he wishes to be avenged on you for the wrong he thinks your forefather did him per haps he wants to add me to his collection he shuddered aye hawkmoon said thoughtfully but it would be unwise to anger him without reason he could be useful to us well sleep on it sleep warily oladahn cautioned but hawkmoon slept deeply and awakened to find himself bound in tight leather thongs that had been wrapped round and round his body and then tugged to secure him he straggled glaring up at the enigmatic helm that covered the face of his immortal kinsman there came a soft chuckle from agonosvos you knew of me last of the hawkmoons but you did not know as much as you should know you not that many of my years were spent in londra teaching the lords of granbretan my secrets we have long had an alliance the dark empire and i baron meliadus spoke of you when last i saw him he will pay me anything i desire for your living body where is my companion the furry creature scampered into the night when he heard our approach they are all the same these beast folk timid and fainthearted friends so you intend to deliver me to baron meliadus you heard me perfectly aye that is just what i intend ill leave this clumsy caravan to wend its way as best it can till i return well move on swifter steeds special steeds i have kept for such a time as this i have already sent a mes senger ahead of me to tell the baron of my catch you bear him forth at agonosvoss command two midgets hurried forward to pick hawkmoon up in their long wellmuscled arms and clamber out of the wagon with him into the gray light of early dawn a drizzle still fell and through it hawkmoon saw two great horses both with coats of lustrous blue intelligent eyes and powerful limbs he had never seen such fine beasts i bred them myself agonosvos said not for strangeness in this case but for speed we shall soon be in londra you and i he chuckled again as hawkmoon was slung over the back of one of the steeds and roped to the stirrups he climbed into the saddle of the second horse took the bridle of hawkmoons and spurred forward hawkmoon was alarmed at the swift movement of the horse it moved easily galloping almost as fast as his flamingo had flown but where the bird had borne him toward salvation this horse took him closer to his doom in an agony of mind hawkmoon decided that his lot was hopeless they galloped for a long time through the slushy earth of the forest hawkmoons face became coated with mud and he could see only by blinking heavily and craning his neck up then much later he heard agonosvos curse and shout out of my way out of my way hawkmoon tried to peer forward but could see nothing but the hindquarters of agonosvoss horse and a little of the mans cloak dimly he heard another voice but could not distinguish what it said aaah may kaldreeen eat your eyes agonosvos now seemed to be reeling in his saddle the two horses slowed their pace then halted hawkmoon saw agonosvos sway forward and then fall into the mud crawling through it and trying to rise there was an arrow in his side helpless hawk moon wondered what new danger had arisen was he to be killed here rather than at the court of king huon a small figure came into view skipping over the struggling body of agonosvos and slashing hawkmoons bonds hawk moon dropped from the saddle holding on to the pommel and rubbing at his numbed arms and legs oladahn grinned at him youll find your sword in the sorcerers baggage he said hawkmoon grinned in relief i thought youd fled back to your mountains oladahn began to reply but hawkmoon gasped a warning agonosvos the sorcerer had risen to his feet clutching at the arrow in his side and staggering toward the little mountain man hawkmoon forgot his own pain ran to the sorcerers horse and tore at the mans rolled goods until he found his sword oladahn was now wrestling in the mud with ago nosvos hawkmoon sprang at them but dared not risk stabbing at the sorcerer lest he harm his friend he leaned down and hauled on agonosvoss shoulder dragging the enraged man backward he heard a snarl issue from the helm and agon osvos drew his own sword from its scabbard it whistled through the air as he struck at hawkmoon hawkmoon still hardly able to stand met the blow and staggered backward the sorcerer struck again hawkmoon deflected the blade swung his sword somewhat weakly at agonosvoss head missed and saw just in time to parry the next stroke then he saw an opening and drove the blade pointfirst into the sorcerers belly the man shrieked and backed away curiously stifflegged his hands clutching hawkmoons sword which had been wrenched from the duke of kotos hands then he spread his arms wide began to speak and fell sprawling into the dark water of a shallow pool panting hawkmoon leaned against the bole of a tree the pain in his limbs increasing as the circulation returned oladahn rose from the mud hardly recognizable a quiver of arrows had been torn loose from his belt and he picked it up now inspecting the fletchings some are ruined but ill soon replace em he said where did you get them last night i decided to make my own inspection of agonosvoss camp i found the bow and arrows in one of the wagons and thought they might be useful returning i saw agonosvos enter our wagon and guessed his business so i remained hidden and followed you but how could you follow such fast horses hawkmoon asked i found an even faster ally oladahn grinned and pointed through the trees coming toward them was a grotesque creature with incredibly long legs the rest of his body of normal size this is vlespeen he hates agonosvos and willingly aided me vlespeen peered down at them you killed him he said good oladahn inspected agonosvoss baggage he brandished a roll of parchment a map and enough provisions to get us all to the coast he unrolled the map its not far look they gathered around the map and hawkmoon saw that it was scarcely more than a hundred miles to the mermian sea vlespeen wandered away to where agonosvos had fallen perhaps to gloat over the corpse a moment later they heard him scream and turned to see the body of the sorcerer brand ishing the sword that had slain him walking stiffly toward the longlegged man the sword ripped upward into vles peens stomach and his legs collapsed under him jerked like a puppets and then were still hawkmoon was horrified from within the helm came a dry chuckle fools i have lived for nine hundred years in that tune i have learned how to cheat all forms of death without thinking hawkmoon leaped at him knowing it was his one chance to save his life even though he had sur vived a blow that should have been mortal agonosvos had evidently been weakened the two struggled on the edge of the pool while oladahn danced around them jumping at last upon the sorcerers back and wrenching the tight helm from his head agonosvos howled and hawkmoon felt nausea overcome him as he stared at the white fleshless head that was revealed it was the face of an ancient corpse a corpse that the worms had chewed upon agonosvos covered the face in his hands and staggered away as hawkmoon picked up his sword and made to mount the great blue horse he heard a voice come calling to him through the woods i shall not forget this dorian hawkmoon youll yet make sport for baron meliadus and i shall be there to watch hawkmoon shuddered and urged the horse southward where the map had shown the mermian sea to lie within two days the sky had lightened and a yellow sun shone in a blue sky and ahead of them was a town beside the glinting sea where they might take ship for turkia chapter three the warrior in jet and gold the heavy tarkian merchantman clove through the calm waters of the ocean foam breaking over its bow its single lateen sail stretched like a birds wing as it took the strong wind the captain of the vessel in golden tasseled hat and braided jacket his long skirts held to his ankles by bands of gold stood with hawkmoon and oladahn in the stern of the ship the captain jerked his thumb at the two huge blue horses corralled on the lower deck fine beasts masters ive never seen the like in these parts he scratched at his pointed beard you would not sell them im part owner of this vessel and could afford a good price hawkmoon shook his head those horses are worth more to me than any riches i can believe it replied the captain missing his meaning he looked up as the man in the topmast yelled and waved stretching his arm to the west hawkmoon glanced in the same direction and saw three small sails rising over the horizon the captain raised his spyglass by rakardark empire ships he passed the glass to hawkmoon hawkmoon saw the black sails of the vessels clearly now each was emblazoned with the shark symbol of the empires warfleet do they mean us harm he asked they mean harm to all not of their own kind the captain said grimly we can only pray they havent seen us the seas becoming thick with their craft a year ago he paused to yell orders to his men the ship jumped forward as stay sails were added forward a year ago there were few of them and trading peacefully for the most part now they dominate the seas youll find their armies in turkia syria persia everywhere spreading insurrection aiding local revolts my guess is theyll have the east under their heel as they have the west give em a couple of years soon the dark empire ships were below the horizon again and the captain breathed a sigh of relief ill not be com fortable said he till ports in sight the tarkian port was seen at sunset and they were forced to lie offshore until morning when they sailed in on the tide and docked not much later the three dark empire warships came into the harbor and hawkmoon and oladahn deemed it exped ient to purchase what provisions they could and follow the map eastward for persia a week later the great horses had borne them well past ankara and across the kizilirmac river and they were riding through hill country where all seemed turned to yellow and brown by the burning sun on several occasions they had seen armies pass by but had avoided them the armies consisted of local troops often augmented by masked warriors of gran bretan hawkmoon was disturbed by this for he had not expected the dark empires influence to stretch this far once they witnessed a battle from a distance seeing the disciplined forces of granbretan easily defeat the opposing army now hawkmoon rode desperately toward persia a month later as their horses trotted along the shores of a vast lake oladahn and hawkmoon were suddenly surprised by a force of some twenty warriors who appeared over the crest of a hill and came charging toward them the warriors masks flashed in the sun adding to their fierce appearance the masks of the order of the wolf ho the two our master seeks cried one of the leading horsemen the reward is large for the tall one if taken alive oladahn said calmly i fear lord dorian that were doomed make them kill you said hawkmoon grimly and drew his sword if the horses had not been weary he would have fled the warriors but he knew that that would be useless now soon the wolfmasked riders were all around them hawk moon had the slight advantage of wishing to kill them while they wanted him alive he struck one full in the mask with the pommel of his sword sheered halfthrough anothers arm stabbed a third in the groin and knocked a fourth from his horse now they were in the shallows of the lake the steeds hooves splashing in the water hawkmoon saw oladahn ac counting well for himself but then the furry little man gave a cry and fell from his saddle hawkmoon could not see him for the press but he cursed and struck about him with a greater will now they closed in so that he hardly had room to swing his sword he realized sickeningly they would take him in a few moments he struggled and smote on his ears full of the clang of metal his nostrils clogged with the smell of blood then he felt the pressure give way and saw through a forest of swords that an ally had joined him he had seen the man before but only in dreams or visions very similar to dreams it was the man he had seen in france and later in the kamarg he was dressed in full armor of jet and gold a long helm completely enclosing his face he swung a sixfoot broad sword and rode a white battle charger as big as hawkmoons wherever he struck men fell and soon there were only a few wolf warriors still horsed and these at length galloped off through the water leaving their dead and wounded behind hawkmoon saw one of the fallen riders struggle up then he saw another rise beside him and realized it was oladahn the little man still had his sword and was defending himself desperately against the granbretanian hawkmoon pushed his horse through the shallows and brought his sword round in a great swing to strike the wolf warrior in the back sheering through his mail and leather undershirt and cutting deep into his flesh with a groan the man fell and his blood joined that already reddening the waters hawkmoon turned to where the warrior in jet and gold sat his horse silently i thank you my lord he said you have followed me a long way he resheathed his sword longer than you know dorian hawkmoon came the rich echoing voice of the warrior you ride to hamadan aye to seek the sorcerer malagigi good i will ride with you some of the way it is not far now who are you hawkmoon asked who may i thank i am the warrior in jet and gold do not thank me for saving your life you do not realize yet what i have saved it for come and the warrior led them away from the lake a little later as they rested and ate the warrior sitting with one leg crooked a little way off hawkmoon asked him know you much of malagigi will he help me i know him said the warrior in jet and gold perhaps he will help you but know you this there is civil war in hamadan queen frawbras brother nahak schemes against her and he is aided by many who wear the masks of those we fought at the lake chapter four malagigi a week later they looked down on the city of ham adan all white and gleaming in the bright sun with its spires domes and minarets chased with gold silver and mother ofpearl i will leave you now said the mysterious warrior turning his horse farewell dorian hawkmoon doubtless we shall meet again hawkmoon watched him ride away through the hills then he and oladahn urged their horses toward the city but as they approached the gates they heard a great noise from behind the walls it was the sound of fighting the shouts of warriors and the screams of beasts and suddenly out of the gates burst a great rabble of soldiers many of them badly wounded and all much battered the two men pulled their horses up short but were soon surrounded by the fleeing army a group of riders charged past them and hawkmoon heard one cry all is lost nahak wins the day following them came a huge bronze war chariot pulled by four black horses and in it was a ravenhaired woman in blue plate armor who shouted at her men urging them to turn and fight the woman was young and very beautiful with huge dark slanting eyes that blazed with anger and frustra tion in one hand she held a scimitar which she brandished high she dragged at the reins as she saw the bewildered hawk moon and oladahn who are you more dark empire mercenaries no i am an enemy of the dark empire hawkmoon said what is happening an uprising my brother nahak and his allies broke through the secret passageways that lead from the desert and surprised us if you are granbretans enemy then you had best flee now they have battle beasts with them that then she was yelling again at her men and had moved on we had best return to the bills oladahn murmured but hawkmoon shook his head i must find malagigi he is somewhere in this city there is little time left they pushed their horses through the throng and into the city up ahead some men were still fighting in the streets and the spiked helmets of the local soldiers mingled with the wolf helms of the dark empire warriors everywhere was carnage hawkmoon and oladahn galloped up a side street where there was little fighting at present and emerged into an open square on the opposite side they saw gigantic winged beasts like great black bats but with long arms and curved claws they were rending at the retreating warriors and some were already feasting on the corpses here and there nahaks men were trying to urge these battle beasts on but it was plain the giant bats had already served their purpose a bat turned and saw them suddenly hawkmoon yelled to oladahn to follow him down a narrow lane but the bat was already pursuing them halfrunning halfflapping through the air a disgusting whistling sound coming from its jaws a dreadful stench exuding from its body into the lane they rode but the bat squeezed between the houses and continued to follow them then from the opposite end of the street came some half a dozen wolfmasked riders hawkmoon drew his sword and charged on there was little else to do he met the first of the riders with a lunge that ripped the man from his saddle a sword slashed at his shoulder and he felt it bite home but he continued to fight in spite of the pain the battle beast screamed and the wolf warriors began to back their horses away in panic hawkmoon and oladahn burst through them and found themselves in a larger square that was empty of the living only corpses lay everywhere on cobblestones and pavements hawkmoon saw a yellowrobed man dart from a doorway to bend beside a corpse and cut at the purse and jeweled dagger in its belt the man looked up in panic and tried to dash back into his house when he saw the duke of koln but oladahn blocked his way hawkmoon pressed his sword into the mans cheek which way to malagigis house the man pointed a trembling finger and croaked that way masters the one with the dome that has zodiacal signs inlaid in ebony on a silver roof down that street do not kill me i he sighed in relief as hawkmoon turned his great blue horse and rode for the street he had indicated the domed house with the zodiacal signs was soon in sight hawkmoon stopped at the gate and hammered on it with the pommel of his sword his head was beginning to throb again and he knew instinctively that count brasss spells could not hold the black jewels life for much longer he realized that he should have approached the sorcerers house in a more courteous manner but there was no time with granbretans soldiers everywhere in the streets of the city overhead two of the giant bats flapped seeking victims at last the gate swung open and four huge negroes armed with pikes and dressed in purple robes barred the way hawk moon saw a courtyard beyond them he tried to ride forward but the pikes menaced him immediately what business have you with our master malagigi one of the negroes asked i seek his help it is a matter of great importance i am in peril a figure appeared on the steps leading to the house the man was clad in a simple white toga he had long gray hair and was cleanshaven his face was lined and old but the skin had a youthful appearance why should malagigi help you the man asked you are from the west i see the people of the west bring war and dissension to hamadan begone ill have none of you you are the lord malagigi hawkmoon began i am a victim of these same people help me and i can help you be rid of them please i beg you begone ill play no part in your internal warring the negroes pressed the two men back and the gates closed hawkmoon began to bang again on the gates but then oladahn gripped his arm and pointed up the street toward them came some six wolfhelmed riders led by one whose ornate mask hawkmoon instantly recognized it was mel iadus ha your time is near hawkmoon screamed meliadus in triumph drawing his sword and charging forward hawkmoon wrenched his horse about although his hatred for meliadus burned as deeply as ever he knew he could not fight at that moment he and oladahn fled back down the street their powerful horses outdistancing those of meliaduss men agonosvos or his messenger must have told meliadus where hawkmoon was bound and the baron must have come here to join his own men help them take hamadan and wreak his personal vengeance on hawkmoon down one narrow street after another hawkmoon dashed until he had for the moment lost his pursuer we must escape the city he shouted to oladahn it is our only chance perhaps later we can sneak back and convince malagigi to help us his voice trailed off as one of the gigantic bats swooped suddenly down to alight immediately in front of them and begin to stalk forward claws outstretched beyond this creature was an open gate and freedom so full of desperation was hawkmoon now since malagigi had refused him that he charged straight at the battle beast sword slashing at its cruel claws flinging himself against it the bat whistled and the claws struck clutching hawkmoon by his already wounded arm the young nobleman brought his sword up again and again hewing at the things wrist until black blood spurted and the tendon was severed the beaked mouth clicked open and thrust at hawkmoon the horse reared as the head came down and hawkmoon thrust his sword up wildly striking for the huge beady eye the sword plunged in the creature screamed yellow mucus began to pour from the wound hawkmoon struck a second time the thing reeled and began to fall toward him hawkmoon managed to pull his horse aside barely in time as the battle beast collapsed now he raced for the gate and the hills beyond oladahn in his wake calling you have killed it lord dorian this is the stuff of the lays and the little man laughed with a fierce joy soon they were in the hills joining the hundreds of beaten warriors who had survived the battle in the city they rode slowly now and at length came to a shallow valley where they saw the bronze chariot that the warrior queen had driven earlier and rank after rank of weary soldiery lying down in the tough grass while the ravenhaired woman went among them near the chariot hawkmoon saw another figure it was the warrior in jet and gold and he seemed to be waiting for hawkmoon hawkmoon dismounted as he reached the warrior the woman approached and stood leaning against her chariot her eyes still glowing with the anger hawkmoon had noted before the warrior in jet and golds rich voice came from his helmet faintly laconic so malagigi would not help you eh hawkmoon shook his head looking at the woman without curiosity disappointment filled him but was beginning to be replaced with the wild fatalism that had saved his life in his battle with the giant bat i am finished now he said but at least i can return and find a way to destroy meliadus we have that ambition in common said the woman i am queen frawbra my treacherous brother covets the throne and seeks to get it with the aid of your meliadus and his warriors mayhap he already has it i cannot tell yet but it would seem we are badly outnumbered and theres scant chance of retaking the city hawkmoon looked at her thoughtfully if there was a slim chance would you take it if there was no chance at all id have half a mind to try the woman replied but im not sure my warriors would follow me at that moment three more horsemen rode into the camp queen frawbra called to them have you just escaped the city aye one answered they are already looting i have never seen such savage conquerors as those westerners their leader the big man has even broken into malagigis house and made him prisoner what hawkmoon cried meliadus has the sorcerer prisoner ah then there is no hope at all for me the warrior in jet and gold said nonsense there is still hope so long as meliadus keeps malagigi aliveand one might expect him to since the sorcerer has many secrets mel iadus desires to learn then you have a chance you must return to hamadan with queen frawbras armies retake the city and rescue malagigi hawkmoon shrugged but is there time already the jewel shows signs of warmth that means its life is returning soon i will be a mindless creature then you have nothing to lose lord dorian oladahn put in he laid a furry hand on hawkmoons arm and gave it a friendly squeeze nothing to lose at all hawkmoon laughed bitterly shrugging off his friends hand aye youre right nothing well queen frawbra what say you the armored woman said let us speak to what remains of my force a little later hawkmoon stood in the chariot and addressed the battleweary warriors men of hamadan i have traveled for many hundreds of miles from the west where granbretan holds sway my own father was tortured to death by the same baron meliadus who aids your queens enemies today i have seen whole nations reduced to ashes their populations slain or enslaved i have seen children crucified and hanging on gibbets i have seen brave warriors turned to cringing dogs i know that you must feel it is hopeless to resist the masked men of the dark empire but they can be beaten i myself was one of the commanders of an army little more than a thousand strong that put an army of granbretan more than twenty times its number to flight it was our will to live that enabled us to do it our knowledge that even if we fled we should be hunted down and die eventually ignobly you can at least die courageously like men and know that there is a chance of defeating the forces that have taken your city today he spoke on in this vein and gradually the tired warriors rallied some cheered him then queen frawbra joined him in the chariot and cried to her men to follow hawkmoon back to hamadan to strike while the enemy was unwary while its soldiers were drunk and squabbled over their loot hawkmoons words had given them cheer now they saw the logic of queen frawbras words they began to buckle on their weapons adjust their armor look for their horses well attack tonight the queen shouted giving them no time to get wind of our plan ill ride with you i think said the warrior in jet and gold and that night they rode back to hamadan where the conquering soldiers reveled and the gates still stood open and hardly guarded and the battle beasts slept soundly their stomachs full of their prey chapter five the black jewels life they had thundered into the city and were striking about them almost before the enemy realized what was hap pening hawkmoon led them hawkmoons head was full of agony and the black jewel had begun to pulse in his skull his face was taut and white and there was something about his presence that made soldiers flee before him as his horse reared and he raised his sword and screamed hawkmoon hawkmoon cutting about him in a hysteria of killing close behind him came the warrior in jet and gold fighting methodically with an air of detached ease queen frawbra was there driving her chariot into startled groups of warriors and oladahn of the mountains stood up in his stirrups and shot arrow after arrow into the enemy street by street they drove nahaks forces and the wolf helmed mercenaries through the city then hawkmoon saw the dome of malagigis house and leaped his horse over the heads of those who blocked his way reaching the house and standing upon his mounts back to grasp the top of the wall and haul himself over he dropped into the courtyard just missing the sprawled body of one of malagigis negro guards the door of the house had been broken down and the interior had been wrecked stumbling through the smashed furniture hawkmoon found a narrow stairway doubtless this led to the sorcerers laboratories he was halfway up the stairs when a door open ed at the top and two wolfmasked guards appeared running down to meet him their swords ready hawkmoon brought up his sword to defend himself his face was set in a deaths head grin as he fought and his eyes blazed with a madness that was mixed fury and despair once twice his sword darted forward and then there were two corpses tumbling down the stairs and hawkmoon had entered the room at the top to discover malagigi strapped to a wall the marks of torture on his limbs quickly he cut the old man down and lowered him gently to a couch in the corner there were benches everywhere with alchemical apparatus and small machines resting on them malagigi stirred and opened his eyes you must help me sir hawkmoon said thickly i came here to save your life at least you could try to save mine malagigi raised himself on the couch wincing in pain i told you ill do nothing for either side torture me if you will as your countryman did but ill not damn you hawkmoon swore my heads afire ill be lucky if i last till dawn you must not refuse i have come two thousand miles to seek your aid i am as much a victim of granbretan as you more i prove that and perhaps ill help you malagigi said drive the invaders from the city and then return by then it will be too late the jewel has its life at any moment prove it said malagigi and sank back on the couch hawkmoon halfraised his sword in his wild rage and desperation he was ready to strike the old man down but then he turned and ran back down the stairs and out into the courtyard unbarring the gate and leaping into the saddle of his horse again at length he found oladahn how does the battle go he yelled over the heads of fighting swordsmen not too well i think meliadus and nahak have regrouped and hold a good half of the city their main force is in the central square where the palace stands queen frawbra and your armored friend are already leading an attack there but i fear its hopeless lets see for ourselves hawkmoon said yanking at his mounts bridle and forcing his way through the embattled warriors striking here and there at friend or foe depending on which stood in his path oladahn followed and they came eventually into the great central square to find the armies drawn up facing each other horsed at the head of their men were meliadus and the rather foolishfaced nahak who was plainly a tool of the dark empire baron opposite them were queen frawbra in her battered war chariot and the warrior in jet and gold as hawkmoon and oladahn entered the square they heard meliadus call through the flickering torchlight that illumi nated the armies where is that treacherous coward hawk moon skulking in hiding perhaps hawkmoon broke through the line of warriors noticing that their ranks were thin here i am meliadus i have come to destroy you meliadus laughed destroy me know you not that you live only by my whim do you feel the black jewel hawk moon ready to nibble at your mind involuntarily hawkmoon put his hand to his throbbing forehead feeling the evil warmth of the black jewel knowing that meliadus spoke the truth then why do you wait he said grimly because i am ready to offer you a bargain tell these fools their cause is hopeless tell them to throw down their arms and i will spare you the worst now hawkmoon fully realized that he did indeed retain his mind only at the pleasure of his enemies meliadus had restrained his desire for immediate vengeance in the hope of forcing hawkmoon to save granbretan further losses hawkmoon paused unable to answer trying to debate the issues there was silence from his own ranks as they waited tensely to hear his decision he knew that the whole fate of hamadan might now depend on him as he sat there his mind in confusion oladahn nudged his arm and murmured lord dorian take this hawkmoon glanced down at the thing the mountain man offered him it was a helmet at first he did not recognize it then he saw that it was the helm that had been wrenched from the skull of agonosvos he remem bered the disgusting head that had once reposed in it and shuddered why the thing is befouled my father was a sorcerer oladahn reminded him he taught me secrets this helm has certain properties there are circuits built into it which will protect you for a short time from the full force of the black jewels power put it on my lord i beg you how can i be sure put it on and find out gingerly hawkmoon removed his own helmet and donned the sorcerers it was a tight fit and he felt stifled by it but he realized that the jewel no longer pulsed so fast he smiled and a wild feeling of elation filled him he drew his sword this is my answer baron meliadus he yelled and charged full at the startled lord of granbretan meliadus cursed and struggled to get his own sword from its scabbard he had scarcely done so before hawkmoons sword had knocked his wolf helm clean from his head and his scowling bewildered face was revealed behind hawkmoon came the cheering soldiers of hamadan led by oladahn queen frawbra and the warrior in jet and gold they clashed with the enemy forcing them back to the gates of the palace from the corner of his eye hawkmoon saw queen frawbra lean from her chariot and encircle her brothers throat with her arm dragging him from his saddle her hand rose and fell twice bearing a bloody dagger and nahaks corpse dropped to the ground to be trampled by the horsemen who followed the queen hawkmoon was still driven by wild despair knowing that the helm of agonosvos could not protect him for long he swung his sword rapidly striking blow after blow at meliadus who parried as swiftly meliaduss face was twisted in an expression resembling that of the wolf helmet he had lost and a hatred burned from his eyes that matched hawkmoons own their swords clanged rhythmically in warlike harmony each blow blocked each blow returned and it seemed that they would continue in this way until one dropped from weariness but then a group of fighting warriors backed against hawkmoons horse and caused it to rear throwing him backward so that he lost his footing in his stirrups and meliadus grinned and thrust at hawkmoons undefended chest the blow lacked force but it was enough to push hawkmoon from his saddle he fell to the ground below the hooves of meliaduss horse he rolled away as the baron tried to trample him dragged himself to his feet and did his best to defend himself from the volley of blows rained down on him by the triumphant granbretanian twice meliaduss sword struck the helmet of agonosvos denting it badly hawkmoon felt the jewel begin to pulse afresh he shouted wordlessly and dashed in close astonished by this unexpected move meliadus was taken offguard and his attempt to block hawkmoons thrust was only halfsuccessful hawkmoons sword cut a great furrow along one side of meliaduss unprotected head and his whole face seemed to open up and gush blood his mouth crooked with pain and paralysis he tried to wipe the blood from his eyes and hawkmoon grasped bis sword arm and hauled him down to the ground meliadus wrenched himself free stum bled backward then rushed at hawkmoon his sword a blur of metal striking hawkmoons blade with such force that both swords snapped for a moment the panting antagonists stood still glaring at one another then each drew a long dirk from his belt and they began to circle poised to strike meliaduss handsome features were handsome no longer and if he lived would always bear the mark of hawkmoons blow blood still came plentifully from the wound trickling down his breastplate hawkmoon for his part was wearying rapidly the wound he had sustained the day before was beginning to trouble him and his head was on fire with the pain the jewel caused he could hardly see for it and twice he staggered only to right himself as meliadus feinted with his dagger then both men moved and were instantly locked together grappling desperately to stab the single mortal blow that would end their feud meliadus struck at hawkmoons eye but misjudged his blow and the dagger scraped down the side of the helmet hawkmoons dagger sliced toward meliaduss throat but but the barons hand came up caught hawkmoons wrist and turned it the dance of death went on as they wrestled chest to chest to deal the finishing cut their breath groaned from their throats their bodies ached with weariness but fierce hatred glared from both pairs of eyes still and would glare on until one or both became glazed in death around them the battle continued with queen frawbras forces driving the enemy farther and farther back now none fought near the two men and only corpses surrounded them dawn was beginning to touch the sky meliaduss arm trembled as hawkmoon tried to force it back and make the hand release his wrist his own free hand was weakening on meliaduss forearm for this was his wound ed side despairingly hawkmoon brought his armored knee up into meliaduss armored groin and shoved the baron staggered his foot caught in the harness of one of the fallen and he fell trying to struggle up he became worse entangled and his eyes filled with fear as hawkmoon slowly advanced himself only barely able to remain upright hawkmoon raised his dagger now his head was swim ming he flung himself down at the baron then felt a great weakness seize him and the dagger dropped from his hand blindly he groped for the weapon but consciousness was going he gasped with anger but even that emotion was ebbing fatalistically he knew that meliadus would now be able to kill him at his very moment of triumph chapter six servant of the runestaff hawkmoon peered through the eyeslits of the helmet blinking in the bright light his head still burned but the anger and desperation seemed to have left him he turned his neck and saw oladahn and the warrior in jet and gold staring down at him oladahns face was concerned but the warriors face was still hidden by that enigmatic helm i am not dead hawkmoon said weakly it does not seem so replied the warrior laconically though perhaps you are merely exhausted oladahn said hastily darting a dis approving glance at the mysterious warrior the wound in your arm has been dressed and is likely to heal quickly where am i hawkmoon asked now a room a room in queen frawbras palace the city is hers again and the enemy slain captured or fled we found your body sprawled across that of baron meliadus we thought you both dead at first so meliadus is dead it is likely when we returned to look for his corpse it had vanished doubtless it was borne away by some of his fleeing men ah dead at last said hawkmoon thankfully now that meliadus had paid for his crimes he felt suddenly at peace in spite of the pain that still pulsed in his brain another thought came to him malagigi you must find him tell him malagigi is on his way when he heard of your exploits he decided to call at the palace will he help me i do not know oladahn said glancing again at the warrior in jet and gold a little later queen frawbra entered and behind her was the wizenfaced sorcerer carrying an object covered by a cloth it was about the size and shape of a mans head lord malagigi hawkmoon murmured trying to rise from his bed you are the young man who has been pursuing me in recent days i cannot see your face in that helmet malagigi spoke waspishly and hawkmoon began to despair again i am dorian hawkmoon i proved my friendship to hamadan meliadus and nahak are destroyed their forces gone hm malagigi frowned i have been told of this jewel thing in your head i know about such creations and their properties but whether it is possible to remove its power i cannot say i was told you were the only man who could do it hawkmoon said couldyes can i do not know i am growing old physically i am not sure if the warrior in jet and gold stepped forward and touched malagigi upon the shoulder you know me sorcerer malagigi nodded aye i do and you know the power i serve aye malagigi frowned glancing from one to the other but what has that to do with this young man he too serves that power though he knows it not malagigis expression became resolute then i will help him he said firmly even if it means risking my own life again hawkmoon raised himself on the bed what does all this mean whom do i serve i was unaware malagigi withdrew the cloth from the object he carried it was a globe covered with little irregularities each of which glowed a different color the colors shifted constantly mak ing hawkmoon blink rapidly first you must concentrate malagigi told him holding the strange globe close to his head stare into the device stare hard stare long stare dorian hawkmoon at all the colors hawkmoon now found that he was no longer blinking found that he could not tear his gaze away from the rapidly changing colors in the globe a peculiar feeling of weightless ness overcame him a great sensation of wellbeing he began to smile and then all became misty and it seemed he hung in a soft warm mist beyond space beyond time he was still absolutely conscious in one way and yet he was unaware of the world around him for a long time he remained in this state knowing vaguely that his body which no longer seemed much a part of him was being moved from one place to another the delicate colors of the mist changed sometimes from a shade of rosered to shades of skyblue and buttercup yellow but that was all he saw and he felt nothing at all he felt at peace as he had never felt before save perhaps as a small child in his mothers arms then the pastel shades began to be shot through with veins of darker grimmer colors and the sense of peace was grad ually lost as lightnings of black and bloodred zigzagged across his eyes he felt a wrenching sensation one of terrible agony and he screamed aloud then he opened his eyes to stare in horror at the machine before him it was identical with the one he had seen so long ago in the palace laboratories of king huon was he back in londra the webs of black gold and silver murmured to him but they did not caress him as they had done before instead they contracted moving away from him growing tighter and tighter together until they filled only a fraction of the space hawkmoon stared around him and saw malagigi and beyond him the laboratory where earlier he had rescued the sorcerer from the dark empires men malagigi looked exhausted but there was an expression of great selfsatisfaction on his old face he stepped forward with a metal box gathered up the machine of the black jewel and tossed it into the box closing the lid firmly and locking it the machine hawkmoon said thickly how did you get it i made it malagigi smiled made it duke hawkmoon aye it took a week of intensive effort while you lay there partly protected from the other machine the one in londra by my spells i thought for a while that i had lost the struggle but this morning the machine was complete save for one element what was that its life force that was the crucial issue whether i could time the spell aright you see i had to let the whole of the life of the black jewel come through and fill your mind then hope that this machine would absorb it before it could begin to eat hawkmoon smiled in relief and it did it did you are now free from that fear at any rate human dangers i can accept and meet cheerfully hawk moon said lifting himself from the couch i am in your debt lord malagigi if i can do you any service nay nothing malagigi said almost with a smirk i am glad to have this machine here he tapped the box per haps it will be of use to me sometime besides he frowned staring thoughtfully at hawkmoon what is it ah nothing malagigi shrugged hawkmoon touched his forehead the black jewel was still imbedded there but it was cold you did not remove the jewel no though it could be done if you desire it offers you no danger it would be a simple matter of surgery to cut it from your head hawkmoon was about to ask malagigi how this could be arranged when a thought came to him no he said at length no let it remain a symbol of my hatred for the dark empire i hope they will soon learn to fear that symbol you intend to carry on the fight against them then aye with redoubled effort now that you have freed me it is a force that should be countered malagigi said he drew a deep breath now i must sleep i am very tired you will find your friends awaiting you in the courtyard hawkmoon walked down the steps of the house into the bright warm sunshine of the early day and there was ola dahn a smile splitting his furry face almost in two beside him was the tall figure of the warrior in jet and gold you are completely well asked the warrior completely good then i will leave you farewell dorian hawk moon i thank you for your help hawkmoon said as the warrior began to stride toward his great white battle charger then as the warrior began to mount a memory returned and he said wait what is it the helmed head turned to regard him it was you who convinced malagigi he should remove the power of the black jewel you told him that i serve the power that you serve yet i know of no power that is my master you will know of it one day what is the power you serve i serve the runestaff said the warrior in jet and gold and he rattled the white horses heavy bridge urging his mount through the gate and away before hawkmoon could ask him further questions the runestaff is it oladahn murmured frowning a myth i thought aye a myth i believe that warrior enjoys mysteries doubtless he jokes with us hawkmoon grinned slapping oladahn on the shoulder if we see him again well get the truth from him im hungry a good dinner theres a banquet prepared at queen frawbras palace oladahn winked the finest ive seen and i think queens interest in you is not sparked merely by gratitude say you so well i hope i do not disappoint her friend oladahn for i am pledged to a fairer maid than frawbra is it possible aye come little friend lets enjoy the queens food and make preparations to return to the west must we leave so soon were heroes here and besides we deserve a rest surely hawkmoon smiled stay yourself if you will but ive a wedding to attend my own oh well sighed oladahn in mock grief i could not miss that event i suppose i will have to cut short my stay in hamadan queen frawbra herself escorted them to the gates of ham adan the next morning youll not think again dorian hawkmoon i offer you a throne the throne my brother died trying to win hawkmoon looked to the west two thousand miles and several months journey away yisselda awaited him not knowing whether he had succeeded in his goal or was now a victim of the black jewel count brass too waited and must be told of granbretans further infamy bowgentle doubt less was even now standing with yisselda in the turret of the topmost tower of castle brass looking over the wild fenland of the kamarg trying to console the girl who wondered if the man pledged to wed her would ever return he bowed in his saddle and kissed the queens hand i thank you your majesty and i am honored that you should think me worthy to rule with you but there is a pledge i must keep that i would forfeit twenty thrones to keep and i must go also my blade is needed against the dark empire then go she said sadly but remember hamadan and her queen i will he urged his great bluecoated stallion out across the rocky plain behind him oladahn turned blew a kiss to queen frawbra winked and rode after his friend dorian hawkmoon duke von koln rode steadily west ward to claim his love and take his vengeance
