 just when you think you have it all scoped out and youre riding high old fate will stampede right over you and not even stop to say im sorry happens every time if your name is garrett you can make book on it im garrett sitting pretty in my early thirties over six feet brown hair two hundred pounds plus maybe threatening to shoot up because my favorite food is beer i have a disposition variously described as sulky sour sarky or cynical anything with a sibilant sneaky and snaky my enemies claim but hell im a sweetheart really just a big old cuddly bear with a nice smile and soulful eyes dont believe everything you hear im just a realist who suffers from a recurrent tumor of romantic pragmatism once upon a time i was a lot more romantic then i did my five in the fleet marines that almost snuffed the spark keep that in mind that time in the corps if i hadnt been there none of this would have happened bonelazy morley would call me but thats a base canard from a character without the moral fiber to sit still more than five minutes im not lazy id just rather not work if i dont need money when i do i operate as a confidential agent which means i spend a lot of time in the middle between people you wouldnt invite to dinner kidnappers blackmailers thugs and thieves and killers my the things kids grow up to be it isnt a great life it wont get me into any history books but it does let me be my own boss set my own hours pick my jobs it lets me off a lot of hooks i dont have to make a lot of compromises with my conscience trying not to work when i dont need money means looking through the peephole first when someone knocks on the door of my place on macunado street if whoever is there looks like a prospective client i simply dont answer it was a false spring day early in the year it was supposed to be winter out there but somebody was nodding the snow had melted after six days of unnatural warmth the trees had conned themselves into budding theyd be sorry i hadnt been out since the thaw i was at my desk reckoning accounts on a couple of minor jobs id subcontracted thinking about taking a walk before cabin fever got me then somebody knocked it was deans day off i had to do the legwork myself i went to the door i peeked and i was startled and brother was i fooled whenever the big troubles came the harbinger always wore a skirt and looked like something you couldnt find anywhere but in your dreams in case thats too subtle its like this ive got a weakness for ripe tomatoes but im learning give me about a thousand years and this wasnt any tomato this was a guy id known a long time ago and never expected to see again one i hadnt ever wanted to see again when wed parted and he just looked uncomfortable out there not like he was in trouble so i opened the door that was my first mistake sarge whatre you doing here how the hell are you i shoved a hand at him something i wouldnt have dared do when i saw him last he was twenty years older than me the same height twenty pounds lighter he had skin the color of tanned doeskin big ears that stuck straight out wrinkles small black eyes black hair with a lot of gray that hadnt been there before no way to pin down exactly why but he was one of the ugliest men id ever known he looked damned fit but he was the kind that would look that way if he lived forever he stood there like he had a board nailed to his spine im fine he said and took my hand in a sincere shake those beady little eyes went over me like they could see right through me hed always had that knack youve put on a few pounds on in the middle off at the top i tapped my hair it wasnt noticeable to anyone but me yet come in whatre you doing in tunfaire im retired now out of the corps ive been hearing a lot about you into some exciting things i was in the neighborhood thought id drop in if youre not busy im not beer come on back to the kitchen i led the way into deans fiefdom the old boy wasnt there to defend it when did you get out been out three years garrett yeah i figured youd die in harness at a hundred fifty his name was blake peters the guys in the company called him black pete hed been our leading sergeant and the nearest thing to a god or devil any of us had known the kind of professional soldier that gives an outfit its spine i couldnt imagine him as a civilian three years out he looked like a marine sergeant in disguise we all change i started thinking too much instead of just doing what i was told the beer isnt bad it was damned good weider who owns the brewery had sent a keg of his special reserve to let me know he appreciated past favors and to remind me i was still on retainer i hadnt been around for a while he was afraid his employees might go into freelance sales again so whatre you doing now i was a little uncomfortable i never had the experience myself my father died in battle in the cantard when i was four but guys have told me theyd felt ill at ease dealing with their fathers man to man when that first happened black pete hadnt ever been a friend hed been the sergeant he wasnt anymore but i didnt know him any other way im working for general stantnor i was on his staff when he retired he asked me to go with him i did it i grunted stantnor had been a colonel when i was in hed been boss of all the marines operating out of full harbor about two thousand men id never met him but id had plenty to say about him during my stint not much of it was complimentary about the time id gotten out hed become commandant of the whole corps and had moved to leifmold where the karentine navy and marines have their headquarters jobs about the same as it was but the pays better peters said you look like youre doing all right own your own place i hear about then i started getting suspicious it was just a niggling little worm a whisper hed done some homework before he came which meant he wasnt just stopping in for old times sake i dont go hungry i admitted but i do worry about tomorrow about how long the reflexes will last and the mind will stay sharp the legs arent what they used to be you need more exercise you havent been keeping yourself up it shows i snorted another morley dotes dont start with the green leafies and red meat ive already got a fairy godfather to pester me about that he looked puzzled which was some sight on that phiz sorry private joke sort of so youre just sort of taking it easy these days eh i hadnt heard stantnors name much since hed retired i knew hed come home to tunfaire to the family estate south of the city but that was it hed become a recluse ignoring politics and business the usual pursuits of ranking survivors of the endless cantard war we havent had much choice he sounded sour and looked troubled for a moment he planned to go into material contracting but he took sick maybe something he picked up in the islands took the fire out of him hes bedridden most of the time pity on the plus side of stantnors ledger had been the fact that he hadnt sat in an office in full harbor spending his troops like markers on a game board when the big shitstorms hit he was out in the weather with the rest of us a pity and i said so maybe worse than a pity garrett hes taken a turn for the worse i think hes dying and i think somebody is helping him along suspicion became certainty you didnt just happen to be in the neighborhood he was direct no im here to collect he didnt have to explain there was a time when wed gotten caught with our pants down on one of the islands a surprise venageti invasion nearly wiped us out we survivors had fled into the swamps and had lived on whatever didnt eat us first while we harrassed the venageti sergeant peters had brought us through that i owed him for that but i owed him more hed carried me away when id been injured during a raid he hadnt had to do it i couldnt have done anything but lie there waiting for the venageti to kill me he said that old man means a lot to me garrett hes the only family ive got somebodys killing him slowly but i cant figure out who or how i cant stop it ive never felt this helpless and out of control so i come to a man who has a reputation for handling the unhandleable i didnt want a client but garrett pays his debts i took a long drink a deep breath cursed under my breath tell me about it peters shook his head i dont want to fill you up with ideas that didnt work for me damnit sarge garrett he still had the whipcrack voice that got your attention without being raised im listening hes got other problems ive sold him on hiring a specialist to handle them ive sold him your reputation and my memories of you from the corps hell interview you tomorrow morning if you remember to knock the horse apples off your shoes before you go in the house hell hire you do the job he wants done but while youre at it do the real job got me i nodded it was screwy but clients are that way they always want to sneak up on things to everyone else youll be a hired hand job unknown antecedents mostly unknown you should use another name you have a certain level of notoriety the name garrett might ring a bell i sighed you make it sound like i might spend a lot of time there i want you to stay till the job is done ill need the name youre going to use before i leave or you wont get past the front door mike sexton i plucked it off the top of my head but it had to be divine inspiration if a little dangerous mike sexton had been our companys chief scout he hadnt come back from that island peters had sent him out before a night strike and wed never seen him again hed been black petes main man his only friend peterss face went hard and cold his eyes narrowed dangerously he started to say something but black pete never shot his mouth off without thinking he grunted itll work people have heard me mention the name ill explain how we know each other i dont think i told anybody hes gone he wouldnt he wouldnt brag about his mistakes even to himself id bet part of him was still waiting for sexton to report thats the way i figured it he downed the last of his beer youll do it you knew i would before you pounded on the door i didnt have any choice he smiled it looked out of place on that ugly mug i wasnt a hundred percent sure you were always a stubborn bastard he took out a worn canvas purse the same one hed had back when fatter than it had been before he counted out fifty marks in silver which was a statement of sorts the price of silver has been shooting up since glory mooncalled doublecrossed everybody and declared the whole cantard an independent republic with no welcome for karentines venageti or what have you silver is the fuel that makes sorcery go both karenta and venageta sway to the whims of cabals of sorcerers the biggest most productive silver mines in the world lie in the cantard which is why the ruling gangs have been at war there since my grandfather was a pup till the mercenary glory mooncalled pulled his stunt hes made it stick so far but ill be amazed if he keeps it up hes got everybody pissed and hes right in the middle it wont be long before its war as usual down there i opened my mouth to tell peters he didnt need to pay me i owed him but i realized he did need to he was calling in an obligation but not for free he didnt expect me to work for nothing he just wanted me to work and maybe he was paying off something to the general by footing the bill eight a day and expenses i told him discount for a friend ill kick back if this comes out too much or ill bill you if i need more i took the fifty into the dead mans room for safekeeping the dead man was hard at what he does best snoozing all four hundred plus pounds of him hed been at it so long id begun to miss his company with that thought i decided it was time i took a job missing the dead mans company was like missing the company of an inquisitor peters was ready to go when i got back see you in the morning he asked there was a whisper of desperation behind his words ill be there guaranteed it was eleven in the morning theyd roofed the sky with planks of lead i walked though the generals hovel was four miles beyond south gate me and horses dont get along i wished id taken the chance my pins were letting me know i spend too much time planted on the back of my lap then fat raindrops started making coinsized splats on the road i wished some more i was going to get wet if the old man and i didnt hit it off i shifted my duffel bag to my other shoulder and tried to hurry that did all the good it ever does id bathed and shaved and combed my hair i had on my best meet the rich folks outfit i figured theyd give me credit for trying and not run me off before they asked my name i hoped black pete was on the level and had left that at the door the stantnor place wasnt exactly a squatters shanty i figured maybe a million marks worth of brick and stone and timber the grounds wouldnt have had any trouble gobbling the lost battalion i didnt need a map to find the house but i was lucky the general had put out a paved private road for me to follow the shack was four storeys high at the wings and five in the center in the style called frame halftimber and it spread out wide enough that i couldnt throw a rock from one corner to the other of the front i tried it was a good throw but the stone fell way short a fat raindrop got me in the back of the neck i scampered up a dozen marble steps to the porch i took a minute to arrange my face so i wouldnt look impressed when somebody answered the door you want to deal with the rich youve got to overcome the intimidation factor of wealth the door which would have done a castle proud as a drawbridge swung in without a sound maybe a foot a man looked out all i could see was his face i almost asked him what the grease bill was for silencing those monster hinges yes mike sexton im expected yes the face puckered up where did he get lemons this time of year maybe he wasnt thrilled to see me but he did open up and let me into a hallway where you could park a couple of woolly mammoths if you didnt want to leave them out in the rain he said ill inform the general that youve arrived sir he walked away like theyd shoved a javelin up his back in boot camp marching to drums only he could hear obviously another old marine like black pete he was gone awhile i entertained myself by drifting along the hallway introducing myself to the stantnor ancestors a dozen of whom scowled at me from portraits on the walls the artists had been selected for their ability to capture their subjects private misery every one of those old boys was constipated i inventoried three beards three mustaches and six clean shaven the stantnor blood was strong they looked like brothers instead of generations going back to the foundation of the karentine state only their uniforms dated them all of them were in uniform or armor stantnors had been professional soldiers sailors marines forever it was a birthright or maybe an obligation like it or not which might explain the universal dyspepsia the last portrait on the left was the general himself as commandant of the corps he wore a huge ferocious white mustache and had a faraway look in his eyes as if he were standing on the poop of a troopship staring at something beyond the horizon his was the only portrait that hadnt been painted so its subjects eyes followed you when you moved it was disconcerting having all those angry old men glaring down maybe the portraits were supposed to intimidate upstarts like me opposite the general hung the only portrait of a young man the generals son a marine lieutenant who hadnt developed the family scowl i didnt recall his name but did remember him getting killed in the islands while i was in hed been the old mans only male offspring there wouldnt be any more portraits to put up on those darkpaneled walls the hall ended in a wall of leaded glass that rose the hallways two storey height a mosaic of scenes from myth and legend all bloodthirstily executed heroes slaying dragons felling giants posturing atop heaps of elvish corpses while awaiting another charge all stuff of antiquity when we humans didnt get along with the other races the doors through that partition were normal size also filled with glass artwork from the same school the butler or whatever he was had left them ajar i took that as an invitation the hall beyond could have been swiped from a cathedral it was as big as a parade ground and four storeys high all stone mostly swirly browns from butterscotch to rust folded into cream the walls were decorated with trophies presumably won by stantnors in battle there were enough weapons and banners to outfit a battalion the floor was a checkerboard of white marble and green serpentine in its middle stood a fountain a hero on a rearing stallion sticking a lance into the heart of a ferocious dragon that looked suspiciously like one of the bigger flying thunderlizards both of them looked like theyd rather be somewhere else couldnt say i blamed them neither one was going to get out alive the hero was about one second short of sliding off the horses behind right into the dragons claws the sculptor had said a lot that undoubtedly no one understood i told them you two want to scrap over a virgin you should work a deal i headed for the fountain heels clicking the walls throwing back echoes i turned around a few times taking in the sights hallways ran off into the wings stairs went up to balconies in front of each of the upper floors there were lots of polished round brown pillars and legions of echoes the place couldnt be a home only thing id ever seen like it was a museum you had to wonder what went on inside the head of a guy who would want to build a place like that to live it was damned near as cold in there as it was outside i shivered checked out the fountain up close it wasnt going or at least id have had its chuckles for company seemed a pity the sound would have improved the atmosphere maybe they only turned it on when they were entertaining ive always had a soft spot in my heart for the idea of being rich i guess most people do but if this was the way the rich had to live i thought maybe i could settle for less my trade has taken me into any number of large homes and every one seemed to have a certain coldness at its heart the nicest id hit belonged to chodo contague tunfaires emperor of the underworld hes a grotesque a real blackheart but his place at least fakes the life and warmth and his decorator has his priorities straight once when i was there the house was littered with naked lovelies thats what i call home furnishings thats a lot more cheerful than a bargeload of instruments of war i dropped my duffel bag put a foot up on the fountain surround and rested my elbows on my knee you boys go ahead with what youre doing ill try not to disturb hero and dragon were both too preoccupied to notice i looked around where the hell was everybody a place that size ought to have a battalion for staff id seen livelier museums at midnight well all was not lost in fact things had started to look up id spotted a face it was looking at me around a pillar supporting the balconies to my left the west wing it was female and gorgeous and too far away to tell much else but that was all i needed to get my blood moving again the woman attached was as timid as a dryad she ducked out of sight an instant after our eyes met the part of me that is weak wondered if id see more of her i hoped so i could get lost in a face like that she did a little flit into the nearest hallway i got just a glimpse but wanted her to come back she was worth a second look and maybe a third and a fourth a longhaired slim blonde in something white and gauzy gathered at the waist by a red girdle around twenty give or take a few and sleek enough to put a big goofy grin on my face id keep an eye out for that one unless she was a ghost shed gone without making a sound whatever she was going to haunt me till i got a closer look was the place haunted it was spooky enough in its cold way i realized it was me might not bother someone else i looked around and heard the clash of steel and the moans of those who had died to furnish all those emblems of stantnor glory i was packing my own haunts in and letting the place become a mirror i tried to shake a darkening mood a place like that turns you somber the guy from the front door marched in after the girl disappeared his heels clicking he came to a perfect military halt six feet away i gave him the onceover he stood fivefooteight maybe a hundred seventy pounds in his fifties but looking younger his hair was wavy black slicked with some kind of grease that couldnt beat the curl if he had any gray he hid it well and he still had all the hair hed had when he was twenty his eyes were cold little beads you could get ice burns there hed kill you and not even wonder if he was making orphans the general will see you now sir he turned and marched away i followed i caught myself marching in step skipped to get out in a minute i was back in step i gave it up theyd pounded it in good the flesh remembered and couldnt hear the rebellion in the mind you have a name i asked dellwood sir what were you before you got out i was attached to the generals staff sir which meant absolutely nothing lifer dumb question garrett i could bet the family farm i was the only nonlifer in the place excepting the girl maybe the general wouldnt surround himself with the lesser breeds called civilians thirtytwo years sir he asked no questions himself not into small talk and chitchat no he didnt care i was one of them maybe i should have come to the tradesmans entrance he grunted tough the general had my respect for what hed accomplished not for who hed been born dellwood had twenty years on me but i was the guy doing the puffing when we hit the fourth floor about six wise remarks ran through my alleged brain but i didnt have wind enough to share them dellwood gave me an unreadable look probably veiled contempt for soft civilians i puffed awhile then to distract him said i saw a woman while i was waiting watching me timid as a mouse that would be miss jennifer sir the generals daughter he looked like he thought hed made a mistake volunteering that much he didnt say anything else one of those guys who wouldnt tell you what he thought you didnt need to know if you burned his toes off was the whole staff struck from the same dies then why did peters need me they could handle anything dellwood marched to an oaken door that spanned half the corridor on the top floor of the west wing he pushed the door inward announced mr mike sexton sir a wall of heat smacked me as i pushed past dellwood id come with no preconceptions but i was still surprised general stantnor preferred spartan surroundings other than the rooms size there was nothing to hint that he was hip deep in geld there were no carpets a few straightbacked wooden chairs the ubiquitous military hardware two writing desks nose to nose the bigger one presumably for the general and the other for whoever actually wrote the place was almost a mausoleum the heat came off a bonfire raging in a fireplace designed for roasting oxen another gink without joints in his spine was tossing in logs from a nearby mountain he looked at me looked at the old man behind the big desk the old man nodded the fireman marched out maybe to kill time practicing close order drill with dellwood having surveyed the setting i zeroed in on its centerpiece i could see why black pete was suspicious there wasnt much left of general stantnor he didnt look anything like the guy in the picture downstairs he looked like he might weigh about as much as a mummy though most of him was buried under comforters ten years ago hed been my height and thirty pounds heavier his skin had a yellowish cast and was mildly translucent his pupils were milky with cataracts his hair had fallen out in clumps only a few patches remained not just gray or white but with a bluish hue of death he had liver spots but those had faded too his lips had no color left but a poisonous grayblue i dont know how well he could see through those cataracts but his gaze was strong and steady he didnt shake mike sexton sir sergeant peters asked me to see you grab a chair pull it up there facing me i dont like to look up when i talk to someone there was power in his voice though i dont know where he found the energy id figured him for a graverobbers whisper i settled opposite him he said for the moment im confident were not being overheard mr garrett yes i know who you are peters provided me with a full report before i approved bringing you in he kept staring as though he could overcome those cataracts through sheer will but well pursue the mike sexton fiction in future assuming we come to terms now i was close enough to smell him and it wasnt a good smell i was surprised the whole room didnt reek they must have brought him in from somewhere else peters didnt say what you needed sir he just called in an old marker to get me out here i glanced at the fireplace they would be baking bread in here soon it takes a great deal of heat to keep me going mr garrett my apologies for your discomfort ill try to keep this brief im a little like a thunderlizard i generate no heat of my own i waited for him to continue and sweated a lot i have peterss word that you were a good marine no doubt that counted for a lot around here he vouches for your character then but men change what have you become a freelance thug instead of a drafted one general which you need or i wouldnt be here he made a noise that might have been laughter ah id heard you have a sharp tongue mr garrett i should be the impatient one not you i have so little time left yes peters vouches for you today as well and you do get mentioned in some circles as being reliable though headstrong and inclined to carry out your assignments according to your own lights they say you have a sentimental streak that shouldnt trouble us here they say you have a weakness for women i think youll find my daughter more trouble than shes worth they say you tend to be judgmental of the vices and peccadillos of my class i wondered if he knew how often i change my underwear why did he need an investigator let him use whoever had investigated me again that sorry laugh i can guess what youre thinking everything i know is public knowledge your reputation runs before you something that might have been a smile in better times youve managed to do a fair amount of good over the years mr garrett but you stepped on a lot of toes doing it im just a clumsy kid general ill grow out of it i doubt it you dont seem intimidated by me im not i wasnt id met too many guys who really were intimidating i had calluses on that organ you would have been ten years ago different circumstances indeed good i need a man who wont be intimidated especially by me because i fear that if you do your job right you may uncover truths i wont want to face truths so brutal i may tell you to back off you wont do that he had me baffled im confused the normal state of the world mr garrett i mean when i hire you if i hire you if you agree to take this job your commitment will be to follow it through to the end disregarding anything i tell you later ill see that youre paid up front so you arent tempted to bend in order to collect your fee i still dont get it i pride myself on my ability to meet the truth headon in this case i want to arrange it so i have no choice however much i squirm and ache can you understand that yes only in the most literal sense i didnt understand why we all spend a lot of time fooling ourselves and his class were masters at that though hed always had a reputation for having both feet firmly planted in reality hed disobeyed or refused orders more than once because they had originated in wishful thinking by superiors who hadnt come within five hundred miles of the fighting each time events had saved him embarrassment by proving him right he didnt have a lot of friends before i make any commitment i have to know what im supposed to do there is a thief in my house mr garrett he stopped because of some kind of spasm i thought he was having a heart attack i jumped up and headed for the door wait he croaked it will pass i paused midway between my chair and the door saw the spasm fade in a moment he was back to normal i perched myself on my chair again a thief in my house yet there is no one here i havent known for thirty years no one i havent trusted with my life many times that had to be a weird feeling knowing you could trust guys with your life but not with your things i got a glimmer of why he needed an outsider a bad apple amongst old comrades they might cover up refuse to see the truth or who knows marines dont think like people i follow go ahead my infirmity came upon me soon after i returned home its a progressive consumption apparently but slow i seldom get out of my quarters now but ive noticed this past year that some things some of which have been in the family for centuries have disappeared never large flashy things that would be obvious to any eye just trinkets sometimes more valuable as mementoes than intrinsically yet the sum should add to a fair amount by now i see i glanced at the fire it was time to turn me over so i wouldnt be underdone on one side bear with me a few minutes more mr garrett yes sir any strangers in the house recently any regular visitors a handful people off the hill not the sort who would pilfer i didnt say so but in my thinking the worst of all criminals come off the hill our nobility would steal the coppers off dead mens eyes but the general had a point they wouldnt steal with their own hands theyd have somebody do it for them you have an inventory of whats missing would that be useful maybe somebody steals something they want to sell it to get money right i know some of the retailers whose wholesalers are people with sticky fingers do you want the stuff back or do you just want to know whos kyping it the latter step first mr garrett then well consider recovery sudden as a lightning bolt he suffered another spasm i felt helpless unable to do anything for him that was not a good sensation he came back but this time he was weaker ill have to close this out quickly mr garrett ill need to rest or the next attack may be the last he smiled there were teeth missing behind the smile another reason to make sure you get your fee up front my heirs might not see fit to pay you i wanted to say something reassuring like hed outlive me but that seemed too cynically a load of manure i kept my mouth shut i can do that sometimes though usually at the wrong time id like to get to know you better mr garrett but nature has its own priorities ill hire you if youll have me for a client will you find me my thief on the terms i stated no punches pulled no backing off exactly yes sir i had to force it out i really was getting lazy im on it now good good dellwood should be outside tell him i want peters i got up will do general i backed toward the door even in his present state the old man retained some of the magnetism that had made him a charismatic commander i didnt want to pity him i really wanted to help him i wanted to find the villain black pete said was trying to kill him the cool in the hallway felt like high winter in the arctic for a second i worried about frostbite the general was right about dellwood he was there waiting the way he did it suggested hed been scrupulous about not getting so close he might overhear anything though i doubted explosions could be heard through that door i decided i could like the guy in spite of the stick up his spine the general says he wants to see peters very good sir id better attend to that if youll return to the fountain and wait sure but hold on whats wrong with him he had a couple of pretty fierce attacks while i was in there that stopped him dead he looked at me emotion leaking through for once he loved that old man and he was worried bad spasms sir they looked that way to me but im no doc he cut the interview short because he was afraid another one would be too much for him id better check on him before i do anything else whats wrong with him i asked again i dont know sir weve tried bringing physicians in but he throws them out when he finds out what they are he has a morbid fear of doctors from what theyve said i understand that a physicians care might not do any good they havent done anything but scratch their heads and say they dont understand it good to see you can talk dellwood i believe the general brought you on board sir youre one of the household now i liked that attitude most people i meet either stay clammed or tell lies id like to talk to you some more when you get the time yes sir he pushed through the generals door i found my way to the fountain wasnt that hard but id become one of the company scouts after sexton disappeared i was a highly trained finder of the way peters often reminded me how much the crown had invested in me id left my bag leaning against the fountain for lack of desire to lug it around before i decided if i was hired it had seemed safe enough still as the place was i mean id visited livelier ruins someone was digging through it when i reached that temple to overstated militarism she had her back to me and a mighty fine backside it was she was tall and slim and brunette she wore a simple tan shift in imitation peasant style it probably set somebody back more money than a peasant saw in five years her behind wiggled deliciously as she dug it looked like shed only gotten started i moved out on scouts tippytoes stopped four feet behind her gave her fanny an approving nod said find anything interesting she whirled i started the face was the same as the one id seen earlier but this time it wasnt timid at all this face had more lines in it it was more worldly that other face had had the placidity behind timidity that you see in nuns her eyes flashed who are you she demanded unrepentant i like my ladies unrepentant about some things but not about snooping in my stuff sexton who are you why are you going through my stuff how come youre carrying a portable arsenal i need it in my work i answered a couple your turn she looked me up and down raised an eyebrow looked like she didnt know if she approved or not wound me to the core then she snorted and walked away im not the handsomest guy in town but the lovelies dont usually respond that way had to be part of a plan i watched her go she moved well she exaggerated it a little knowing she had an audience she disappeared into the shadows under the west balcony going to be some strange ones here i muttered i checked my bag shed stirred it up but nothing was missing id arrived in time to keep her out of the little padded box with the bottles inside i doublechecked though opening it there were three bottles royal blue emerald green ruby red each weighed about two ounces they were plunder from a past case their contents had been whipped up by a sorcerer they could get real handy in tight situations i hoped i didnt have to use them id brought along more tightsituation stuff than clothing clothing washes i prowled the hall while i waited for dellwood that was like visiting a museum alone none of the stuff there meant anything to me richly storied all of it no doubt but ive never been a guy to get excited about history for its own sake dellwood took his time after half an hour i started eyeballing an old bugle wondering what would happen if i gave it a couple of toots then i spotted the blonde again watching me from about as far away as she could get and still be in that hall with me i waved im a friendly kind of guy she ducked out of sight a mouse this one dellwood finally showed i asked the general all right hes resting sir hell be fine he didnt sound convinced sergeant peters will handle the requests you made now he sounded puzzled im curious sir what are you doing here the general sent for me he looked at me a moment said if youll come with me ill show you your quarters after wed climbed to the fourth floor east wing and he had me puffing again he tried another tack will you be staying long i dont know i hoped not the place was getting to me already it was too much a tomb in the other wing the master was dying and the place seemed to be dying with him as dellwood opened a door i asked what will you do after the general passes on i havent given that much thought sir i dont expect him to go soon hell beat this his ancestors all lived into their eighties and nineties whistling in the dark he had no future he could see the world didnt have much room for lifers with their best years used up which made me wonder again why anyone in that house would want stantnor to check out early black petes suspicions were improbable logically but logic doesnt usually come into play when people start thinking about killing other people i hadnt looked at the thing yet id keep an open mind till id done some poking and prying and just plain listening whats the word on meals dellwood im not equipped for formal dining we havent dressed since the general took ill sir breakfast is at six lunch at eleven in the kitchen supper is at five in the dining room but informally guests and staff sit down together if that presents any problems not to me im an egalitarian kind of guy i think im just as good as you are i missed lunch eh i wasnt going to be happy here if i had to conform to the native schedule i see six in the morning only when i havent gotten to bed yet the trouble with morning is that it comes so damned early in the morning im sure something can be arranged this once ill tell cook we have a newly arrived guest thanks ill take a minute to settle in then get down there very well sir if anything is not satisfactory let me know ill see that any problems are corrected he would too sure thanks i watched him step out and close the door i could not imagine things going awry considering some scenes ive endured dellwood had installed me in a suite bigger than the ground floor of my house the room where i stood boasted rosewood wainscotting mahogany ceiling beams a wall of bookshelves loaded down and furniture for entertaining a platoon a dining table with seats for four a writing table various chairs leaded and plain glass windows unfortunately facing north a carpet some old lady had spent the last twenty years of her life weaving maybe three hundred years ago lamps enough to do my whole house a chandelier overhead loaded with a gaggle of candles unlighted at the moment this was how the other half lived two doors opened off the big room i made a guess and pushed through one what a genius hit the bedroom first time it was of a piece with the rest id never met a bed so big and soft i looked around for hiding places squirreled some of my equipment good some so it could be found easily and the rest maybe overlooked i kept the most important stuff on my person i figured id better hit the kitchen while the staff were still understanding after i stoked the bodily fires i could wander around like an old ghost in better times the kitchen probably boasted a staff of a dozen with fulltime specialists like bakers and pastry cooks when i dropped in there was only one person present an ancient breed woman whose nonhuman half appeared to be troll wrinkled shrunken stooped she was still a foot taller than me and a hundred pounds heavier even at her age she could probably break me over her knee if i stood still and let her lay hands on me you the new one she growled when i walked in thats me names sexton mike sexton names mud you dont show on time after this youngun sit she pointed i didnt argue i sat at a table threequarters buried in used utensils and stoneware plunk she slammed something down in front of me you served with the general too smartass eh you want to eat eat dont try to be a comedian right just making conversation i looked at my plate all kinds of chunks of something i didnt recognize mixed up in slimy sauce piled on rice i approached it with the trepidation i usually reserve for the stuff they serve at my friend morleys place the citys only vegetarian restaurant open to a mixed clientele if i want conversation ill ask for it look around here it look like i got time to waste jacking my jaw been trying to carry it on my own since they threw candy out on his ass i keep telling the old skinflint i need another pair of hands think hell listen hell no all he sees is hes saving a couple marks a week i took a bite here a bite there there seemed to be mussels and mushrooms and a couple things i couldnt identify and all damned good this is excellent i said where you been eating its slop i got no helper i dont got time to fix anything right she started tossing pots at a sink sending sprays of water flying barely got time to get ready for the next feeding these hogs you think they know the difference feed them hot sawdust mush they wouldnt know it maybe not but id had old dean cooking for me for a while and i knew good food when i bit it how many do you have to take care of eighteen counting myself bloody army what do you care mr nineteen and straw that broke the camels back that many the place is like a haunted house ive seen the general dellwood and you and some old boy who was stoking the fireplace in the generals study kaid and two women where are the rest on maneuvers wise ass eh where did you see two women that ass harcourt sneaking one of his floozies in here again hell i hope he is i just hope he is ill have the old man put him on kp for a year get this cesspool cleaned out what the hell you doing here anyway we aint had nobody new here for two years no honesttogoodness guests in a year and a half just in and outs from uptown their noses in the air like they dont squat to shit like everybody else whew to tell the truth miss she didnt take the hook to tell the truth im not quite sure the general sent for me said he wanted to hire me but he had some kind of attack before she melted the vinegar drained out in two seconds how bad is it maybe id better go see dellwoods taken care of it says he just needs to rest he got himself overwrought this fellow harcourt he has a habit of bringing girlfriends home not since a couple years back what the hell you asking all the questions for aint none of your damned business what we do or who we do it with she had a thought she stopped dead still stepped away from the sink turned laid a firstclass glower on me or is it your business i didnt say i tried to slide around it by offering her my empty plate wouldnt be a little more of that would there just to fill a couple empty spots it is your business the old man has another fantasy thinks somebodys out to get him or somebodys robbing him she shook her head youre wasting your time or maybe not long as hes paying you it dont matter if you find something does it hell probably better if you dont you can rob him yourself taking money for nothing till the fantasy wears off i was confused but covered it somebodys been robbing the general nobodys robbing him the old boy aint got a pot to pee in not counting this damned stone barn and its too damned big to carry off anyway if somebody was robbing him i wouldnt tell you word one not no outsider i dont never say nothing to no outsiders theyre all a bunch of con artists commendable attitude i wiggled my plate suggestively i got my hands in dishwater up to my elbows and you dont look like you got no broken legs get it yourself be happy to if i knew where she made an exasperated noise made allowance for the fact that i was new on the damned stove rice in the steel pot stew in the iron kettle i worry about the old boy these fancies more and more all the time must be the sickness touching him though he always did think somebody was trying to do him out of something wouldnt say a word to an outsider i was proud of her it isnt possible somebody might actually be robbing him like they say even paranoids get persecuted who you tell me that mr smartass snooper aint nobody in this whole damned place wouldnt wrestle thunderlizards for him half of them would take the disease for him if they could i didnt make the point but people work kinky deals with their consciences i had no trouble imagining a man willing to die for the general being equally willing to steal from him the very willingness to serve could set off a chain of justifications making theft sound completely reasonable shed figured me out in fifteen minutes how long would it be before word spread you ever have a problem with pixies or brownies the countryside suffered periodic infestations like termites or mice the little people are fond of baubles and have no respect for property we had any around here id put them to work i figured she would dellwood hinted that the general has a prejudice against doctors in his condition id think hed be ready to try anything you dont know that boy hes got a stubborn streak a yard wide he by damned made up his mind when the missus died he wasnt never going to trust no quack again and he stuck uhm she wouldnt talk to no outsider not her no siree see he loved that girl miss tiffany such a lovely child she was broke all our hearts when it happened they laughed at him he was so much older than her but he was her hearts slave him that never loved a thing before then miss jennifer came she was in labor so long he couldnt stand to see her in pain he brought in doctors from the city after miss jennifer finally came one damned fool gave miss tiffany a damned anticoagulant infusion thought he was giving her a sleeping potion a big mistake and an especially stupid one sounded like she bled to death she did might have anyway she was a frail pale thing but you couldnt never convince him mistakes that cost lives arent easy to understand or forgive but they happen despite what they want us mortals to believe doctors are human and where there are human beings theres human error its inevitable when doctors make mistakes people hurt easy for me to be understanding i hadnt known and loved the generals wife changed his whole life that did went off and spent the rest of it in the cantard taking out his grief on the venageti and when generals make mistakes lots of people hurt you going to hang out here all day youngster you better roll up your sleeves and get washing round here we dont got no place for drones i was tempted she had plenty to say still maybe later if it looks like im wasting my time i might as well wash dishes she snorted thought that would get rid of you never knowed a man yet with balls enough to wade into a mountain of dirty dishes of his own free will the lunch was great thank you miss didnt work this time either that fountain in the great hall was a good hub from which to launch exploratory forays i perched on the surround digesting cooks remarks i had a premonition i would get intimate with dishwater before i exhausted that vein of stubborn silence i had that creepy feeling you get when you sense somebody watching you i looked around casually there she was the blonde again drifting in the shadows bold enough now to be on the same floor with me i pretended not to notice i gave it a minute got up stretched she ducked out of sight i moved her way pretending i had no idea she was there she lit out like a scared pheasant i bolted after her jennifer i ducked between pillars where did she go i didnt see anywhere she could run but she wasnt there spooky hey mike what are you doing i jumped about five feet peters dont sneak up like that this place has got me believing in spooks already where the hell is everybody peters looked puzzled everybody working that made sense you could lose a lot more than eighteen people in that barn and on those grounds youd think id run into somebody once in a while it does get lonely at times he smiled that made two times in two days a record thought you might want a tour i can find my way i was a scout in the marines you know his smile vanished he looked at me like the old black pete like i wasnt bright enough to tie my own shoes he jerked his head toward the back of the hall the north end which was a wall of leaded glass with fifty furious combats going there was a door back there hey mom garrett didnt raise many idiots i got it i could use a look at the grounds though and somebody to tell me what im seeing he relaxed some did a slick aboutface and marched i huptwothreed behind him i didnt feel a bit of nostalgia for the bad old days peters didnt say anything till we were out of earshot of the house clear of the formal garden behind it away from cover where eavesdroppers might lurk you saw the old man what do you think hes in bad shape you know any poisons that could do that to him i gave it an honest think no but im no expert i know a guy who is but hed have to see the general morley dotes knows whatever there is to know about doing in your fellow man or elf him being a breed with more darkelfin than human blood i dont think i could swing that one outsider here has the place in an uproar already yeah its a regular bustedup beehive our walk to isolation hadnt shown me a single body in motion it was just a suggestion you want to know something you get the answer from somebody who knows ill give it a shot the business about the thefts is it real the cook thinks its all in the generals imagination its not shed think that back when we first came here he did have a spell when he imagined things she doesnt get out of the kitchen much and she has a few loose threads herself most of the time she doesnt know what year it is she tried to draft me as kitchen help she would gods i remember your cooking i remember what i had to work with muskrats and cattail roots and bugs for garnish he grunted almost smiled again dont tell me you cant have fond memories of those days no garrett even lifers arent that crazy i dont miss that part he shuddered eh what bad rumor they may call up the veterans to run glory mooncalled down i laughed whats so damned funny best joke ive heard in weeks you know how many people that takes in every human male in the population over twentyfive you think any of them would go without a fuss a callup like that would start a revolution maybe you think it could be poison i suppose assume it is speculate i dont know anything about poisons how could it be given to him im not an expert but i have a professional interest and keep my ears open when such things are discussed it could be in his food or drink it could be dusted into his bed so it would seep through his skin it could even be in the air he breathes looking for how can be a dead end unless you know what better to look at the people who has access everybody one way or another take it a step farther whod profit if somebodys killing him that somebody has to have a reason right he grunted obviously whoevers doing it believes he has ive been trying to figure that out from the beginning and i cant come up with one i didnt have any trouble whats the estate worth who does it go to doesnt make sense jennifer gets half the other half gets divided amongst the rest of us give me a value in gold marks just a guess then ask yourself what some people might do for a share of that three million for the house he shrugged a million for the contents two or three million for the real estate he was offered three for the two north sections last year he was tempted because hes strapped for cash and he wants to set jennifer up so shes fixed for life no matter what she does three million for just part of the property somebody wanted the land near the city but the offer was withdrawn because he dithered they bought a tract from the hillmans instead for less money no bad feelings not that i heard i did some rough division in my head i came up with around a hundred thousand marks each for the minority heirs i knew guys whod cut a hundred thousand throats for that kind of money so there was a motive assuming somebody was in a hurry to get his share everybody know theyre in the will sure the old man used to make a big deal of it how if you didnt toe the mark you blew your share ha cook mentioned a candy not him hes long gone he wouldnt have the balls either he wasnt even human wasnt in the will either wasnt one of the guys the old man brought home with him he was one of the crew who managed the place while the general was in the cantard she mentioned a harcourt who got in trouble for bringing girlfriends home harcourt he frowned i guess he got fed up with what he thought were chickenshit rules he just took off about six months back the old man cut him out hed know that so theres nothing for him to gain let alone wed see him around here we may have to back off and go at this from another angle sarge eh what have i got to go on your feelings but every time i ask you a question you make it sound more like theres nobody whod want him dead and nobody whod profit from it since everybodys getting a cut anyway we cant hang up a solid motive and means and opportunity are limited youre sneaking up on something im wondering if maybe he isnt just dying of stomach cancer wondering if maybe you shouldnt hire a doctor instead of me till you know whats killing him he didnt answer for a few minutes i was talked out we walked he brooded and i studied the grounds somebody had farmed the fields last summer there was nobody in them now i glanced at the sky theyd thrown on a few more slabs of lead and added icicles to the breeze winter was coming back i tried garrett two months ago somebody leaked it to the old man the doc never got through the front door the way he said somebody i guessed he knew who i asked he didnt want to say who sarge we cant pick and choose our suspects jennifer she was in on the plot but she defected shes a strange girl her big goal in life is to win some gesture of love and approval and the old man doesnt know how hes scared of her she grew up while he was away it doesnt help that she looks a lot like her mother her mother died cook told me that story she would that old hag knows everything and tells anyone wholl listen you ought to move into the kitchen we walked some more headed south now circling the house peters said maybe we have a communication problem the deeper you get in the more youll think the mess is imaginary the old man has crazy spells he does think people are out to get him when theyre not thats what makes this diabolical unless somebody sticks a knife in him in front of everybody nobodys going to believe hes in danger i grunted i had a friend pokey pigotta in the same line as me hes dead now but once hed had a case that worked that way a crazy old woman with a lot of money always down with imaginary illnesses and besieged by imaginary enemies pokey discounted her fears her son did her in pokey was haunted by that one ill keep an open mind thats all i ask stick with it dont let it get to you sure but we could shortcut everything if we could get a few experts in i said id try dont hold your breath it was hard enough selling you we continued our circuit of the grounds at one point we passed near a graveyard family plot i asked for three hundred years i glanced at the house it brooded down on us from that point it doesnt look that old it isnt there was an earlier house check the outbuildings in back you can still see some of its foundations they tore it down for materials to build the outbuildings after the new house went up i supposed id have to give them the onceover you have to go through all the motions you have to leave no stone unturned though already intuitively i was inclined to think the answer lay inside the big house if there was an answer peters read my mind if im fooling myself and weve just got an old man dying i want to know that too check check ive spent more time with you than i should id better get back to work where do i find you if i need you he chuckled im like horse apples im everywhere catch as catch can a problem youll have with everybody especially during poacher season cooks the only one who stays in one place we walked toward the house passing through a small orchard of unidentifiable fruit trees with a white gazebo at its center climbed a slope went up the steps to the front door peters went inside i paused to survey the stantnor domains the cold wind gnawed my cheeks the overcast left the land colorless and doleful like old tin i wondered if it was losing life with its master but there would be a spring for the land i doubted there would be for the old man unless i found me a poisoner i heard black petes footsteps fading as i stepped into the great hall the light was dimming there the place seemed more deserted and gloomy than ever i went to the fountain watched our hero work out on his dragon thought about what to do next explore the house hell i was cold already why not look at those outbuildings and be done with it i felt eyes on me as i moved already habituated i checked the nearest shadows the blonde wasnt there nobody was anywhere then i glanced up i caught a flicker on the third floor balcony east side somebody ducking out of sight who one of the majority i hadnt yet met why they wouldnt want to be seen was a puzzle id see everyone sooner or later i took myself out the back door immediately behind the house lay a formal garden sort of thing that id paid no heed before peters had wanted to get away where we could talk i gave it a look now there was a lot of fancy stonework statues fountains pools that had been drained because at that time of year water tends to freeze ice would break the pool walls there were hedges shaped trees beds for spring and summer plantings it could be impressive in season right then it just seemed abandoned and haunted by old sorrows i paused at the hedge bounding the north end of the garden looked back the vista seemed a ghost of another time at least one someone was watching me from a third floor window in the west wing keep that in mind garrett whatever you do wherever you go somebody is going to be watching twenty feet behind the hedge was a line of poplars they were there to mask the outbuildings so the practical side of life wouldnt offend the eyes of those who lived in the house the rich are that way they dont want to be reminded that their comfort requires sweaty drudge labor there were half a dozen outbuildings of various shapes and sizes stone was the main structural material though it wasnt stone that matched that in the big house the stable was obvious somebody was at work there i heard a hammer pounding there was a second structure for livestock presumably cattle maybe dairy cattle it was nearest me and had that smell the rest of the buildings including a greenhouse off to my right had the look of protracted neglect way to the left was a long low building that looked like a barracks it also looked like nobody had used it for years i decided to start with the greenhouse not much to see there except that someone had spent a fortune on glass and then hadnt bothered to keep the place up a few panes were broken the framework that had been white once needed paint desperately the door stood open a foot and sagged on its hinges i had trouble pushing it back enough to get inside no one had been in there for a long time the place had gone to weeds the only animal life i saw was a scroungy orange feral cat she headed for cover when she saw me the building next on the left was small solid and very much in use it turned out to be a wellhouse which explained why it looked like it handled a lot of traffic a place this size would consume a lot of water though id have thought theyd pipe it in from a reservoir the stable was the next building over i gave it a skip id talk to whoever was there after i finished snooping next over was a smaller building filled with a jungle of tools and farm implements with an air of long neglect there was another cat in there a lot of mice and from the smell a regiment of bats theres nothing like the stink of lots of bats next up was the barn and yes thats what it was bottom level for the animals dairy and beef top level for hay straw and feed nobody around but the cows and a few more cats i figured there must be owls too because i didnt smell bats the place needed maintenance the cows werent friendly unfriendly or even curious the day was getting on the gloom was getting thick i figured id better get on with it and save the detail work for later supper would be coming up soon the building id thought looked like a barracks was probably for seasonal help it was about eighty yards long had maybe fifteen doors the first i looked behind showed me a large dusty bunkroom the next opened on smaller quarters divided into three rooms a bigger one immediately inside and two half its size behind it the next several doors opened on identical arrangements i guessed these were apartments for workers with families trouble was there was a lot of waste space between doors space unaccounted for the far end of the barracks had a kitchen the size of the bunkroom its door was on the other side of the building glancing along that face i saw more doors which explained the missing space the apartments faced alternate directions i stepped into the kitchen a windowless cheerless place that would have been depressing at the best of times i left the door propped open for light there was little to see but dust and cobwebs and cooking utensils that hadnt been touched in years another place nobody had visited in a long time i was surprised the stuff was still lying around tunfaire and its environs have no shortage of thieves all this stuff had some market value a gold mine that hadnt been discovered the door slammed shut damned wind i muttered and edged my way through the darkness trying to remember what was lying in ambush between it and me i heard somebody secure the rusty hasp not the wind somebody who didnt want to be my friend not a good situation garrett this place was far from where anybody had any business the walls were thick stone i could do a lot of yelling and nobody would hear the door was the only way out and the only source of light i found the door ran my hands over it pushed gently snorted i stepped back a few feet and kicked hard the hasp ripped out of the dry ancient wood i charged through with a ready knife saw nobody i roared around the end of the barracks and still saw nobody damn i leaned against the building and gave it a think something was going on even if it wasnt what black pete thought once i settled down i went back to the kitchen door and looked for tracks there were signs that somebody had been around but the light was so poor i couldnt do anything with them so nothing to do about it now might as well go to dinner and see who was surprised to see me i was late i should have explored the house i didnt know where wed eat so i went to the kitchen i waited there till cook turned up she gave me a highpower glower what you doing in here waiting to find out where we eat fool she loaded up grab an armful and come on i did both she shoved through swinging doors into a big pantry marched through that and out another swinging door the dining room was a dining room the kind where a guy can entertain three hundred of his closest friends most of it was dark everybody was seated at one corner table the decor was standard for the house armor and edged steel there cook said i presumed she meant the empty place i settled my load on an unused part of the table sat wasnt much of a crowd dellwood and peters and the brunette id caught rifling my duffel bag plus three guys i hadnt met and cook who planted herself across from me the general couldnt make it apparently there werent any other places set the girl and guys i hadnt met looked me over the men looked like retired marines surprise surprise the girl looked good shed changed into her vamping clothes garrett you dog the thought fled this one gave off something sour she was radiating the comeandgetit and my reaction was to back off here was trouble on the hoof what was it morley said dont never fool around with a woman whos crazier than you are maybe i was growing up sure and tomorrow morning pigs would be swooping around like swallows i didnt plan to outgrow that for about another six hundred years peters said this is mike sexton he was with me in the islands about ten years back mike cook he indicated the trollbreed woman weve met miss jennifer the generals daughter weve also met i rose and reached across offering my hand didnt get the chance before you had both of yours in my duffel bag cook chuckled jennifer looked at me like she wondered if id taste better roasted or fried youve met dellwood next to him is cutter hawkes hawkes was too far off to shake i nodded he nodded he was a lean rail of a character with hard gray eyes and a lantern jaw middle fifties tough he looked more like a fireandbrimstone prophet than an old soldier like a guy with the sense of humor of a rock art chain the next guy nodded he had a monster black mustache going gray not much hair on top and was thirty pounds over his best weight his eyes were beads of obsidian another character who was allergic to laughter he didnt bother to nod he was so happy to see me he could just shit freidel kaid kaid was older than the general maybe into his seventies lean slow one glass eye and the other one that didnt work too good his stare was disconcerting because the glass eye didnt track but he didnt look like a man who had spent his whole life trying not to smile in fact he put one on for me when peters said his name he was the guy id seen stoking the fire in the generals quarters pleased to meet you mr sexton likewise mr kaid see i can be a gentleman rumors to the contrary are sour grapes and envy jennifer didnt give me a chance to start eating what are you doing here the general sent for me everybody was interested in me nice to be the center of attention sometimes i have to set the dead man on fire just to get him to listen why ask him if he wants you to know hell tell you her mouth pruned up her eyes shot sparks they were interesting eyes hungry eyes but eyes that had been brushed by a darkness i couldnt tell if they were green or not the light wasnt good enough an odd one maybe unique a one in a million beauty and not the least attractive what sort of work do you do mr sexton old kaid asked you could call me a diplomat a diplomat surprised sure i straighten things out i get people to change their minds kind of like the corps only on a small scale personal service peters shot me a warning look i said i enjoy good conversation as much as the next guy but im hungry and you folks got a jump on me how about you let me catch up they all looked at me oddly cook more so than the others she was wondering if maybe shed missed the mark with her earlier guess i stoked the fires some then asked wheres everybody else sarge peters frowned were all here except tyler and wayne they have the night off kaid said snake oh right snake bradon but he never comes in the house hell he may not be around anymore i havent seen him lately anybody seen snake heads shook cook said he come for supplies day before yesterday i didnt want to ask too many questions too soon so i let snake bradon slide id get black pete alone sometime and get a rundown on everybody i said that doesnt add up i heard there were eighteen in the house besides me everybody looked puzzled except cook chain said aint been that many people around here in years you got us guys cook tyler wayne and snake trying to keep this barn from falling apart i ate some i dont know what it was as good as lunch but less identifiable cook was fond of stuff she could do in a pot after a while the silence got to me i had a feeling it wasnt just for my benefit these people wouldnt talk much more without me there what about the blonde girl whos she that got them looking perplexed peters asked what blonde i looked at him for about ten seconds maybe he wasnt yanking my leg about twenty gorgeous as tall as jennifer even slimmer hair almost white that hangs to her waist blue eyes i think timid as a mouse dressed in white i caught her watching me several times today a recollection dellwood i saw her when you were there you told me she was jennifer dellwood made a face yes sir but i didnt see her i assumed it was miss jennifer i didnt wear white today jennifer said what kind of dress was it i tried my best which isnt bad the dead mans big accomplishment is that hes taught me to observe and recollect jennifer said i dont have anything like that trying to sound bored and failing they all exchanged glances i took it none of them knew who i was talking about i asked whos taking care of the general if youre all here hes sleeping sir dellwood said cook and i will wake him for supper after were finished nobody with him he doesnt want to be coddled sir you sure as hell ask a lot of question chain said a habit ive got im working on it there any beer around the place i could use some dessert dellwood explained the general doesnt approve of drink sir he doesnt permit it on the property no wonder they were such a cheerful bunch i looked at peters hard you didnt mention that if hed done his homework he would have known i liked my beer he smiled and winked the son of a bitch not a bad meal cook whatever it was you need a hand clearing away the others looked at me like i was crazy she said you ask for trouble you get it grab a load and follow me i did and by the time i got back for a second load the rats had scattered i was going to have to ask peters about the disparity between cooks head count and everyone elses after supper i wandered up to my quarters as i approached the door digging for the key dellwood had left in the primitive lock i noticed the door was a quarter inch ajar so i wasnt surprised not after jennifers bold peek into my duffel bag and the trick at the old workers barracks i paused go ahead like the cavalry or exercise a little caution caution didnt go with the image i wanted to project but it did contribute to an extended life and nobody was looking i dropped to my knees by the doorframe examined the lock there were a few fine scratches on the old brass plate surrounding the keyhole as i said a primitive piece of hardware pickable by anyone with patience i leaned forward to see what i could glim through the keyhole nothing it was dark in there id left a lamp burning trap if so a dumb one especially not getting the door all the way shut these old boys werent pros but i didnt see them making that basic a mistake and if not a trap but just a search i doubted theyd snuff the lamp that was a dead giveaway the word disinformation trotted through my mind from the spy game provide not just false information but more information than necessary most of it untrustworthy so that all information received came under the shadow of doubt i backed off leaned against a wall nodded to myself yeah that felt like a good intuition i was going to be allowed to find out all kinds of things most of which were untrue useless or misleading hard to put a puzzle together when youve got three times too many pieces which still left me faced with a decision what to do right now it was still possible there was some clumsy idiot hiding in the dark waiting to whack me so why not play the game right back the hall was a good twelve feet wide oversize like everything else in that house and cluttered up with the usual hardware not twenty feet from me was a suit of armor i got it and lugged it over in front of the door pushed it up close backed off snuffed the nearest hall lamps so whoever was inside wouldnt see anything but a silhouette then i got behind the tin suit gave the door a nudge walked the armor ahead a couple of feet stopped like i was startled nothing happened i backed out and got one of the hall lamps and took it inside nobody there but me and my decoy i checked the closets and bedroom and dressing room nobody there and nothing obviously disturbed if the place had been tossed it had been done by an expert so good hed noticed and replaced the little giveaways id rigged so what did we have here somebody had gone to the trouble of picking the lock just to snuff a lamp i closed the door patted the armors shoulder somebodys playing games old buddy i think ill let you stick around i lugged it over and shoved it into a cloak closet just big enough to contain it lighted my lamps took the hall lamp back lighted the lamps there went inside locked up sat down at the writing table to let my dinner digest didnt work too well i need a beer or two to get the most out of those occasions i had to do something about the shortage in fact it might be a good idea to vanish for a while and consult some experts there was ink and paper and what not in the drawer under the table i got it out and started making notes i put down the names of everyone id met and hadnt and a mystery woman to the side peters dellwood the general cook jennifer hawkes chain and kaid tyler and wayne who had the night off and somebody named snake bradon who was antisocial and wouldnt come in the house somebody named candy who theoretically didnt count because hed been fired long ago and harcourt who used to sneak his girlfriends in but who had left six months ago eighteen people here according to cook by my count eleven plus the mystery blonde we had us what the marines call a manpower shortfall someone tapped on the door yeah peters mike i let him in whats up i brought you a list of the missing stuff cant guarantee its complete not the kind of stuff you see everyday and notice is gone right away he handed me a wad of papers i sat down and looked it over this is a lot of stuff and all small each item had a guessed value noted stuff like gold medals old jewelry belonging to stantnor women long dead silver serviceware disdained by rough tough exmarines decorative weapons if you want i can go through the house room by room and get a better count trouble is its hard to tell whats gone because there isnt anybody who knows what all belongs dont seem worth the trouble unless you could find out about something that could be traced little on the list fit that description the thief had shown restraint even so hed gotten enough so the bottom line made my eyes bug twentytwo thousand marks based on my best guess at the intrinsic value of metal and gems i assume thered be a big knockdown at a fence there would be partly offset by artistic value a lot of this dont look like the junk that gets melted down maybe are we committed to finding the thief i was that being the commission id accepted from the general i was fishing for black petes feelings yes the old man may not have long i dont want him going off burdened by knowing somebody got away with betraying him right then what ill do is subcontract a search for the fence sometimes it helps to come back at a thief from the other end work me up a description of four or five outstanding items and ill have somebody try to find them youll have to pay for that yes you going to squeeze the generals coppers he smiled i shouldnt but im not used to not having to watch every one anything you need i need to know more about the people here i looked at my list counting three guys i havent met and not counting my ghost lady i come up with eleven names cook tells me eighteen wherere the the other seven i told you she has some loose threads shes been here since they built the first place literally and she never quite knows what year it is when we first came here from the cantard there were eighteen people counting her and jennifer more before the old man finished dismissing the old staff now eleven is right where did the others go sam and tark just up and died on us wollack got on the wrong end of a bull when we were breeding cows and got himself gored and trampled the others just drifted away they got fed up i guess hung around less and less then just didnt come back i leaned forward got a fresh sheet of paper divided five million by two and gave two and a half mil to jennifer then divided two and a half by sixteen and came up with a hundred fiftysix thousand marks and change not bad and i never knew anybody who would walk on a hundred fifty thousand gold or silver i did some more math nine into two and a half million came out two hundred seventyseven thousand and change damned near double your money was there something else going on here i didnt mention it it was something to keep in mind though you onto something peters asked i doubt it time for some footwork having a little trouble making sense of things there any way we can find out where those four men are now also im going to need to know more about the generals bequeathal arrangements he frowned why its a large estate you said he used his bequests as a hammer maybe he ran those guys off maybe one of them might be trying to get even either by doing the stealing or slipping him poison youve got me there he looked it two things then a copy of the will and find out if there was a clash between the general and any of those four you dont really think theyd be sneaking back i didnt no i thought they were dead with my confidence in human decency aroused i was sure somebody was playing a game of last one left and doing such a damned good job nobody else was suspicious but if somebody was then that somebody was innocent of trying to murder the old man that somebody would want to keep the general healthy while the field was narrowed that somebody might even bring in an outside specialist presuming he had a genuine cause for concern anyone have a spare key or master key for my room that caught him from the blind side dellwood why somebody picked the lock and got in between the time i left for supper and the time i came back here why would hey thats a petty one compared to why would somebody want to kill the general if that somebody exists he might be real nervous about me what did you all do when you split up after supper i was going to play logical puzzle eliminate me and cook because i didnt do it and she was with me take dellwood off the hook because he didnt need to pick locks peters because he knew about me already eliminate anybody who was with them the whole time dellwood would have gone to get the general up and ready for dinner i assume jennifer went with him she usually does she stays till cook brings his food and helps him eat if he cant manage himself i was in my quarters writing up the list from notes uhm i thought a minute i do have one problem with this sarge and thats a reason for being here i need to ask questions i need to find loose strings i can pull on kind of hard to do that when i dont have a good excuse cooks already told me im too nosy i suppose i had hopes but i didnt really think you could manage without giving yourself away how many people know about the missing trinkets as opposed to how many know you think somebodys trying to kill the general why not tell the truth say the old man hired me to find out whos stealing from him they might even find it amusing if they think hes imagining it and the wouldbe assassin should relax the others might open up after i convince them somebody is stealing from the old man right i suppose he didnt like it though figure out a way to let it get out so everybody knows but it seems like i dont know they know maybe joke about the general having another fantasy all right anything else no im going to turn in im going to roll out early and make a run into the city to put somebody on the track of the stolen goodies is that a hint it was i didnt think of it that way but i guess it is ill see you in the morning then he went out i locked the door behind him returned to the writing table seemed to me there might be three puzzles here who was stealing from the general who was trying to kill him and who was eliminating his heirs it seemed reasonable to suppose that each thing if any were fact would be going on independent of the others since the thefts were petty compared to murder and killing the general wouldnt be in the interest of whoever was trying to enlarge his share of the estate i could be up to my neck in villains i did hit the sack right away i doubt peters believed i would because he knew the hours i keep but i did need sleep and i had plans for the wee hours of the morning at home i usually control my internal clock go to sleep when i want wake up when i want give or take ten minutes i didnt leave the clock behind i woke right on time and was aware of a presence before i opened my eyes i dont know how some sound so soft i didnt catch it consciously some subtle scent maybe just a sixth sense whatever i knew somebody was there i was on my left side facing the wall opposite the door sunk so deep in eiderdown i couldnt move fast if you branded me i tried sneaky faking a slow rollover in my sleep i didnt fool anybody all i saw was the tail end of the blonde sliding out the bedroom door hey hang on i want to talk to you she bolted i climbed up out of that bed tangled myself in the covers fell on my face said colorful things thats garrett light on his feet a real gymnast has moves like a cat when i hit the sitting room she was gone and there wasnt a sign shed been there the door was locked i lighted a few lamps and surveyed the big room i hadnt heard the door i hadnt heard a key in the lock i didnt like that damned spooky old house was the kind that might come equipped with secret passages and hidden panels and all that stuff maybe with secret dungeons below the root cellar and bones buried behind false foundations i was going to have a nice time here i was i was all i needed to make it a real vacation were ghosts and monsters i went to the window the sky was clear a nail paring of moon was headed west come on youre not trying we need some rain and lightning or at least some fog on the moor and something howling in the night back for a circuit of the room i didnt find any secret entrances id deal with that later when there was time to measure walls and whatnot right now i had to prowl while at least some of the denizens of the place werent keeping track i dragged my tinsuit friend out of the closet into the bedroom i detached him from the support that held him upright put him in bed better than using pillows to make it look like somebody was home looked perfect once i pulled a sheet over his helmet rest easy buddy i didnt like the way things were going somebody here might be less than friendly i collected my favorite headknocker an oak nightstick with a pound of lead in the business end then slipped into the hall i was alone out there one lamp burned presumably dellwood had been around to snuff the others to save oil he was the only guy id seen working other than cook id have to find out what everybody did shouldve asked peters while i had him i went to the east end of the hall where a small window looked out on the grounds nothing out there but darkness and stars the werewolves and vampires were taking the night off i retreated to the first door on the left i seemed to be the only inhabitant of that floor in the wing so i didnt try for quiet i picked the lock and marched in lamp in front in my left hand headknocker in my right i neednt have bothered the room was a warehouse for cobwebs nobody had been in there in a decade i did a cursory inspection went to the room across the hall same story every suite on the floor was the same except the last which showed signs that someone had visited recently in that room i noted circles on the mantel where the dust was thinner like something had been removed candlesticks or small doodads i tried to get something from the marks left by the visitors feet theres always hope youll find something unique like maybe feet the size of pumpernickels or only two toes if they run barefoot it didnt pay off this time the intruder had shuffled probably not intentionally not the sort of thing your average thief thinks of the search was taking longer than id expected i decided to take a quick tour and leave detail work for later at least id know my way around there was a partial floor above mine reached via an enclosed stair i went up that floor was one vast dark room over the great hall it was stuffed with junk mostly as dusty as the rooms below but there was a path beaten from the stairhead across to a stair down to the fourth floor of the west wing a shortcut the alternative was to descend to the second floor and cut across on a narrow balcony above the back door placed there so somebody could address a crowd might as well go across work my way down the west wing come back on the ground floor and work my way up the west wing was inhabited i didnt enter any rooms maybe tomorrow night maybe while i was in town i could have a locksmith check my key to see if he could create a skeleton key for its type of lock fourthfloor hall and a stroll on the balcony there nothing likewise the third floor and its balcony the design differed from my wing the halls were shorter ending at the doors of the suites of the masters of the estate two doors on the third floor showed light underneath either somebody was up late or somebody was scared of the dark second floor had only five large suites probably for honored guests like dukes and counts firelords and stormwardens and others a ranking commander might entertain the ground floor boasted rooms meant for other purposes the west wing was where in times past the businesses of the estate and its masters had been conducted the doors to several rooms were open i invited myself in i didnt find anything from the west wing i walked across to the east where i knew id be into the kitchen pantries dining hall and whatnot id been through some of that but hadnt had a chance to pry as i passed the brave champion still stubbornly skewering his dragon i got that creepy sensation i looked around saw no one my blonde admirer i was beginning to think she was a spook not literally the place was creepy at high noon it had fallen from a ghost story but i didnt entertain the notion that it was haunted the world is filled with the strange the magical the supernatural but i didnt figure id need haunts to explain anything here any schemes here had been set in motion by the root of all evil amongst the living a closer examination of the dining room proved it to be what id figured big with decorations fitting the theme of the house i wondered how many battles the stantnors had fought the room had a high ceiling which suggested that part of the second floor east didnt exist true i found out when i explored the pantry a door there opened on stairs one set went up another down it was as dark as a vampires heart in there i went up the way led to storerooms filled with housekeeping goodies some of which looked like theyd been laid in before the turn of the century some dead stantnor had saved by buying wholesale nobody swept or dusted but the place was orderly it was inhabited by moths who found my lamp irresistible why so much room for storage i came on stacks of fourinchthick oak things bound in iron each with a number chalked onto the black iron curious i looked closer they were covers for the windows to seal them if the house was besieged they had to be as old as the house itself had they ever been used not in the past century i was sure i found a strong room in the southeast corner the door was latched but not locked it was an armory inside were weapons enough for a company as though there werent enough around the house already everything steel was covered with grease everything wood coated with paraffin might be interesting to find out what the climate was like when the house was built troubled times apparently i spent too much time there when i descended it was too late cook was banging around in the kitchen i slipped out before she tripped over me as i hit the fourth floor i caught a glimpse of white across the way my lovely mystery lady i blew her a kiss id had another visitor this one had left in a hurry hed left a key in the lock with the door standing open i saw why when i went into the bedroom my visitor had murdered the suit of armor hed walked in wound up with an antique battleax and had let the poor boy have it the ax was still there i laughed bet he drizzled down his leg thinking hed walked into a trap i sobered quickly that was twice next time more care might go into the attempt i was way out on a limb here i had to take steps i locked up pocketed the key which wasnt identical to mine so might be a skeleton key i got the tin man out of bed and the ax out of him sorry about that but well get our revenge i used the ax to rig a booby trap anybody who walked through the bedroom door was in for a rude welcome then i took an hour nap i was early for breakfast first to arrive cook was up to her ears in work getting platters ready need a hand i need ten i dont know what youre up to boy sucking up to me but you better believe ill use you get over to the oven and see how them rolls are coming i did maybe a minute more what you know about baking i explained the arrangement at my house where old dean handles the drudgery and cooking hes a good cook he taught me i can put together a decent meal when i want like when i give him time off because i want him out while i entertain dont know if youre lying or not probably are i never seen a man yet who could cook i didnt tell her dean thought the only good cooks were men i should get you together to watch the sparks fly huh times up get them rolls out drag that pot of butter over i glanced at the butter fresh snake just brung it in he going to join us she laughed not snake he dont have nothing to do with nobody just grabbed him some food and lit out not sociable snake whats his problem head got scrambled in the cantard he was down there twenty years never got a scratch on the outside she shook her head started piling sausages and bacon on a platter sad i knew him when he was a pup cute kid he was too delicate and sensitive for a marine but he thought he had to try so here he is an old man with his head in knots used to draw the prettiest pictures that boy coulda been a great painter had him a magic eye could see right inside things and drawed what he seed any damn fool can draw the outside of things the way they want we should see them takes a genius to see the truth that boy saw you going to stand there jawing till lunchtime or you going to eat i fixed myself a plate without mentioning the fact that i couldnt get a word in edgewise because i couldnt get a word in edgewise she rolled right along i told the general then he was just commissioned it was a raging shame to waste the boy down there and i told him again when he come back and the general he told me you were right cook it was a sin against humanity taking him but you know he couldnt have stopped the boy if hed wanted had that damnfool stubborn streak and thought it was his duty to go with the lord to war the rush came while she chattered there were two new faces presumably tyler and wayne they looked like they hadnt slept the whole crowd took their platters to the dining room i asked cook that tyler and wayne howd you guess lucky stab anybody else i havent met who else could there be i dont know yesterday you said there were eighteen people here ive seen ten plus this snake thats shy and a blonde that only i can see comes up short of eighteen aint eighteen you said eighteen boy im four hundred years old less i concentrate i dont remember where i am in time i just cook and set table and wash and dont pay no attention to nothing else just sort of drift dont see nothing dont say nothing last time i looked up they was eighteen counting me mustve been a while hell maybe thats why theres so many leftovers been cooking too much i didnt notice too many places set at the table she paused youre right part of me must keep track been with the stantnors a long time came to them with my momma when i was a kit long time back when the humans hereabouts still had emperors fore they ever moved out here and built the first house this ones only maybe two hundred was a sight when she was new she was you mustve seen some sights in your time seen some she agreed served every king and stormwarden and firelord right there in that dining room she headed that way that ended our conversation i stuck my head in nobody showed any special disappointment nobody turned handsprings either they were a depressing bunch these guys had spent their whole lives together youd think they could make conversation unless theyd said everything there was to say i feel that way with some people sometimes before anything gets said at all tyler and wayne were cut from marine lifer cloth whatever the physical differences between men they gain a certain uniformity in service tyler was a lean narrowfaced character with hard brown eyes saltandpepper hair and a thin speckled beard trimmed within a halfinch of his skin wayne was my size maybe twenty pounds heavier not fat he looked like he could throw cows around if the passion took him he was six inches taller than tyler and blond with icy blue eyes yet you felt the sameness in them you even felt the identity with chain who had gone to seed id spent five years in the company of men like them any one of them would be capable of murder if he took a mind human life wasnt anything special to them theyd seen too much death which did present one puzzle marines are straightforward kinds of guys if one wanted the general dead chances were hed just do it unless there was some overpowering motive to make it a lingering death like say hanging onto a share of the old mans estate worrying about it was pointless you cant force these things they have to unfold i helped cook clear away then put on my traveling shoes i hadnt been to morleys place in months it wasnt that wed had a falling out or anything i just hadnt had a need nor any urge to graze on the cattle food that comes out of his kitchen i arrived about nine hes closed to business then hes open from eleven to six in the morning catering to every sentient species there is all so warped they try to subsist on vegetables it takes all kinds some of my best friends eat there ive done so myself without enthusiasm so nine oclock the place was locked up i went to the backdoor and gave the secret knock which means i hammered and howled till morleys man wedge brought a fourfoot piece of lead pipe and offered to move my face to my belly button region thiss business wedge i didnt figure you was in heat for some bean curd you dont come around unless you want something i pay for what i get he snorted he didnt think it was right me using morley just because morley had taken advantage of me at deadly risk and without my consent to get out of some heavy gambling debts cash money wedge and he dont have to get off his butt he just needs to have somebody do some legwork that didnt cheer him up hes one of the guys who does morleys legwork but he didnt slam the door come he eased me in and barred the door led me through kitchens where cooks were butchering cabbages and broccoli parked me at the serving bar drew me a mug of apple juice wait he went upstairs the public room was naked and forlorn almost painfully quiet the way it ought to be all the time instead of overcrowded morley dotes is a headhunter a kneebreaker and a lifetaker most of the guys who work for him help morley is a deadly symbiote feeding on societys dark underside hes the best at what he does barring maybe a couple of guys who work for chodo contague adding up the account morley dotes is everything i dont like hes the kind of guy i wanted to take down when i decided to put on my goodguy hat but i like him sometimes you cant help yourself wedge came down shaking his head whats up i asked hes taking this health stuff too far youre telling me hes like a born again trying to save everybody else the worlds only vegetarian lifetaker wants to save the world from the perils of red meat before he cuts its throat i dont know maybe theres no conflict but it sounds like one to me hes added to the list been a few months right last time i was here hed sworn off gambling and was making it stick he tried women but couldnt hold out he forgot that crock say that for him the thing now is early to bed early to rise hes up now up and dressed and fed and doing his morning workout a year ago you wouldnt have caught him dead out of bed this time of day you could have if there was enough money in it wonders never cease do they he said come up you want a refill why not fruit juice is the only thing here i can handle he winked he wasnt one of morleys converts he topped off my mug i took it up to morleys office which is the barbican to his personal quarters im about as close to a friend as he has but ive never been past the office my hair is too short and i dont wear enough makeup dotes was doing situps chunking them out like a machine my stomach hurt just watching youre in pretty good shape for a guy your age i told him i wasnt sure what that was it could be substantial hes part darkelf elves can last a long time i take it youre working again he said it while popping up and down like there was no strain to what he was doing i told myself i had to start doing a few exercises at my age when you lose it its hard to get back why do you assume you dont come down here unless you want something not true i used to bring maya in all the time that was before she and i had gone our own ways you lost a gem there garrett he rolled over started doing pushups his darkelf blood doesnt scream out he looks like a short slim darkhaired man in good shape hes quick on his feet theres an air of the dangerous about him but not one of menace maybe thats why women find him irresistible maybe i do miss her some she was a good kid pretty too so you going on with tinnie my friend tinnie tate professional hightempered redhead ours is an unpredictable relationship i see her when she doesnt think i deserve to be punished by not seeing her only smart thing youve done since ive known you is not tell her about maya he completed fifty fast ones jumped up he wasnt sweating i felt like kicking his behind whats up you heard of general stantnor used to be marine commandant the same what about him a guy who works for him my old company sergeant called in a debt he got me to do a job for the old boy dont you ever work just to be working i never saw anyone like you i know im a dog you never see a dog do anything when hes not hungry if im not hungry why work what about the general i do work when im not hungry and ive got plenty of that here the old boy is trying to die my old sergeant thinks somebody is trying to kill him slowly so it looks like a wasting disease is somebody i dont know hes been doing it a long time you know a way to do that whats his color like his color sure there are poisons you could use in cumulative dosages the color is the giveaway hes kind of a sickly yellow his hair is falling out in clumps and his skin has a translucent quality morley frowned not blue or gray yellow like pale butterscotch he shook his head cant tell you based on that he has seizures too crazies like heart tremors or something doesnt sound familiar maybe if i saw him id like that i dont know if i can arrange it theyre all paranoid about strangers i gave him a rundown on the players sounds like a bughouse could be all of them except jennifer and cook spent at least thirty years in the marines mostly in the cantard he grinned im not going to say it good for you we all make the world a little holier when we resist temptation one more thing the old man thinks he hired me to find out whos stealing the silver and his old war trophies i produced the list morley started reading ill pay legwork fees for somebody to make the rounds and see if any of that is moving through the usual channels saucerhead needs work saucerhead tharpe is a friend of sorts in a line somewhere between morleys and mine he has more scruples than dotes and more ambition than me but hes as big as a house and looks half as smart people cant take him serious he never gets the best jobs all right ill pay his standard rate bonus if he recovers any of the articles bonus if he gets a description of the thief on the cuff that was a hint i gave him advance money he said i thank you and saucerhead thanks you i know youre doing an old buddy a favor but it seems damned tame especially if the old guy is just dying theres something going on somebody tried to off me i told him he laughed i wish i could have seen the guys face when he swung that ax and you bonged like a bell youve still got the luck maybe why are they after you i dont know money thats the one angle that makes this interesting the old boy is worth about five million marks his son is dead his wife died twenty years ago his daughter jennifer gets half the estate and the other half goes to his marine cronies three years ago he had seventeen heirs since then two died supposedly natural deaths one got killed by a mad bull and four disappeared a little basic math shows that nearly doubles the take for the survivors morley sat down behind his desk put his feet up cleaned his pearly white teeth with a sixinch steel toothpick i didnt interrupt his thoughts theres potential for foul play in that setup garrett human nature being what it is if i was a betting man id give odds that somebody is fattening his share human nature being what it is nobody walks out on that kind of money not you not me not a saint so maybe you have something interesting after all maybe thing is i dont see any way to tie it up in a package if i find out whos stealing which makes no sense considering the payoff down the road im not likely to find out whos killing the old man that doesnt make sense for whoever is cutting down the number of heirs hed want the old man to hang on what happens if the daughter checks out before he does damn a critical point and it hadnt occurred to me if everything went to the boys shed really be on the spot the odd thing is none of them act like they know whats going on they seem to get along they dont watch each other over their shoulders i did and i was only there one night a marvelous aspect of your species is that most of you see only what you want whats that mean maybe those guys are old buddies and only one of them realizes that throatcutting can be profitable maybe nobody is suspicious because they all know their old buddies wouldnt do something like that after all theyve been through together could be id kind of had that problem myself i couldnt picture me turning on anybody id been running with that long and the whole thing could be what they say it is three dead by explainable cause and four who couldnt handle the lifestyle and walked because money didnt mean anything and the moon could be mouse bait you have a dark outlook supported every day in the street the other night a thirtysixyearold man knifed his mom and dad because they wouldnt give him money for a bottle of wine thats the real world garrett were our own worst nightmares he chuckled youre lucky this time you dont have anything weird no vampires no werewolves no witches no sorcerers no dead gods trying to come back to life none of the stuff you usually stumble into i snorted those things arent on every street corner but theyre part of the world everybody brushes against them eventually they didnt impress me though i was happy not to deal with them i said i could have seen a ghost a what a ghost i keep seeing a woman that nobody admits is there that nobody else sees unless theyre pulling my leg which they probably are or youre crazy shes a gorgeous blonde right a blonde not bad youre daydreaming out loud in your eyes your wishful thinking has gotten to you maybe ill know before im done there was something else i wanted but it escapes me now must not have been important probably not id better get back out there you take some equipment hate to think of you up to your ears in killers with nothing but your teeth and toenails ive got a trick or two he grunted you always do dont turn your back on anybody i wont as i started to close the door he asked whats the daughter look like early twenties a looker but not a talker spoiled rotten probably he looked thoughtful then shrugged got up dropped down and started doing more pushups i shut the door i cant stand seeing a man abuse himself i headed south feeling smug i knew my morley dotes curiosity would get him hed push his end beyond what id hired him to do hed go fishing amongst his contacts if there was something going on involving the stantnors hed find out the smugness disappeared after i walked out south gate thats when the drizzle started thats when i started cussing myself for my distrust of horses hell if i couldnt ride i could hire a coach i had a client i could charge it to expenses expenses are wonderfully flexible especially if the client fails the attitude test i got some wet before i reached my destination odd most of those big country places have names the maples windward sometimes something that doesnt make any sense like brittany stone but this one could have been a squatters hut the stantnor place ancient family seat and museum but not enough of a home for anybody to give it a name i was still a quarter mile off when jennifer stantnor flew out the front door headed toward me she hadnt put a wrap on peters came after her gaining but not looking like he was trying to catch her they reached me at the same time jennifer looked irked that peters had come peters looked exasperated at her i did my best to look puzzled which isnt hard thats where i am most of the time i raised an eyebrow way up its one of my best tricks jennifer just stood there panting peters less winded despite being almost three times her age said theres been a hunting accident i kept a straight face oh lets get in out of the rain i looked at the girl i think she wanted to talk grimly she said i dont think it was an accident it probably wasnt if someone had gotten killed but i didnt say that i just grunted peters talked while we walked weve had trouble with poachers there are deer on the grounds a fair herd jennifer interjected we put out feed we dont take many three all last year peters said peasants the animals make easy targets theyre not so wary here the past month weve had six intrusions that we know of jennifer said dad gets more upset about the trespassing than the poaching he has a thing about boundaries like theyre lines of steel after the last incident peters said as we climbed the steps to the house the general ordered regular patrols he wanted someone caught and an example made today kaid hawkes tyler and snake had the duty hawkes apparently caught somebody in the act he sounded his hunting horn jennifer said when the others got there he was on the ground with an arrow in him a gutted deer was hanging in a tree fifty feet away interesting and sad but why tell me sounds like something you people can handle jennifer looked puzzled peters said this is going to sound silly youre the only scout around here all these lifers and none of them can follow a trail oh maybe its been years and i wasnt that good i recalled my stumbling around during a few recent cases mediocre is better than what the rest of us are peters looked at chain who was headed our way how is he i dont think hell make it he needs a surgeon you know the old man no doctors in the house we cant move him without killing him jennifer snapped get a doctor my father doesnt have to know he never comes out of his room dellwood will tell him ill handle dellwood go peters told chain and chain got his carcass moving i said i take it hawkes is still alive hes fighting can i talk to him hes out way out not much chance hell come around unless chain gets a cutter in time show me where it happened before the rain wipes out the sign i got to ride lucky me the horse was hospitable all the way out but i knew it had heard of me through the grapevine those monsters have it grinned when it heard my name it was waiting for a chance it was a good ride out the stantnors had a lot of land we didnt talk much i took in the countryside getting the lay the landmarks i might need to know them id developed the habit young it was my apparent knack for knowing my way around that got me volunteered as a scout when the real sexton vanished looks like snake came back out peters said as we crossed a rise and came to the scene i saw a man under an oak near a hanging animal carcass sarge i never knew any of these guys when i was in did any of them know sexton he looked at me funny i dont think so i dismounted tied the reins to an oak sapling my mount got a forlorn look thought id just drop them and youd scurry when i turned my back didnt you what peters asked talking to the horse i talk to horses they make more sense than people snake this is mike sexton scouted for me in the islands you probably heard hes here snake grunted he looked me over i returned the favor if chain had gone to seed this one had gone a step beyond his hair hadnt been cut since hed gotten out his beard was a bramble patch he didnt change clothes or bathe very often his pants were covered with curious colored stains he said i heard you found anything snake grunted it sounded negative i looked at the carcass wasnt much to it kind of puny isnt it fawn snake said just lost its spots yes a little rusty garrett why would a poacher take a fawn if he was after the meat and the herd wasnt spooky hed go for a bigger kill i gave the carcass a closer look it was ten years since id done my own butchering but this job looked amateurish like it had been done by someone whod seen animals butchered but who hadnt ever done it himself this patrol this morning was there a set plan specific assignments peters said we had a routine if thats what you mean routes wed figured so four men could cover everything not exactly what i wanted to know i couldnt be more specific without giving away more than i wanted where was hawke when he was hit up here i followed peters the spot was obvious once you got there hawkes had thrashed around after hed fallen hed lost enough blood to draw flies too stupid to go for the bonanza in the tree the spot was fifty feet from the deer a blind archer could have made the shot i picked out what i thought was hawkes back trail i followed it found a place where hed stopped id guess this is where he sounded the horn then he went down and stopped again there and the poacher let him have it somebody did what time did it happen about nine uhm that fawn had been dead a lot longer than that i walked back down snake still stood staring at the carcass i asked you look around some he grunted whyd anybody want to do that to a little fawn an old buddy getting an arrow through the brisket didnt bother him the fawn did i took another look at the carcass i couldnt find its death wound was there an arrow in it no snake wasnt going to be much good for anything the tree where the fawn hung was a loner ten yards from the edge of a wood that followed a creek that wood was only a hundred yards across i headed downhill swinging back and forth looking for the poachers trail i found it somebody in a big hurry had charged straight through the underbrush understandable if youve just plinked some guy and you know he has friends coming peters followed me i asked was there a set pattern to who rode where on these patrols no way to keep him from wondering why i asked he frowned no we mixed it up so we wouldnt see the same ground every time then the sniper hadnt been after somebody in particular just somebody assuming the arrow hadnt come from the bow of a panicky poacher but someone who had laid a trap i was sure that when hawkes stopped the second time hed seen whoever let him have it that hed been startled into halting otherwise hed have kept moving how much of that was peters figuring out the man wasnt stupid how do you get along with your neighbors we ignore them they ignore us most of them are scared of us id be scared if i had neighbors like them the sniper had become less panicky after fifty yards of flight hed turned onto an old game trail there were too many leaves down for the ground to take good tracks but i could tell which way he had gone by the way they were disturbed got any dogs or know where we could get some to track with no the game trail went down to the creek split one fork crossed over the other ran along the bank my quarry had taken the latter a hundred fifty yards along that path dipped into a wide shallow sandybottomed section of creek and didnt come out the other side i looked around ive lost it god damn it look again i looked satisfied that he hadnt noticed the horse apples in the shallow water whoever had come down here had ridden away down the streambed no big deal since the water was never more than a foot deep how many peasants forced to poach deer could afford to keep a horse sorry theres nothing then ill find some damned dogs as we walked back uphill i asked who takes care of the stables here mostly snake with help from hawkes and tyler i dont get snake takes care of the animals likes to but you cant get him on a horse to save his life that made sense to me though it was a little extreme i asked questions that got me curious looks but no answers unless they were liars and fast to boot or in cahoots none of the men on patrol could have dropped hawkes and hawkes didnt do it to himself that narrowed the field of suspects but not enough i wanted rid of snake and peters so i could prowl down that creek to wherever the sniper had left it shit black pete exploded weve got our heads up our asses what what did we do every time we hit the venageti on the damned island what did i pound into you guys every damned day we were there hed gotten it yeah you dont leave tracks on water before a raid wed always made sure we had an escape route crossed by a lot of water the bastard walked down the creek thats why you couldnt find anything yeah lets go ill check it out no need you taking any more time off he looked at me hard checked to see where snake was whatre you thinking garrett ive seen you like this before i havent forgotten the stuff you pulled im doing my job the best way i know nothing personal but everybodys a suspect till i prove otherwise no matter how well i think i know them he started getting angry can it you wanted me to find out whos killing the old man right which one of you guys would do that none of you right but one of you is till i nail it down you get treated like everybody else if only because im supposedly looking for a thief get me you want to play a lone hand youre the professional ill put up with it for a while good you dont have a choice anyway and thats nothing to get mad about he got mad anyway they always do they all think they ought to be the exception to the rule he rode off in a huff i didnt care so long as he rode off my horse looked forlorn i got it and led it down along the edge of the wood looking for tracks if i didnt find anything before i reached the property line id work my way back up the far side of the woods our villain had cunning in limited amounts the stunt would have been sufficient if thered been no cause for suspicion but there was i found where a horseman had come out of the wood barely far enough away to be out of sight of the place where hawkes had gotten it the spacing of hoofmarks said hed been in no real hurry once hed gotten away from the woods meaning he hadnt been worried about explaining his presence that put tyler and chain back on the suspect list they wouldnt have been questioned because they belonged out here id have to question the survivors find out who said and did what before they set out might be some subtle indicator there whoever the killer was hed been bold hed ridden around behind the rise you crossed to reach the ambush then had headed home at least i presumed that was what hed done while the poacherhunters were fussing over hawkes i lost the trail i circled and circled quartered this way and that and couldnt find it againthe drizzle and the chill breeze overcame my devotion to my craft i headed for the house i was stomping through that museum of a central hall headed for a change of clothes when jennifer fluttered out of nowhere she looked more feminine and frail and vulnerable than she had she was flustered and frightened i waited though i had no urge to see her sergeant hawkes died she blurted right there in front of me he just shook all over and made this funny sound and he wasnt alive anymore when just a few minutes ago i was looking for dellwood when i saw you i need somebody to tell me what to do if she was looking for comfort shed come to the wrong man i didnt feel like comforting anybody not even a gorgeous brunette who had all the right stuff in all the right places put together to make a dead bishop howl my late night and early morning had me feeling like i was carrying an extra fifty pounds worse id missed lunch id already determined that cook was immune to my golden tongue she didnt even know what was happening it went right past her dellwood would be the best man to tell you and speak of the devil here he came moving without the usual sedate deliberation miss jennifer you were supposed to stay with hawkes he doesnt need me anymore dellwoods eyes got big he he yes what do we do now i said dellwood i need to see the general at his earliest convenience ill be in my quarters i was going to take a nap i expected id have another long night id better rest while i could i glanced back at jennifer and dellwood maybe they were good actors maybe they were genuinely frazzled and upset whatever they had exaggerated just that little bit that told me they wanted me to see them in a favorable light i didnt care if they cried or danced with joy as far as i was concerned there was only one good guy in the house and his name was garrett i woke up in time for dinner i didnt feel rested the floor of my dressing room wasnt that comfy but it was safer than the bed that tin mans wounds proved that i decided id set up camp in one of the vacant suites make them hunt for me to murder me in my sleep had hawkes died because of me id fallen asleep wondering had my presence nudged somebody into pushing his murder schedule things like that that i cant control nag me i walked to the end of the hall surveyed the central chamber jennifer was seated by the fountain leaning against one of the dragons wings chain and kaid walked past without acknowledging her they were headed for dinner as i started moving i spotted the blonde on the third floor balcony opposite in shadow looking down there goes a theory shot to hell she glanced up i waved black pete stepped out of the hall across the way he caught my wave frowned returned it i pointed down he leaned over the rail too late shed caught my gesture and drifted into deeper shadow i descended the stairs beginning to consider if only halfseriously the notion of a resident haunt id thought the blonde was jennifer in a wig making quick clothing changes their builds were similar their faces much alike my romantic streak made the blonde prettier barely id never seen them both at once all id needed was some screwy motive on jennifers part to tie the knot sometimes you guess right and sometimes you dont i dont a lot more than i do when i hit the ground floor id convinced myself i shouldve known better the blonde really was prettier moreover she had a lonely ethereal quality jennifer couldnt mimic not that i knew much about jennifer id been on the job a day and hadnt gotten close to anybody but cook and her not close enough chances were i wasnt going to get close to anybody these werent the kind of people who would let you the case looked stranger by the minute at least it was more lowkey than the bloody whirlwinds that had swept me up lately peters met me at the foot of the stair you wanted something the wave i wasnt waving at you the blonde was on the balcony under you she ducked out when i pointed he looked at me like he wondered if hed brought in the wrong man i figured id better distract him i have a question for you completely hypothetical if you were to kill somebody here and wanted to get rid of the body where would be the best place on the property his look got stranger garrett youre getting weird or maybe you got weird since you left the marines what do you want to know something like that for just tell me asking questions is what i do they dont have to make sense to you hell they dont always make sense to me but theyre the tools i use can you give me a hint if i was going to bury somebody a little light went on inside he thought i was looking for a place somebody might cache the generals goodies it would depend on the circumstances how much time i had how good a job i wanted to do hell if i had time id put the body ten feet down where nobody would have any reason to dig if i was in a big hurry i wouldnt do it here at all id take it up the road to the marsh tie it to a couple of rocks and throw it in what marsh on down the road the other side of the rise out front look out the front door past the cemetery you can see the tops of the trees its about a hundredacre swamp theres been talk about draining it because of the smell old melchior who owns the land wont hear of it take a look sometime itll bring back memories i will lets feed our faces before cook forgets us she was delivering the final load when peters and i arrived she looked at me like id betrayed her by not showing up to help some people whatever you do they expect you to do it forever it was a meal like last nights no conversation except grumbles about how they might find the poacher and what they could do with him afterward nobody seemed suspicious of the circumstances could that be somebody was picking them off and they didnt realize it maybe it was their background all those years in the war zone when my company went in there were two hundred of us officers sergeants and men who had trained together and been hammered into a single unit two years later there were eighteen originals left guys went down after a while you accepted that after a while you accepted the fact that your turn was coming you went on and stayed alive as long as you could you become completely fatalistic i asked who took care of the stables today they all looked at me like theyd just noticed me peters said nobody snake was on patrol he wanted to ask why i wanted to know so did the others but they just looked at me my glance crossed jennifers she was thawing she smiled faintly with promise dellwood said i spoke to the general hell see you after we eat good thanks i was wondering if youd remembered all those eyes turned on me again they wondered what business i had with the old man i wondered what their theories were about my presence it was obvious peters hadnt spread the word i asked what do you guys do for entertainment this place is pretty bleak id forgotten to smuggle in some beer maybe tomorrow chain growled got no time for entertainment too much work to do and the general wont hire anybody on which reminds me troops we got to cover for hawkes which means we have to let something else go to hell wayne said the whole place is falling apart even with us hopping like the onelegged whore the day the fleet pulled in dellwood you got to try to get through to him ill try dellwood didnt sound optimistic they went on now the ball was rolling i learned more than i wanted to know about how and where the place was falling apart what had been allowed to slide too long and what had to be done right now to stave off disaster tyler said i say we worry about that damned poacher in our spare time and say the hell with trying to catch the others the general dont come out no more hows he going to know were not wasting time looking for them they want a few deer i say let them have them we need to keep this place from falling apart that debate raged a while jennifer contributed not a word she seemed more interested in me my fatal charm my curse or maybe she just wondered how id gotten those old boys so animated i helped cook clear away dellwood helped me help he didnt seem inclined to let me out of his sight cook was as tightlipped as she claimed with a third party present dellwood wanted to talk he started as soon as we left the kitchen i hope you have some progress to report it would be a good time to give the general an emotional lift how come he had a good day today hes been alert his mind has had a keen edge he managed to eat his lunch without help your presence seems to have motivated him it would be nice if you could give him something to keep him feeling positive i dont know what i had to tell the general wasnt positive ill try not to bring him down we were watched going up this time i wasnt wrong about it being jennifer a strange woman pity she was gorgeous i didnt get it when was the last time a woman like that left me cold i couldnt recall female is my favorite sport wasnt anything obviously wrong with her either maybe it was bad chemistry the opposite of lust at first sight who raised jennifer cook mostly and the staff oh what became of them the general released them to make room for us we shouldve been able to manage the place putting the cropland out for rent hasnt worked out though he kept cook why her shes a fixture been here forever raised him too and his father before him and his father too he has his sentimental streak thats nice he hadnt been sentimental when hed been my supreme commander of course i hadnt gotten to know him he takes care of his own dellwood opened the generals door seated me in the room where id met the old man before old kaid was stoking the fire wait here ill have him out in a few minutes the temperature was obscene sure thanks it was more than a few minutes but the old man was worth seeing when he came out he had a smile on his cheeks had gained some color he waited till dellwood and kaid departed good evening mr garrett i take it youve made progress progress general but i dont have any good news had his health improved because the poisoner had backed off with me around good news bad news better get on with it i went into the city this morning i put some acquaintances to work tracing the missing items through those people who deal in articles that stray from home theyre competent if the thief disposed of anything through those channels theyll find out and get a description of the seller i do need instructions should they recover the articles if theyve been sold you could be at the mercy of the new owners very good sir very good yes by all means i want to recover whatever i can i expect youll have problems getting them back from someone whos taken a fancy to them he smiled you seem in good spirits sir i am i am indeed i havent felt this well in months maybe years not your doing but it did start after your arrival youre good luck if i keep improving at this rate ill be dancing within the month i hope so sir sir that brings me to the bad news but first a confession i didnt come out here just to unmask a thief ah there was a sparkle in his eye yes sir sergeant peters believes someone is poisoning you slowly he wanted me to find out who if its being done at all and youve found something he seemed troubled now no sir nothing like that that pleased him on the other hand theres no negative evidence and one has to wonder about your recovery it pleases me but im suspicious by nature and this is your bad news no sir thats nastier more pervasive if you will go on im not one to slay the bearer of ill tidings or to ignore them because they arent what i want to hear let me preface this by saying id like to read your will he frowned peters asked for a copy was that your doing yes go on im afraid it may be written so as to encourage villainy i was starting to sound pompous but it was hard to be one of the boys with general stantnor if the number of heirs decreases does the take for the survivors increase he gave me the fisheye i gather half goes to jennifer and the rest to everyone else sixteen people originally after this morning only eight meaning the take for survivors has doubled he looked at me hard i thought he might throw me out earlier protests to the contrary support your suspicions mr garrett i dont think the four men who left you could have one maybe two at the most but people arent built to walk away from so much money four i can see that maybe what else whoever put the arrow into hawkes set it up ahead of time the deer was too long dead to be a fresh kill the sniper rode away on a horse would a peasant who has to poach have a horse and the horseman headed this way after the ambuscade though thats circumstantial i lost the trail part way here he was quiet for a long time his color deserted him i pitied him then on a more personal level two attempts have been made on my life since ive been here i dont know by who he looked at me but didnt say anything unearthing that wasnt part of my brief but i thought you should know what i think is happening should i pursue it yes he paused it doesnt add up theft thats almost petty someone possibly trying to poison me someone trying to kill everyone else thats true i cant make it add up i dont want to believe you mr garrett i know those men better than that two attempts on your life i told him about them he nodded i dont suppose you no i believe you get dellwood i rose a question first general go ahead could an outsider be responsible do you have enemies vicious enough to try to set your house against itself i have enemies a man my age whos been what ive been of course i have enemies but i dont think any of them would try for the pain in something like this thered still have to be an inside man wouldnt there i nodded opened the door dellwood was in the hall a decorous distance away the boss wants you ill say this for that old man he took the bull by the horns i didnt think he was doing the smart thing but it was his house his life his sanity and his choice to take the risk he had dellwood bring everybody in and get them seated he had me stand beside him facing them they looked at him and me and wondered while peters and chain looked for snake kaid tossed logs on the bonfire i sweated nobody said a word then jennifer tried she barely got her mouth open the general said wait one word softly that stung like a whips bite snake ambled in with chain and peters hed tried to clean himself up he hadnt done a great job but passed inspection well enough to be given a seat stantnor said close the door peters lock it thank you hand me the key please peters did so the others watched with varying expressions mostly in the frown range thank you for coming as if theyd had any choice we have a problem he reached out i put his will in his hand hed let me read it while we waited it was an invitation to mayhem incredibly naive my will you know the details ive hit you over the head with them often enough they seem to have created the problem therefore a candle sat on the table before him he shoved the end of the will into the flame held it till it caught laid it on the table and let it burn i watched them watch it they were shocked they may have been disappointed or outraged but they didnt move didnt protest didnt fall down and confess that instrument has been a murder weapon sure as any blade but i wont make a speech theres the fact motive has been eliminated the will has been abrogated ill write a new one in a few days he looked them in the eye one by one nobody shied away everybody looked baffled and dismayed dellwood said sir i dont understand i certainly hope you dont those of you who dont be patient it will become clear first though i want to introduce the man next to me his name is garrett mr garrett is an investigative specialist amongst other talents i employed mr garret to find out whos been stealing from me his efforts have been quite to my satisfaction so far the old boy was a chess player mr garrett found evidence of more heinous crimes hes convinced me that some of you have been killing your comrades to gain a larger share of my legacy sir dellwood protested the others stirred looked at each other mr garrett was a scout during his service dellwood he tracked todays poacher back to our stable he wasnt maundering or speaking imprecisely he wanted them to think id done just that not lost the trail in the fields he wanted somebody to feel pressed mr garrett has an excellent reputation for handling these things ive asked him to find the killer hes agreed i have every confidence in his ability i tell you all this by way of letting you know where you stand if youre innocent i want you to cooperate with him the sooner its wrapped up the better if youre guilty maybe you ought to put on your running shoes be advised that i shall hunt you as implacably as the hounds of hell youve betrayed my trust you have done me a hurt i cant forgive im going to have your head and heart when i find you i didnt look at him though it was hard not to the old devil had gone farther than id expected by burning the will hed eliminated the threat to the innocent nobody stood to gain now if he died intestate the estate could go to the crown which meant everyone lost even the poisoner ought to want to keep him alive till he wrote a new will a clever man general stantnor but hed left me swinging in the breeze you understand your positions he said mr garrett ask what questions you like chain said sir no sergeant chain mr garrett will ask youre not to speak unless spoken to well stay here till mr garrett is satisfied i said mr garrett doesnt think he can stay awake that long im not the kind of guy who can pull all the suspects together and expose a villain by weaving a web of clever questions my style is bull in the china shop its jump in the pond and thrash till the frogs start jumping i wished i had the dead man handy one of his more useful talents is an ability to read minds he could settle this in minutes i still entertained the possibility of an outside force with motives unfathomable the arguments against these people being involved had to be answered before i could discard that possibility they looked at me waiting the general turned his gaze on me as though to say show us the old garrett razzledazzle boy anybody want to confess save us time and let us get to bed nobody volunteered surprise surprise i was afraid youd be that way chain cracked i swiped a piece of rock candy from my sister when i was nine theres a start a criminal mastermind in the budding i dont think we need to go back quite that far though lets confine ourselves to this morning what did you do today sergeant chain account for your time and movements tell us who you saw doing what and who saw you doing what you were doing this would get tedious before we finished nine stories but it might do the job each story would add a color to the portrait of the morning every tale told true would leave our villain less room to hide chain got pissed but before he could do more than grumble stantnor said i demand cooperation chain do exactly as mr garrett says answer his questions without reservation or get off the estate followed by the knowledge that youve made yourself the prime suspect chain swallowed his protests he didnt look at me like a guy who wanted to become my drinking buddy i said try to attach times to the major events of your day i dont pay no attention to what time it is im too busy doing what i got to do i mean i do as much as i can aint possible to get done everything that needs doing thanks to our killer who keeps taking away pairs of hands estimates will do once weve heard from everybody it should be pretty clear who did what where and when go ahead just ramble along take all the time you need you cant go into too much detail clever clever garrett sets himself up for an excruciating night it took chain fortyfive minutes to tell me he hadnt done anything interesting and that between breakfast and lunch hed seen only five other members of the household excepting dellwood and peters those had been on the patrol anybody disagree i asked anybody want to call him a liar nobody volunteered all right snake youre uncomfortable here how about we get you off the hook go ahead snakes story wasnt any more interesting than chains hed seen nobody in anything but innocent circumstances dellwood before theyd ridden out the other hunters during the hunt peters when hed come out with me then hed gone back to his stables to get away i dont like people that much anymore he confessed i aint comfortable around them can i go now general the old man had begun to doze apparently but he was alert enough you arent concerned about what somebody might say if youre not here no sir i aint got nothing to hide and im getting awful uncomfortable he looked like he was about to suffer a panic attack the general looked at me i shrugged stantnor handed me the key up to you i unlocked the door held it for snake good night as he passed me he whispered you come out when youre done maybe i can guess who done hawkes it didnt seem a good time to get hardassed i just added him to a lengthening list of things to do while everybody slept i closed the door turned glanced around wondered if anyone had overheard their faces revealed nothing but it had been a loud whisper i took wayne next he was a bust cook wouldve talked all night and next day if i hadnt gotten her to edit some shed seen everybody and theyd seen her four down three hours gone five to go a pattern had begun to develop a trivial one but a pattern dellwood had been seen too often to have had time for a ride in the country i hadnt thought him much likelier than cook anyway i had peters go next he resented having to be a suspect but he did what he had to do the general seemed to be dozing again but that meant nothing peters didnt tell me anything i didnt already know hed barely finished when jennifer came to life mr garrett if that isnt a false name too how about me next thiss really wearing me down welcome to the club go ahead she hadnt done a damned thing all morning shed sat in her room knitting dellwood could attest to that hed found her there when hed brought the news about hawkes fine can i go im tired and i have a splitting headache i could empathize i was developing one myself it was part of an oncoming cold that seemed to be a legacy of the weather not yet bear with me ill try to hurry it along anyone want to go next no volunteers i picked tyler he didnt bother to conceal his resentment as he described the events of his morning they were dull they dovetailed they didnt point a finger he added another dellwood sighting to the list kaid i said how about you another dull tale mostly to do with the patrol the idea wasnt working out only dellwood and cook ninety percent were out of the noose dellwood its probably a waste of time but go ahead his report was only slightly less detailed than cooks he didnt put me on anybodys trail most everyone had had time to go do it to hawkes well you cant leave the stones unturned thank you all for your patience and cooperation ill talk to you again for as long as it takes no killer is invulnerable if you think of anything let me know ill hold your name in confidence you can go they headed for the door in a pack forgetting that i had the key jennifer remembered first she hollered for it as ladylike as a wolverine in a bad temper i tossed it to her one thing folks ive seen another woman around the house i described her i want to know who she is secret or not mostly they gave me baffled looks a couple looked like they wondered about my sanity they all went out except for dellwood who brought the key to the writing table ill put the general to bed now sir if you dont mind i dont if he doesnt go garrett the old man said proving he hadnt been asleep im not alert enough to continue see me after breakfast yes sir i got up and went out it was after midnight i was tired should i grab a few hours sleeping would be a real problem now the old man had made me a target no snake first the way things were going he probably didnt have anything i could use on the other hand he might if he did i might not have to worry about getting the ax in my sleep anymore i headed down the hall and got distracted immediately i spotted that woman again she was on the balcony across from the head of the generals hall my balcony i froze watched her just sort of drift along in a daydream she didnt notice me i darted to the stair leading to the fifth floor stole to the east wing crept down to the balcony below all for nothing she was gone id have to trap her if i wanted to talk to her i wanted to the mind plays games she was getting a grip on that part of me inexplicably immune to jennifers fetching charms as long as my room was just down the hall i figured it would be wise to stop for some extra equipment a sap and a sheath knife might not be enough if tonights party got somebody excited the bit of paper between the door and the doorframe was the way id left it but it was a decoy meant to flutter down and catch the eye the real telltale was a hair id left leaning against the door two inches in from the handle side frame it couldnt be replaced by somebody who stayed inside the hair was out of place go on in or just walk away i presumed somebody was waiting there hadnt been time for a comprehensive search since the adjournment i considered getting comfortable and waiting them out but every minute i wasted was a minute longer before i heard from snake how about we just surprise the surprise party i got a shield off the wall a mace dug my key out turned it in the lock kicked the door in hard enough to mash anybody waiting behind it went in with the shield up to take the blow of somebody against the wall on the other side nobody and it was dark in there someone had snuffed the lamp again i backed into the hall fast not wanting to stand there in silhouette a man with a crossbow could fix me up good someone came toward the doorway just far enough to be seen its me morley dotes i glanced along the hall nobody i went inside what the hell are you doing here i shucked the shield and felt around for a lamp curiosity thought id see what was happening i got the lamp going and the door shut you just walked in anybody could they dont lock the doors howd you find my suite he tapped his nose followed my honker we elves have a good sense of smell your suite is so heavy with the stink of meateater its easy to pick out he was putting me on youre here what do i do with you any developments yeah theres another dead one while i was in town this morning so tonight the old man calls a meeting tells everybody who i am and says im going to nail hides to the wall meantime he burns his will anything from town saucerhead made some rounds didnt find much some of those medals you know how many they handed out every hock shop in town has a bucket full the only ones worth anything are the silver ones people on the hill are worried about their silver supply the hill is tunfaires heart all the biggies live there including a gaggle of witches and wizards and whatnot who have to have their silver if they want to stay in business silver is to sorcery as wood is to fire since glory mooncalled whipped up on everybody in the cantard prices have soared but that was of no concern now what about the candlesticks and stuff he found a couple of things maybe the people who had them didnt remember where they got them literally you know saucerhead he can be convincing like a landslide you didnt talk when he said talk chances were you would real quick great theres a dead end hes going to try again tomorrow pity your thief didnt take something special so somebody would remember him thoughtless of him look ive got an appointment with a man who says he knows the killer maybe id like to see him before he changes his mind about talking lead on noble knight morley rags me about being romantic and sentimental he has his moments himself like turning up here hed never admit he was concerned about me swimming in a school of sharks hed just claim he was curious this is a real haunted house he muttered as we stole downstairs how can they stand it maybe theyre right when they say theres no place like home maybe you dont notice after a while whos the brunette i spotted when everybody charged out of the hall across the way thats the daughter jennifer a dead loss near as i can tell maybe you dont have what it takes maybe not but i think its bad chemistry we hit the bottom of the stairs nobody was around we headed for the back door there was a sliver of moon out just enough to keep me from stumbling over things morley had no trouble his kind can see inside a coffin at least its straightforward no dead gods no vampires no killer ogres just greedy people i thought about the woman in white and hoped she wasnt supernatural i didnt know how to deal with spooks morley grabbed me somebody moving over there i didnt see anything somebody tripped over something heard us morley said he took off i went to the stable called snake where you at its garrett no answer i stuck my head inside i didnt see anything the horses were restless muttering in their sleep i decided to circle around outside before i risked the inside wavering light spilled between boards on the north end near the west corner it was feeble like the light of a single guttering candle there was a narrow door id found snakes hideout snake you there its garrett snake didnt answer i opened the door snake wouldnt be answering anybody in this world again somebody had stuck a knife in him it wasnt a good job the thrust had gone in on the wrong side of his breastbone piercing a lung the tip of the dagger had lodged in his spine morley materialized lost him he looked at snake amateur work always a student morley and always a critic pros make mistakes if theyre in a hurry with somebody tough this guy was a commando way i hear be hard to take him clean maybe dotes dropped to his haunches toyed with a cord twisted around snakes neck the killer had finished it the hard way interesting id started looking for physical evidence a killer in a hurry could have dropped something whats that this is a kef sidhe stranglers cord a what i squatted beside him kef sidhe they have strict religious injunctions against spilling blood they think if you spill blood the murdered mans spirit cant pass on till hes been avenged so they kill without spilling blood because murder is part of their religion too using the cord is an art with them i looked at the cord it wasnt just a piece of rope morley said the master assassin makes his own cords making your own is the final rite of passage to master status look the knot is like a hangmans knot except the noose is round so it can be drawn with the hands pulling apart these knots in the cord arent really knots theyre braided over cork cones they work like barbs on an arrowhead the cord can be pulled through the knot in only one direction it only took a second to see how that worked with an example right there i felt one of the tapered bulges in the cord morley said the cork crushes down going through the knot expands again on the other side how do you get your cord off they dont they use it only once then its tainted ive only ever seen one before cut off his own throat by a man i knew years ago excepting you he was the luckiest guy ive ever known i looked around less interested in snake than he was if our killer wasnt good he was lucky there wasnt a spot of physical evidence kind of sad i said death usually is which was a surprise considering the source but morley has been full of surprises as long as ive known him i mean the way he lived i gestured at our surroundings hed lived like his horses hed slept on straw his only piece of furniture was a paintstained table this was a professional soldier twenty years in mostly spent in the cantard combat pay prize money a man careful enough to stay alive that long would be careful about his money but he lived in a barn like an animal didnt even have a change of clothes morley grunted happens want to bet he came out of the worst slum or off a dirt farm where they never saw two coppers the same month no bet id seen it raised poor they can get pathological about squirreling it away for a rainy day and death comes before the deluge sad way to live i touched snakes shoulder his muscles were still knotted he hadnt relaxed when hed died curious i recalled what cook had told me about him put it on his tombstone he was a good marine i rolled him over in case there was something under him there wasnt that i could see morley it takes a guy awhile to strangle maybe whoever killed him tried that first then stuck him instead of the other way around he glanced around at the damage which wasnt all that obvious considering the state of the place could be you ever try to strangle somebody he gave me a look he didnt answer questions like that sorry i have i was supposed to take out this sentry during a raid i practiced before we went in that doesnt sound like you that was me then i dont like killing and i didnt like it then but i figured if i had to do it and wanted to get out id better do it right he grunted again he was giving snakes former downside the onceover i did it by the book the guy was halfasleep when i got him but i blew it he threw me around like a ragdoll he beat the shit out of me and all the time i was hanging onto that damned rope only good i did was keep him from yelling till somebody could stick a knife in him the point if you dont snap a guys neck hes going to fight you and if he breaks loose even with that kef sidhe thing around his neck he sees you and you got to make sure of him any way you can what youre sneaking up on is this snake guy was stronger than whoever hit him like that venageti soldier i hadnt said the venageti was stronger than me but it was true yes somebody in the house probably has bumps and bruises if someone from the house did this maybe damn why couldnt i have had some luck this once what do you mean he thinks my luck is outrageously good why couldnt the killer leave something a scrap of cloth a tuft of hair anything why not just wish for a confession morley shook his head youre so slick you slide right past yourself he left you a dagger and a kef sidhe stranglers cord how exotic do you want to get i told you how rare the cord is how many daggers have you seen like this one it had a fourteeninch polished steel blade which was unusual but the hilt made it especially interesting it was black jade plain except for being jade but at its widest point where the middle finger of the hand would rest there was a small silver medallion struck with a twoheaded venageti military eagle a war souvenir morley suggested an unusual one venageti nobody lower than a light colonel would carry it a battalion commander in their elite forces or a regimental commander or his second in the regulars couldnt be a lot of those around could there true it was a lead tenuous but a lead i looked down at snake man why didnt you blurt it out when you had the chance garrett i knew that tone morleys special cautionary tone he saves for when he suspects im getting involved getting unprofessional hed call it getting bullheaded and careless too i have it under control i just feel for the guy i know what his life was like it shouldnt have ended like this its time to go garrett yes it was time before i got more involved emotionally i walked away thinking the old saw there but for the grace of the gods over and over morley wanted a crack at tracking whomever wed heard fleeing i gave him his head he didnt accomplish anything its not right garrett what im getting a bad feeling not quite an intuition something beyond that like an unfounded conviction that things are going to turn real bad just so i couldnt ever call him a liar somebody screamed inside the house it wasnt a scream of pain and not quite one of fear though there was fear in it it sent those dread chills stampeding around my back it sounded like a woman but i couldnt be sure id heard men scream like that in the islands stay out of sight i told morley and took off the screams went on and on i blew inside they came from the westside thirdfloor balcony i hit the stair running two flights up i slowed down i didnt want to charge into something the stairsteps were spotted with water drops and green stuff in bits and gobs under one lamp lay what looked like a dead slug i poked it it wiggled and i recognized it it was a leech id become closely acquainted with its relatives on that one swampy island there was an awful smell in the air i knew it from that island too what the hell there was all kinds of racket up there now men yelled peters shouted get one of those spears and shove it back down dellwood with a squeak higher than the screaming asked what the hell is it i moved upward carefully i saw men against the head of the stairs a couple with spears jabbing at something heaving on the stairs there wasnt enough light to show it clearly i had a suspicion draug i got a lamp i didnt want to see what i saw that thing on the stair was something nobody ever wants to see and whoever made it least of all it was a corpse one that had been immersed in a swamp what folklore called a draug a murdered man who could not rest in death while his killer went unpunished there are a million stories about draugs vengeance but id never expected to be a player in such a tale theyre apochryphal not concrete nobody ever really saw one funny how the mind works the thoughts youd expect didnt come to me all i could think was why me this shot hell out of my simple case peters yelled what do we do garrett besides puke i dont know you cant kill a draug its dead already it would just keep coming till it wore them out try to cut it up dellwood did upchuck chain shoved him aside flailed away with the ax part of a halberd a couple of fingers came wriggling down where i stood they didnt lose their animation hold it there ill come around the long way i backed down to the balcony as i retreated to the stair to the first floor i spied the woman in white watching from the top balcony east from a spot where she wouldnt be seen by the bunch above me she looked more interested and animated than usual like she was enjoying herself i tried to sneak up on her but she wasnt there when i got there i wasnt surprised i crossed through the loft went down the guys were hard at work poking and hacking and stumbling over each other peters said this is getting old garrett ill buy that whos it after how the hell should i know who did the screaming jennifer she ran into it down there somewhere it followed her up here where is she now in her suite hang in there youre doing a great job i started down the hall then came back kaid and chain cursed me i asked who was it when it was alive peters bellowed how the hell should i know he needed to work on his vocabulary he was in a rut catch you in a minute i headed for jennifers suite which was identical to her fathers apparently one floor below i tried the door at the end of the hall locked and barred i pounded jennifer its garrett i heard vague movement sounds they stopped she didnt open up i wondered if id have the nerve considering all the tricks the stories say draugs and haunts try i tried again she wasnt receiving callers i rejoined the boys they were hanging in there chunks of corrupt stinking flesh were everywhere and the draug kept coming stubborn cuss i found a spot from which i could kibbitz figure out who it was yet peters yeah spencer quick disappeared two months ago the clothes nobody dressed like quick lots of black leather thought it made the women swoon you bastard you just going to stand there i rounded up a fivefoot broadsword the kind theyd used in knighthood days to bash each other into scrap metal i tested its edge not bad considering i took up position out of the way behind where the thing would emerge onto the balcony let it come youre crazy kaid told me maybe go ahead back off do it peters said trusting me way too much they skipped away the dead man came in a cloud of stench dragging what was left of him lurching into the wall whatre you waiting for wayne shrieked at me i was waiting for the draug to jump its murderer thats what but it didnt of course they all panicked grabbed axes and swords and started swinging six of them in a crowd like that it was a miracle they didnt kill each other i stood back and watched to see if anybody took advantage of the confusion to eliminate another heir now that they had room they carved the draug into little frisky pieces didnt take them long either they were motivated wayne tyler and dellwood kept hacking away long after that was necessary they backed off finally panting everybody looked at me like they thought i ought to be next i got the impression they werent satisfied with my level of participation well then that takes care of that be smart to collect up the pieces and burn them peters you want to fill me in on this quick who was he and how did he happen to go away without anybody thinking that was strange chain exploded before he could get out a coherent sentence i said chain i want you to come with me and peters and tyler were going to backtrack that thing say what chain gulped air backtrack it yes i want to see where it came from might tell us something useful shit he said and started shaking i want to tell you im scared i dont mind admitting it all my years in the cantard i wasnt scared like i am now you never ran into anything like this not to worry its done peters said we have some other men missing garrett suppose more of those things turn up doesnt seem likely draugs dont run in packs usually i recalled a couple of stories there was the wild hunt a whole band of dead riders who hunted the living you saw how slow it was stay alert you can outmaneuver them the thing to remember is dont get excited we might have wrapped this mess up if wed let the draug go after whoever killed it shit chain swore it didnt care it just wanted to get somebody anybody maybe so lets hit the trail i tried to sound perky another glorious night in the corps i didnt feel perky not even a little i was scared stiff arm up if that makes you feel better and get lanterns peters grumbled i hope you know what youre doing garrett i didnt have the faintest i was just rattling around hoping something would shake loose tyler move out to the left about ten yards chain you go to the right i dont see much of a trail keep an eye out i disposed myself and peters between them so we spanned thirty yards we started from the base of the front steps lets go peters said it was walking when it came wouldnt leave much of a trail probably not you going to tell me who quick was before we carved him up we chain bellowed will you listen to that shit calm down peters told him i know what he was doing he was right you should have told us garrett and warn the villain hes pretty well warned now safe too oh add a name to the victim list somebody did it to snake peters stopped held his lantern overhead glared at me you arent kidding snake why the hell snake i tried to recall whod been sitting where when id let snake out that door hell anybody with good ears could have heard hed used a stage whisper maybe hed wanted the killer to know maybe hed had something planned and it had turned in his hand i wouldnt let a known killer get close enough to put a noose around my neck here chain said we moved over a strip of rotten leather hung on a bush we redeployed i said you going to tell me about quick i cant peters said i didnt know him he was almost as spooky as snake stayed to himself mostly you had to use a pry bar to get three words out of him he did fancy himself a lover you want to find out about him talk to the gals at the black shark all i can tell you is he was somebody the general knew and thought he owed like all of us id passed the black shark on the way to the stantnor place it was an evillooking dive id been considering tastetesting the house brew now i had business reasons to visit chain you know anything about him not me hell sour as he was i wasnt surprised when he walked him and the old man feuded all the time he never gave a shit about the money far as i know he just didnt have nowhere else to go tyler i didnt know him except he played a big role at the black shark guy was a werewolf the way he changed personality when a woman was in sight i figured he found somewhere he wanted to be more than he wanted to stay here great the live ones were weird and the dead ones weirder we were spread out just enough we kept finding another trace just before we lost the trail we adjusted and kept on it was slow going who do you think is doing it garrett peters asked i dont have a clue chain said hell pass the word when theres only one of us left that would work i admitted tyler kicked in id have put money on snake he was killcrazy in the islands hed go hunting alone if he went too long without action id known a few like that guys who got hooked on the killing they hadnt made it through death has a way of devouring its acolytes here peters said hed found a place in tall grass where the draug had stopped the trail was easy now the grass was trampled down the trail pointed toward the swamp peters had mentioned i asked you ever heard of kef sidhe kef she what sidhe as in the race sidhe kef sidhe are professional killers religious assassins no hell the nearest sidhe are a couple thousand miles from here ive never seen one neither had i theyre something like elves what about them snake was strangled with a kef sidhe stranglers cord not exactly a common item in these parts peters just looked baffled near as i could tell by lantern light damn he was ugly how about a venageti colonels dress dagger were there any souvenirs around blackhandled thing with a silver medallion long blade yes can i ask why you can i wont tell you till i know more about the knife snake had one he took off a venageti colonel that he snuffed during one of his private excursions chain said damn whats the matter somebody stuck it in him when the stranglers cord didnt work fast enough wouldnt you know it stuck with his own sticker hell next thing i knew id find out he committed suicide our villain was probably more lucky than clever full of tricks that were working out by accident chain said holy shit in a soft voice we got trouble what peters demanded look at this we joined him he held his lantern as high as he could now there were two trails through the grass one a yard to the side of the other peters and i exchanged glances then looked at chain tyler get over here tyler hadnt come his lantern hung about two feet off the ground as he knelt to study something wait a second i asked what have you got looks like dark movement behind him look out the draug grabbed tyler by the throat and hoisted him into the air his neck snapped he made a sound like a rabbits scream his lantern fell and broke fire splashed the draugs feet it lifted tyler overhead heaved him into the darkness turned on the rest of us spread out i said you damn well better do more than watch this time chain told me the fire blazed till the lanterns fuel was gone the grass didnt catch neither did the draug both were too wet well cut it up i said like the other one chain said lets dont talk lets do i didnt want to but this draug wasnt particular about whom it stalked it hated life if it had been after tyler specifically it would have fallen down done revenge complete but it wanted the rest of us too it didnt have much chance against three of us we were faster and armed but it kept coming and coming and coming its hard to cut a body up when its chasing you the horror and fear subsided after a few minutes i got my head working either one of you know who this was crumpet chain said he concentrated like a clockmaker making every move and stroke count crumpet what kind of name is that nickname peters said real name was simon riverway he didnt like it crumpet was all right the ladies hung it on him in full harbor said he was a sweet bun weird i unleashed a roundhouse cut at the draugs neck it got a hand in the way my stroke sheered halfway through its wrist one bones worth the thing kept turning toward me while i was off balance grabbing with its other hand it grabbed hold of my sleeve i thought i was a goner chain came in with a twohanded overhead stroke all his weight behind it it hit the things shoulder hard enough to shake its hold i owe you one chain i danced back a few yards decided id follow chains example and set my lantern down the draug kept after me which was fine with peters and chain peters jumped in behind and took a wild cut at its right achilles tendon hamstrung it on his backstroke and it kept coming though not as fast as it had it seemed to take forever but we wore it down it fell and couldnt get up we carved it up good to make sure spending a lot of fear energy once we were finished i recovered my lantern said i think wed better hole up till dawn if there were two of them there might be more we can explore later you said they dont run in packs peters said maybe i was wrong i dont want to find out the hard way lets get out of here first smart thing ive heard you say chain said he examined tyler dead as a wedge you think hes the one that killed them i dont know i wouldnt bet on it that one didnt care who it killed it just wanted to kill somebody like the old joke about the hungry buzzard lets go before tyler gets up and comes after us too i couldnt take that i didnt argue draugs are supposed to be dead a few months before they get up but i wasnt ready to field test the folklore as soon as we reached the house i went to check on dellwood kaid and wayne they were out back theyd gotten a roaring bonfire going and were feeding it pieces of the first draug i told them throw it all in and get inside sir dellwood asked he had his color back there may be more of them out we ran into one who used to be called crumpet it killed tyler lets not find out what else is waiting in the dark they didnt fool around they didnt ask questions they pitched the draug in the fire and headed for the house i glanced around as i followed wondering what had become of morley the survivors gathered at the fountain they were chattering about snake and tyler when i joined them wayne and kaid held the opinion that the second draug had gotten the right man i told them im not so sure it just wanted to kill it wasnt satisfied with tyler dellwood check the doors peters are there other ways to get in several take chain and kaid and check them out we stay in threes till the sun comes up how come chain asked i think the killer is working alone if were stuck with him well outnumber him two to one oh peters said ask these guys about that sidhe thing right dellwood wayne kaid you know anything about kef sidhe especially a kef sidhe stranglers cord they frowned dellwood puffing from his hasty trip to the doors asked whats that i described the thing id found around snakes neck the general had something like that in his study peters brightened yes i remember it it was with a whole bunch of junk whips and stuff in the corner by the fireplace i recalled the whips i hadnt paid much attention dellwood next time youre up there see if its gone ask the general where it came from and where it went if its not there dellwood nodded i hated to turn loose but i couldnt keep him on my suspect list he just didnt seem capable if i discounted peters whod have to be crazy to hire me if he was guilty i didnt have many suspects left the others were thinking the same way chain kaid and wayne started giving each other plenty of room peters started to go wait i said theres one question i shouldve asked before ive been too busy with murder to worry about theft does anybody have a drug habit or gamble or keep a woman on the outside all of those might explain the thievery everybody shook their heads not even hawkes or snake or tyler three in one day the old man wasnt going to be happy about the job i was doing though he hadnt exactly hired me to keep people alive no peters said you dont stay alive in the cantard if youre the slave of your vices true though vice had been rampant in places like full harbor where wed taken our rare leaves and liberties a hellhole for a kid full harbor but you learned what life was like there you had no illusions when you left karenta hadnt yet evacuated full harbor though glory mooncalled said they had to go his deadline had passed something would happen down there soon a really big explosion and glory mooncalled wouldnt have his usual advantages you cant outrun outmaneuver or even sneak up on a fortified city waiting for you i doubted he had friends inside the walls his enemies there would include karentas top sorcerers against whom he had no defense i didnt think he could take full harbor but he had to try hed shot off his mouth one time too many he was committed the fate of full harbor meant nothing now of course we had our own siege here a siege of horror peterss group split to make sure the house hadnt been penetrated the rest of us stayed at the fountain in reserve after a while i asked dellwood what do you figure on doing after the general passes he looked at me funny i never really thought about it mr garrett that was hard to believe i said so wayne chuckled believe it garrett this guy isnt real he aint here for the money hes here to take care of the old man really and why are you here three things the money i got nowhere else to go and jennifer i lifted an eyebrow i hadnt gotten much chance to show off my favorite trick lately the generals daughter the same i want her pretty blunt this one whats the general think i dont know i never brought it up i dont intend to before he goes what do you plan to do with your share of the money nothing let it sit i wont need it if i have jenny will i no he wouldnt which is why i aint your killer mister i dont have to skrag anybody to get half the estate a point whats jennifer think about this she hadnt shown any interest in wayne straight she aint exactly swept away but she aint got no other offers and she aint likely to get none when the time comes shell come around what an attitude he sounded like a guy who could work his way up a hit list fast what do you think about that dellwood not much sir but miss jennifer will need somebody how about you no sir i havent the force of personality to deal with her not to mention the fact that she isnt a very pleasant person really i was about to probe that when wayne jumped up and pointed there was a vague shape at the back door not clearly visible through the glass it rattled the door i figured it was morley i walked toward the door slowly make him wait halfway there a face pressed against the glass i was able to make out decomposed features i stopped another one dont panic i dont think it can get in if it does stay out of its way i returned to the fountain settled disturbed but not afraid the draugs werent particularly dangerous when you were ready for them one in a night was unpleasant enough but not that unreasonable except for the assault on reason in this world almost anything can happen and it does but id never seen the dead get up and walk before id never known anybody whod seen it unless you counted vampires but theyre a whole different story theyre victims of a disease and they never really die they just slip into a kind of limbo between life and death once was unpleasant twice was doubly unpleasant but three times was just too much to have been animated by hatred and hunger for revenge alone not all in the same night mass risings of the dead in story and legend were initiated from outside by necromancers by sorcerers hey uh dellwood anybody around here a trained sorcerer or even an amateur no sir he frowned why i lied i thought we could use a little help laying some restless spirits snake wayne said he could do some spooky stuff picked it up from a necromancer he was her chief bodyguard for a while he painted her picture and she taught him some tricks he snickered must have been a variety of tricks he wasnt much good at it and hes dead yeah thats how you get off the hook around here but suppose he could think like a sorcerer what do you mean what i let me reach i was supposed to meet him he was going to tell me who the killer was he seemed sure he knew hed be wary but somebody got to him despite his training and precautions suppose he knew that might happen suppose that if he had a mind to he could turn himself into a booby trap somebodys a booby flatterer look its in stories all the time the curse that gets you after you kill a sorcerer suppose he fixed it so that if he got killed everybody else the killer killed would get up and go after him wayne grunted maybe knowing that spooky paranoid bastard hed rig it so theyd get up and go after everybody that fit too sometimes im so brilliant i blind myself so what suppose that was true it explained the draugs but didnt settle anything there was a killer on the loose if that hadnt been tyler no way to know unless he struck again if he had an ounce of brains hed retire while he had the chance to get out free i have such confidence in human nature gents im bone tired im going to bed sir dellwood protested that thing isnt going to get in it was still trying and getting nowhere our killer if hes still alive has got a great out now he can let tyler take the rap what you call planting a seed for the slow of wit i was so tired my eyes wouldnt stay open i needed to set myself up with some safe time good night all morley was in my sitting room when i arrived he had his feet up on my writing table youre getting old garrett you cant take one long night anymore huh i was right on top of things we investigator types have minds like steel traps were always ready with a snappy comeback heard your speech to the troops shucking them so you can make with the snores my second long night in a row howd you get in thought we had the place buttoned up you might trick is walk in before the buttoning starts you went off chasing the walking dead i just strolled around front and let myself in poked around the house some came up here when the troll woman started rattling pots and pans oh i got the feeling my repartee lacked something tonight or this morning the first ghost light of dawn tickled the windows i looked through the kitchen the things you people eat the sacrifices i make i didnt ask cook favored basic country cooking heavy stuff meat and gravy and biscuits lots of grease though morley might have liked what shed had for lunch my first meal here he was saying he planned to stay around he went a little farther i figure you can use a ghost to balance off theirs huh i wasnt making a comeback ill haunt the place roam around where theyre not looking doing things youd do if you werent busy keeping them calmed down that made sense i had a list of a hundred things i wanted to do like look for hidden passageways and sneak into peoples rooms to snoop i hadnt had time for them and probably wouldnt because somebody would be in my pocket constantly thanks morley i owe you one not yet not quite but were getting up close to even he meant for a couple of tricks hed pulled on me back when the worst was having me help carry a coffin with a vampire in it hed given a guy he didnt like he hadnt warned me for the good reason that if id known i wouldnt have helped i hadnt known till the vampire jumped up id been a little put out hed been paying me back with little favors ever since he said fill me in so i wont go reinventing the wheel i got myself a handkerchief first this cold feels like itll turn bad my heads starting to feel like the proverbial wool pack diet he told me you eat right you dont get colds look at me never had a cold in my life maybe elves dont get colds i gave him the full account as i wouldve given it to the dead man i kept an eye on him watching for giveaways he finds ways to profit when he weasels his way in to help me id watched him enough to recognize that moment when he grabs onto something the obvious way here would be to recruit a gang to loot the place that would be easy not so easy would be eluding an excited and bloodthirsty upper class afterward not that that would intimidate him much they might not have much use for general stantnor but as a class they couldnt tolerate the precedent every stormwarden firelord sorcerer necromancer whatnot would join in to pass out the exemplary torments we have three separate things going then morley said thievery slow murder maybe mass murder you have the wheels turning on the thievery so forget that the general the thing to do is let me and a doctor look at him on the other killer the only thing you can do is keep talking to people eliminating suspects go teach grandma to suck eggs morley this is my business i know dont be so touchy im just thinking out loud you agree dellwood and peters look unlikely sure they all do the old man is bedridden and probably couldnt be fixed up with a motive anyway i hadnt considered the general the kaid character is too old for the pace and not strong enough to shove these other guys around maybe sneakiness is the killers trademark though an old man would be sneaky sure then theres the wayne character who plans to marry money so who does that leave if everybody else is honest chain obnoxious argumentive overweight chain to whom id taken an instant dislike and the daughter and the outside possibility not to mention maybe somebody who went away but didnt disappear because hed been murdered wait wait wait whats that you have four men who rode off into the sunset right snake bradons presumptive necromancy recalled three wheres the other one which one was he what were the will provisions regarding those men i didnt recall one had gotten cut out id heard that but if somebody was good for a share even if he wasnt around and everybody thought he was gone or dead now hed be in great shape to do dirty deeds then turn up for the reading of the will whoever got hawkes headed for the house here you lost the trail true if it was somebody who isnt on the inside he wouldnt know about the general burning the will yes he might keep on keeping on true again somebody tried giving me the ax theres that but it could be related to your other problems morley trying to puzzle it out will drive me crazy i dont want to bother he gave me a look something short of a sneer good thinking youre goofy enough now i said look at this point what i do is just bull around and try to make things happen when the bad boys get nervous they do something to give themselves away morley chuckled you have style garrett like a water buffalo what good will bulling around do if your villain was tyler not much i admitted what about the cook if shes been around four hundred years she might think the family owes her a fatter chunk than the old man was going to give her id considered that in light of the fact that the nonhuman races dont think like us and trolls are pretty basic somebody gets in a trolls way the troll flattens him cooks time is accounted for when hawkes got it not to mention if she was on a horse and her weight didnt kill it it would leave tracks a foot deep it was an idea hows she look for poisoning the old man i shrugged shes got means and opportunity but i come up short on motive she raised him from a pup id think thered be some love of a sort he snorted youre right were not going to reason it out sleep on it ill go haunt dont walk into the bedroom i warned him i have an ax rigged to carve sneaky visitors id decided to go back to the featherbed the floor in the dressing room was too hard maybe id move later like id been thinking morley nodded then he flashed a grin wish there was your usual compliment of honeys in this one that would make it a lot more interesting i couldnt argue with that it seemed id just drifted off when somebody started pounding on the door though the light through the window said otherwise i cursed whomever and rolled over im not at my best when wakened prematurely in the process of rolling i cracked my eyes what i saw didnt register it was impossible i wriggled into the down the old hound searching for perfect comfort i sat up like id gotten a pin in the sitter the blonde smiled faintly as she drifted out my bedroom door i didnt even yell i just gaped shed been sitting on the edge of the bed looking at me shed gotten in without getting carved up i checked the booby trap it sat there looking back loaded and ready to splash blood over half a county if some villain should cooperate and trip it just sitting here waiting boss and the door was open it hadnt worked that gave me the spine chills suppose it hadnt been my lovely midnight admirer suppose it had been somebody with a special gift i imagined being stuck to the bed like a bug with a pin through him by the time i got through the supposes and lumbered out of the bedroom the blonde was gone without having used the hall door where some obnoxious fellow was pounding away trying to get my attention hed gotten my goat already i collected my headknocker and went to see who wanted me up at such an unreasonable hour whatever hour it was dellwood whats happened now sir oh nothings happened you were supposed to see the general this morning sir yeah sorry i was too busy snoring to remember missed breakfast didnt i hell i needed to diet anyway give me ten minutes to get presentable he looked at me like he thought it might take me a year longer than that yes sir ill meet you there sir great im getting old it took more than ten minutes it was twenty before i started hoofing it across the loft to the old mans wing i wondered about the blonde i wondered about morley i wondered why i didnt just go home these people were nuts whatever i did i wasnt going to strike any blow for truth and justice ought to fade away and come back in a year see how things stood then i was in a great mood dellwood was waiting in the hallway outside the generals door he let me in the preliminaries followed routine dellwood went out kaid followed after making sure the fire was the size and heat of the one thats going to end the world i sweated the general suggested sit down i sat did dellwood bring you up to date the events of the night he did do you have any idea what happened or why yes surprisingly i told him about snakes whisper our date how id found him dellwood suggested the cord might have come from this room kef sidhe yes i have one inherited from my grandfather he collided with the cult around the turn of the century when he was a young lieutenant sent to battle the crime rings on the waterfront they were bad back then one of the nonhuman crime lords had imported some sidhe killers the cord should be there with the whips and such i checked not here now i wasnt racked with amazement neither was he who could have gotten it anyone anytime i havent paid attention to it in years who knew what it was everybodys heard me maunder on about my grandfathers adventures and about the adventures of every other stantnor who ever was since my sons death theres been no future to look to so i relive the glories of the past i understand sir he was a good officer he brightened you served under him careful garrett or youll spend your stay having the old boy bend your ear no sir but i knew men who did they spoke well of him that says plenty considering how enlisted men discuss their officers indeed he knew he drifted off to another time when everyone was happier or at least he remembered them being happier the mind is a great instrument for redesigning history he came back suddenly apparently the past wasnt all roses either a disastrous night talk to me about those dead men i gave him my theory about snake having raised them possible he said entirely possible invisible black was the sort of bitch whod think it an amusing practical joke to arm an untutored marine with the weapons to accomplish something like that the name meant nothing to me except that another sorceress had adopted a ridiculous handle her real name was probably henrietta sledge have you nothing positive to report mr garrett not yet any suspects no sir everybody im having trouble making sense of the situation i dont know the people well enough yet he looked at me like he was thinking i should be living up to one of those corps mottos like the difficult we do immediately the impossible takes a minute longer what will you do now poke around talk to people till i get hold of something shake it i had one thought during the night the man whos been picking the rest off could be one who apparently left you if he thought he could turn up for the reading of your will no sir each man executed an agreement when he joined me in retirement to remain eligible hed have to remain here i lost some respect for him there hed bribed them and indentured them so he wouldnt be alone he was no philanthropist his motives were completely selfish general stantnor was a mask behind it was someone who wasnt very nice i wouldnt call it an epiphany but it was an intuition that felt true this was a meanspirited old man in a carefully crafted disguise i examined him more closely his color wasnt good this morning his respite was over he was on the road to hell again i reminded myself it wasnt my place to judge then i reminded myself that when i remind myself what im doing is looking for justification someone knocked that saved me confusion and stole the generals opportunity to get righteous id sensed that coming enter dellwood opened the door theres a mr tharpe to see mr garrett the general looked at me i told him thats the man i had trying to trace certain items bring him up dellwood dellwood closed the door i asked here is he likely to report something you dont want me to hear no it just seemed an inconvenience to you not at all hell he was fishing for entertainment again he didnt care what saucerhead had to tell me much he just didnt want to be alone mr garrett could i impose on you to build the fire a little damn i was hoping he wouldnt notice it was down to a volcanic level i wondered if kaid had a fulltime job just hauling in fuel saucerhead arrived lugging a bag in his paw it seemed small he hulks like a cave bear dellwood seemed a little intimidated the old man was impressed he cracked cook sees him shell fall in love that was the first id heard him try for humor thatll be all dellwood dellwood got out saucerhead wiped his brow and said why dont you open a goddamned window whos the old prune garrett the principal be nice right whats up i was surprised hed make a trip out considering what he was getting paid i maybe found some of the stuff he dumped the sack on the writing table silver candlesticks they wouldnt have been remarkable if silver hadnt become important lately general i asked this your stuff look on their bases if they belong to the family therell be a seahorse chop beside the smiths i looked little sea critters we have a lead looks like whats the story saucerhead saucerhead has a kind of pipsqueak voice when hes just making conversation doesnt go with his size at all he said i was jawing with some guys at morleys last night bitching about the job looked like it wasnt going anywhere talking about this and that you know how it is then this one guy asks did i think there might be a reward for the stuff i didnt know you never told morley if there was or not so i said maybe and did he know something to make a long story short he knew some fences i didnt outside guys so this morning i go to check them first one i hit he has the sticks we talk a little i threaten a little he blusters a little i make mention of how i know he dont have a connection with the kingpin and i happen to know chodo personal would he like me to arrange an introduction all of a sudden hes eager to help he loans me the sticks i promise to bring them back which meant he would and if the general tried to grab them saucerhead would walk through him and the rest of the house he keeps his promises got you can the fence finger the thief he dont know squat bought the stuff wholesale from somebody out in the country hell sell the wholesalers name did you follow that general i believe so this dealer in stolen goods bought the candlesticks from another dealer closer to home here for a price hell sell the man out thats it go beat it out of him it doesnt work that way general he offered a straight deal we should follow through on those terms deal with criminals as though they were honorable men you have all your life with those bandits off the hill but lets not argue we have a lead we could settle the theft problem today saucerhead how much does he want i was thinking longterm now an unconnected fence hed need friends he could be nurtured and stroked on the head and maybe become a good source someday if he stayed alive people arent scared of fences the way theyre scared of morley dotes or chodo contague saucerhead named a price that was pleasantly low its a bargain general go with it how much more are you willing to lose to avoid spending a few marks collect from dellwood he handles the household monies that sounded like a cue for me to get away from a place where i was uncomfortable ill take care of this sir maybe stantnor sensed my discomfort he didnt protest but there was a glimmer of hurt in his eyes id never seen it in an old person before but im not around them much id seen it in children the pain when an adult doesnt have time to be bothered with them that hit me in the spot where i think of myself as one of the good guys guilt its lack is something i envy morley morley never feels guilty morley does what he wants or has to do and is puzzled by the behavior of those of us who had mothers where does it come from that niggling little nasty saucerhead said that old boy didnt look good garrett whats he got i dont know youre going to help me find out say what dellwood the general said give my friend enough to cover some upcoming expenses how much do you need saucerhead hand him a chance to make his trip worth the trouble he didnt bite not very big twenty the guy tries to jack me up ill pull his ears off he would and wrap them with a bow get the name then get the guy right but find a doctor somewhere and bring him out here too a doctor you lost me somewhere garrett what you want a doctor for to look at the old man hes got a thing about croakers only way to get one close is fool him so you do that all right youre paying the freight hurry all you can right he was supposed to be too simple for sarcasm but i smelled a load there dellwood gave him twenty marks he left i went to the front door watched him head out in a buggy hed probably rented from playmate a mutual friend i grumbled about his expenses the old man had given me a nice advance but i hadnt counted on quite so many expenses dellwood joined me may i ask what that was all about sir you can ask dont mean ill tell you part of the job you going to tell the general im sneaking a doctor in on him he gave it a think no sir its appropriate except for yesterday hes been sinking fast hes pretending to bear up today but last night is gnawing at him too if theres a way let me know if i can aid in the deception i will i have a lot to do today like what not that much specific ill let you know before tharpe gets back very well sir we parted i went upstairs to see if morley was in the suite hed have a part to play as i reached the top balcony i spied my friend in white across the way i waved she surprised me by waving back morley wasnt there just like him not to be handy when i needed him thoughtless of him i grabbed my coat and headed out the blonde was still there she wasnt watching for me i decided to take one more crack at sneaking up on her slipped up to the loft across went down ha still there only my imagination had run away with me this wasnt my blonde this was jennifer wearing white and not the same white the blonde wore she smiled kind of sadly as i approached her whats the matter i asked life she leaned her elbows on the rail i joined her leaving a few feet between us below our hero remained locked in mortal combat with the dragon chain passed without giving them a glance i knew how the knight felt us heroes like to be applauded for our efforts i answered jennifer with one of those uhm noises that mean youll listen if your companion wants to share her troubles am i ugly garrett i glanced at her no she wasnt not hardly ive known several equally gorgeous women who were more insecure about their looks than your lessthanaveragelooking ladies the guy who didnt notice would have to be dead thanks trace of a smile trace of warmth she moved maybe three inches closer that helps half a minute but nobody does notice even that im female how do you tell a woman it isnt her looks its her inside that nice as she looks she feels like a black widow spider you dont you fib a little to avoid the cruelty and hate even standing close with her radiating a need to be wanted i couldnt find any interest inside me i began to worry about me you dont notice me i notice you plenty only somebody with very skewed standards like maybe a ratman would call her hard on the eyes but im taken thats always an out oh that infinite sorrow again thats what it was sorrow sorrow that stretched back to the dawn of her days an abyss that could gobble the world whats her name tinnie tinnie tate is she attractive yes the redhead is in the same class as jennifer that is the howlatthemoon class but we have our problems one of which is that we arent going anywhere sort of a cantlivewithandcantlivewithout arrangement neither of us with enough confidence to risk commitment i might have with maya or maybe she just said she was going to marry me so often that i accepted the possibility i wondered what she was doing wondered if i was supposed to track her down wondered if shed ever be back youre awful thoughtful garrett tinnie does that to me and this place this house dont be apologetic i live here i know its a sad place a ghost town all by itself haunted by mighthavebeens some of us live in the past and the rest live for a future thatll never come and cook who lives in another world is the rock that holds us together she wasnt so much talking to me as putting feelings into words theres a road down front garrett less than half a mile away its other end is tunfaire karenta the world i havent been past the front gate since i was fourteen how old are you now twentytwo whos holding you here nobody but me im afraid everything i imagine i want is out there and im afraid to go see it when i was fourteen cook took me to the city for the summer fair i wanted so badly to go its the only time ive ever been off the estate it terrified me odd most beautiful women dont have much trouble coping because theyve had attention all their lives i know my future and it frightens me too i looked at her thinking she meant wayne id be disturbed too if i were the object of such plans ill stay here in the heart of my fortress and turn into a crazy old woman while the house crumbles around me and cook ill never find nerve enough to hire the workmen to put it right strangers scare me it doesnt have to be that way it has to my destiny was laid down the week i was born if my mother had survived but she probably wouldnt have changed things she was a strange woman herself from what i hear daughter of a firelord and a stormwarden raised in an environment almost as cold as mine betrothed to my father by arrangement between his parents and hers they never met before their wedding day my father loved her though what happened really hurt him he never mentions her he wont talk about her but he has her picture in his bedroom sometimes he just lies there and stares at it for hours what do you say when somebody tells you something like that you cant kiss it and make it better not much you can do or say i said im going to take a walk why dont you get a wrap and come along how cold is it not too bad winter was just blustering and fussing bluffing too cowardly to jump in there and bully the world which was fine with me winter isnt my favorite season all right she pushed away from the rail and walked to the stairs down headed for her own suite i tagged along which was fine till we neared her door then she got nervous she didnt want me inside fine for now her fortress would remain inviolate i retreated halfway down the hall if id had doubts about her lack of social skills they disappeared when she returned in less than a minute ive never known a woman who didnt spend half an hour changing her shoes shed done that and had donned a very sensible militarytype winter coat that surprisingly was flattering because it centered attention on her face and that face made me wince because such beauty was shut up here wasted such beauty like a great painting should be out for all to appreciate we went downstairs and through that hall between the stantnor forebears all of whom noted our passing with grave disapproval so did wayne who maybe thought i was trying to beat his time it wasnt as mild as id promised the wind had picked up since saucerheads departure it had a good bite but jennifer didnt notice we descended the steps i set course along the path that chain peters tyler and i had taken last night i asked would you like to see the city if you could do it without too much discomfort i had in mind turning saucerhead loose on her he has a knack for making women comfortable though his taste runs to gals about five feet short its too late if youre trying to save me i didnt say anything to that my attention was on last nights trail i saw something strange today jennifer said shifting subject radically a man i dont know i went up where you found me looking for him but he wasnt there anymore morley had to be maybe my blondes boyfriend she glanced at me sharply the first time shed looked up since wed left the house are you making fun of me no of a situation maybe i see a woman over and over nobody else sees her at least nobody admits shes there but now youre seeing ghosts too i saw him garrett i didnt say you didnt but you dont believe me i dont believe or disbelieve the first rule of my business is keep an open mind the second is remember that everybody lies to you that seemed to satisfy her she didnt speak again for a while we came to the place where tyler died tyler wasnt there neither was the draug i walked around trying to discover what had happened i couldnt i hoped peters and the others had collected them id have to find out the wind was biting the grass was brown the sky was gray and the brooding stantnor place loomed like a thunderhead of despair i glanced at the orchard all those bare arms reaching for the sky spring would come for the trees but not for the stantnors do you dance i asked maybe we could force gaiety into the place at swords points she managed a joke i dont know ive never tried hey were making headway next thing youll be smiling she didnt respond for half a minute then bushwhacked me again im a virgin garrett not exactly a surprise it figured but why tell me the other day when you caught me in your stuff i thought you were the man who would change that but you arent are you i dont think so peters warned me that i have a reputation maybe but the way this is it wouldnt be right it has to be right jennifer carefully carefully garrett hell hath no fury and all that you shouldnt want to do it just because you dont want to be a virgin you should do it because thats what you want to do because youre with someone special and you want to share something special i can get preached at by cook sorry just trying to tell you how i think youre a lovely woman one of the most beautiful ive ever met the kind men like me only dream about id take you up on it in a second if i was a guy who could just use a woman and discard her like a gnawed bone and not care how much she hurts that seemed to help believe me all that analysis and nimblefooting had me real nervous prancing around a lot of mixed feelings i think i understand its actually kind of nice thats me mr nice guy talk myself out of the winners circle every time she gave me a look sorry youre not used to my brand of wit i was following the backtrails of the draugs slowly now climbing a gentle slope toward the family cemetery jennifer seemed too preoccupied to notice after wed walked another fifty yards she stopped would you do one thing for me sure even what we were talking about if it ever becomes right strained little smile touch me huh i was back into my trick bag of brilliant repartee touch me what the hell i reached out touched her shoulder she raised her hand grabbed mine moved it to her cheek i rested my fingers there gently she had the silkiest skin id ever touched she started shaking i mean shaking bad tears filled her eyes she turned away embarrassed or frightened after a while she turned back and we started walking again as we reached the low rail fence around the cemetery she said that was almost as much what nobody ever touched me before ever not since i was old enough to remember cook did i guess when i had to be changed and burped and all those things you do with babies i stopped dead faced that grim old mansion no wonder it was so goddamned bleak i faced her come here what just come here when she stepped closer i pulled her into a hug she went as rigid as an iron post i held her a moment then turned loose maybe its not too late to start everybodys got to touch sometime youre not human if you dont i understand what she wanted when she wanted to stop being a virgin sex had nothing to do with it she might not realize it consciously but she thought sex was the price she had to pay for what she needed how many times has morley told me im a sucker for cripples and strays more than i like to remember and hes right if you call wanting to ease pain being a sucker i stepped over the cemetery fence held her hand as she followed she caught the hem of her dress which wasnt exactly designed for a stroll in the country she cursed softly i helped her keep her balance while she worked it loose looking around as she did so my gaze fell on a tombstone less aged than most as simple a marker as there was there just a small slab of granite with a name eleanor stantnor not even a date jennifer stepped over to it my mother that was all that was the resting place of the woman whose death had warped so many lives and turned the stantnor place into the house of graydom i wouldve thought hed built her a temple of course the house had become her mausoleum her memorial the house of broken dreams jennifer shuddered and moved closer i put my arm around her we had a biting cold wind a gray day and a graveyard i needed to be close to somebody too i said ive reconsidered somewhat spend the night with me tonight i didnt explain i didnt say anything more she didnt say anything either neither in protest shock or accusation she stiffened just the slightest the only sign shed heard me it was an impulse almost kicked up by that part of me that hates to see people hurting maybe theres such a thing as karma our good deeds get their reward a small thing but if id overcome that impulse id probably be dead we stood looking at the tombstone i asked do you know much about your mother only what i told you which is all cook ever told me father wont say anything he fired everybody after she died except cook there wasnt anyone else to tell me what about your grandparents i dont know anything about them my grandfather stantnor died when i was a baby my grandmother stantnor went when my father was a boy i dont know who they were on my mothers side except that they were a stormwarden and a firelord cook wont tell me who they were i think something bad happened to them and she doesnt want me to know ting a little bell rang inside my head a favorite pastime of our ruling class is plotting to snatch the throne though we havent lately sometimes we go through periods when we change kings like underwear we had three in one year once thered been a big brouhaha when i was eight maybe seven about the time jennifer had been born an assassination attempt had gone awry and had been so blackhearted at its core that the wouldbe victim had gotten so righteously pissed off hed made a clean sweep not a bit of forgiveandforget necks got stretched heads and bodies went their separate ways arms and legs got hauled around the kingdom and buried individually beneath crossroads great estates got confiscated it hadnt been a good time to be related to the conspirators however remotely from my neighborhood it had been great fun watching the ruling class chase its tail and get it caught in a door or some such mixed metaphor when those things come up everybody on the outside hopes that crowd will wipe themselves out but they never do they just select out the least competent schemers shouldnt be hard to find out who her grandparents had been would you want to know i asked is it important to you its not important it wouldnt change my life i dont know if i care anymore after some silence i used to dream about them when i was little they were going to come take me home to their palace i was really a princess theyd sent me and my mother here to hide us from their enemies only something happened maybe theyd forgotten where theyd hidden us i dont know i never figured out why they never came i just pretended that they would someday a common childhood mind game but it could be true jennifer things were unsettled politically in those days its possible the marriage was arranged to put your mother out of harms way with your grandparents dead your father might have been the only one left who knew who your mother was youre kidding no i was young but i remember those days some people tried to kill the king they blew it he went crazy a lot of people died including some who had nothing to do with the plot sometimes you tell the white lie wouldnt hurt to leave her the option of believing her grandparents had been innocents caught in the storm she laughed without humor wouldnt that be something if my kids daydreams were true do you still not care i could find out about her grandparents without doing much but poke through some old records worth the effort if it would brighten her life i think i do care ill find out then i started moving again she followed caught up in her thoughts paying no attention while i got back onto the trail of the draugs we were almost to the road before she realized we were still headed away from the house she might not have noticed then if we hadnt gotten into some cockleburs where are you going she sounded almost panicky there was a touch of wildness in her eyes she looked around like shed suddenly wakened in enemy territory only the peaks of the house were visible above the hummock where the cemetery lay once we reached the road those would be out of sight im backtracking the thing that came to the house last night i was backtracking all three really there were three trails smashed through the weeds but there were no return trails that left me a little uneasy wed only disposed of two i think it came from the swamp thats supposed to be up ahead there no i want to go back she looked around like she expected something to jump out at us and maybe something could those draugs hadnt behaved like story draugs who was to say they werent immune to daylight and i wasnt equipped to handle them it hadnt occurred to me to bring any heavy weaponry still i wasnt particularly nervous without the dark to mask them they couldnt sneak up on us nothing to worry about well be all right im going back if you want to go out there she said out there like i was headed for another world if you want you go ahead you win you seen one swamp youve seen them all and i got a plenty good look in the islands shed already started walking i had to trot to catch up she looked relieved its almost lunchtime anyway it was and i still had to find morley and rehearse him for saucerheads return i should thank you ive missed so many meals im lightheaded we went straight to the kitchen we ate the others eyed us curiously everyone knew wed gone for a walk each invested that with his own special significance nobody mentioned it though wayne looked like he had a few words he wanted to say as peters was about to leave i asked where can i catch you later the stable im trying to catch up for snake he didnt look pleased that kind of work wouldnt thrill me either ill be out need to ask you something he nodded and went his way i ingratiated myself by helping cook for a while she didnt say much with jennifer there fumbling around cook never said much with a third party present made me wonder i hoped jennifer wasnt going to attach herself permanently but it did seem that way id just been kind to a stray but pups run to where the kindness is my own fault a sucker as morley says i had to see him soon or adjust my scheme for the afternoon i told cook id be back to help later then headed upstairs hoping morley would be in my suite jennifer tagged along till it was obvious where i was headed then she chickened out afraid of a guy with my reputation i said goodbye and kept a straight face till id let myself in no morley no sign of morley curious it made me uneasy morley is an odd bird but hed make an effort to stay in touch i had a bad moment imagining him dead in some hidden place ambushed not a pleasant thought a friend getting offed for helping with something that wasnt his concern but morley was too much a pro to get taken that way the mistakes he makes arent those kind when he buys it it will be because an irate husband appears unexpectedly while hes in no position to react i took a quick guess at how long it would be till saucerhead returned decided id have to manage without morley black pete would have to carry the load i shrugged into my coat and headed for the stable making sure my telltales were in position i kept an eye out for my blonde sweetheart but the only person i saw was kaid on the fourthfloor balcony west scoping out how to haunt the place after his own death kaid was close to the old man i ought to spend some time with him he might give me a lead on who might want the general out i shoved my head into the stables didnt spot peters a couple of horses grinned at me like they thought their hour had come think what you want i told them plot and plan and scheme ive got an arrangement the general can pay me in horseflesh horses that aggravate me are going to end up at the tannery i dont know why i said that pure bull of course they wouldnt believe it anyway wish i understood why horses bring out the silliness in me peters you here not seeing him right away worried me id had enough guys turn up dead here from the far end it was dark in there i moved warily even assuming peters wasnt one of the villains i found him at the nether end all right hard at it with a pitchfork he grumbled that damned snake must have been playing with his paint set all the time he hadnt cleaned out in months look at this mess i looked i wrinkled my nose peters was tossing manure and soiled straw into a spreader wagon im no expert but isnt this the wrong time of year to spread manure you got me all i know is its got to be cleaned out and thiss the wagon you haul it in he mumbled some rakledly rikkenfratzes and colorful commentary on snake bradons ancestors then added i have enough to do without this whats up garrett and why dont you grab a fork and help while youre resting i grabbed a fork but i wasnt much help i was always lucky even in the marines and never had to learn the practical side of keeping horses whats up is ive found the fence who bought the stolen stuff one of my associates will bring him out this afternoon he stopped pitching he stared long enough to start me wondering if maybe he wasnt less than thrilled he said so you are doing something after all i was starting to think you were a drone that the only effort you were putting out was trying to get jennifer to put out nope not interested not my type i guess there was an edge to my voice he dropped it you just wanted to give me the news no i need your help my associate is bringing a doctor too and you want me to distract the old man while this croaker gets a look at him i want you to go down the road and meet them explain to the doc so he dont get himself booted before he gets a look not that i have any hopes he can tell much without laying hands on peters grunted and started throwing horse hockey when are they coming i tried guessing an optimum turnaround time with saucerhead there wouldnt be many delays hed just grab them by the collar and drag them id think two more hours if we can id like to get the fence in without anybody seeing him so we can spring him on whoever he grunted again youre slacking we tossed he said ill manage ill have to see the old man first always something around here i told him i have hopes for this yeah maybe itll start things unravelling if it goes right we could get it tied up by tonight you always were too optimistic you dont think so i dont youre not dealing with your average idiots these guys arent going to rattle they arent going to panic watch your back i intend to he put his fork down you go ahead im going to go clean up i watched him walk toward the open doorway grinned those ears stuck out like the handles of jugs i tossed about three more forksful and quit mama garrett didnt raise her boy to be a stable hand id gone a dozen steps toward the house when i had a thought i turned back and invited myself into snake bradons den i fiddled around for five minutes getting a lamp going snake wasnt there anymore i wondered what theyd done with him nobody had done any digging in the cemetery damn id meant to ask peters about tyler and the draug i missed the dead mans nagging i just wasnt alert enough getting too turned inward or something not paying close enough attention i didnt do that when i had the dead man to tell me what to do i went down the list by the numbers all right i would id failed to meet snake in time that didnt mean bradon couldnt still tell me something as the dead man would remind me they could all tell me things want to or not if i concentrated so lets start here now garrett i did the things id done when wed found snake i didnt learn anything this time either but i did pay attention to the paintsplashed worktable i hadnt before i hadnt considered that side of snake at all cook said hed had tremendous artistic talent someone else said he might have painted the sorceress invisible black here there thered been remarks to the effect that he remained an active artist that side of the man didnt fit the rest of the bradon image to my mind artists sponge off the lords of the hill however good they are they cant make a living doing what they do i hadnt considered bradon an artist because he hadnt fallen into the groove that table was evidence hed worked plenty but where were the results the table wasnt his product i started a thorough search working outward from the center of snake bradons life i found nothing interesting in his room except squirreled stuff for making paints i recalled that hed been messy when we were checking what had happened to hawkes hed been working on something recently there was a fifteenbytwenty tack room next to snakes hole the place had been torn apart i just stood there surprised somebody was worried about snake after he was gone my my and garrett hadnt been smart enough to get to it first if the searcher found something he did a fine job of getting rid of it there was nothing there now but a scatter of brushes some broken underfoot i wondered if bradons hobby had been a secret one of those kind everybody knows but nobody mentions painting pictures wasnt a manly marine sort of thing to do he might not have shared with the others i was having a little trouble making sense of these people again still i paused to wonder where id have hidden something if id been snake as the searcher probably had knowing him better brilliant thinker that i am i came up with a big nothing nothing for it then a general search every nook and cranny whoever had gone before me wouldnt have had a lot of time hed have to be seen places when he was supposed to be hell maybe hed done his hunting before morley and i came along last night or maybe while he was supposed to be loading manure whatever there was a chance he hadnt found anything if anything existed i did a quick tour of the ground level nothing caught my eye i felt the imminence of the confrontation with the thief and kept getting more hurried somehow hoping to have an extra dart when the showdown came i climbed into the hayloft perched on a bale and muttered what the hell am i looking for anyway paintings hed painted obviously and the product wasnt in evidence but what could paintings tell me if i found them i shrugged got up looked around snake had gotten a damned good hay supply in considering all neatly bailed too from what i recalled the country boys saying back when that wasnt common ordinary folks filled their lofts with loose hay ha a story recalled a guy in the outfit tulsa something hell of an archer did our sniping farm kid poor background died on that island but he used to laugh about games hed played with the daughters of the lord of a nearby manor theyd done it in a secret room theyd built in the hayloft of the lords main barn i raised my lamp high and stared at all that hay too much for the state of the place might that pile be hollow i muttered that has to be it i poked around the outside trying to guess how bradon would have gotten inside elimination left me three good spots to find entrances i set the lamp on a beam and went to work i moved maybe ten bales before i decided id tried the wrong place first i went to the next spot moved another ten bales and felt foolish looked like id outfoxed myself again my activities drew the attention of the natives three ugly cats joined me including an evil old calico me moving the bales got the mice stirring the cats were snacking they worked as a team not something cats usually do as far as i know when id turn a bale one would jump into the vacated spot to scare mice toward the others at one point the calico had one mouse under each forepaw and another in her mouth see i told them im not all bad one more try third time was the charm as they say i tipped a few bales cats flew around and behold a threefoothigh eighteeninchwide hollow black as a priests heart ran back into the pile i got the lamp i asked the cats one of you want to run in there and let me know whats up no i didnt think so i got down on hands and knees and crawled it smelled in there not too bad a smell but a strong one of moldy hay it didnt do my cold any good my nose ran like a fountain there was a room inside the hay larger than id expected snake had spanned it with planks to support the bales on top it was maybe six feet wide and ten feet long his paintings were there along with other treasures mostly what wed consider trivial or trash junk from the war mostly and medals snake had accumulated him a potful of medals proudly displayed on a tattered karentine banner against the narrow end wall i couldnt help feeling for the guy a hero had come to this a life for his country for this and our rulers wonder why glory mooncalled is a folk hero both side walls were lined with paintings none of them framed all just leaning there stacked three and four deep they were every bit as good as cook said they could be better maybe im no expert but they looked like the product of a driven genius they werent cheerful paintings they were the spawn of darkness visions of hell one caught my eye immediately and hit me like a blow in the gut it was a swamp maybe not the swamp that became my home away from home during my stint but a place just as horrible and that painting was no simple brooding landscape faintly touched with the dark side swamp things swarmed there the way they seemed after theyd driven you mad for months mosquitos the size of hornets eyes that watched from the dark stagnant water human bones in the foreground was a hanged man the scavengers had been at him a dark bird perched on his shoulder pecked his face something about the way he hung left you certain hed hanged himself rather than go on a couple of guys in the company had killed themselves when they couldnt take it anymore gods i felt like i could fall into that painting and tumble right back through time i turned it around it got to me that much shaking i went down the row on that side then up the other no other piece had the personal impact that one did but the same genius drove them theyd have as much power for the right viewer he was crazy i murmured i couldnt hear anything well but it seemed the horses below were restless i went around again checking the paintings behind the ones displayed most seemed less maniacal more illustrative yet there was no doubt they portrayed places beheld by the same eye that had interpreted the war in the others one i recognized as a view of full harbor contorted into a hellish dreamscape more proof that snake had put his memories or haunts onto his canvases snake hadnt been just a painter of places the first portrait i encountered was of jennifer id guess at the time the general had come home she was indefinably younger and maybe more beautiful yet interpreted by mad eyes i studied it hard but couldnt figure it out yet snake had done something with jennifer that gave me the creeps there were portraits of the others too kaid looked old and tired and worn out and you got the feeling that death was watching over his shoulder the general had some of the creepiness that illuminated jennifer and something of the fox about him chain looked plain mean wayne looked like a greedy burgher i got it part of it part of the interpretation was how bradon had clothed them that was the crude statement but there were the faces too painted like the man had been able to read the bones and souls beneath there was a later portrait of jennifer crueler than the first but with the lady more beautiful then a couple of guys i hadnt met presumably among the missing then one of dellwood that reminded me of a basset hound i guess snake saying he was a faithful old dog without a soul or mind of his own then one of peters either a failure for the artist or observer i couldnt read anything into it then one of cook that must have been romantic excess because she came off like a saint like a mother to the world then still another of jennifer almost repulsive in its portrayal of the dualities beauty and horror once i got over being startled i examined it more closely part of the effect came at a subconscious level almost i dont know how he did it but hed painted two faces one over the other the outer one of blinding beauty and the other the skull face of death you didnt see that one without staring long and hard the horses were excited downstairs i wondered why but was preoccupied with the magic yeah the sorcery of snake bradons artistry if it was a sin that jennifers beauty should be hidden it was the crime of the century that bradons paintings should go unseen certain to fall victim to mold and moisture before i left jennifer i vowed id find some way to bring the paintings out snake bradon wouldnt go unremembered had he been in love with jennifer she was the only subject hed painted more than once excepting a scene that looked like a before and after of a nonhuman holy place that had had the misfortune to stumble into the middle of a human battle the later painting reeked of defilement by the corpses and ravens and bones it felt like a parable of the world i blew my nose hit the motherlode before it watered up again i caught a whiff of a new odor what i shrugged and went on damn ah damn my eyes that was no curse friends that was a squeal of triumph snake had painted my lady in white he had caught her as the incarnation of beauty yet she too had some of the creepiness hed put into his portraits of jennifer she was in a wind running frightened a darkness lay behind her you knew it was in pursuit yet you could not define what it was the harder you looked the harder it was to tell it was there the woman looked right into your eyes the artists eyes her right hand was just starting the motion of reaching out for help her eyes said she knew the person she was looking at knew what was behind her it transfixed me it had the impact of the swamp painting and this time i couldnt figure out why because this one couldnt be explained in terms of my own past i blew my nose again i got another whiff of that odor this time i recognized it smoke the damned stable was on fire no wonder the horses were excited i scrambled out of there to the edge of the loft flames roared at the end where peters had been working the animals had gotten out and run i heard shouting outside the heat was savage i wasnt trapped yet if i moved fast i could get clear i knew the mileage morley would get out of the gesture as i dove into the hole leading to snakes cache hed be on me for a year risking my life over some daubs on canvas i slapped a dozen of those daubhickeys into a pile as big as i could manage and dragged them out the fire was spreading fast flames were almost to me when i burst out the heat beat at me i felt my eyebrows curl my eyes dry out i staggered away the flames came after me damned fool i muttered to myself the heat seared the back of my neck now my eyes watered nearly blinding me my chances were slim enough without the damned paintings i couldnt let them go they were that important they were worth risking a life part of me already mourned those id had to leave behind the fire had spread below faster than it had up top it was ahead of me now at the end where snake had lived i wasnt going to get out that way i could see daylight through cracks between the vertical boards that formed the outside wail roughcut timber that had shrunk with the years till some of the gaps were half an inch wide it was like looking through the bars at the gates of hell from the inside that close and so far as panic closed in i threw myself that way the stable was old and damned near falling down and if it was half as rotten as it looked i might be able to bust out i hit the wall with my shoulder low both creaked neither broke but i figured the wall had the edge i got down on my back and shot my feet out one board gave an inch that gave me hope and maybe some manic strength i let fly again an eightinchwide board tilted outward then fell away under its own weight mad as i was i flipped bradons paintings out before trying to make the hole wide enough for me the smoke almost overcame me first but i made it i jumped i lay around panting a while vaguely aware that i was out there alone away from the hollering on the other side of the barn i climbed a fencepost and got myself upright looked around counted limbs to make sure i hadnt left any behind i was still alone i gathered my priceless salvage if there are gods they agreed with me about those paintings they hadnt been damaged i got them together limped over to the cow barn hid them in the hayloft my fuddled sense of humor told me that was appropriate then i stumbled back around the far side of the stable the whole gang was running around like chickens doing the hopeless bringing buckets of water from the wellhouse only the general and peters were absent garrett jennifer squealed what happened im such a handsome devil they just go to pieces when they see me i was taking a nap in there i lied she got a little pale i gave her my heroic grin not to worry i just busted through a wall and here i am a coughing jag hit me great timing damned smoke cant stop the true of heart you couldve been killed i could have but i wasnt too light on my feet kaid said somebody tried to kill you boy as he staggered past with a fivegallon bucket i looked at the growing inferno that hadnt occurred to me though it should have no you dont kill somebody by setting a barn on fire too easy for him to get away maybe you start a fire to flush him out but that wouldnt have worked here too many witnesses even in my fuzzy state it was obvious the arsonist had wanted to get rid of the stable and whatever contents hed been unable to find during a hasty search wonderful snakes information had escaped me again even cook was out lugging water but no peters i worked up a case of the suspicions before i recalled why he wasnt around hell saucerhead was overdue i said you guys are wasting your time just keep it from jumping to the other buildings what the hell you think were doing dipshit chain growled if youre not going to help get the hell out of the way which was just the advice i needed im going inside to treat these burns i had a few but didnt know how bad they were not too bad i hoped i didnt need them distracting me the cold was bad enough i stumbled away the others didnt pay any attention i walked straight through to the front of the house past the dueling champions and all the dead stantnors id been in that stable longer than id thought saucerhead was way overdue unless id guessed badly about how long it would take to recruit a doctor and jump a couple of fences through hoops i stepped out the front door my burns not bad made their presence felt i hoped that doctor would have something for the sting nothing in sight saucerhead whats holding you up how long does it take to twist a guys arm a few raindrops hit the steps leading to the porch i glanced at the sky old slabs of lead again i wondered if the stantnor place ever had any other kind it was getting to me the wind was rising that wouldnt do the firefighters any good maybe their best hope was that the rain wouldnt play around it did become a steady fall not quite a downpour but it should help i guess that took fifteen minutes to develop the wind started gusting throwing water onto the porch i started to retreat a coach came out of the rain that damned saucerhead now it was a hired coach it pulled up people tumbled out peters galloped up the steps followed by a tall distinguished character whom i presumed to be the doctor a weasely little character followed him then saucerhead and morley dotes i asked morley where the hell you been i been trying to find you all morning he gave me a funny look home taking care of business saucerhead interrupted lets do it garret this here is doc stones he indicated the weasely guy which goes to show you what its worth judging by appearances hell get an arm and leg off you for this thats your fence there we got an agreement no names fine with me as long as he points a finger peters lets get upstairs peters wore a puzzled look whats happening somebody tried to burn the stable down with me inside lets go doc you got anything to take the sting out of burns we moved inside as i asked saucerhead asked me you want to give him the other arm and leg what took you so damned long anyway peters led the way headed for the stairs morley he fooled around finding a doc he thought would look like a fences partner that made sense yeah i guess i can appreciate that morley i thought you were going to prowl around the house do the stuff i dont have time to do because ive got to be on stage all the time he looked at me funny again like i was maybe talking too much so did peters dotes said i did what i could garrett but i have a business to run and not a whole lot of time to spend working on the cuff but i heard you come in and go out a couple times he stopped i roamed around an hour after you hit the sack didnt find squat decided i better get back and see if wedge had robbed me while my back was turned i didnt go back to your room i shuddered the old cold rats pranced up and down my back you didnt no oh my but id swear i even saw you once it wasnt me i was sure id gotten up to use the chamberpot id even grumbled a hello and gotten something growled in return i told him that it wasnt me garrett i went home dotes said it in a flat disturbed voice ill take your word for it my voice was just as flat so who was it shapechanger id run into one of those before i didnt want to do that again how changers have to kill the people they mimic then they absorb their souls or whatever and even then they cant always fool people who knew them yes and this one had me pat i was pretty damned tired there was only one lamp burning and i just walked through not paying that much attention but id have sworn it was you i dont like this it makes me nervous garrett real nervous me too yeah boy all we needed was some villain prancing around able to pretend he was somebody else that would complicate things real good morley was just concerned about morley dotes not everything else he had troubles enough in life without having somebody else running around doing dirty deeds in his name and face i had a broader perspective on it if somebody here could fake morley he could fake me or anybody else any time so none of us could ever be sure who we were dealing with which undermined the roots of reality some fun coming up morley suggested youd better get out while you still can i was tempted tempted like ive never been tempted before but i cant i took the job if i quit because its getting tough it wont be that long before i find some good reason to drop another one that happens a couple times and i wont get work at all he politely refrained from mentioning the fact that i spend most of my energy avoiding work figured youd say something like that so lets get on with it i want out of here even if you dont he started up the final flight of stairs you drink much milk garrett no beer i sort of figured why the others watched us like we were a road show not sure what it is about milk but its good for the teeth and bones and brain a man who drinks milk always has a healthy sense of selfpreservation beer guzzlers get increasingly feeble in that area he was dressing up a cautionary message as one of his crackpot dietary theories that way it was easier to tell me he was afraid i was in way over my head peters said i dont know what youre talking about garrett i dont much care but i do think we ought to get on with it he stared at the glass at the rear of the house the glow from the burning stable shone through he looked like he wanted to rush off and get involved right go get the old man set i stared at the firelight while the rest moved toward the generals suite garrett coming i caught a glimpse of the blonde across the way behind a pillar she smiled and looked like she might wave back if i started it i growled and headed down the hall her portrait was one id saved from the flames id bring it in and ask some questions and i was by damn going to get some answers i was getting tired of being nice peters moved on into the deeps of the old mans suite the rest of us waited in the study i killed time by tossing logs on the fire and exchanging puzzled glances with morley each of us wondered how much the other was pulling his leg the general arrived bundled as though for an expedition to the arctic he looked at the fire at me stirring it around so i could get a few more logs on beamed approval thank you mr garrett thoughtful of you he surveyed the crowd who are these people mr morley dotes restaurateur and an associate of mine morley gave him a nod indeed the old man seemed startled like maybe he knew the name he looked at me hard reconsidering his estimate of me i said youve met mr tharpe the other gentlemen prefer to remain anonymous but theyve agreed to point out your thief oh a hollow sound that faced by the imminence he wasnt that anxious to know i recalled his instructions dont let him evade the truth he asked where are the others i told peters to get them he didnt move till the general agreed i said theyre out trying to contain a fire somebody set in the stable a fire arson he was confused the doc and morley studied him intently yes sir near as i can figure whoever killed bradon was afraid something in the stable could connect him with the murder the place had been searched whoever did it probably thought he didnt have time to do it right so he took second best oh again that hollow sound i walked over to the door peeked out nothing out there saucerhead want to warn us when the mob comes he grunted came over i whispered did you rehearse those two he grunted again he didnt have time to explain i had to trust his judgment general shall i take the position i did last time mr tharpe and mr dotes can hold the door i suppose i suppose as the fire grew and threw more light i saw that his color was as bad as it had been the other day i took my place a few minutes later saucerhead announced people coming let them in but dont let them back out check the doctor retreated into a corner so did the fence morley moved to the side of the door opposite saucerhead they came in looking tired and wary and dispirited they looked at morley and saucerhead like they all thought theyd been caught doing something even peters and he knew what was happening the general said mr garrett has some news mr garrett looked at the fence so did mr tharpe glowering like the man wouldnt get out of the house alive if he didnt point a finger he didnt have to the bad boy gave himself away i said somebodys been stealing doodads from around here about twenty thousand marks worth the general wanted to know who now we know that dellwood im curious why he took it pretty well maybe hed figured that being found out was inevitable to meet household expenses there was no other way to raise the money the general sputtered through a bad case of not wanting to face the truth he ranted his people kept blank faces but i got the feeling their sympathies didnt lie with their employer for one second i entertained the possibility that they all wanted to do him in dellwood persisted the general provides funds suitable for maintaining a household of ten at the time he left for the cantard he wont believe that prices have risen since then not one copper has gone into my pocket not one has been spent needlessly our suppliers refused to extend further credit must be hell to be rich and broke the general managed you might have told me instead of subjecting me to this humiliation i told you repeatedly sir for two years i told you you had your eyes firmly fixed on the past you refused to believe that times have changed i had the choice of doing what i did or allowing you to be hounded by creditors i chose to shield you ill collect my things now he turned to the door saucerhead and morley blocked his way i asked general the old man didnt say anything for what its worth sir i believe hes telling the truth are you calling me a miser i said nothing of the sort but you do have that reputation i was piqued ive never gone out of my way to cuddle up to a client of the male persuasion anyway he sputtered some more then he had one of his fits for a moment i thought it was a ploy the others did too maybe hed cried wolf a few times everybody just looked till it was over then they all moved in tripping over each other i gave saucerhead the signal to turn the fence loose dellwood led the charge nobody hung back which did not bode well for my hope that breaking one of the cases within the case would start everything unravelling back off i told them give him some air he was past the worst saucerhead let dellwood go too dellwood managed his exit with considerable dignity i reflected on the fact that my pay and saucerheads and everyone elses was likely being financed by his efforts i glanced at cook shed told me the old man didnt have a pot to pee in here he was living on his principal without even realizing it was some other helpful soul trying to salvage the estate by hurrying an incompetent tightwad manager to his reward the general got himself under control i shant thank you for what youve done mr garrett though i asked for it dellwood wheres dellwood hes gone sir get him back he cant leave whatll i do without him i have no thoughts on the subject general i think weve accomplished all we can here good yes youre right leave me but get dellwood back here everybody out peters youd better stay kaid morley saucerhead i want to talk to you i scooted out first i caught dellwood in his quarters he hadnt bothered to close his door he was stuffing things into bags come to make sure i dont take the family jewels i came to tell you the old man wants you to stay ive spent most of my life attending his wants enough is enough itll be a relief being my own man he lied a mans loyalty will only stretch so far youre upset you did what you had to do and it brought you trouble nobody holds it against you not even me bull hell hold it against me the rest of his life thats the kind of man he is whatever my reasons i rubbed his nose in something he doesnt forgive no matter who was right but i know him give me credit for that i did you walk you lose everything the bequest never meant much to me im not poor mr garrett i had few expenses while i was in service i saved my money and i invested it well i dont need his bequest to survive your choice i didnt move he stopped throwing things into bags and looked at me what the general didnt just hire me to find out who was kyping the family trophies he also wanted me to find out whos trying to kill him he sneered kill him nobodys trying to kill him thats just his imagination at work so was theft when i arrived except to you he was right about that and i think hes right about this bull whod profit good question i dont think the estate has anything to do with it i cant supply another motive though yet i looked at him expectantly he didnt say anything any friction with anybody any time ever i cant give you what you want mr garrett weve all had our troubles with the general none of them the kind you kill over matters of discipline thats all none of these people are inclined to hold grudges chain hes a big stupid farm boy gone to fat at the hips and between the ears he can hold a grudge forever but hes never had one against the general if youll excuse me sir not yet youve known this moment was coming since i got here havent you i wasnt surprised you found me out i was startled that you found the man who bought from me will that be all no who killed hawkes and snake i wouldnt know i expect youll find out youre a firstclass finderouter its what i do you didnt perchance try to discourage me when you decided i could cause you trouble did you sir there have been three attempts on my life since i arrived i wondered if youd thought you could cover your tracks thats not my way i made it through a marine career without killing anyone i have no intention of starting now i told you i have nothing to lose here maybe and maybe he was just a convincing liar i shrugged for what its worth i dont think you did wrong and i dont feel that proud of rooting you out i bear you no ill will you were only the agency by which the inevitable arrived but i would like to get on the road before dark you wont reconsider i dont think the old man will last without you kaid can handle him he shouldve been all along anyway do you know who the blonde woman is he had nothing to lose by telling me now a figment of your imagination i suspect theres no blonde woman here no one but you has seen her bradon did he painted her portrait that stopped him cold he did he did he believed me he didnt get much push behind his snake was crazy i was pretty sure he knew nothing about any blonde which made her that much more interesting an enigma i moved out of the doorway indicating he was free to go i said you cant tell me anything that might keep somebody else from getting killed no id tell you if i could he picked up his bags i suggested catch a ride with my associates when they go he wanted to tell me to go to hell he didnt thank you it was raining and those bags were heavy i asked one more thing what happened to tyler and the draug from out front ask peters i dont know my duties confined me to the house the draug that tried to get in the back isnt accounted for it didnt go back to the swamp where could it hide out during the day assuming like story draugs that it didnt dare hazard daylight in the outbuildings i really must go mr garrett all right thanks for talking to me he headed out back stickstraight unapologetic hed done what had to be done he wasnt ashamed he wasnt going to be talked out of leaving either another one down i reflected now there were six heirs the cut for the minority people was up near a half million apiece morley saucerhead and the doctor awaited me beside the fountain i didnt approach in any hurry i was trying to figure out how to launch a draug hunt cook came out as dellwood headed for the front door they went into the entry hall arguing she didnt want him to go either i joined morley and the others whats the verdict morley shrugged he didnt shake enough or have trouble enough talking for it to be what i thought he show any of those symptoms earlier some shaking no real trouble talking what about the fit i dont know ask the doc i did he said i dont quite know i shouldve had a closer look and a chance to interview the patient but from where i stood it looked like you need an exorcist more than a doctor a what morley was as startled as i was id never seen his eyes bug before the remark had caught him from the blind side an exorcist a demonologist maybe a necromancer possibly all three though the first step should be a physical exam to make sure im not imagining things start over youve got me all turned around between us mr dotes and i have a comprehensive knowledge of poisons we know of none that produce the combination of symptoms the man shows not without affecting him more dramatically physically leaving him unable to control his speech and extremities if he stayed alive at all disease is more probable than poison who knows what he brought home i spent eight years down there i saw a lot of strange diseases though nothing quite like this is he taking any medication are you kidding hed die first i had a thought how about malaria id been one lucky marine id never contracted malaria or some kind of yellow fever i thought of that a virulent strain of malaria with massive quinine treatments might produce most of the symptoms he shows tainted medication might account for the rest but you said hed die before accepting medication i really must know his medical history before i hazard a guess why that business about an exorcist my chief suspicion lies in the supernatural realm several varieties of malign spirit could produce the symptoms we see my advice would be to examine his past you might find something there to explain whats happening you might also look for an origin in unfriendly witchcraft an enemy may have sent a spirit against him black pete showed up in time to catch most of the discussion i asked you make anything of that the general have enemies whod off him that way he shook his head the answer is here garrett im sure he doesnt have enemies whod want to kill him the worst ones he does have are the kind whod send somebody like your friend he twitched a hand toward morley theres no sorcerer around here unless you count bradon whos gone doctor could an amateur necromancer have sicked something on him say accidentally that would stick after the spiritmaster died an amateur i doubt it somebody really potent maybe if they stuck around themselves as a ghost hatred is the usual force animating spirits that devour a man from within and i mean hatred strong enough to bend the laws of nature hatred that wants its object to suffer for all eternity but im no expert which is why i suggested a demonologist an exorcist a necromancer you must discover the nature of the spirit then banish it or raise it up find out what animates its hatred and appease it peters said this is crazy garrett the general never made that kind of enemy were talking possibilities the doc says the whole thing could be physical he needs to do a handson physical exam and he needs a detailed medical history whatre the chances he looked at me at the doctor glanced at morley and saucerhead better than you think his voice turned hard the old bastard can only threaten so much we dont have to give him a choice ill be back in five minutes he strode toward the kitchen morley settled on the fountain surround in the shadow of the dragons wing now what lets wait hell talk to cook if she goes along youll get to look at stantnor cook might not be mother to the world but she was queen of the stantnor household doctor can you suggest any experts who might help lets see if we get to examine the patient if i find no physical cause ill provide referrals they wont come cheaply though does anybody but me morley had a big yuk this is the man who paid cash for a house with the take from one case and for every one of those i have fifty where i give saucerhead half my fee to get them to pay up you know anything about the art world thats a change of subject i know something about everything i need to what do you need say i discovered an unknown painter genius whose work deserves display who would i see to get things moving he shrugged grinned got me now if you had some hot old masters i could help i know people who know morally flexible collectors if you have something like youre talking about you should see your friend with the brewery weider hes got fingers in all the cultural pies honorary director of this and that he has the contacts you dont have some old masters do you he glanced around im sure hed been inventorying potential plunder you wont find anything here but portraits of old guys with whiskers who scowl a lot all painted by people you never heard of i noticed the welcoming committee i wondered how long it takes the stantnors to train their young not to smile might be hereditary ive never seen jennifer do more than fake it your buddys coming peters was coming from the kitchen under a full spread of sail i knew what hed say before he said it he said it anyway we dont give the old man a vote hell cut you out of his will ask me if i give a damn lets go but he hung back gave me a look that said he wanted a private word i let the others move upstairs a flight what that crack about the will in all the excitement i plain forgot to tell you before the copy the general burned wasnt the only one he always made two of every document sometimes three oh interesting that meant nothing had changed if the killer knew how many are there one for sure he gave it to me to give to you like you asked i put it in my quarters then got distracted till i was talking to cook and she said the same thing you did about getting cut out it wasnt that important to you no i did you a favor then forgot to carry through till it hit me what that copy could mean it could mean the killer wont back off if he knows about it who knows dellwood and kaid they were there and everybody else knows the general made copies of documents whered you put it give me your key ill grab it now you go ahead and get after the old man he gave me a nasty look i knew what he was thinking i wanted to toss his quarters i told him i dont think youve got anything to hide youre a bastard garrett put me in a spot where im damned whatever i do you do have something to hide he glared no then get it yourself ill take your word i recalled the fire for which he could have been responsible i hung in there taking a chance on my guts but hurry he gave me the key in the drawer of my writing table cook came rumbling up the stair shuddering to her tread we going to do this she demanded or we going to gossip smart woman cook the old man couldnt dismiss her if she went in and sat on him all he could do was cuss and take it thanks i told her she gave me half a sneer what for hes my baby aint he yeah i watched them hurry to overtake the others the general would be in the worst tactical position of his life he couldnt do anything to morley saucerhead the doc or cook and hed be damned stupid if he did anything about peters if he ran black pete off hed be damned near out of help he had to think survival in more than personal terms he had to think about keeping the estate in shape i suspected its value was dropping fast i fingered peterss key glanced around i had the feeling i was being watched but i saw nobody my blonde again i thought i wondered where the others were at work presumably a vampirous spirit eh on top of draugs what a lovely place to live something wasnt right black petes door wasnt locked he wasnt the sloppy type it worked before so i grabbed a shield and stormed inside and didnt find anything this time either the damned place was haunted by practical jokers i tossed the shield against the doorframe put up my headknocker went to the writing table the room was a mirror image of my sitting room i sat down at an identical table i guess i heard a sole scuff the carpet i started to turn to duck thats all i did started something hit me like a monument falling i saw shooting stars i think i howled i lurched forward my face met the tabletop it wasnt a friendly meeting its pretty hard to knock somebody out you either dont hit hard enough in which case your victim gets after you or you hit him too hard and he croaks if you have any idea what youre doing you dont bash him up top the head unless you want to smash his skull this blow was aimed at my skull i moved that much it hit the side of my neck and bounced off my shoulder it didnt put me out not more than ninetynine percent it paralyzed me for half a minute i was vaguely aware of a shape in motion then the lights went out got to stay away from the hard stuff i thought as i came around getting too old for it the hangover isnt worth it i thought i was slumped over my desk at home the truth dawned as i tried to get up i saw unfamiliar surroundings my head spun i fell banged my jaw off the edge of the table curled up on the floor and dumped cooks lunch when i tried to move the heaves started again sometime during the fun somebody ran past headed for the door all i saw was a flash of brown i didnt much care concussion i thought that scared me id seen guys with their brains scrambled after getting hit on the head id seen them paralyzed id seen them go to sleep and never wake up got to stay awake garrett got to stay awake thats what the docs say get up garrett to hell with the heaves take charge garrett make the flesh obey the will trouble was there wasnt much will left after a while i got my knees under me and crawled to the door i fell down a few times during the trek but the exercise did me good i arrived so chipper i was afraid i wasnt going to die i worked up so much ambition that i swung the door open and moved out a yard before i collapsed and passed out again gentle delicate fingers slid lightly over my face feeling my features the way a blind woman once did id turned over somehow i cracked one eyelid a millionth of an inch my sweetheart in white had come to succor me at least she looked concerned her lips moved but i didnt hear anything panic id heard of guys whod lost their hearing too she jumped away not that she needed to i was in no shape to run down a brigand snail more black petes door had closed on my legs i was caught like a mouse i managed a feeble dont go please the investigative mind was at work it wanted to know she came back she settled onto her knees resumed massaging my head are you badly hurt her voice was the ghost of a whisper she sounded concerned she looked concerned only in my heart you keep running away we investigator types are tough we keep our eye on the prime objective youre the loveliest woman ive ever seen that put a light in her eyes strange how women like to be told theyre pretty strange like a rock falling when you drop it she even smiled for a hundredth of a second who are you i thought about telling her i loved her but that seemed premature id give it ten more minutes she didnt tell me she just massaged my forehead and temples and sang something so softly i couldnt make out the words who was i to question the will of the gods i closed my eyes and let it happen the song got a little louder a lullaby a hushmylove kind of thing fine by me the hell with business this was the life something brushed my lips light as falling eiderdown warm i cracked my eye she was an inch away smiling yeah then everything drained out of her face she jumped up and fled bam before i overcame inertia and turned my head she was gone feet pounded up the hallway businesslike then hurriedly garrett what happened peters dropped to his knees he wasnt nearly as attractive as his predecessor i managed to croak somebody in your room bopped me on my bean he jumped up and shoved inside i had smarts enough left to drag my legs out before the door closed thats all i did seemed like a good days work peters bounded out they tore the place apart he had something in his hand heres the will what else could they have been after probably was that he scowled at me did you have to puke all over yeah a mans got to do what a mans got to do why didnt he get it if thats what he wanted i fell over the desk he couldnt get at it without moving me and maybe having me wake up lit out when i did start coming to who could have heard us talking couldnt have been cook or kaid they were upstairs with the old man waynes out burying snake hawkes and tyler i let him help me into a sitting position where were they in the wellhouse its cooler in there what difference does that make that leaves chain doesnt it or dellwood if he doubled back chains supposed to be out keeping an eye on whats left of the fire and trying to salvage something from the stable wasnt any ghost and it wasnt a draug did we find the third draug nobodys had time to look hell find us then i lifted a hand he helped me up between him and the wall they managed to keep me upright what was the verdict on the old man my head hurt so much i no longer felt my burns the old silver lining they were looking for you to tell you you tell me he fired me and kaid too we told him to go to hell were not going anywhere i guess you arent going to tell me i dont want to say it not something thats easy to believe that told me enough but i let him help me downstairs to the fountain where i perched on the fountain surround and tried to work out which way was up till morley and the others showed i said i take it that im shopping for a demonologist dont look at me like that morley said i didnt do it you look spooked spooks spook me garrett even a vampire or a werewolf i can do something about i cant get ahold of a spook yeah he didnt want to believe we had a haunt here i wasnt quite ready to buy it it would be easier to swallow without a legacy at stake it wouldnt be the first fake ghost used to cover a little bloodletting it sure wasnt any spook who offed hawkes and bradon no spook tried to trap me ax me burn me knock a hole in my head everybody stood around looking at me like i was in charge so i said my heads killing me and morley you want to stay over tonight give me a hand i was afraid youd ask just his sweetnatured way of saying yes cash money i promised how are you going to get cash when that old man doesnt have any i didnt tell him id grabbed it off going in though the expenses had about devoured their allowance ill figure something howd he take it he wasnt pleased to put it mildly i looked at the doctor you couldnt find a physical cause oh please please the weasel shook his head not saying it isnt something i dont recognize or a combination but bring in a demonologist hell ill send one eliminate the mysterious first if theres no supernatural cause send for me be an interesting challenge morley grinned slyly you two work it right you could have careers here him trying to root out an unknown disease and you trying to find a killer whos smarter than you are i grumbled my parts easy i just stay alive till theres only one suspect left my head was killing me that didnt do wonders for my temper doc you got something for a headache what happened i told him he insisted on examining me and offering the usual advice about concussions maybe he wasnt a pure thief i have a low opinion of professionals notably doctors and lawyers supported by experience he gave me a dose of the old standby syrup heavily laced with nastytasting stuff boiled out of the inner bark of willow branches with that perking in my stomach i decided to get on with getting on peters itll be suppertime soon these guys might be hungry square it with cook if they want to eat im going to drop in on the general peters grunted asked if anybody wanted supper saucerhead and the doctor were all for that and morley was staying anyway as i climbed the stairs i recalled that id told dellwood he should ride into town in the coach was he out there waiting freezing with the coachman it was still raining i felt for wayne and chain too though chain not so much i had him all i needed to do was push him into a box and put a bow on him throw him out stantnor rasped at kaid when i invited myself in kaid eyed me i dont believe hell let me sir he said it with a straight face there was a twinkle in his eye he turned to the fire to hide a smile i asked did you hear the diagnosis general mr garrett i didnt employ you to interfere in my life i employed you to find a thief and a killer and a wouldbe killer who wants your scalp and that implies that part of the job is to keep you alive and to do that i need to know how theyre trying to kill you the assumption was poison the assumption was wrong he appeared surprised maybe they hadnt told him maybe hed become so obnoxious theyd just walked mr dotes is an expert on poisons likewise the doctor whos also an expert on tropical diseases could it hurt to exaggerate they say youre not being poisoned unless its a poison so exotic theyve never heard of it and youre not suffering from any known disease though the doctor says youre anemic and jaundiced have you had malaria general i think he was secretly touched that people cared enough to look out for him in spite of himself yes hard to avoid it in the islands bad no you taking quinine on the sly the doctor says impure quinine might explain some of your problems no i wont he suffered one of his spasms was it his heart it was a minor one hed begun to recover before kaid reached him he croaked no mr garrett no medication id refuse if it was offered i thought so but i had to make sure before i tell you what they think which is he was coming back fast youre haunted eh that blindsided him he looked at kaid kaid just looked baffled your problem is supernatural your enemy is a ghost or somebody who can send a spirit against you peters says you dont have that kind of enemies the doctor says look at your past for somebody i wouldnt have believed it possible but his color worsened dramatically he damned near turned gray there was something some dark past moment unknown to anyone else so dreadful someone might reach out from the grave to restore the balance hell a place like the stantnor shack wouldnt be complete without a horror in its past without a curse wed better talk about it i said well have to hire experts i gave kaid a meaningful look the old man wouldnt want to confess ancient evils in front of a crowd a demonologist an exorcist possibly a medium or necromancer to communicate with the spirit kaid was as thick as a brick he didnt move the general said nothing till he was sure hed say only what he wanted to be heard and that was get out garrett when youre ready to talk then get out leave me alone hell get out of my house get out of my life he had another fit this was a big one kaid yelled get that doctor up here his expression lacked any forgiveness for having gotten the old man so excited strange people every one i joined cook in the kitchen we were alone can you use a hand come to try sweettalking me out of something eh i see right through you boy you ought to know by now i dont run my mouth i dont tell nobody nothing that aint none of their business of course i rolled up my sleeves eyed the heap of dirty stuff distastefully not much i hate more than washing dishes but i stole a pot of hot water off the stove prepared a sink put more water on to heat dug in ten minutes of silence passed i waited till i felt her curiosity becoming palpable you were up there when they looked at the general what did you think i think that croaker is as crooked as the general says she didnt sound convinced she sounded worried know what he thinks is wrong i know what he said hes crazy if he believes it aint no haunts around here three draugs she grunted there lay the core of her doubt if those draugs hadnt come she wouldnt have given the doctors idea a glance people keep telling me the general doesnt have enemies of the killing kind and theres no incentive here for anyone to hurry him along despite the size of the estate whatll be left after he lets it wither i swear his damnfool sickness has infected the whole place her voice was weak she wasnt the woman shed been things were going on inside her head she had no attention to spare if nobody from today wants to kill him to torment him with slow death and the hell between when he passes who in his past might my gut feeling is it goes back to before his move to the cantard she grunted and threw utensils around and didnt say anything what happened the only trauma i know of is his wifes death could that have something to do with it her parents jennifer says she thinks they were a firelord and stormwarden but she doesnt know who is this a legacy from them a delayed curse she still didnt have squat to say were they involved in the blue cabal that went after kenrick iii you put a lot together out of nothing boy thats what i do i get paid for it i think the grandparents were involved i think jennifers mother came here partly to hide from reprisals if the plot failed lucky her it did and kenrick devoured everyone remotely related to it i wonder if the doctor who administered an incorrect drug was on the royal payroll maybe jennifer survived only because he couldnt murder a newborn you do put it together i kept quiet hoping shed fill the vacuum i washed set stuff out to dry there was enough work for me to make me a new career when i got tired of the old one i was tempted the missuss mother called herself charon light her daddy was nightmare blue one funloving guy nightmare blue had put the blue plot together hed been as meanspirited and vicious as they came the story was that only the threatened defection of key conspirators forced him to confine his scheme to the king hed wanted to scrub kenricks whole house the bad blood between the men stemmed from a mysterious childhood incident charon light supposedly was as innocent as a wife could be shed apparently been ignorant of the plot till the last hours there was reason to suspect shed been responsible for its failure in the penultimate moment warning the king well never know unless someone raises the dead to ask none of those people survived i doubt anybody would try raising a sorcerer is a fools game unless youre a more powerful sorcerer eleanors mother brought her here to hide her cook grunted having second thoughts about talking she kept her peace for a few minutes i got more hot water her mother brought her in the middle of the night it was a devils own night thunder and lightning and the wind howling like all the lost souls she was some distant relative of the stantnors was charon light dont recall her born name something fen she brought the child in so frightened she wet herself as bad as jennifer she was never been out of her own house before such a pretty young thing too like jennifer she was more retiring than jenny jenny can work herself up shes an actress our jenny she puts on a role like a dress that child not young mistress eleanor scared of her own shadow that one i grunted this time the old general and charon light they worked it out right here in this kitchen i was here serving tea theyd marry the child to young will in name only so shed be safe this was only a couple days before the storm broke kenrick couldnt do nothing to upset the old general he was the only rock between karenta and defeat in the cantard in those days the war hadnt meant much to me back then my father had been dead for years killed down there and i wasnt old enough to worry about going but i did recall that at about that time karentas fortunes had been at low ebb and thered been talk about the elder stantnor being the only man who could handle the venageti of the day you want the benefit of my suspicion i think charon light was going to deal going to sell the plot for immunity i dont know if thats how she went she didnt survive i told her im starting to get confused i thought jennifer was born about then and she had an older brother half brother his mother was the generals first wife haveto wedding when he was sixteen daughter of a serving woman but you dont need to know that i need to know everything if im going to make sense of whats happening hidden things kill what happened to the first wife they stayed married till the boy was old enough for tutors and nannies then he put her aside the old general sent the family away hard feelings involved plenty but the old general bought them off he reminded young will every day especially if he spent a night out wenching a terror he was when he was a lad obsessed you might say she didnt sound like shed thought him an amusing rake he didnt sound like somebody id have liked for fifteen minutes i tried to get her to tell me more i got only enough to guess the young stantnor was a crude ass a driven philanderer whose life had gained direction and meaning only after his permanent move to the cantard so he wasnt a nice guy who from those days hated him enough to no there was no equivocation there thats life garrett the hurt dont hang on everybody does stupid things when theyre young some dont ever stop everybody grows out of them you dont laugh at them when you look back but you dont take a killing grudge to your grave neither i dont know the stantnors seemed pretty skewed if that extended to their circle someone in contact might hold a grudge over something normal people would call bad luck then you tell me whos haunting him she stopped working looked at me shed remembered something she hadnt thought about in years for a moment she teetered on the brink of telling me then she shook her head her face closed down no it wasnt that way what wasnt nothing some cruel gossip nothing to do with us today youd better tell me it might have some bearing i dont repeat no lies about no one wouldnt have nothing to do with this nohow i got my third pot of hot water i was tearing them up i bet she hadnt seen so many clean dishes in years im good for something cant keep people from killing each other but im a wiz at washing dishes might be time to consider a career change after a while she said what goes around comes around he sure fell for missus eleanor she was his goddess we all want what were not supposed to have i tried an encouraging grunt when that didnt get any response i tried a direct question she said i think i done talked too much already i think i done said things i shouldnt have said to no outsider i doubted that i thought shed weighed every word and had told me exactly what she wanted me to know shed give me another ration when she thought i was ready i hope you know what youre doing id bet therere things in your head that could save lives maybe i pressed a touch too hard there she didnt have to be told what she already knew she resented it she gave me a dirty look and clammed up till dinnertime then she only growled and gave orders after supper having finally gotten the doctor and saucerhead off morley and i headed for my suite as we climbed the stairs i said i guess old dellwood got tired of waiting hed abandoned the coach hours earlier according to the coachman who wasnt pleased with his own lot it hadnt occurred to anyone to ask him in out of the cold morley belched that woman tried to poison me that mess wasnt fit to feed a hog i chuckled hed made only one oblique negative comment and had gotten invited to cook his own meals his presence didnt thrill the natives his charm stoked to a white heat had been wasted on jennifer his feelings were hurt he wasnt used to being looked at like something from the underside of a rock they didnt know who and what he was only that he was somebody who had invaded their weird little world me im not such a sensitive guy a lovely bunch garrett truly lovely the girl should work at an icehouse where do you find these people they find me people who arent troubled dont need me he grunted there was a lot of that going around i understand that i suspect his clients are weirder than mine but he doesnt have to deal with them on an extended basis i checked the telltales at the door thered been no sloppy visitors we stepped inside i said im going to take a nap i had a hard night last night dont turn into a spook again he gave me a sour grin not this time he started unwinding a piece of cord hed scrounged up while i was helping cook clear supper dishes whats that for to measure with you say somebodys getting in and out without using the door theres got to be a way he measured off a foot of cord tied a knot folded the cord tied another knot not a perfect ruler but it would do i was going to do that myself when i got time you never get time for detail work garrett youre too busy bulling around trying to make things happen what do you expect tonight id hinted that we could expect some excitement i figure that one draug will come back what else who knows getting so i think anything can happen here while youre fiddling around think of a way to get chain to give himself away the fat guy with the garbage mouth thats him he the baddie hes the only one i can line up who had opportunity with hawkes and bradon and the attempts on me turn you into bait catch him in the act thanks a bunch hes screwed it up three times already maybe four how many shots should i give him take your nap youre safe morleys here thats not the comfort you think it should be i went into the bedroom shucked my clothes and slithered in between the sheets there was something sinful about being naked in such comfort for about thirty seconds i listened to morley putter measuring and talking to himself while rain tippytapped on the windows then the lights went out the lights never came on not quite but there were fires to light the night well there was the threat of fire anyway i woke up no longer alone my blonde friend was back checking my head touching my face all that this time she didnt move fast enough but she was leaning way over off balance and i didnt think before i grabbed i got her wrist and gave her a comehither tug she fell on top of me it was dark shed have been invisible if shed been a brunette wearing dark clothing still from four inches her face was visible she wore a sort of smile like she wanted to look kittenish and playful the rest of her couldnt fake it she shook like she was terrified talk to me i whispered tell me who you are i put an arm around her caressed the back of her neck her hair felt fine as spider silk light as down i did it to keep her from getting away but it took only about four seconds for me to start having trouble keeping my mind on business she kissed me instead of answering me man oh man it had the kick of straight grain alcohol it got me repeating mantras just to remember who i was shaking like she was running naked through a hailstorm she turned up the heat she worked her way under the covers this was what the old man needed to keep him warm boy could he save on firewood then i lost my mantra and kissed her back about twenty seconds later she forgot about shivering morley pounded the door hey garrett you going to nap all night i sat up so sudden i made myself dizzy i felt around just garrett all by his lonesome what ive got a vivid imagination and a rich fantasy life but bring a light in here what about your booby trap what about it its not set morley found me on the edge of the bed draped in a sheet looking croggled and feeling four times as croggled as i looked what happened youre not going to believe it he didnt i never left the other room well only long enough to use the pot nobody couldve gotten past you had a dream maybe but damn i could use more dreams like that if it was i dont think so ive never had one like that man gets on in years he starts living his adventures in his head he grinned a big one full of pointy elf teeth lets dont start im too flustered to keep up my end you find anything what time is it yes your cloak closet is two thirds as big as it should be its about midnight the witching hour i could probably make it through the night without cracks like that i got up dragged the bedclothes with me morley got a funny look stepped over picked something up it was the red belt my blonde always wore even in snakes painting he looked at me i looked at him i maybe smiled a little not mine i told him maybe we ought to get the hell out of here garrett i pulled my clothes on i couldnt think what to say i agreed mostly finally i just muttered you ever back out on a job once you took it he got him another funny look and said yes once i couldnt picture that that wasnt morley dotes he delivered he wouldnt back down from the kingpin or from a nest of vampires id seen that with my own eyes i dont believe it what were you up against a herd of thunderlizards not exactly he didnt like talking about his work i dropped it lets look at that closet the situation had him more spooked than he let on he said a man hired me without telling me anything about the mark just where hed be at a certain time i had the biggest surprise of my life when i got there i opened the closet door all right ill bite you were the mark i turned slowly for about ten seconds i had no idea where i stood had we reached a moment id prayed would never come easy that was six months ago forget it i wasnt going to mention it he wouldnt have unless hed gotten so rattled most bets were off i tried to recall what id been working on back then nothing significant one missing person thing that had smelled from the start but that had petered out when i found the missing guy dead i owe you one forget it i shouldnt have mentioned it you forget it lets see where the missing space went i thought i got it that missing person thing had smelled because id thought there was more to it than the client would admit shed seemed vindictive when nothing in her story indicated a reason looking for a man shed claimed was an associate of her late husband pieces toppled into place belatedly the guy she was looking for could have been blackmailing her over the husbands demise she hadnt needed me once she knew the guy was dead the guy might have hired morley if hed heard i was after him hell with it water under the bridge nothing to do with what we were into now but i owed morley that more than balanced the stunt with the coffin full of vampire on this side morley said it was obvious once you knew it was there on the right the closet was twenty inches smaller than it should be give me the light i examined the wall inside nothing out of the way no door nothing to release one or open one has to be out there somewhere i went out examined the wall looked for some hidden device cunningly disguised like those id seen before i didnt find any such beast i got it morley said he tipped a twofoot section of wainscotting outward like a kitchen flour bin bam no sign it was there when it was in place clever he said every secret gizmo i ever saw leaves marks on the floor or something if its used much the section didnt quite drop to the floor a leather strap kept it from falling all the way we eyed each other i said well he grinned we can either stand here and stare at it or we can do something i vote we do something after you my man oh no im just the hired help i hand the knight his lance when hes ready to charge the black baron when im in a real helpful mood i polish a few rust spots off his armor but i dont stomp into traps for him i love you too boy he was right it was my game to play didnt hurt to try though i got another lamp made sure both were full started to crawl into the opening stay close right behind you boss all the way wait i backed out now what equipment it seemed like a good time to arm up just in case morley watched me ferret stuff out grinned when he saw the colored bottles i wondered if you kept those smart man never throws anything away might come in handy someday loaded for thunderlizard i returned to the passageway this time i kept going morley had less trouble in there being a foot shorter and a half ton lighter i kept banging my head the passage ran straight ahead fifteen feet it ran under the counter in the dressing room we emerged in a twofootwide dead space behind the bedroom and dressing room it was claustrophobic in there it was dusty and cobwebby too and there was nothing to be seen but studs lathing and plaster the wall at my back was identical it was the wall of the suite next to mine there were peepholes of course a couple for the dressing room and three for the bedroom the thought that i might have been watched left me real uncomfortable morley said heres how you get out at the end of the dead space against the wall of the hallway there was a twobytwo hole in the floor wooden rungs were nailed to the studs i sneezed ferociously the dust and my cold were ganging up my head hurt from being banged my skin burns gave me no respite i had no reason to be amused i chuckled anyway what no way im going to get past you you have to go first think so he ducked into the passageway from my sitting room after you my man youre so slick youll slide out of your casket i tested the rungs they were solid ever go down a vertical ladder carrying a live fire lucky im a paragon of coordination the third floor was identical to the fourth except for the cover over the hole opening on the second theres a big open storage loft below here i told morley and sneezed so hard i almost killed my lamp i listened for movement below nothing i lifted the cover it swung to the side on hinges how would we get down id seen no ladders when id explored the storage area crafty builders right under the hatch was the end of a rack the shelf supports made neat rungs i dropped to the floor knowing what to look for i spotted trapdoors that would take me to every room in the wing pretty simple morley said think its set up for spying or for escapes i think its probably for whatevers to the advantage of the stantnors i wonder how it works in the east wing that layout is different youve already checked this wing right except for the cellar you didnt find any place your girlfriend could be hiding no you ask the cook about food shortages no i should have shed have to eat i thought of her portrait id better get the paintings into the house tonight lets do this systematically the cellar first then the other wing seems probable the passages there start in the cellar yeah as i recalled the layout the walls all sat atop one another from the first floor upward we descended to the pantry quietly listened nothing on to the cellar it was your typical earthen floor cellar deeper than my own where i have to stoop but vasty dark and dusty a wilderness of stone pillars supporting beams that supported joists at first it seemed mostly empty and dusty and dry though dry wasnt a surprise the house sat atop a hill the builders would have arranged good drainage as we moved toward the east end we encountered evidence that an earlier regime had maintained a large wine cellar only the racks remained great place to get rid of bodies morley remarked they have their own graveyard for that somebody sank a couple three guys in that swamp he had a point we completed a circuit of the east end finding little but the wine racks broken furniture and near the foot of the steps sausages and stores hanging so mice couldnt reach them i sneezed almost continuously thats the easy half morley said we started our circuit of the western end that end had less to recommend it or make it interesting except for the supports and plumbing beneath the fountain those would have been of interest mainly to a plumber or engineer there were no entries to hidden passages i said we just wasted three quarters of an hour and sneezed never a waste when you find something out even if its negative thats my line youre supposed to grumble about wasted time he chuckled must be infecting each other lets get out before the spiders gang up i grunted sneezed interesting the cellar was almost verminfree other than spiders there was very little wildlife id have expected a sizable herd of mice i recalled the cats can you smell anything im deaf in the nose here what am i supposed to smell cat shit what no mice if there arent any the cats must be on the job the only cats ive seen are out in the barns if theyre getting in here theres a way into the basement from the outside oh his eyes got a little bigger he started watching the edges of the light more closely there was still a draug around somewhere he said were not going to find anything here lets do the west wing he was uncomfortable usually hes cool as a rock that creepy house really worked on you i was about halfway up to the first floor when i caught the end of a cry oh damn what now dont ever try to run through unfamiliar territory in the dark even with a lamp between us we nearly killed ourselves a half dozen times each before we made it to the great hall we burst into the light of the hall where the stantnors spared no expense on illumination what was it there was nothing shaking sounded like it came from here morley said looks like were first to arrive oh damn not quite damn damn damn chain had beaten us there the dragonslayer and his victim had masked him from us at first he was on the floor crumpled in a way no man should be hed bounced once some and had left a big smear blood still leaked out of him looks like he came from the top balcony morley said with an artisans dispassion tried to land on his feet and didnt quite make it he glanced up he didnt jump and id bet you he didnt trip over the rail if i was a betting man wouldnt touch the bet at a thousand to one the fall wasnt much more than thirty feet for chain it must have seemed like a thousand thirty feet is a bad fall but people have survived it if they have themselves under control or theyre lucky chain hadnt been either i glimpsed movement on the opposite balcony whirled i expected to see my mystery blonde i saw jennifer instead in her nightclothes at the rail at the end of my hall she looked down in a sort of daze she was very pale peters appeared right above us a moment later what the hell he bellowed and came bounding downstairs stay with him i told morley im going up there i indicated jennifer black pete galloped up to morley as i trotted away mouthing questions too fast for anybody to shove an answer in sideways i was puffing my lungs out when i reached jennifer swearing that when this one was over i was going to work out every day right after i spent a week catching up on my sleep she was flushed now so red she looked like shed run a mile she snapped where were you ive been trying to wake you up for ten minutes huh she stared at the floor shivering you said i thought you wanted me to hell id forgotten damned good thing she hadnt come earlier especially damned good thing i hadnt given her a key standing there shy and shamefaced and looking vulnerable in nightclothes that did little to hide the fact that she was one gorgeous hunk of woman she made me react after all i got all set to howl at the moon only peterss chatter downstairs kept my mind on business part of my mind on business a small part of my mind what do you know about this i jerked a thumb at chain her eyes got big nothing come on you had to see or hear something all right dont bully she eased a little closer still shivering business boy mind on business i sneaked out of my room about thirty minutes ago when i got to the end of my hall chain and peters were down by the fountain they were just sitting there like they were waiting for something to happen i couldnt get to the stairs without them seeing me so i waited the more i waited the more scared i got i was ready to chicken out when peters said something to chain and started upstairs chain turned his back so i hurried up to the fourth floor before peters saw me chain must have seen me when i was sneaking toward the loft stair he yelled i went up and over when i got to your side he was on the fourth floor going into the hall to my fathers suite i ran down your hall to your door and tried to get you to answer you didnt i kept trying then i heard that yell i didnt know what to do i was scared i tried to hide in the shadows at the end of the hall until i heard your voice you didnt see anybody but peters and chain no i told you huh i thought a moment youd better get back to your suite before anybody else comes out peterss questions will be troublesome enough oh yeah lets go i followed her to the stairs up to the loft and across the darkness there didnt bother her a bit we parted at the head of the stair to the thirdfloor balcony i said ill come talk to you as soon as weve settled things down all right a quavery mouse voice she was scared as hell i didnt blame her i was scared myself chain was dead helped along my favorite suspect my almost certain killer gone out of the picture meaning id wanted to nail the wrong hide to the wall unless hed tried to do unto another and got it done to him in selfdefense i walked along the balcony to the point where i guessed hed gone over morley and peters were quiet now watching me he got wool pants on i asked yes morley replied there were strands of wool on the rail there were scratches and flecks of skin too like hed tried to grab hold as hed gone over minute scraps of evidence but they made me certain hed been shoved i pictured him standing there looking down maybe talking to somebody when he got a sudden boost with barely enough oomph on it maybe hed even needed a little extra help after hed started going sometimes i suffer too much empathy for men who die untimely deaths i picture the thing and conjure the feelings they must have felt as the realization hit them falling scares hell out of me i had more than the usual ration of compassion for chain what would it take about a second of free fall all of it intense with fear and wild desperation and vain hope trying to adjust to take the fall and maybe just maybe survive i shuddered this one was going to haunt me trying hard not to think about it i clumped down to the ground floor i hurt everywhere i wasnt in a good mood at all whats your story sarge he was taken aback by my intensity but he excused it we were waiting for the draug there was a collection of instruments of mayhem lying in the fountain i hadnt noticed before kaid and wayne were going to take the next watch in about an hour i had to take a leak i didnt want to go outside so i headed for my room you took a long time taking a leak found out i had to do more once i got there you want to check its still warm take his word for it garrett morley isnt your dedicated investigator willing to stir fouled chamberpots in search of damning evidence im not that devoted myself anyway i believed peters hed have come up with an alibi less dumb if he was going to toss somebody off a balcony i was about out of suspects which meant i had to open the whole thing up and suspect everybody again even the unlikelies shares of the legacy were worth over six hundred thousand now if the value of the estate wasnt falling faster than the murderer could expand his share peters cook wayne who for no sound reason i gave wayne top billing and cook was starting to look better though she had pretty good alibis but alibis arent everything i guess the killer knows theres a copy of the will i told peters that means the general could be in double jeopardy what after last night the killer has to worry about the other copies going too they do all his risks have gone for nothing so maybe hell want the old man to check out before the last copy of the will does better find out exactly how many there were and where theyre at now i tapped my shirt to make sure i had my copy not that it was particularly safe with me considering i was no more immortal than chain hawkes or bradon snake popped into mind and after snake his paintings i had to get those inside but it was pouring out maybe headed for something worse there was the occasional flash of lightning i said getting around to the kind of weather that suits this place all we need is something howling and ghost lights puttering around outside peters snorted you get the next best thing a frisky draug he pointed there it was back at the rear again trying to get in a lightning flash illuminated it i got my first good look it was more decomposed than the others peters selected a few items from the stockpile in the fountain shall we take care of it thats my old sergeant morley cool in the face of the enemy uhm he went through the arsenal himself here was something he could get a hold on all right i guess we should take care of it get it out of the way i checked their leavings theyd taken all the best stuff already hell with this i went and disarmed a retired knight i had to be getting close to the end there werent many suits of armor left for me to vandalize morley sat on the fountain surround hugging cracked ribs peters was curled up on the floor in a pool of vomit clutching his groin he did his manly best not to whimper me id been luckier all id come up with was a shin bruise and a badly stomped foot not on the same leg maybe next time ill save myself some grief and let whoever wants kill me morley gasped why didnt you say the man was a handtohand specialist when he was alive dont look at me i didnt know anything about him not even who he was pieces of draug were scattered all over some still moved what now eh you burned the other two right one of them i know both peters groaned he got onto his knees his forehead on the floor his knuckles were bone white hed gotten hit bad they dumped the other one into the stable fire when they saw there wasnt no stopping it he didnt say that in one chunk but in little gasps a word or two at a time the effort cost him a spate of dry heaves i felt for him though not as much as i would have if i hadnt been hurting myself i got up better make sure we got the job done the thing looked like it was trying to get itself back together the pieces were trying to get to a central point i hobbled pitching random limbs back what the hells going on down there i looked up wayne and kaid had appeared for their shift at the thirdfloor rail come on down were in no shape to finish this wayne beat kaid by a floor he looked at what was left of chain at the pieces of rotted corpse at chain again man man oh man man he didnt say anything else till he asked what happened i told him kaid arrived in time to get it all man man oh man wayne was scared for the first time since i arrived i saw one of those people convinced of his own mortality hell youre all a hundred thousand richer now man i dont care about that i dont need it it aint worth it im out of here soon as its light enough that nothing can sneak up on me but money aint everything you cant live it up if youre dead im gone the man was almost hysterical i glanced at peters he was preoccupied though hed made it to the fountain surround he hoisted himself up and perched with his misery he had no attention left for anything else morley was no help but he couldnt be he didnt know the people i looked at kaid he was as pallid as a man could get as shaken as wayne equally eyeball to eyeball with death it had come home the field was so narrow each knew he might be next he swallowed about three times then managed the general somebodys got to take care of the general wayne snarled let that bastard take care of himself im gone i aint dying for his money or for him pain will distract you some but mine wasnt so alldevouring that i couldnt spend some effort trying to figure out what the hell would happen next i wondered which of the three was acting and how hed gotten so good i wondered some about cook jennifer even the old man and how i could figure one of them for the killer or more than one that was an angle i hadnt given much thought maybe there was more than one killer that would take care of alibis and my ivory lover what of her the mystery woman suddenly looked like a top bet for the villain who the hell was she i plunked myself down on the fountain surround as nimble as a quadraplegic dwarf kaid and wayne came out of shock enough to start thinking and doing kaid went to the kitchen got some big burlap sacks he and wayne stuffed them with pieces of draug and tied them shut they gagged while they worked my cold was that much of a blessing i didnt have to take the smell morley was three feet away i asked how you doing be running windsprints in the morning he grimaced spat on the floor winced again as he leaned to look at it what wanted to see if i was spitting blood come on you rolled with it he flashed me a down under smile he was putting on a show he wanted folks to think he was hurt worse than he was might be an edge for him later i shut my mouth peters managed to say what now garrett i dont know how do we stop this before were all dead i dont know that either unless we just scatter in which case the killer wins by default wayne walks tomorrow its the same as if he got killed morley said makes your job easier garrett he did a grimace he was overacting eh i was at top form shortens the list by another name black pete grunted out garrett howre you going to catch him him i wasnt so sure now if wayne walked and peters was clean the crowd was so small id have to lynch kaid but i thought kaid was too old and feeble to have done all the killer had i dont have a clue sarge dont press me you people know each other better than i know you you tell me who it is shit it isnt anybody logically one way or another you can discard everybody except maybe your phantom blonde that nobody sees but you i saw her morley said i looked at him puzzled was he lending moral support hadnt he said something about seeing her last night or was that the other morley id forgotten that the thing that could be somebody else probably the spook that the doctor was sure was here it didnt get any easier your picture morley whispered i frowned get it and find out who she is besides a hot tumble maybe he was right maybe i wanted to say the hell with it for now we were out of the woods for a while that draug had been cared for the killer wasnt likely to make another move for a while i hurt everywhere i just wanted to slither upstairs and finish what id started before id been interrupted but id put off seeing bradon for a few minutes and look what that had cost not just snake but chain not to mention the stable those paintings and however many horses had vanished into the sunset because there was no one to round them up i got my feet under me peters any rain gear handy morley got up too he scrunched over held his side with his left arm rain gear what the hell you need to go outside for got to get something while its still there he looked at me like he thought i was crazy probably right i thought to your left at the end over there through that arch the old guest restrooms he still wasnt talking in big gobbling chunks morley and i went to the arch which was barely five feet wide a crack of a doorway for this place it opened on an alcove eight by eight there was a door in front of me and one to my left check that one i told morley and opened the one in front of me mine was the womens the only pissoir id seen in the house i hadnt noticed any plumbing downstairs maybe it wasnt there anymore the place was dried up used only for storage there were no raincoats i went to check on morley his room was the mens surprise surprise one wall was all marble that fell to a trough the flush pipe whence water ran at eye level had rusted out i spied the rain gear but not morley where are you here his voice came from beyond a copse of brooms and mops and whatnot in the lefthand rear corner hed found another movable panel he was halfway up the narrow stairway behind it we can check it out later i spied a lantern amongst the junk on the marble fourholer it smelled like it had been used in the modern era when morley came down i was getting it lighted morley said if there werent people hanging around youd think the place had been abandoned for twenty years yeah i shrugged into an oilcloth coat so big it hung long on me lets get with it while morley tried to find something smaller than a circus tent i snapped up a few extras to wrap bradons artwork we put on hats and dashed out into the storm actually we stumbled i wasnt getting any friskier neither was morley i had to spend most of my energy keeping the lantern from blowing out there was a brisk wind blowing throwing barrels of water around it came from every direction but up the thunder banged away lightning over the city carried on like a battle between hordes of stormwardens we reached the barn in spite of all thank heaven we found rain gear morley said we might have gotten soaked sarky bastard i was wet to the skin i rooted through the place where id squirreled the paintings damn me somethings gone right what theyre still here watch out for a booby trap then i almost took him seriously thats the way my luck runs i shook the water off the extra coats morley held the lantern and cursed and dodged bats those coats arent going to be enough let me look around he scurried off leaving me halfway convinced id never see him again he came back with a couple of heavy tarps we wrapped the paintings in two bundles we took one apiece and slogged into the storm i got soaked all over again i had mud up to my knees when we reached the house but the paintings arrived dry we shed our gear guess we better take these up to the suite i told morley he was looking at the paintings what do you think the man was disturbed and good too thats her im in love he stared at the portrait like he might dive in lets admire her upstairs but we had to pass kaid wayne and peters to get to the stairway black pete asked whats all that no reason not to tell the truth some of bradons paintings i saved them from the fire they wanted to see they hadnt seen bradons work before the man never had shown it yech kaid said after a couple of war scenes thats sick its good wayne said thats how it felt but it doesnt look like i know its how it felt man peters said he didnt like jennifer much did he somehow id managed to save four portraits the blonde and three jennifers just as well i hadnt salvaged any of these guys they wouldnt have appreciated them id gotten more than one jennifer by accident it had gotten hurried toward the end peters lined the portraits up against the fountain the third and probably most recent jennifer i hadnt seen before it was the ugliest jennifer was radiant yet something horrible about her made you doubt the artists sanity kaid said he was crazier than we thought garrett dont ever let miss jennifer see these that would be too cruel i wont i took them by accident more than anything i was just grabbing but the blonde now i took that one on purpose thats the woman ive been seeing who is she they looked at me at the painting at me again their studied blandness said they were unsure about my sanity they thought id let my imagination attach itself to the first thing handy peters played it straight i dont know garrett never seen her before you men wayne and kaid shook their heads wayne said theres something familiar about her though that seemed to cue something in kaids head he frowned moved a step closer i asked you know something kaid no for a second no just my imagination i wasnt going to argue with them till i could produce physical evidence lets get these tucked away morley we started gathering the paintings now peters was frowning at the blonde something perking in the back of his head he was a little pale and a whole lot puzzled he didnt say anything though we collected the paintings and headed for the stairs maybe intuition nudged me when i reached the fourth floor i went to the rail peters and kaid had their heads together yakking away they kept their voices down but were intense morleys ears are better than mine he told me whatever theyre talking about theyre determined to convince each other its impossible they recognized her they think she looks like somebody she couldnt be i think i didnt like the sound of that morley perched the mystery woman on the mantle in my sitting room contemplated her intently i misread his interest i seldom do that because his interest in the female tribe is definite cant have her boy shes taken be quiet he told me sit down and look at the painting he wouldnt be sharp if it wasnt important i planted myself i stared i began to feel like i was part of the scene morley got up and snuffed a few lamps halving the light in the room then he threw the curtains open apparently so wed get the full benefit of the storm he settled and resumed staring that woman came more and more to life grabbed more and more of my being i felt i could take her hand and pull her out away from the thing that pursued her the storm outside intensified what was going on in the paintings background that damned snake bradon was a sorcerer the painting once you looked at it awhile was more potent than the swampscape with hanged man but this one was more subtle i could almost hear her begging for help morley muttered damn her shes too intense got to block her out of there what theres something else there but the woman pulls your attention away hed lost me the rest of the painting was decoration to me or arrows pointing out the crucial object morley got paper from my writing table spent ten minutes using a small knife to trim pieces to cover the blonde you damage that thing ill carve you up i told him i had a notion where it ought to be displayed there was a big bare spot on the wall of my office at home id cut my own throat first garrett the man was crazy but he was a genius curious morley calling him crazy without having met him morley killed another lamp he hung his cutouts over the canvas ill be damned the painting was almost as intense without the woman but now the eye could rove morley grunted let your mind go blank just let it sink in i tried the storm carried on outside thunder galloped swords of lightning flailed the flashes played with the flashes in the painting the shadow seemed to move like a thunderhead boiling what it was there for just a second i couldnt get it back i tried too hard did you see the face morley asked in the shadow yeah for a second i cant get it back neither can i he removed the cutouts settled again shes running from somebody not something shes reaching out you think bradon has her reaching for somebody particular running from somebody to somebody he asked maybe him maybe i shrugged you youre the one who you said you saw her i saw somebody just a glimpse the more i stare at this the more i think it could have been the other one jennifer yes they look a lot alike i hadnt seen that i tried to see jennifer in the blonde i dont know theres a lot of stantnor in jennifer and none in this one i guess i squeaked he asked what that face in the background there was a lot of stantnor in it jennifer bradon did her bad i dont think so i got the feeling it was male around thirty and stark raving mad the lightning had fits outside i shuddered jumped up started lighting lamps i couldnt shake the chill im spooked i confessed yes the more i look the creepier it gets the chill stayed with me i wondered if we were being watched think ill start a fire whoa what did you say ill start a fire im freezing my youre a genius garrett nice of you to notice what did i genius it went right by me fire in the stable you figured right too not for you at all for something bradon had hidden what did you find hidden the paintings he gestured at the blonde the painting i dont know i do what were the others crazy stuff but people weve seen and places in the cantard so i looked at the painting again morley said theres the key to your killer thats why bradon died theres why the stable burned thats your killer he laughed it was a crazy noise hell everything was crazy in this place and you slept with her he started to say something else caught himself reflected oh man he came and put a hand on my shoulder he could have slept with a mass murderer and thought nothing of it maybe hed have smiled and cut her throat afterward a lovable rogue most of the time but theres a cold subterranean stream inside him he knew how it would hit me before it hit he was there when i started to rattle it wasnt as bad as i feared but the idea did shake me ive got to pace he let me get up and try to walk it off that didnt do much good the whoopeemaking noises outside didnt help the thunder ripped at my nerves like cats howling at midnight then i recalled promising jennifer id see her later the old mind fixed on that telling me i could clean out a whole birds nest with one stone where you going morley demanded something to do promises to keep almost forgot i got out before he pressed me sudden as that not quite sure i was thinking right i glanced over the rail kaid and wayne were seated on opposite sides of the fountain not talking theyd cleaned up chain peters had gone i wondered why they bothered maybe they couldnt sleep i couldnt see me getting much sleep despite exhaustion and hurting everywhere i made it to the loft crossed slipped down to the third floor without attracting attention it was a great house for sneaking i tiptoed to jennifers door i tapped she didnt answer i shouldnt have expected her to as long as it had been i tried the door locked only reasonable any fool would have taken that precaution i tapped again and still got no response so much for that idea i started for home and stopped and without understanding why i turned back and went to work on the lock i had it undone in moments jennifer didnt like the darkness half a dozen lamps burned in a sitting room identical to her fathers not knowing the layout of these end suites i decided the best place to find her would be behind the same door the old man used to make his entrances i locked the hall door and headed that way i dont know what youd call the room beyond it wasnt a bedroom it was more a small informal sitting room with only a few pieces of furniture and one big window facing west it was gloomy lighted by a single candle jennifer was there in a chair facing the window the drapes were open wide shed fallen asleep despite the excitement outside i doubted shed have heard my knock had she been awake now what bright boy make the wrong move and theyll turn you into a eunuch hell itd been tried before i shook her shoulder jenny wake up she shrieked and jumped and stumbled away and the gods were kind one of those barrages of thunder absorbed her cry she recognized me and got herself under control more or less she held her hands over her heart and panted you scared me to death whatre you doing here garrett i fibbed a little i told you id come by i knocked you didnt answer i got worried i fiddled the lock and came to see if you were all right you looked so pale i just reached out to shake your shoulder i didnt mean to scare you did i sound sincere i poured it on i do sincere pretty good been studying morleys technique she relaxed some moved a little closer gods i hope i didnt wake the whole house yelling like that i apologized some more then it seemed only natural to hug her to comfort her a minute after that when shed stopped shaking so bad she found a little girl voice and asked youre going to ravish me now arent you for me it was the perfect thing for her to say at the moment i busted out laughing it took the builtup pressure out of me it took almost too much i had to fight it to control it whats so damned funny her feelings were bruised no jenny honey im not laughing at you im laughing at me honest i really am no im not here to ravish you the condition im in after today i couldnt ravish a chipmunk ive been burned bludgeoned and kicked half to death i hurt all over im so tired i could pass out on the spot and im totally upset about chain if theres anything id want from a woman now it would be for her to comfort me not for me to ravish her you slick talker pay attention talk like that its eight to five youll wind up getting comforted by a vestal virgin just be harmless helpless and in need of mothering and pour on the sincere well what with one thing and another i talked myself right into something without consciously planning it fifteen minutes later we were in her bed fifteen minutes after that i was trying hard to stay harmless helpless and in need of comfort theres something reassuring about just lying around holding somebody after youve been bruised and abused and treated like a wolf treats a fox that isnt fast on its feet but theres also something about being comforted by somebody put together like jennifer that makes you forget they shoved you through the meat grinder sideways hide hooves and all wed been whispering mostly just talk innocent enough but she couldnt he still she was relaxed enough now considering she moved seemed startled asked is that what i think it is body pressure left no doubt what she meant yeah sorry cant help it maybe id better go i didnt make any move to leave though not me i cant believe it no its impossible it wasnt impossible at all for a while i forgot the painting the storm all my aches and pains i even got to sleep some though that was more like catnaps between tests of the limits of possibility i knew i was going to hate myself in the morning it was just my body that hated myself in the morning it felt about a hundred and two years old my head was fine not counting my cold i kissed jennifer on the forehead nose and chin headed for my own quarters while it was still early enough that i might not be noticed wayne and kaid were on duty still sort of kaid was nodding wayne was sprawled on the fountain surround snoring cook was in the kitchen cursing i heard her all the way to the fourth floor i wondered what was bothering her i was sure wed all know before long what with her closedmouth stoic ways i went up through the loft down i glanced across as i started into my hallway the blonde stared at me from the hall to the generals suite i waved feebly she didnt respond oh boy i headed for my door for a second i thought shed gotten there before me then i realized it was the painting it seemed so creepy i turned it to face the wall you have a nice time morley was in a big overstuffed chair he looked like hed been asleep ghastly thats what puts that smug look on your face ill remember that get cleaned up its almost time for breakfast him eager for one of cooks breakfasts ill give it a skip and take a nap instead youre working garrett you dont take time off to nap whenever you feel like it do you thats the beauty of being your own boss he was right more right than he knew really i could go get some sleep sure and if somebody got killed while i did id be haunted for years yeah all right now he looked smug bastard he knew right where to poke me i went into the dressing room threw some water on my face mixed up some lather hacked and slashed morley planted himself in the doorway he watched the show awhile then said id better move on the cook fast or youll have every woman in the place wrapped up youre out of luck she was my first conquest he snorted i said i had to move fast because i knew youd head for her like a moth to a candle i wiped my face on the other hand i wont stand in your way shes definitely your type ill sing at your wedding dont think you can provoke me into a battle of wits with an unarmed man huh i know its your diet talking maybe i ought to talk to the cook about that dietary improvements could do your general more good than squadrons of doctors and witches got you on the run already what last recourse old buddy you start talking about red meat and celery juice and boiled weeds boiled weeds you ever actually buy a meal at my place i mean pay for it out of your own pocket i was tired enough to forget how well he does sincere i made the mistake of offering an honest answer i dont recall doing that every time its been on the house and not that bad but who was going to admit that and you complain about free meals you know how much it costs to gather those weeds theyre rare they grow wild they arent cultivated commercially he put on a lot of sincere i wasnt sure if he was yanking my leg or not i know it isnt cheap to eat at his place but id always figured that was part of the ambience make his customers think they were buying class were getting too serious i said by way of ducking possible issues lets go see how shell poison us today not the best choice of words garrett but lets sometime back a hundred years ago cook whumped up one big breakfast and shed been rewarming leftovers ever since the same old greasy meats and biscuits and gravy and all that so heavy it would founder a galleon your basic country breakfast morley was in pain he concentrated on biscuits and muttered at least the storm passed it was quiet out the rain had fallen off to a drizzly mist the wind had died down it was getting colder which i didnt interpret as a positive omen i figured it meant the snow would be back jennifer didnt show which i didnt find mysterious and nobody else mentioned so it must not be unusual but wayne wasnt around either and he wasnt the kind who missed his meals wheres wayne i asked peters who looked groggy crabby and like he still hurt plenty he gave me the answer i was afraid id hear he pulled out soon as there was enough light just like he said kaid said he had his stuff all packed and at the front door he was raring to go i looked at kaid kaid looked like i felt he nodded which seemed to take all the energy he had i muttered and then there were three peters said and im having a hard time talking myself into sticking cook rumbled what are you boys on about now i realized she probably hadnt heard i told her about chain and when i thought about chain i wished i hadnt because wayne the gravedigger was gone and that meant either peters or i or both of us would have to hike over to the graveyard and wallow in the mud till we got art chain planted i knew morley wouldnt do it he hadnt hired on for that as hed remind me with a shiteating grin while he kibbitzed my digging style eight hundred and some thousands apiece now and all the survivors improbable suspects i thought about burning my copy of the will right there but what good would that do if they didnt know it was the last copy then i had a terrible thought was the will registered you can do that to keep your heirs from squabbling it means filing a copy of the document if stantnors was registered then the villain did not have to worry about my copy or about the general having torched his they all looked at each other shrugged wed have to ask the general i started to say i wanted to see him but a racket out front cut me off it sounded like a cavalry troop arriving what the hell is that kaid muttered he shoved himself off his stool started moving like he was forty years older than his seventysomething everybody but cook toddled along behind cook didnt leave her bailiwick for trivia we swarmed onto the front porch what the hell peters demanded looks like a damned carnival caravan it did and the mob with the garish coach and wagons boasted every breed you could imagine none of the vehicles were pulled by horses or oxen or even elephants which you sometimes see with a carnival the teams were all grolls grolls being half giant half troll green and from twelve to eighteen feet tall when theyre grown theyre strong enough to tear out trees by their roots big trees a pair of those grolls waved and hollered took me a moment doris and marsha i said havent seen them for a while a skinny little guy bounced up the steps i hadnt seen him for a lot longer dojango roze how the hell are you a little down on my luck actually he grinned a strange little breed he claimed he and doris and marsha were triplets born of different mothers id given up trying to figure that out what the hell is this dojango morley asked ive never been sure but i think dojango is some distant relative of his doctor dooms medicine show carnival and home spirit disposal service actually friend of the doc said you had a bad spirit needing handling he grinned from ear to ear his brothers doris and marsha boomed cheerfully not giving a damn that i didnt understand one word of grollish they and the other grolls and all the oddities with them got to work setting up camp on the front lawn i glanced at peters and kaid they just stared morley i raised an eyebrow about a foot high your doctor friends referral his smile was a little weak around the edges looks like hey dojango said sensing my lack of enthusiasm doc doom is the real thing actually real ghost tamer exorcist demonologist spirit talker the works even does a little necromancy actually but there aint much call for those skills actually not when youre not human how many of you humans would think of using a nonhuman to call up your uncle fred so you can find out where he hid the good silver before he croaked see so doc has to make a mark here and a mark there some other way peddles nostrums mostly actually hey let me go get him bring him up let you judge for yourself he spun around and headed for the coach which hadnt disgorged any passengers yet he ran halfway down the steps i muttered i dont believe this the old man would foul his drawers if he saw it morley grunted his eyes were glazed roze came back oh doc doom is kind of a quirky guy actually you got to give him some room and be a little patient if you know what i mean i dont i told him better not be too quirky ive got quirky enough right here and no patience left over for more dojango grinned managed to leave without using his favorite word again actually he dashed down to that ridiculous coach which was so brightly painted it would have blinded us on a sunny day breeds swarmed around it a couple got up a giant parasol another one brought a set of steps somebody else laid out a canvas dingus from those steps to the steps to the house morley and i exchanged glances again dojango opened the coach door and bowed meantime grolls set up a circus on the lawn i asked morley you heard of this guy actually yes he smiled word is hes the real thing like dojango says actually kaid sputtered and went back into the house a figure seven feet tall and maybe six hundred pounds wide descended from the coach what it was wasnt immediately obvious it was wrapped up in so much black cloth it looked like a walking tent the tent was covered with mystical symbols in silver a huge hand came out and made a benevolent gesture to the troops one of the taller breeds dragged something out of the coach and planted it atop doctor dooms head it added three feet to his height priests should wear something so bizarre and ornate he came toward us as though the star of a coronation processional you doc doom i asked when he arrived give me one good reason why i should take you seriously after that clown show dojango bouncing around like a puppy seemed stricken hey garrett you cant talk to doctor doom that way actually i talk to kings and sorcerers that way why should i make an exception for a clown you better pack your tents and get rolling the nitwit who sent you made a mistake morley said garrett dont get excited the man is for real hes just kind of into drama and maybe has a little bit of a puffedup notion of his own importance ill say doom hadnt spoken yet he didnt now he gestured a breed beside him female about four feet tall who looked like she had a lot of dwarf and ogre in her she was ugly said the doctor says hell excuse your impertinence this once because you were ignorant of who he is but now you know bye i turned sarge morley we got work to do sarge maybe you better see if you can find a horse we may have to send for the garrison there isnt much law anywhere in karenta but guys like the general have access to a little somebody irritates them they can always get a hand or two hundred from the army dojango had a fit he pursued us into the hall where he lost the thread of his thoughts as he looked around at the paintings and hardware and bellicose scenes in glass he mumbled something about hes desperate for work actually cook strode onto the scene as formidable as a war elephant now i knew where kaid had gone she damned near trampled roze i said i dont think well need the army morley said youre being too hard garrett one more time the man is the real thing yeah right i went back to the door to watch cook in action the action was over essentially she stood in front of the marvelous doctor with hands on ample hips looking like she might breathe fire he was out of his wonderful hat already and getting rid of the tent like i thought the guy inside went more stone than i had fingers to count but i had to revise his tonnage downward he didnt go more that fourfifty in his work clothes he had some troll in him and three or four other bloods once you saw him without the costume you figured maybe he was smart to wear it he made his little mouthpiece look gorgeous mr garrett ill dispense with the showmanship as my good friend dojango has assured you i am the genuine article his voice was down a wells depth below bass somewhere along the line somebody had popped him in the adams apple that added a growly scratchy character to his voice and made him hard to understand he knew that and spoke slowly you have a problem with a malign spirit im told unless its of a class two magnitude or greater i can deal with it huh im not up on the jargon i try not to hang around with sorcerers that can be hazardous to your health will you reconsider and allow me a preliminary examination of the premises why not im an easygoing guy when people dont shuck me as long as you knock the horse apples off your boots and promise not to wet on the carpets he was so ugly his expression was hard to read i dont think he appreciated my humor though i asked what do you need from us nothing i brought my own equipment a guide perhaps to show me those places where the spirit most commonly manifests it doesnt leastwise not when anyone is looking the only evidence we have that there is one is the doctors opinion curious a spirit of the sort he suspected ought to manifest frequently dojango my kit morley asked could it appear to be somebody familiar explain your question please i told him about having a morley in my room who wasnt yes exactly if it wanted it could cause a great deal of confusion that way dojango what are you waiting for roze scampered off to the doctors coach meantime doom said perhaps i should apologize for distressing you with my arrival the sort of people who usually employ me wont believe im real unless they get a show i understood that sometimes i have that problem in my business potential clients look at me and wonder especially when they catalog the marks on my face i have to remind them that they should see the other guys dojango staggered up the steps with four big cases they probably outweighed him his face was frozen in a rictus of a grin cook seemed satisfied that everything was under control she headed into the house never said a word to me my feelings were hurt but not much dojango arrived panting like hed run twenty miles doctor doom said shall we begin once the good doctor stopped clowning he impressed me as quite professional he started at the fountain about which he made several remarks suggesting he thought it one of the great sculptures of the modern age he asked if it might be for sale in the foreseeable future peters and i exchanged glances peters was way out at sea encountering a side of the world about which hed only heard before he said unlikely doctor unlikely a pity a great pity id love to own it it would make a wonderful prop he shuffled through his cases as dojango popped them open took out this and that and nobody else knew what they were for all i could tell they had no use at all and were just stuff to impress the peasants three minutes later he said a great many traumatic events have occurred in this house he looked at something in his hand drifted to the spot where chain had made his exit from this vale of tears the boys had cleaned up good i guessed chain was taking his ease in the wellhouse till planting time a man died here recently violently doom looked up pushed id guess on the money i admitted maybe an hour after midnight last night he wandered around the dead have walked here zombies no worse not under control draugs i looked at morley i guess he knows his stuff unless hes got a friend on the inside youre suspicious of everything occupational hazard the spook hunter spent fifteen minutes just standing by the fountain with his eyes closed holding some doohickeys to his ears id begun to wonder if we werent getting shucked after all when he came back from wherever hed been this is a house of blood the very stones vibrate with memories of great evils done he shuddered closed his eyes for another three minutes then turned to me youre the man who needs my help im the guy the general hired to straighten out a mess that only gets more tangled by the minute he nodded tell me what youve learned there have been so many evils done here that its impossible to separate them thatll take awhile why dont we get comfortable i led him to one of the rooms on the first floor west where i presumed in better times the business of the estate had been managed we settled peters went off to sweettalk cook into providing the next best thing to refreshments in a household where alcohol was banned a twisted place indeed doom said when he learned that i decided maybe he wasnt so bad after all i told him what id learned which wasnt that much when you came down to it mostly a catalog of crimes he asked no questions till i finished the spirit seems content to victimize your principal the other deaths are the work of other hands hell i dont know the longer im here the more confused i get every time somebody dies or emigrates the list of suspects gets more improbable i explained how id had chain locked in as the villain till he took his tumble he considered he reflected he took his time he was one guy who didnt get in a hurry he said yours isnt my field of expertise mr garrett but i would as a disinterested layman suggest that you may be following false trails because you began with faulty assumptions say what you think youre after someone who wants a greater share of the estate have you considered another motive the heirs keep demonstrating a lack of interest in the legacy perhaps theres another cause for murder entirely perhaps im not exactly a dummy id considered that but i couldnt come up with anything to connect these people any other way only the legacy offered any normal basis for bloodshed i told him that im open to suggestions ill tell you i am he did some reflecting how separate are your separate investigations i explained it the way i saw it morley fretted thinking my perspective too narrow good heavens huh doom was staring past my shoulder i had my back to the doorway i turned jennifer had appeared good heavens i said she looked like death warmed over doom said come here child instantly i got up put an arm around her waist she was almost too weak to walk she hadnt had strength enough to dress herself properly garrett there were tears in her eyes thats all she said i led her to the seat id vacated the light was better what it showed me wasnt shed taken on the color the old man showed its after her i croaked the spook doom looked at her a long time before he said yes morley looked at her too then he looked at me garrett lets take a walk doc see what you can do for her well be back numb i didnt say anything till morley started leading me upstairs what are we doing that spooks been gnawing on the old man for a year right it never bothered anybody else right yeah we were headed for my suite something changed that between last night and this morning we reached the fourth floor me puffing and renewing my vow to get in shape i guess but what he unlocked the door with my key held it for me once we were inside he took down the portrait of my mystery blonde whered you spend the night garrett i looked at her i looked at him i recalled seeing her as i wandered home i said oh thats all i had to say it was a lot to swallow morley went back into the hall me tagging along he said time to get an opinion on this from everyone morley this isnt possible maybe not i hope not he has no mercy sometimes his tone was a hot flensing knife we returned to the room where doom and jennifer were doom was disturbed jennifer looked a lot better though hed done something for her she had strength and attention enough now to put herself into better array morley placed the portrait on a table nearby face down peters would you get everyone in here garrett has something to show everybody peters had been hovering over jennifer he looked at me i said please the general too we can do without him for the moment he was gone longer than i expected i found out why when he came back cook and kaid were up feeding the general garrett hes damned near gone cant even sit up cant talk its like hes had a stroke or had all but the last ounce of life sucked out doom listened but said nothing how soon will they be here soon as they get him cleaned up he fouled his bed hes never done that before he always got hold of kaid or dellwood most times he had enough strength to make it to his chamberpot after that there wasnt much to say i watched doom fuss over jennifer and jennifer continue to improve i tried not to dwell on what morley had said without saying it in so many words there are things you just dont want to believe kaid and cook came in cook grumbling steadily about the interruptions in her schedule morley said sit down please garrett i knew what i had to do i didnt want to for some reason that seemed almost outside me but garretts got willpower i looked at jennifer too bad garrett dont have a little more wont power snake bradon was a remarkable artist but it seems he never showed his work which is a damned sin he was able to capture the essence of what it felt like in the cantard he painted people too with a very skewed eye this is one of his portraits i managed to save it from the stable fire it could be the key to everything i want you all to look at it and tell me about it morley brought a lamp closer so thered be more light i lifted the painting damn me if jennifer didnt let out a squeak and faint and cook who hadnt deigned to seat herself collapsed a moment later hell of an impact i said doc doom stared at the blonde he got the look morley had last night he shook himself loose said lay it down again please once i had he said the man who painted that had one eye in another world hes got both of them there now he was murdered night before last he waved that off it was irrelevant morley asked you see what was in the background better than anyone with an untrained eye i suspect that painting tells a whole story an ugly story yeah i said what is it who was the woman thats what ive been trying to find out since i got here nobody but me ever sees her the rest of these people say she doesnt exist she exists im surprised youre sensitive no i did say shed manifest frequently sometimes they will attach themselves to a disinterested party gradually trying to justify themselves before an impartial court huh morley said i get it i was wrong garrett shes not the killer shes your ghost she didnt need secret passages to get in and out morley morley you know damned well thats impossible i told you about some sense wormed through my confusion there was a crowd here was i going to be dumb enough to tell them all id fooled around with a spook was i dumb enough to believe it myself shes the haunt doom agreed theres no doubt that painting explains everything she was murdered and it was the culmination of a betrayal so immense so foul that she stayed here i had it stantnor killed her his first wife the one he got rid of supposedly he bought her off and sent her away he murdered her instead maybe there is a body in the cellar morley no huh that was cook getting up off the floor thats missus eleanor garrett jennifers mother yes she moved to the table she lifted the painting she stared i was sure she saw everything snake bradon put there maybe stuff morley and i missed so he did it hisself hes lived a lie all these years because he cant give up that alibi it wasnt no fumblefingered doctor at all that lousy bastard wait a minute just wait a damned minute the story is there mr garrett doom said she was tortured and murdered by an insane man why my voice was in what youd call the plaintive range i wasnt calming down any i couldnt get last night out of my head that hadnt been any spook well if it was it was the warmestbodied friskiest most solid spook there ever was doc i need to talk to you in private its critical we went into the hallway i told him he went into one of his reflections when he came out a week later he said it begins to make sense and the child jennifer did you sleep with her too well hell they say confession is good for the soul yes but it was kind of her idea stop making excuses garrett he smiled it wasnt a salacious grin it was a eureka kind of grin it falls together the old man your principal whose life shes been leeching slowly as she sets his feet upon the path to hell is drained this morning shed have had to do that to assume solid form with you then the other her own daughter wounds her by taking you to her bed you the focus shes chosen to justify youve been tainted that has to be punished he got reflective again thats crazy were not dealing with sane people living or dead i thought you understood that knowing it and knowing it are two different things we have to talk to the troll woman it would be wise to know the circumstances of those days as well as possible before we take steps this isnt a feeble haunt we went back inside doom asked cook what reason would general stantnor have had for doing what he did from what mr garrett tells me she was frightened of everything had almost no will of her own it would take great evils to animate her to the point where wed have the situation that exists here now i dont tell no stories cook can it i snapped we have the general nailed here he murdered eleanor evidently in extremely traumatic fashion now shes getting even that doesnt bother me too much i kind of like the idea of retribution but now shes started on jennifer i dont like that so how about you just puke up some straight answers cook looked at jennifer who hadnt yet recovered i kind of hinted at it but i guess not strong enough the general well he was obsessed with missus eleanor like i told you but that never stopped him from rabbiting around hisself tumbling every wench whod hold still while he threw her on her back he wasnt discreet about it neither missus eleanor naive as she was figured it out i cant tell you what she felt for him she wasnt never one to talk or show much but she had to be his wife she didnt have nowhere to go her parents was dead the king was out to get her she was hurt bad by the way he done real bad maybe because she was the way she was lots more hurt than a deceived wife ought to be anyway she told him if he didnt straighten up shed see if what was good for the gander was good for the goose she wouldnt never have done it not in a million years she didnt have the nerve but that didnt make him no never mind he thought everybody worked inside like he did he beat her half to death maybe wouldve killed her if i hadnt of got between them anyway he just went crazy after that poor child only time she ever stood up to him i wanted to tell her to make the long story short but it might not be smart to interrupt while she was puking her guts well the poor child was pregnant with miss jennifer she didnt know it yet naive child once she did figure it out it was a day too late i like to pounded his head for him but he wouldnt believe he was its dad not till she was gone him thinking that poor child was as loose as him with who i asked him was there anybody around the house hell no not but him and the child never went outdoors half the time she didnt even come out of her room but try to convince a fool with logic he put her through hell pure hell tormented her tortured her i think she had bruises all over trying to get her to tell him the name i done what i could that wasnt never enough only made him worse when i wasnt looking and it got worse when the old general passed she looked at me there were tears in her eyes the size of larks eggs i swear though i never thought he killed her i never believed that even when there was some whispers if id of known it then id of plucked off his fingers and toes and arms like plucking feathers off a chicken how could he of killed her i dont know cook but im going to ask i looked at doctor doom he asked you intend to confront him oh yes i sure do i grinned like a werewolf he hired me to unravel his troubles no matter how much he didnt like what he learned im going to give him apoplexy take it easy morley said dont get so upset you cant think straight good advice ive been known to gallop around like a beheaded chicken when im excited doing more damage to myself than to the bad guys ive got it under control i glanced at jennifer shed begun to recover while cook was talking she looked a little goofy still as she stared at the portrait of her mother she seemed amazed and puzzled she mumbled thats my mother thats the woman in the painting in fathers bedroom i looked at peters why didnt you tell me that last night i didnt believe it i guessed but this painting doesnt look anything like that one i thought i had to be wrong that it was just a coincidence snake never saw her anyway cook said thats not true thats right i said he came from the estate didnt he i should have thought of that did he know her at all cook shook her head he never came in the house even back then she never went out but he would of seen her from a distance peters just shook his head i didnt believe it i recalled him and kaid arguing after morley and i left now i knew why theyd been trying to make up their minds what do we do about the ghost doctor at the moment i was on her side despite what shed done to jennifer not hard to understand last night shed added adultery to the punishments visited upon stantnor twenty years after hed convicted her then jennifer and i had but why shouldnt she consider jennifer my victim the way shed been stantnors was there more to it than i knew i supposed doom could explain but i couldnt ask i shrugged go try to unravel motives and youll drive yourself crazy in my line youre better off dealing with results thats much more straightforward doom said she has to be laid to rest her staying here and walking the night thats far more cruel thats more punishment thats undeserved she needs peace he paused apparently expecting comment when he got none he added its not my place to be judgmental i suspect the man who killed her deserves all hes gotten and more but my own ethics dont let me let the victimization go on he was starting to look like a right guy despite his clown show most of the time thats the code i follow myself most of the time ive been known to get involved and consequently stumble into some homegrown justice sometimes i agree mostly what next doom worked his ugly face into a smile im going to work a constraint on the shade that will keep it from draining any more substance off the living the principal will begin to recover immediately once he regains some strength this is just a suggestion id like to call her up to confront him a direct confrontation will leave her less reluctant to go to her rest i think and i have a feeling that an exorcism against a hostile shade would be very difficult here yeah i reckoned he knew what he was talking about and a confrontation sounded good to me you cant do that jennifer protested that might kill him he might have a stroke nobody else much cared if he did at the moment there was very little love for stantnor around that place cook looked like she was considering ways she could help him across to the other shore shed raised him like her own but she was less than proud of him she said i got to get back to work lunch is going to be late as it is she stomped out keep an eye on her sarge i suggested shes pretty upset right doom didnt need help doing his constraint thing in fact he wanted to be alone there are always risks in these things i have a tendency to underestimate ghosts it would be safer for everybody if you stayed away till i finish i said you heard him the party broke up nobody said much to anybody else there was a lot of thinking going on peters went to the kitchen to ride herd on cook kaid went up to take care of the old man probably with severely mixed feelings i had them it was hard to reconcile the general stantnor of the cantard war with the vicious monster wed uncovered here morley went outside to talk about old times with dojango and his big green brothers i took jennifer up to her suite and put her back to bed alone to rest she was badly shaken seemed to want to curl up and make the world go away i didnt blame her id be the same way if i found out my father murdered my mother i didnt tell her why she was in such bad shape physically she had enough troubles and i still wasnt sure i could accept that myself nothing much to do till doom was ready to go i put my coat on and walked out to the stantnor graveyard i stared at eleanors marker awhile trying to make peace with myself it didnt work i noticed a shovel leaning against the fence wayne had left it behind as though hed known there would be more graves to dig and why bother lugging tools back and forth i found a spot and started digging trying to lose myself preparing chains resting place that didnt work very well it especially didnt work when after i was about three feet down i noticed eleanor by her tombstone watching me i stopped tried to read something from features that were none too clear in daylight shed been pretty substantial last night because shed sucked so much life out of stantnor had she taken on substance at other times to attack him by eliminating his servants a ghost could make murder put of even apparently accidental deaths by maddening a bull or maybe causing heart attacks im sorry eleanor i never meant to hurt you she didnt say anything she never did except that once when she found me outside peterss room she seemed to gain substance what was taking doom so long was she giving him more trouble than hed expected i tried to think about that the grave i was digging lunch the killer still to be caught anything but the sad futile brief life this woman had lived it didnt work i sat on the edge of the grave in the muck and cried for her then she was sitting opposite me wearing that look of concern the same one shed worn when shed found me hurt she didnt have enough substance not to be transparent i told her i wish it could have been different for you i wish you couldve lived in my time or i in yours and i meant it she reached out her touch was like the impact of falling swansdown she smiled a weak sad forgiving smile i tried to smile back but i couldnt there are evils in this world its the nature of things that there are though its a struggle accepting that because what eleanor stantnor had suffered through no fault of her own was an evil beyond ordinary evils it was the kind of evil that goes beyond man and rests squarely on the shoulders of the gods it was the kind of evil that had left me an essentially godless man i cant give allegiance to skybeasts whod let things like that happen to the undeserving general stantnor would suffer in turn but the guilt wasnt all his nor did it belong to eleanors parents her mother had tried to protect her nor did it belong to the world as a whole if there are gods at all they deserved equal pain i looked up doom must have been finishing up maybe getting an edge because she was distracted by me she had little substance left but she smiled as she faded at me maybe the guy who had been best to her ever and you can guess how little that made me feel i said be at peace eleanor then she was gone i dug some more in a fury like i was going to open a gate to hell and shove all the evils of the world down that hole when i had a grave a foot deeper than necessary i came to my senses sort of i hoisted myself out and headed for the house i had so much mud on me i feared somebody might mistake me for a draug i stopped and chatted with dojango and the boys but my heart wasnt in it i gave up after five minutes and headed for the house morley watched me go worried about the time i reached the head of the steps he said something to dojango trotted after me dojango sighed one of those sighs i recalled meant he felt immensely put upon hitched up his pants and started running down the drive what the hell i went inside as i passed the dead stantnors i told them what i thought of them and their ways and especially the last of their line morley caught up when i was halfway through are you all right garrett no im feeling about as bleak as i can and still be breathing but ill be all right just frustration over all the mindless wickedness in the world ill come back oh pure essence of garrett wishing he was triplets so he could straighten up three times as many messes i smiled feebly something like that you cant take it all on your own shoulders you cant no but its a hard lesson to learn and knowing that doesnt keep it from getting to you a tremendous metallic crash came from the main hall punctuated by a highpitched scream like a rabbits death cry we charged through the doorway bouncing off one another kaid lay six feet from where chain had died smashed by a suit of armor he wasnt dead not yet he made me think of a smashed bug his limbs still moved they stopped before we got the armor off him the light went out of his eyes as i knelt beside him and then there was one morley whispered and i know which one now i hated myself i should have known sooner it was there to be had doctor doom had been right id looked at it from the wrong angle all along but we all miss what we dont want to see id just concentrated way too much on motive blinded by the one motive i could see sometimes the motive doesnt make sense to anybody who isnt crazy yeah morley had it too pretty obvious right now but he didnt mention it he said cant do anything for him cant do anything about it this minute you go get yourself cleaned up wheres the point ive got to dig another grave that can wait you need to get clean ill keep an eye on things maybe he was right maybe he knew me too damned well a bath probably wouldnt help but it would be symbolic i went to the kitchen cook and peters had lunch almost ready they hadnt heard the crash amazingly i didnt tell them what had happened i just swiped all the hot water and headed for my suite they didnt ask questions i guess i looked too grim i didnt feel any better when i came back down clean and changed some things wont wash off anything i asked morley he shook his head except doom wants to see you i went to the room where id left the doctor he had heard but still was startled when he looked at me you look bad i told him he said i suspected it ive done everything i can here till we bring her up to face her husband i told him about my parting with eleanor he was a kind soul under that ugly exterior i know how you feel ive been there a few times your business mine they have their painful sides youll get another chance to say goodbye lets do it not yet youre not ready you need to calm down your state is too emotional right now i started to argue i dont tell you your business you dont tell me mine im not thinking about you we cant operate properly if theres too much extraneous emotion therell be plenty involving the key characters he was right i need to learn to separate myself more from my work all right ill get myself under control morley stuck his head in lunch youd better take time to have some garrett great everybody was looking out for garretts mental welfare i wanted to scream and holler and carry on i said ill be right there i guess i looked a little less ferocious now black pete watched me gobble whatever it was i wasnt seeing or tasting he asked did something happen yeah something did a suit of armor jumped off the fourth floor and squashed kaid dead huh he frowned he looked at cook she looked at him it took them maybe five seconds each then cook started crying quietly i told them soon as were done here were going up to see the old man well wrap it up peters said its almost not worth the trouble anymore and im almost sorry i ever came looking for you im sure sorry you did i finished stuffing my face never having tasted a bite nobody else was in as big a hurry morley watched me like he was afraid i was going to blow i told him ive got it under control iceberg garrett cucumber garrett id turned off everything inside but i didnt look it outside yet like the heat going out of a corpse it would take awhile for the fury and frustration to radiate away they ate slower and slower like kids knowing they were going to get taken to the woodshed after supper i told morley im going up to the room be back in a minute id forgotten something one of snakes paintings when i returned everybody was done eating doctor doom was there with his tools snakes masterpiece under his arm he was ready to go he checked everybody over seemed satisfied with my emotional control he asked me you want to get the girl sure morley you carry this we trooped across the hall past kaid averting our eyes we climbed stairs i broke away at the third floor and went to jennifers room the door was locked but i had my skeleton key this time i went through the big room into the sitting room where id found her during the night she was there again in the same chair facing the same window she was asleep her face was as untroubled as a babys wake up jennifer i shook her shoulder she jumped what she calmed down quickly what again were going up to see your father come on i dont want to go youre going to itll kill him i dont want to be there i couldnt handle it i think you can and you have to be there things wont work out unless you are i took hold of her hand led her she hung back making me pull her but she didnt fight me the rest were in stantnors sitting room waiting as soon as jennifer and i arrived peters pushed on the next room was a private sitting room like the one in jennifers suite we trudged through into the bedroom the old man looked like a mummy that hadnt gotten the word and kept on breathing his eyes were closed and his mouth was open some kind of slime bubbled out and dribbled down his cheek every third breath sounded like a death rattle we got to work i collected paintings morley planted himself beside the door peters wakened the general and sat him up cook started feeding the fire the old man looked like hell but his eyes were bright when they focused his mind hadnt deserted him he saw how grim everybody looked knew id come with my final report i told him no point you wasting strength talking general or arguing its final report time wont take long but i warn you its worse than you dreamed i wont make recommendations ill give it to you and you can do what you want with it his eyes sparked angrily i said the man you dont recognize is doctor doom a specialist in paranormal activities hes been a big help you dont see wayne because he quit he left this morning chain and kaid arent here because they were taken suddenly dead like hawkes and bradon by the same hand doctor doom started doing his part i gave him a little time to get rolling lips tightened into a colorless prune stantnor watched only his eyes moved they werent filled with gratitude when they turned my way there was something behind the anger in them too he was worried i told him first well talk about whos been trying to kill you doom let out a howl everybody jumped a flash filled the room im no pro but that didnt feel right you all right i asked he gasped its fighting me but ill get it here stay out of my way and dont bother me it took him a few minutes more eleanor materialized at the foot of stantnors bed but not as eleanor not right away first she did a good snake bradon then a less credible cutter hawkes before surrendering to dooms will i compared her to the portrait they said stantnor stared at all the time it didnt look much like her and nothing like the woman in bradons painting stantnors eyes got huge he sat up straight no he squeaked he threw up an arm to shield his eyes no get her away he started whimpering like a whipped child get her out of here you said my job was to make you face the truth no matter how unpleasant that truth might be general one truth ive uncovered is this im going to enjoy making you face it the woman you tortured and murdered jennifer burst out he killed her my mother it wasnt a doctor she staggered keep her under control morley morley left the door moved to support her she started blubbering words dribbled out but none of them made sense stantnor sputtered like he was going to run a bluff spittle ran down his chin he couldnt talk he was too rattled he looked like he might have the stroke jennifer had predicted i faced eleanor go now rest youve done enough it doesnt become you dont darken your soul any more our eyes locked we stared at one another till the others grew restless i said please and wasnt quite sure what i was pleading for shell rest easy mr garrett doom said gently thats a promise turn her loose then she doesnt need i shut my mouth before i said something that might cause me more trouble than i could handle i closed my eyes got myself under control when i opened them eleanor was little more than a wraith she smiled for me goodbye goodbye i took another minute before i faced the old man he was gasping and wheezing but less distressed i brought along a little something for you to remember her by general youll love it i took down the junk portrait of eleanor flipped it away replaced it with bradons masterpiece isnt that better stantnor stared at it and the longer he stared the more terrified he became he screamed i looked at the portrait i damned near screamed i cant tell you what it was it hadnt changed in any obvious way but it had changed it told eleanors story you couldnt look at it and not be crushed by her pain and her fear of the thing that pursued her that mad shadow that wore the face of a young stantnor i tore my gaze away just before doom did it for me he told me you still have work to do his voice was soft and calm it reached way down inside me like the dead mans can and gentled that part of me about to stumble over the brink what are you doing he asked i want him to know he has to spend the rest of his life looking at that not now lets go on youre right of course peters get his attention away from the painting for a minute peters turned the old mans head i watched madness fade from stantnors eyes no it wasnt madness not exactly hed just been focused on something far away that only he could see on his own vision of hell he was back now for a few minutes at least i have another present for you i told him youll like this one too to make sure he paid attention i turned eleanors portrait to the wall i replaced it with snakes last portrait of jennifer your lovely daughter so like her father jennifer screamed she threw herself forward morley caught her in a painful comealong she didnt notice the pain cook stopped feeding the fire elbowed morley aside took jennifer into her arms took the knife away from her controlled her held her wept over her murmured my baby my baby my poor sick baby nobody else said anything everybody knew even the general knew theres why your stable burned that painting she sat for bradon several times but snake bradon had an eye that could see the true soul which is probably why he retreated from the world a man with his eye would see a lot of awful truths i look for truth but this time i didnt see it soon enough maybe i didnt want to like so many of the darkest evils this one came in a beautiful package maybe the painting of eleanor preoccupied me too much maybe i should have studied this one more closely stantnor interrupted eight murders general your baby killed eight mostly good men four she lured to the swamp on the melchior place once id accepted jennifer as the villain the pieces had fallen together took a while but i finally figured what they had in common they were all chasers she pretended she was catchable she got them out there and killed them and dropped them in that got her past the stumbling block i came up against whenever i wondered if she might be the killer how did she move the bodies i missed the obvious answer that she got them to move themselves the heaviest work she ever did was shove chain off the fourthfloor balcony and drop a suit of armor on kaid maybe i was slow because the murders werent the kind you associate with women i just didnt face the fact that in a house full of marines everybody might think like marines and be straightforward and bloody whod picture a woman being daring enough to take on a trained commando with a kef sidhe stranglers cord i looked at jennifer thought of our stroll to the graveyard shed planned to kill me out there i knew now id offered her an unexpected moment of kindness that had saved my life and had cost her her chance to get away with everything i know who and how but i sure as hell dont understand why she cracked she laughed and wept and talked a yard a second and never made a lick of sense it seemed to have to do with a fear that if there were any heirs but her and cook parts of the estate would get sold off and once it was dismembered shed be forced to leave for that deadly world shed visited only once when she was fourteen i was wrong about one thing she hadnt committed eight murders shed committed eleven shed done in the three men whose deaths had seemed natural or accidental she admitted it she bragged about it she laughed because shed made fools of everybody till now stantnor stared at her the whole time aghast i knew what he was thinking what had he done to deserve this i started to tell him garrett morley took hold of my arm what its time to go the jobs done doom had gone already his part complete eleanor laid to rest cook was trying to comfort and control jennifer and to work out some separate peace with herself the girl wasnt the daughter of her flesh but stantnor had become fixated on his daughters portrait seeing deeper than anyone but bradon had maybe seeing the hand hed had in creating a monster i had no pity for him i did try to find it it just wasnt there then he had one of his fits this one went on and on and on garrett its time to go the old man was dying rough morley didnt want to stay for the show peters just stood there numb doing nothing he didnt know what to do i did pity him i shook off the hold emotion had on me i told morley stantnor owes me i spent my whole fee and then some getting him his answers it dont look like hell hang around to be billed he looked at me weird that kind of cold remark wasnt in character dont he said though he had no idea what i was going to do lets just go forget it i wont charge you for my time no i snagged the painting of eleanor my fee an original bradon the general didnt argue he was busy dying i looked at peters he just shrugged he didnt care morley snapped garrett he was sure i was going to do something id regret wait a damned minute i still had a responsibility here cook whatre you going to do she looked at me like id asked the dumbest question possible what i always done boy look after the place get hold of me if i can do anything then i followed morley i didnt think another thought about the old man if thered been a doctor outside who could have saved him i doubt it would have occurred to me to mention his distress peters was at the vestibule door when morley and i got there carrying paintings and my stuff he was staring at the great hall the way id stared at bradons painting of the swamp and hanged man he had a shovel in one hand he had graves to dig i wondered if anybody would bother giving stantnor a marker he said i dont think i can say thanks garrett you came when i called but i dont think id have visited you if id known i wouldnt have come if id known were even whatre you going to do bury the dead then go somewhere maybe back into the corps theyll need veterans with mooncalled running amok and its all i know anyway yeah good luck see you again someday sarge sure we both knew wed never see one another again a terrible scream came from upstairs it went on and on till it seemed no human throat could have produced it we all looked up peters said i guess hes dead he said it with a complete lack of passion the scream came again now it was filled with mad rage cook boomed miss jenny you come back here the girl had cracked completely she flew out of the fourthfloor hallway carrying a dagger screaming shocked i realized she was yelling my name get moving garrett morley said hed seen berserkers before even a ninetyfivepound woman could tear me apart she was so far out of her mind she didnt know where she was realization hit her too late she hit the balcony rail full speed the heroic knight caught her in his lap broken she dribbled down off him wound up at one of the dragons feet she looked like the monsters prey the hero had come to her rescue moments too late but this hero had been way too late to save anybody i turned and walked morley stayed behind me just in case i did some damnfool thing like try to go back morley and i didnt talk much on the way home once i muttered something about finding another line of work and he just told me not to be a damned fool i asked if hed filled his pockets while he was there or planned to drop back in some midnight usually if i ask something like that he just looks at me like he hasnt got the faintest idea what im talking about i wouldnt take anything out of that place if you paid me garrett not if you begged me theres a darkness in every stone every thing in there we didnt talk again till we were coming up macunado street toward my house then he said go in there and get roaring drunk falling down puking drunk get the poison out thats the best idea youve had in years dean let me in he looked older and leaner though itd been only a few days mr garrett we were concerned not hearing from you for so long we i grumbled he was going to fuss over me him he jerked his head toward the dead mans room hes been awake since you left expecting you to ask for help i handled this one alone boy did i handle it oh hed gotten the sense of my mood guess id better draw one i might drink a whole barrel that bad worse find me a hammer too i eased into my office checked the spot where i meant to hang eleanor dean went he moved with a swiftness i should remember next time he went at his customary snails pace he was back with a beer a hammer and a cup of nails in less than a minute i drained the beer mug more ill start a meal too you look like you could use one old sneak going to get something on my stomach before i started my serious drinking i did miss your cooking where i was i drove a nail into the wall dean brought beery reinforcements before i unwrapped eleanor this time he brought a pitcher as well as a mug i unwrapped the lady and hung her stepped back it wasnt the same picture well yes it was but something had changed the intensity the passion the horror werent there but it looked the same except eleanor seemed to be smiling she seemed to be running to something instead of from something no it was the same nothing had changed but me i turned my back on it snake bradon hadnt been that great a painter i glanced over my shoulder eleanor smiled at me i downed another mug dean scurried off to get something cooking before i downed enough to pass out the dead man dragged me into his room almost against my will and dragged the story out of me he didnt criticize which was unusual we didnt get into an argument despite my best efforts instead of climbing all over me for my mistakes for not having recognized that jennifer was crazy and a killer earlier than i had he made thoughtful sounds in my mind when i finished he meandered off on an extended review of the latest news from the cantard i got interested despite myself glory mooncalled had attacked full harbor hed postured and threatened too much hed had to prove he wasnt all wind hed done his damnedest launching night attacks from the sea and air using cantard creatures hed tried to capture the city gates so he could get his ground troops inside and hed gotten his ass whipped just as id predicted there goes the myth of his invincibility i told the dead man he responded with a huge mental chuckle not at all now they will chase after him to finish him off into his country oh so if he whipped them out there there wouldnt be enough defenders to hold the city next time he attacked maybe and our boys would chase him in a mob we dont have enough competent commanders our last really capable man retired three years ago i am curious garrett why would the woman hit you in the head in the sergeants quarters you had rendered yourself immune by plying her with your adolescent charm he couldnt resist getting in a small needle here and there i dont think she wanted to kill me she just wanted to get the copy of the will before i did why i had the feeling hed figured it out and wanted to see if i had for exactly the opposite of the reason i assumed at the time she wanted to destroy it if she could get rid of the copies she wouldnt need to kill people thered be no evidence there were any other heirs the law would pass the estate to her no dismemberment no need for her to leave and how did she know where to find the copy i think she was behind the wall listening when i talked to peters i think a lot of the time she was supposed to be in her rooms she was creeping around in the walls listening in look i really dont want to talk about it i have one for you why did eleanor pretend to be morley and how could she do it so slick that i never suspected a thing she did it because she wanted to know more about you your fatal charm again you had caught her eye how is quite simple especially for one with her antecedents she simply opened your mind and made herself a mirror she did not have to know a thing about mr dotes she just had to make you think she did you did all the work almost like a dream there was an implication remote that i didnt like if eleanor had been inside my head she knew all about why i was there she probably could have told me about jennifer any time she could have saved i didnt want to think about it thats a little much to swallow watch suddenly that fifth of a ton of dead meat was gone and in his place was a guy named denny tate who was so real we talked about things the dead man couldnt possibly know solid proof rock solid denny tate had been dead more than a year a good choice by the dead man i couldnt call it a trick he wasnt somebody who could be sneaked in for a little sleight of eye and denny was one of the few people important to me whod died untimely without violence the silly sack had fallen off a horse and broken his neck enough old bones im a believer denny tate vanished what replaced him was ugly as sin but i didnt tell him so not today my mood hadnt vanished i almost asked him to conjure eleanor man a guy could set up a hell of a racket faking calling up the dearly departed think about something else the dead man suggested id love to chuckles but it isnt that easy hell i couldnt do anything right not even get drunk i was barely lightheaded you need a distraction right so conjure me a miracle old bones somebody hammered on the front door the dead man is dead in the flesh anyway but i swear he looked like he was smiling dean hollered can you get that mr garrett im right in the middle here ive got both hands full muttering i stomped down the hall and flung the door open without bothering to look first maya hi garrett bright perky like shed never been gone except maybe to step around the corner she walked in like she belonged which she did as i started to close the door i caught a glimpse of morley dotes holding up a wall down the street smiling that slick bastard hed sent dojango ahead to set this up i bet he knew where maya was all along maybe they all had from the kitchen dean called welcome back miss maya dinner will be ready in a minute he never looked to see who it was set me up good they did maya took my hand and led me down the hall for a second i resented everybody ganging up on me but i didnt spend a whole lot of time worrying about it maya was there i was distracted
