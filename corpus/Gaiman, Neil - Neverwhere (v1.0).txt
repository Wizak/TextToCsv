every night and all fire and fleet and candlelight and christ receive they soul if ever thou gavest meat or drink then every night and all the fire shall never make thee shrink and christ receive thy soul the lyke wake dirge prologue the night before he went to london richard mayhew was not enjoying himself he had begun the evening by enjoying himself he had enjoyed reading the goodbye cards and receiving the hugs from several not entirely unattractive young ladies of his acquaintance he had enjoyed the warnings about the evils and dangers of london and the gift of the white umbrella with the map of the london underground on it that his friends had chipped in money to buy he had enjoyed the first few pints of ale but then with each successive pint he found that he was enjoying himself significantly less until now he was sitting and shivering on the sidewalk outside the pub in a small scottish town weighing the relative merits of being sick and not being sick and not enjoying himself at all inside the pub richards friends continued to celebrate his forthcoming departure with an enthusiasm that to richard was beginning to border on the sinister he sat on the sidewalk and held on tightly to the rolledup umbrella and wondered whether going south to london was really a good idea you want to keep a eye out said a cracked old voice theyll be moving you on before you can say jack robinson or taking you in i wouldnt be surprised two sharp eyes stared out from a beaky grimy face you all right yes thank you said richard he was a freshfaced boyish young man with dark slightly curly hair and large hazel eyes he had a rumpled justwokenup look to him which made him more attractive to the opposite sex than he would ever understand or believe the grimy face softened here poor thing she said and pushed a fiftypence piece into richards hand ow long you been on the streets then im not homeless explained richard embarrassed attempting to give the old woman her coin back pleasetake your money im fine i just came out here to get some air i go to london tomorrow he added she peered down at him suspiciously then took back her fifty pence and made it vanish beneath the layers of coats and shawls in which she was enveloped ive been to london she confided i was married in london but he was a bad lot me mam told me not to go marrying outside but i was young and beautiful although youd never credit it today and i followed my heart im sure you did said richard the conviction that he was about to be sick was starting slowly to fade fat lot of good it done me i been homeless so i know what its like said the old woman thats why i thought you was what you going to london for ive got a job he told her proudly doing what she asked um securities said richard i was a dancer said the old woman and she tottered awkwardly around the sidewalk humming tunelessly to herself then she teetered from side to side like a spinning top coming to rest and finally she stopped facing richard hold out your hand she told him and ill tell yer fortune he did as he was told she put her old hand into his and held it tightly and then she blinked a few times like an owl who had swallowed a mouse that was beginning to disagree with it you got a long way to go she said puzzled london richard told her not just london the old woman paused not any london i know it started to rain then softly im sorry she said it starts with doors doors she nodded the rain fell harder pattering on the roofs and on the asphalt of the road id watch out for doors if i were you richard stood up a little unsteadily all right he said a little unsure of how he ought to treat information of this nature i will thanks the pub door was opened and light and noise spilled out into the street richard you all right yeah im fine ill be back in a second the old lady was already wobbling down the street into the pelting rain getting wet richard felt he had to do something for her he couldnt give her money though he hurried after her down the narrow street the cold rain drenching his face and hair here said richard he fumbled with the handle of the umbrella trying to find the button that opened it then a click and it blossomed into a huge white map of the london underground network each line drawn in a different color every station marked and named the old woman took the umbrella gratefully and smiled her thanks youve a good heart she told him sometimes thats enough to see you safe wherever you go then she shook her head but mostly its not she clutched the umbrella tightly as a gust of wind threatened to tug it away from her or pull it inside out she wrapped her arms around it and bent almost double against the rain and the wind then she walked away into the rain and the night a round white shape covered with the names of london tube stationsearls court marble arch blackfriars white city victoria angel oxford circus richard found himself pondering drunkenly whether there really was a circus at oxford circus a real circus with clowns beautiful women and dangerous beasts the pub door opened once more a blast of sound as if the pubs volume control had just been turned up high richard you idiot its your bloody party and youre missing all the fun he walked back in the pub the urge to be sick lost in all the oddness you look like a drowned rat said someone youve never seen a drowned rat said richard someone else handed him a large whisky here get that down you thatll warm you up you know you wont be able to get real scotch in london im sure i will sighed richard water was dripping from his hair into his drink they have everything in london and he downed the scotch and after that someone bought him another and then the evening blurred and broke up into fragments afterward he remembered only the feeling that he was about to leave somewhere small and rationala place that made sensefor somewhere huge and old that didnt and vomiting interminably into a gutter flowing with rainwater somewhere in the small hours of the morning and a white shape marked with strangecolored symbols like a little round beetle walking away from him in the rain the next morning he boarded the train for the sixhour journey south that would bring him to the strange gothic spires and arches of st pancras station his mother gave him a small walnut cake that she had made for the journey and a thermos filled with tea and richard mayhew went to london feeling like hell one she had been running for four days now a harumscarum tumbling flight through passages and tunnels she was hungry and exhausted and more tired than a body could stand and each successive door was proving harder to open after four days of flight she had found a hiding place a tiny stone burrow under the world where she would be safe or so she prayed and at last she slept mr croup had hired ross at the last floating market which had been held in westminster abbey think of him he told mr vandemar as a canary sings asked mr vandemar i doubt it i sincerely and utterly doubt it mr croup ran a hand through his lank orange hair no my fine friend i was thinking metaphoricallymore along the lines of the birds they take down mines mr vandemar nodded comprehension dawning slowly yes a canary mr ross had no other resemblance to a canary he was hugealmost as big as mr vandemarand extremely grubby and quite hairless and he said very little although he had made a point of telling each of them that he liked to kill things and he was good at it and this amused mr croup and mr vandemar but he was a canary and he never knew it so mr ross went first in his filthy tshirt and his crusted bluejeans and croup and vandemar walked behind him in their elegant black suits there are four simple ways for the observant to tell mr croup and mr vandemar apart first mr vandemar is two and a half heads taller than mr croup second mr croup has eyes of a faded china blue while mr vandemars eyes are brown third while mr vandemar fashioned the rings he wears on his right hand out of the skulls of four ravens mr croup has no obvious jewelery fourth mr croup likes words while mr vandemar is always hungry also they look nothing at all alike a rustle in the tunnel darkness mr vandemars knife was in his hand and then it was no longer in his hand and it was quivering gently almost thirty feet away he walked over to his knife and picked it up by the hilt there was a gray rat impaled on the blade its mouth opening and closing impotently as the life fled he crushed its skull between finger and thumb now theres one rat that wont be telling any more tales said mr croup he chuckled at his own joke mr vandemar did not respond rat tales get it mr vandemar pulled the rat from the blade and began to munch on it thoughtfully head first mr croup slapped it out of his hands stop that he said mr vandemar put his knife away a little sullenly buck up hissed mr croup encouragingly there will always be another rat now onward things to do people to damage three years in london had not changed richard although it had changed the way he perceived the city richard had originally imagined london as a gray city even a black city from pictures he had seen and he was surprised to find it filled with color it was a city of red brick and white stone red buses and large black taxis bright red mailboxes and green grassy parks and cemeteries it was a city in which the very old and the awkwardly new jostled each other not uncomfortably but without respect a city of shops and offices and restaurants and homes of parks and churches of ignored monuments and remarkably unpalatial palaces a city of hundreds of districts with strange namescrouch end chalk farm earls court marble archand oddly distinct identities a noisy dirty cheerful troubled city which fed on tourists needed them as it despised them in which the average speed of transportation through the city had not increased in three hundred years following five hundred years of fitful roadwidening and unskillful compromises between the needs of traffic whether horsedrawn or more recently motorized and the needs of pedestrians a city inhabited by and teeming with people of every color and manner and kind when he had first arrived he had found london huge odd fundamentally incomprehensible with only the tube map that elegant multicolored topographical display of underground railway lines and stations giving it any semblance of order gradually he realized that the tube map was a handy fiction that made life easier but bore no resemblance to the reality of the shape of the city above it was like belonging to a political party he thought once proudly and then having tried to explain the resemblance between the tube map and politics at a party to a cluster of bewildered strangers he had decided in the future to leave political comment to others he continued slowly by a process of osmosis and white knowledge to comprehend the city a process that accelerated when he realized that the actual city of london itself was no bigger than a square mile stretching from aldgate in the east to fleet street and the law courts of the old bailey in the west a tiny municipality now home to londons financial institutions and that that was where it had all begun two thousand years before london had been a little celtic village on the north shore of the thames which the romans had encountered then settled in london had grown slowly until roughly a thousand years later it met the tiny royal city of westminster immediately to the west and once london bridge had been built london touched the town of southwark directly across the river and it continued to grow fields and woods and marshland slowly vanishing beneath the flourishing town and it continued to expand encountering other little villages and hamlets as it grew like whitechapel and deptford to the east hammersmith and shepherds bush to the west camden and islington in the north battersea and lambeth across the thames to the south absorbing all of them just as a pool of mercury encounters and incorporates smaller beads of mercury leaving only their names behind london grew into something huge and contradictory it was a good place and a fine city but there is a price to be paid for all good places and a price that all good places have to pay after a while richard found himself taking london for granted in time he began to pride himself on having visited none of the sights of london but jessica changed all that richard found himself on otherwise sensible weekends accompanying her to places like the national gallery and the tate gallery where he learned that walking around museums too long hurts your feet that the great art treasures of the world all blur into each other after a while and that it is almost beyond the human capacity for belief to accept how much museum cafeterias will brazenly charge for a slice of cake and a cup of tea heres your tea and your йclair he told her it would have cost less to buy one of those tintorettos dont exaggerate said jessica cheerfully anyway there arent any tintorettos at the tate i should have had that cherry cake said richard then they would have been able to afford another van gogh richard had met jessica in france on a weekend trip to paris two years earlier had in fact discovered her in the louvre trying to find the group of his office friends who had organized the trip staring up at an immense sculpture he had stepped backwards into jessica who was admiring an extremely large and historically important diamond he tried to apologize to her in french which he did not speak gave up and began to apologize in english then tried to apologize in french for having to apologize in english until he noticed that jessica was about as english as it was possible for any one person to be by this time she decided he should buy her an expensive french sandwich and some overpriced carbonated apple juice by way of apology and well that was the start of it all really he had never been able to convince jessica that he wasnt the kind of person who went to art galleries after that on weekends when they did not go to art galleries or to museums richard would trail behind jessica as she went shopping which she did on the whole in affluent knightsbridge a short walk and an even shorter taxi ride from her apartment in a kensington mews richard would accompany jessica on her tours of such huge and intimidating emporia as harrods and harvey nichols stores where jessica was able to purchase anything from jewelry to books to the weeks groceries richard had been awed by jessica who was beautiful and often quite funny and was certainly going somewhere and jessica saw in richard an enormous amount of potential which properly harnessed by the right woman would have made him the perfect matrimonial accessory if only he were a little more focused she would murmur to herself and so she gave him books with titles like dress for success and a hundred and twentyfive habits of successful men and books on how to run a business like a military campaign and richard always said thank you and always intended to read them in harvey nicholss mens fashion department she would pick out for him the kinds of clothes she thought that he should wearand he wore them during the week anyway and a year to the day after their first encounter she told him she thought it was time that they went shopping for an engagement ring why do you go out with her asked gary in corporate accounts eighteen months later shes terrifying richard shook his head shes really sweet once you get to know her gary put down the plastic troll doll he had picked up from richards desk im surprised she still lets you play with these the subject has never come up said richard picking up one of the creatures from his desk it had a shock of dayglo orange hair and a slightly baffled expression as if it were lost and the subject had indeed come up jessica had however convinced herself that richards troll collection was a mark of endearing eccentricity comparable to mr stocktons collection of angels jessica was in the process of organizing a traveling exhibition of mr stocktons angel collection and she had come to the conclusion that great men always collected something in actuality richard did not really collect trolls he had found a troll on the sidewalk outside the office and in a vain attempt at injecting a little personality into his working world he had placed it on his computer monitor the others had followed over the next few months gifts from colleagues who had noticed that richard had a penchant for the ugly little creatures he had taken the gifts and positioned them strategically around his desk beside the telephones and the framed photograph of jessica the photograph had a yellow postit note stuck to it it was a friday afternoon richard had noticed that events were cowards they didnt occur singly but instead they would run in packs and leap out at him all at once take this particular friday for example it was as jessica had pointed out to him at least a dozen times in the last month the most important day of his life so it was unfortunate that despite the postit note richard had left on his fridge door at home and the other postit note he had placed on the photograph of jessica on his desk he had forgotten about it completely and utterly also there was the wandsworth report which was overdue and taking up most of his head richard checked another row of figures then he noticed that page had vanished and he set it up to print out again and another page down and he knew that if he were only left alone to finish it if miracle of miracles the phone did not ring it rang he thumbed the speakerphone hello richard the managing director needs to know when hell have the report richard looked at his watch five minutes sylvia its almost wrapped up i just have to attach the p l projection thanks dick ill come down for it sylvia was as she liked to explain the mds pa and she moved in an atmosphere of crisp efficiency he thumbed the speakerphone off it rang again immediately richard said the speaker with jessicas voice its jessica you havent forgotten have you forgotten he tried to remember what he could have forgotten he looked at jessicas photograph for inspiration and found all the inspiration he could have needed in the shape of a yellow postit note stuck to her forehead richard pick up the telephone he picked up the phone reading the postit note as he did so sorry jess no i hadnt forgotten seven pm at ma maison italiano should i meet you there jessica richard not jess she paused for a moment after what happened last time i dont think so you really could get lost in your own backyard richard richard thought about pointing out that anyone could have confused the national gallery with the national portrait gallery and that it wasnt she who had spent the whole day standing in the rain but he thought better of it ill meet you at your place said jessica we can walk down together right jess jessicasorry you have confirmed our reservation havent you richard yes lied richard earnestly the other line on his phone had begun to ring jessica look i good said jessica and she broke the connection he picked up the other line hi dick its me gary gary sat a few desks down from richard he waved are we still on for drinks you said we could go over the merstham account get off the bloody phone gary of course we are richard put down the phone there was a telephone number at the bottom of the postit note richard had written the postit note to himself several weeks earlier and he had made the reservation he was almost certain of that but he had not confirmed it he had kept meaning to but there had been so much to do and richard had known that there was plenty of time but events run in packs sylvia was now standing next to him dick the wandsworth report almost ready sylvia look just hold on a sec can you he finished punching in the number breathed a sigh of relief when somebody answered ma maison can i help you yes said richard a table for three for tonight i think i booked it and if i did im confirming the reservation and if i didnt i wondered if i could book it please no they had no record of a table for tonight in the name of mayhew or stockton or bartramjessicas surname and as for booking a table it wasnt the words that richard found so unpleasant it was the tone of voice in which the information was transmitted a table for tonight should certainly have been booked years beforeperhaps it was implied by richards parents a table for tonight was impossible if the pope the prime minister and the president of france arrived this evening without a confirmed reservation even they would be turned out into the street with a continental jeer but its for my fiancees boss i know i should have phoned before there are only three of us cant you please they had put down the phone richard said sylvia the mds waiting do you think asked richard theyd give me a table if i phoned back and offered them extra money in her dream they were all together in the house her parents her brother her baby sister they were standing together in the ballroom staring at her they were all so pale so grave portia her mother touched her cheek and told her that she was in danger in her dream door laughed and said she knew her mother shook her head no nonow she was in danger now door opened her eyes the door was opening quietly quietly she held her breath footsteps quiet on the stone perhaps he wont notice me she thought perhaps hell go away and then she thought desperately im hungry the footsteps hesitated she was well hidden she knew under a pile of newspapers and rags and it was possible that the intruder meant her no harm cant he hear my heartbeat she thought and then the footsteps came closer and she knew what she had to do and it scared her a hand pulled the covers off her and she looked up into a blank utterly hairless face which creased into a vicious smile she rolled then and twisted and the knife blade aimed at her chest caught her in the upper arm until that moment she had never thought she could do it never thought she would be brave enough or scared enough or desperate enough to dare but she reached up one hand to his chest and she opened he gasped and tumbled onto her it was wet and warm and slippery and she slithered and staggered out from under the man and she stumbled out of the room she caught her breath in the tunnel outside narrow and low as she fell against the wall breathing in gasps and sobs that had taken the last of her strength now she was spent her shoulder was beginning to throb the knife she thought but she was safe my oh my said a voice from the darkness on her right she survived mister ross well i never mister vandemar the voice oozed it sounded like gray slime well i never either mister croup said a flat voice on her left a light was kindled and flickered still said mr croup his eyes gleaming in the dark beneath the earth she wont survive us door kneed him hard in the groin and then she pushed herself forward her right hand holding her left shoulder and she ran dick richard waved away the interruption life was almost under his control now just a little more time gary said his name again dick its sixthirty its what papers and pens and spreadsheets and trolls were tumbled into richards briefcase he snapped it shut and ran he pulled his coat on as he went gary was following are we going to have that drink then richard paused for a moment if ever he decided they made disorganization an olympic sport he could be disorganized for britain gary he said im sorry i blew it i have to see jessica tonight were taking her boss out to dinner mister stockton of stocktons the stockton richard nodded they hurried down the stairs im sure youll have fun said gary insincerely and how is the creature from the black lagoon jessicas from ilford actually gary and she remains the light and love of my life thank you very much for asking they reached the lobby and richard made a dash for the automatic doors which spectacularly failed to open its after six mister mayhew said mr figgis the buildings security guard you have to sign out i dont need this said richard to no one in particular i really dont mr figgis smelled vaguely of medicinal liniment and was widely rumored to have an encyclopedic collection of softcore pornography he guarded the doors with a diligence that bordered upon madness never quite having lived down the evening when an entire floors worth of computer equipment upped and left along with two potted palms and the managing directors axminster carpet so our drinks off then im sorry gary is monday okay for you sure mondays fine see you monday mr figgis inspected their signatures and satisfied himself they had no computers potted palms or carpets about their persons then he pressed a button under his desk and the door slid open doors said richard the underway branched and divided she picked her way at random ducking through tunnels running and stumbling and weaving behind her strolled mr croup and mr vandemar as calmly and cheerfully as victorian dignitaries visiting the crystal palace exhibition when they arrived at a crossroads mr croup would kneel and find the nearest spot of blood and they would follow it they were like hyenas exhausting their prey they could wait they had all the time in the world luck was with richard for a change he caught a black taxi driven by an elderly man who took richard home by an unlikely route involving streets richard had never before seen while holding forth as richard had discovered all london taxi drivers will hold forthgiven a living breathing englishspeaking passengeron londons innercity traffic problems how best to deal with crime and thorny political issues of the day richard jumped out of the cab left a tip and his briefcase behind managed to flag down the cab again before it made it into the main road and so got his briefcase back then he ran up the stairs and into his apartment he was already shedding clothes as he entered the hall his briefcase spun across the room and crashlanded on the sofa he took his keys from his pocket and placed them carefully on the hall table in order to ensure he did not forget them then he dashed into the bedroom the buzzer sounded richard threequarters of the way into his best suit launched himself at the speaker richard its jessica i hope youre ready oh yes be right down he pulled on a coat and he ran slamming the door behind him jessica was waiting for him at the bottom of the stairs she always waited for him there jessica didnt like richards apartment it made her feel uncomfortably female there was always the chance of finding a pair of richards underwear well anywhere not to mention the wandering lumps of congealed toothpaste on the bathroom sink no it was not jessicas kind of place jessica was very beautiful so much so richard would occasionally find himself staring at her wondering how did she end up with me and when they made lovewhich they did at jessicas apartment in fashionable kensington in jessicas brass bed with the crisp white linen sheets in the darkness afterwards she would hold him very tightly and her long brown curls would tumble over his chest and she would whisper to him how much she loved him and he would tell her he loved her and always wanted to be with her and they both believed it to be true bless me mister vandemar shes slowing up slowing up mister croup she must be losing a lot of blood mister v lovely blood mister c lovely wet blood not long now a click the sound of a switchblade opening empty and lonely and dark richard what are you doing asked jessica nothing jessica you havent forgotten your keys again have you no jessica richard stopped patting himself and pushed his hands deep into the pockets of his coat now when you meet mister stockton tonight said jessica you have to appreciate that hes not just a very important man hes also a corporate entity in his own right i cant wait sighed richard what was that richard i cant wait said richard rather more enthusiastically oh please hurry up said jessica who was beginning to exude an aura of what in a lesser woman might almost have been described as nerves we mustnt keep mister stockton waiting no jess dont call me that richard i loathe pet names theyre so demeaning spare any change the man sat in a doorway his beard was yellow and gray and his eyes were sunken and dark a handlettered sign hung from a piece of frayed string around his neck and rested on his chest telling anyone with the eyes to read it that he was homeless and hungry it didnt take a sign to tell you that richard hand already in his pocket fumbled for a coin richard we havent got the time said jessica who gave to charity and invested ethically now i do want you to make a good impression fiancewise it is vital that a future spouse makes a good impression and then her face creased and she hugged him for a moment and said oh richard i do love you you do know that dont you and richard nodded and he did jessica checked her watch and increased her pace richard discreetly flicked a pound coin back through the air toward the man in the doorway who caught it in one grimy hand there wasnt any problem with the reservations was there asked jessica and richard who was not much good at lying when faced with a direct question said ah she had chosen wronglythe corridor ended in a blank wall normally that would hardly have given her pause but she was so tired so hungry in so much pain she leaned against the wall feeling the bricks roughness against her face she was gulping breath hiccuping and sobbing her arm was cold and her left hand was numb she could go no farther and the world was beginning to feel very distant she wanted to stop to lie down and to sleep for a hundred years oh bless my little black soul mister vandemar do you see what i see the voice was soft close they must have been nearer to her than she had imagined i spy with my little eye something thats going to be dead in a minute mister croup said the flat voice from above her our principal will be delighted and the girl pulled whatever she could find deep inside her soul from all the pain and the hurt and the fear she was spent burnt out and utterly exhausted she had nowhere to go no power left no time if its the last door i open she prayed silently to the temple to the arch somewhere anywhere safe and then she thought wildly somebody and as she began to pass out she tried to open a door as the darkness took her she heard mr croups voice as if from a long way away it said bugger and blast jessica and richard walked down the sidewalk toward the restaurant she had her arm through his and was walking as fast as her heels permitted he hurried to keep up streetlights and the fronts of closed stores illuminated their path they passed a stretch of tall looming buildings abandoned and lonely bounded by a high brick wall you are honestly telling me you had to promise them an extra fifty pounds for our table tonight you are an idiot richard said jessica her dark eyes flashing they had lost my reservation and they said all the tables were booked their steps echoed off the high walls theyll probably have us sitting by the kitchen said jessica or the door did you tell them it was for mister stockton yes replied richard jessica sighed she continued to drag him along as a door opened in the wall a little way ahead of them someone stepped out and stood swaying for one long terrible moment and then collapsed to the concrete richard shivered and stopped in his tracks jessica tugged him into motion now when youre talking to mister stockton you must make sure you dont interrupt him or disagree with himhe doesnt like to be disagreed with when he makes a joke laugh if youre in any doubt as to whether or not hes made a joke look at me ill mm tap my forefinger they had reached the person on the sidewalk jessica stepped over the crumpled form richard hesitated jessica youre right he might think im bored she mused i know she said brightly if he makes a joke ill rub my earlobe jessica he could hot believe that she was simply ignoring the figure at their feet what she was not pleased to be jerked out of her reverie look he pointed to the sidewalk the person was face down and enveloped in bulky clothes jessica took his arm and tugged him toward her oh i see if you pay them any attention richard theyll walk all over you they all have homes really once shes slept it off im sure shell be fine she richard looked down it was a girl jessica continued now ive told mister stockton that we richard was down on one knee richard what are you doing she isnt drunk said richard shes hurt he looked at his fingertips shes bleeding jessica looked down at him nervous and puzzled were going to be late she pointed out shes hurt jessica looked back at the girl on the sidewalk priorities richard had no priorities richard were going to be late someone else will be along someone else will help her the girls face was crusted with dirt and her clothes were wet with blood shes hurt he said simply there was an expression on his face that jessica hadnt seen before richard she warned and then she relented a little and offered a compromise dial and call an ambulance then quickly now suddenly the girls eyes opened white and wide in a face that was little more than a smudge of dust and blood not a hospital please theyll find me take me somewhere safe please her voice was weak youre bleeding said richard he looked to see where she had come from but the wall was blank and brick and unbroken he looked back to her still form and asked why not a hospital help me the girl whispered and her eyes closed again he asked her why dont you want to go to the hospital this time there was no answer at all when you call the ambulance said jessica dont give your name you might have to make a statement or something and then wed be late richard what are you doing richard had picked the girl up cradling her in his arms she was surprisingly light im taking her back to my place jess i cant just leave her tell mister stockton im really sorry but it was an emergency im sure hell understand richard oliver mayhew said jessica coldly you put that girl down and come back here this minute or this engagement is at an end as of now im warning you richard felt the sticky warmth of blood soaking into his shirt sometimes he realized there is nothing you can do he walked away leaving behind jessica who stood there on the sidewalk her eyes stung with tears richard did not at any point on his walk stop to think it was not something over which he had any volition somewhere in the sensible part of his head someonea normal sensible richard mayhew was telling him how ridiculous he was being that he should just have called the police or an ambulance that it was dangerous to lift an injured person that he had really seriously upset jessica that he was going to have to sleep on the sofa tonight that he was ruining his only really good suit that the girl smelled terrible but richard found himself placing one foot in front of the other and arms cramping and back hurting ignoring the looks he got from passersby he just kept walking and after a while he was at the ground floor door of his building and he was stumbling up the staircase and then he was standing in front of the door to his apartment and realizing that he had left his keys on the hall table inside the girl reached out one filthy hand to the door and it swung open never thought id be pleased that the door hadnt latched properly thought richard and he carried the girl inclosing the door behind him with his foot and put her down on his bed his shirtfront was soaked in blood she seemed semiconscious her eyes were closed but fluttering he peeled off her leather jacket there was a long cut on her left upper arm and shoulder richard caught his breath look im going to call a doctor he said quietly can you hear me her eyes opened wide and scared please no itll be fineits not as bad as it looks i just need sleep no doctors but your armyour shoulder ill be fine tomorrow please it was little more than a whisper um i suppose all right and with sanity beginning to assert itself he said look can i ask but she was asleep richard took an old scarf from his closet and wrapped it firmly around her left upper arm and shoulder he did not want her to bleed to death on his bed before he could get her to a doctor and then he tiptoed out of his bedroom and shut the door behind him he sat down on the sofa in front of the television and wondered what he had done two he is somewhere deep beneath the ground in a tunnel perhaps or a sewer light comes in flickers defining the darkness not dispelling it he is not alone there are other people walking beside him although he cannot see their faces they are running now through the inside of the sewer splashing through the mud and filth droplets of water fall slowly through the air crystal clear in the darkness he turns a corner and the beast is waiting for him it is huge it fills the space of the sewer massive head down bristled body and breath steaming in the chill of the air some kind of boar he thinks at first and then realizes that no boar could be so huge it is the size of a bull of a tiger of an ox it stares at him and it pauses for a hundred years while he lifts his spear he glances at his hand holding the spear and observes that it is not his hand the arm is furred with dark hair the nails are almost claws and then the beast charges he throws his spear but it is already too late and he feels the beast slice his side with razorsharp tusks feels his life slip away into the mud and he realizes he has fallen face down into the water which crimsons in thick swirls of suffocating blood and he tries so to scream he tries to wake up but he can breathe only mud and blood and water he can feel only pain bad dream asked the girl richard sat up on the couch gasping for breath the curtains were still drawn the lights and the television still on but he could tell from the pale light coming in through the cracks that it was morning he fumbled on the couch for the remote control which had wedged itself into the small of his back during the night and he turned off the television yes he said sort of he wiped away the sleep from his eyes and took stock of himself pleased to notice that he had at least taken off his shoes and jacket before he had fallen asleep his shirtfront was covered with dried blood and with dirt the homeless girl didnt say anything she looked bad pale beneath the grime and brown dried blood and small she was dressed in a variety of clothes thrown over each other odd clothes dirty velvets muddy lace rips and holes through which other layers and styles could be seen she looked richard thought as if shed done a midnight raid on the history of fashion section of the victoria and albert museum and was still wearing everything shed taken her short hair was filthy but looked like it might have been a dark reddish color under the dirt youre awake said richard whose barony is this asked the girl whose fiefdom um sorry she looked around her suspiciously where am i newton mansions little comden street he stopped she had opened the curtains blinking at the cold daylight the girl stared out at the rather ordinary view from richards window astonished peering wideeyed at the cars and the buses and the tiny sprawl of shopsa bakery a drugstore and a liquor storebelow them im in london above she said in a small voice yes youre in london said richard above what he wondered i think maybe you were in shock or something last night that is a nasty cut on your arm he waited for her to say something to explain she glanced at him and then looked back down at the buses and the shops richard continued i um found you on the pavement there was a lot of blood dont worry she said seriously most of the blood was someone elses she let the curtain fall back then she began to unwrap the scarf now bloodstained and crusted from her arm she examined the cut and made a face were going to have to do something about this she said do you want to give me a hand richard was beginning to feel a little out of his depth i dont really know too much about first aid he said well she said if youre really squeamish you only have to hold the bandages and tie the ends where i cant reach you do have bandages dont you richard nodded oh yes he said in the first aid kit in the bathroom under the sink and then he went into his bedroom and changed his clothes wondering whether the mess on his shirt would ever come off the bloody water reminded him of something some kind of dream he had once had perhaps but he could no longer for the life of him remember exactly what he pulled the plug let the water out of the sink and filled it with clean water again to which he added a cloudy splash of liquid disinfectant the sharp antiseptic smell seemed so utterly sensible and medicinal a remedy for the oddness of his situation and his visitor the girl leaned over the sink and he splashed warm water over her arm and shoulder richard was never as squeamish as he thought he was or rather he was squeamish when it came to blood on screen a good zombie movie or even an explicit medical drama would leave him huddled in a corner hyperventilating with his hands over his eyes muttering things like just tell me when its over but when it came to real blood real pain he simply did something about it they cleaned out the cutwhich was much less severe than richard remembered it from the night beforeand bandaged it up and the girl did her very best not to wince in the process and richard found himself wondering how old she was and what she looked like under the grime and why she was living on the streets and whats your name she asked richard richard mayhew dick she nodded as if she were committing it to memory the doorbell rang richard looked at the mess in the bathroom and the girl and wondered how it would look to an outside observer such as for example oh lord he said realizing the worst i bet its jess shes going to kill me damage control damage control look he told the girl you wait in here he shut the door of the bathroom behind him and walked down the hall he opened the front door and breathed a huge and quite heartfelt sigh of relief it wasnt jessica it waswhat mormons jehovahs witnesses the police he couldnt tell there were two of them at any rate they wore black suits which were slightly greasy slightly frayed and even richard who counted himself among the sartorially dyslexic felt there was something odd about the cut of the coats they were the kind of suits that might have been made by a tailor two hundred years ago who had had a modern suit described to him but had never actually seen one the lines were wrong and so were the grace notes a fox and a wolf thought richard involuntarily the man in front the fox was a little shorter than richard he had lank greasy hair of an unlikely orange color and a pallid complexion as richard opened the door he smiled widely and just a fraction too late with teeth that looked like an accident in a graveyard a good morrow to you good sir he said on this fine and beautiful day ah hello said richard we are conducting a personal enquiry of a delicate nature as it were door to door do you mind if we come in well its not very convenient right now said richard then he asked are you with the police the second of the visitors a tall man the one he had thought of as a wolf his gray and black hair cut bristleshort stood a little behind his friend holding a stack of photocopies to his chest he had said nothing until this momentjust waited huge and impassive now he laughed once low and dirtily there was something unhealthy about that laugh the police alas said the smaller man we cannot claim that felicity a career in law and order although indubitably enticing was not inscribed on the cards dame fortuna dealt my brother and me no we are merely private citizens allow me to make introductions i am mister croup and this gentleman is my brother mister vandemar they did not look like brothers they did not look like anything richard had seen before your brother asked richard shouldnt you have the same name i am impressed what a brain mister vandemar keen and incisive isnt the half of it some of us are so sharp he said as he leaned in closer to richard went up on tiptoes into richards face we could just cut ourselves richard took an involuntary step backwards can we come inside asked mr croup what do you want mr croup sighed in what he obviously imagined was a rather wistful manner we are looking for our sister he explained a wayward child willful and headstrong who has close to broken our poor dear widowed mothers heart ran away explained mr vandemar quietly he thrust a photocopied sheet into richards hands shes a little funny he added and then he twirled one finger next to his temple in the universal gesture to indicate mental incapacity richard looked down at the paper it said have you seen this girl beneath that was a photocopygray photograph of a girl who looked to richard like a cleaner longerhaired version of the young lady he had left in his bathroom under that it said answers to the name of doreen bites and kicks run away tell us if you saw her want her back reward payed and below that a telephone number richard looked back at the photograph it was definitely the girl in his bathroom no he said i havent seen her im afraid im sorry mr vandemar however was not listening he had raised his head and was sniffing the air like a man smelling something odd or unpleasant richard reached out to give him back his piece of paper but the big man simply pushed past him and walked into the apartment a wolf on the prowl richard ran after him what do you think you are doing will you stop that get out look you cant go in there mr vandemar was headed straight for the bathroom richard hoped that the girldoreenhad had the presence of mind to lock the bathroom door but no it swung open at mr vandemars push he walked in and richard feeling like a small and ineffectual dog yapping at the heels of a postman followed him in it was not a large bathroom it contained a bathtub a toilet a sink several bottles of shampoo a bar of soap and a towel when richard had left it a couple of minutes before it had also contained a dirty bloody girl a very bloody sink and an open first aid kit now it was gleamingly clean there was nowhere the girl could have been hiding mr vandemar stepped out of the bathroom and pushed open richards bedroom door walked in looked around i dont know what you think youre doing said richard but if you two dont get out of my apartment this minute im phoning the police then mr vandemar who had been in the process of examining richards living room turned back toward richard and richard suddenly realized that he had never been so scared of another human being in his life and then foxy mr croup said why yes whatever can have come over you mister vandemar its grief for our dear sweet sibling ill wager has turned his head now apologize to the gentleman mister vandemar mr vandemar nodded and pondered for a moment thought i needed to use the toilet he said didnt sorry mr croup began to walk down the hall pushing mr vandemar in front of him there now youll forgive my errant brother his lack of social graces i trust worry over our poor dear widowed mother and over our sister whom even as we speak is wandering the streets of london unloved and uncaredfor has nigh unhinged him ill be bound but for all that hes a good fellow to have at your side ist not so stout fellow they were out of richards apartment now into the stairwell mr vandemar said nothing he did not look unhinged with grief croup turned back to richard and essayed another foxy smile you will tell us if you see her he said goodbye said richard then he closed the door and locked it and for the first time since he had lived there he attached the security chain mr croup who had cut richards phone line at the first mention of calling the police was starting to wonder whether he had cut the right cord or not twentiethcentury telecommunications technology not being his strongest point he took one of the photocopies from vandemar and positioned it on the wall of the stairwell spit he said to vandemar mr vandemar hawked a mouthful of phlegm from the back of his throat and spat it neatly onto the back of the handbill mr croup slapped the handbill hard onto the wall next to richards door it stuck immediately and stuck hard have you seen this girl it asked mr croup turned to mr vandemar do you believe him they turned back down the stairs do i hell said mr vandemar i could smell her richard waited by his front door until he heard the main door slam several floors below he started to walk down the hall back toward the bathroom when the phone rang loudly startling him he sprinted back down the hall and picked up the receiver hello said richard hello no sound came out of the receiver instead there was a click and jessicas voice came out of the answering machine on the table next to the phone her voice said richard this is jessica im sorry youre not there because this would have been our last conversation and i did so want to tell you this to your face the phone he realized was completely dead the receiver trailed a foot or so of cord and was then neatly cut off you embarrassed me very deeply last night richard the voice continued as far as im concerned our engagement is at an end i have no intention of returning the ring nor indeed of ever seeing you again bye the tape stopped turning there was another click and the little red light began to flash bad news asked the girl she was standing just behind him in the kitchen part of the apartment with her arm neatly bandaged she was getting out tea bags putting them in mugs the kettle was boiling yes said richard very bad he walked over to her handed her the have you seen this girl poster thats you isnt it she raised an eyebrow the photographs me and you are doreen she shook her head im door richardrichardmayhewdick milk and sugar richard was feeling utterly out of his league by now and he said richard just richard no sugar then he said look if it isnt a personal question what happened to you door poured the boiling water into the mugs you dont want to know she said simply oh well im sorry if i no richard honestly you dont want to know it wouldnt do you any good youve done more than you should have already she removed the tea bags and handed him a mug of tea he took it from her and realized that he was still carrying around the receiver well i mean i couldnt just have left you there you could have she said you didnt she pressed herself up against the wall and peered out of the window richard walked over to the window and looked out across the street mr croup and mr vandemar were coming out of the bakery and have you seen this girl was stuck in a place of prominence in its window are they really your brothers he asked please said door give me a break he sipped his tea and tried to pretend that everything was normal so where were you he asked just now i was here she said look with those two still around we have to get a message to she paused to someone who can help i dont dare leave here well isnt there somewhere you could go someone that we could call she took the dead receiver from his hand wire trailing and shook her head my friends arent on the phone she said she put it back in its cradle where it sat useless and lonely then she smiled fast and wicked breadcrumbs she said sorry said richard there was a little window in the back of the bedroom that looked out on an area of roof tiles and gutters door stood on richards bed to reach it opened the window and sprinkled the breadcrumbs around but i dont understand said richard of course you dont she agreed now shush there was a flutter of wings and the purplegraygreen sheen of a pigeon it pecked at the breadcrumbs and door reached out her right hand and picked it up it looked at her curiously but made no complaint they sat down on the bed door got richard to hold the pigeon while she attached a message to its leg using a vivid blue rubber band that richard had previously used to keep his electricity bills all in one place richard was not an enthusiastic holder of pigeons even at the best of times i dont see the point in this he explained i mean its not a homing pigeon its just a normal london pigeon the kind that craps on lord nelson thats right said door her cheek was grazed and her dirty reddish hair was tangled tangled but not matted and her eyes richard realized that he could not tell what color her eyes were they were not blue or green or brown or gray they reminded him of fire opals there were burning greens and blues and even reds and yellows that vanished and glinted as she moved she took the bird from him gently held it up and looked it in the face it tipped its head on one side and stared back at her with beadblack eyes okay she said and then she made a noise that sounded like the liquid burbling of pigeons okay crrppllrr youre looking for the marquis de carabas you got that the pigeon burbled liquidly back at her attagirl now this is important so youd better the pigeon interrupted her with a rather impatientsounding burble im sorry said door you know what youre doing of course she took the bird to the window and let it go richard had watched the whole routine with some amazement do you know it almost sounded like it understood you he said as the bird shrank in the sky and vanished behind some rooftops how about that said door now we wait she went over to the bookshelf in the corner of the bedroom found a copy of mansfield park richard had not previously known that he possessed and went into the living room richard followed her she settled herself on his sofa and opened the book so is it short for doreen he asked what your name no its just door how do you spell it door like something you walk through to go places oh he had to say something so he said what kind of a name is door then and she looked at him with her oddcolored eyes and she said my name then she went back to jane austen richard picked up the remote control and turned on the television then he changed the channel changed it again sighed changed it again so what are we waiting for door turned the page she didnt look up a reply what kind of a reply door shrugged oh right it occurred to richard then that her skin was very white now that some of the dirt and blood had been removed he wondered if she were pale from illness or from loss of blood or if she simply didnt get out much or was anemic maybe shed been in prison although she looked a bit too young for that perhaps the big man had been telling the truth when he had said she was mad listen when those men came over men a flash of the opalcolored eyes croup and um vanderbilt vandemar she mused for a moment then nodded i suppose you could call them men yes two legs two arms a head each richard kept talking when they came in here before where were you she licked her finger and turned a page i was here but he stopped talking out of words there wasnt anywhere in the apartment that she could have hidden herself but she hadnt left the apartment but there was a scratching noise and a dark shape larger than a mouse scurried out from the mess of videotapes beneath the television jesus said richard and he threw the remote control at it as hard as he could it crashed into the videos with a bang of the dark shape there was no sign richard said door its okay he explained i think it was just a rat or something she glared at him of course it was a rat youll have scared it now poor thing she looked around the room then made a low whistling noise between her front teeth hello she called she knelt on the floor mansfield park abandoned hello she flashed a glance back at richard if youve hurt it she threatened then softly to the room im sorry hes an idiot hello im not an idiot said richard shh she said hello a pink nose and two small black eyes peered out from under the sofa the rest of the head followed and it scrutinized its surroundings suspiciously it was indeed much too big to be a mouse richard was certain of that hi said door warmly are you okay she extended her hand the animal climbed into it then ran up her arm nestling in the crook of it door stroked its side with her finger it was dark brown with a long pink tail there was something that looked like a folded piece of paper attached to its side its a rat said richard yes it is are you going to apologize what apologize maybe he hadnt heard her properly maybe he was the one who was going mad to a rat door said nothing fairly meaningfully im sorry said richard to the rat with dignity if i startled you the rat looked up at door no he really does mean it she said hes not just saying it so what have you got for me she fumbled at the rats side and pulled out a muchfolded piece of brown paper which had been held on with something that looked to richard like a vivid blue rubber band she opened it up a piece of raggededged brown paper with spidery black handwriting on it she read it and nodded thank you she said to the rat i appreciate all youve done it scampered down onto the couch glared up at richard for a moment and then was gone in the shadows the girl called door passed the paper to richard here she said read this it was late afternoon in central london and with autumn drawing on it was getting dark richard had taken the tube to tottenham court road and was now walking west down oxford street holding the piece of paper oxford street was the retail hub of london and even now the sidewalks were packed with shoppers and tourists its a message she said when she gave it to him from the marquis de carabas richard was sure he had heard the name before thats nice he said out of postcards was he this is quicker he passed the lights and the noise of the virgin megastore and the shop that sold souvenir london police helmets and little red london buses and the place next door that sold individual slices of pizza and then he turned right you have to follow the directions written on here try not to let anyone follow you then she sighed and said really shouldnt involve you this much if i follow these directions will it get you out of here faster yes he turned into hanway street although he had taken only a few steps from the welllit bustle of oxford street he might have been in another city hanway street was empty forsaken a narrow dark road little more than an alleyway filled with gloomy record shops and closed restaurants the only light spilling out from the secretive drinking clubs on the upper floors of buildings he walked along it feeling apprehensive turn right into hanway street left into hanway place then right again into orme passage stop at the first streetlight you come to are you sure this is right yes he did not remember an orme passage although he had been to hanway place before there was an underground indian restaurant there his friend gary liked a lot as far as richard could remember hanway place was a dead end the mandeer that was the restaurant he passed the brightly lit front door the restaurants steps leading invitingly down into the underground and then he turned left he had been wrong there was an orme passage he could see the sign for it high on the wall orme passage wl no wonder he hadnt noticed it before it was scarcely more than a narrow alleyway between houses lit by a sputtering gasjet you dont see many of those anymore thought richard and he held up his instructions to the gaslight peering at them then turn around thrice widdershins widdershins means counterclockwise richard he turned three times feeling stupid look why do i have to do all this just to see your friend i mean all this nonsense its not nonsense really justhumor me on this okay and she had smiled at him he stopped turning then he walked down the alley to the end nothing no one just a metal garbage can and beside it something that might have been a pile of rags hello called richard is anyone here im doors friend hello no there was no one there richard was relieved now he could go home and explain to the girl that nothing had happened then he would call in the appropriate authorities and they would sort it all out he crumpled the paper into a tight ball and tossed it toward the bin what richard had taken for a pile of rags unfolded expanded stood up in one fluid motion a hand caught the crumpled paper in midair mine i believe said the marquis de carabas he wore a huge dandyish black coat that was not quite a frock coat nor exactly a trench coat and high black boots and beneath his coat raggedy clothes his eyes burned white in an extremely dark face and he grinned white teeth momentarily as if at a private joke of his own and bowed to richard and said de carabas at your service and you are um said richard er um you are richard mayhew the young man who rescued our wounded door how is she now er shes okay her arms still a bit her recovery time will undoubtedly astonish us all her family had remarkable recuperative powers its a wonder anyone managed to kill them at all isnt it the man who called himself the marquis de carabas walked restlessly up and down the alley richard could already tell that he was the type of person who was always in motion like a great cat somebody killed doors family asked richard were not going to get very far if you keep repeating everything i say now are we said the marquis who was now standing in front of richard sit down he ordered richard looked around the alley for something to sit on the marquis put a hand on his shoulder and sent him sprawling to the cobblestones she knows i dont come cheap what exactly is she offering me sorry whats the deal she sent you here to negotiate young man im not cheap and i never give freebies richard shrugged as well as he could shrug from a supine position she said to tell you that she wants you to accompany her homewherever that isand to fix her up with a bodyguard even when the marquis was at rest his eyes never ceased moving up down around as if he were looking for something thinking about something adding subtracting evaluating richard wondered whether the man was quite sane and shes offering me well nothing the marquis blew on his fingernails and polished them on the lapel of his remarkable coat then he turned away shes offering me nothing he sounded offended richard scrambled back up to his feet well she didnt say anything about money she just said she was going to have to owe you a favor the eyes flashed exactly what kind of favor a really big one said richard she said she was going to have to owe you a really big favor de carabas grinned to himself a hungry panther sighting a lost peasant child then he turned on richard and you left her alone he asked with croup and vandemar out there well what are you waiting for he knelt down and took from his pocket a small metal object which he pushed into a manhole cover at the edge of the alley and twisted the manhole cover came up easily the marquis put away the metal object and took something out of another pocket that reminded richard a little of a long firework or a flare he held it in one hand ran his other hand along it and the far end erupted into scarlet flame can i ask a question said richard certainly not said the marquis you dont ask any questions you dont get any answers you dont stray from the path you dont even think about whats happening to you right now got it but most important of all no buts said de carabas and time is of the essence move he pointed into the depths revealed by the open manhole cover richard moved clambering down the metal ladder set into the wall beneath the manhole feeling so far out of his depth that it didnt even occur to him to question any further richard wondered where they were this didnt seem to be a sewer perhaps it was a tunnel for telephone cables or for very small trains or for something else he realized that he did not know very much about what went on beneath the streets of london he walked nervously worried that hed catch his feet in something that hed stumble in the darkness and break his ankle de carabas strode on ahead nonchalantly apparently not caring whether richard was with him or not the crimson flame cast huge shadows on the tunnel walls richard ran to catch up lets see said de carabas ill need to get her to the market the next ones in mm two days time if i recall correctly as of course i unfailingly do i can hide her until then market asked richard the floating market but you dont want to know about that no more questions richard looked around well i was going to ask you where we are now but i suppose you were going to refuse to tell me the marquis grinned once more very good he said approvingly you are in enough trouble already you can say that again sighed richard my fiancees dumped me and ill probably have to get a new telephone temple and arch a telephone is the least of your troubles de carabas put the flare down on the ground resting it against the wall where it continued to sputter and flame and he began to climb up some metal rungs set into the wall richard hesitated and then followed him the rungs were cold and rusted he could feel them crumbling roughly against his hands as he climbed fragments of rust getting in his eyes and mouth the scarlet light from below was flickering and then it went out they climbed in total darkness so are we going back to door richard asked eventually theres a little something i need to organize first insurance and when we get into daylight dont look down why not asked richard and then daylight hit his face and he looked down it was daylight and he was holding onto a metal ladder that ran up the outside of a very high building and below him he could see london tiny cars tiny buses and taxis tiny buildings trees miniature trucks tiny tiny people they swam in and out of focus beneath him to say that richard mayhew was not very good at heights would be perfectly accurate but it would fail to give the full picture richard hated clifftops and high buildings somewhere not far inside him was the fearthe stark utter silently screaming terrorthat if he got too close to the edge then something would take over and he would find himself walking to the edge of a clifftop and stepping off into space it was as if he could not entirely trust himself and that scared richard more than the simple fear of falling ever could so he called it vertigo and hated it and himself and kept away from high places richard froze on the ladder his hands clamped tightly to the rungs his eyes hurt somewhere behind the eyeballs he started breathing too fast too deeply somebody said an amused voice above him wasnt listening was he i richards throat didnt work he swallowed moistening it i cant move his hands were sweating what if they sweated so much that he simply slipped off into the void of course you can move or if you dont you can stay here hanging onto the side of the wall until your hands freeze and your legs buckle and you tumble to a messy death a thousand feet below richard looked up at the marquis he was looking down at richard and still smiling when he saw that richard was watching him he let go of the rungs with both his hands and waggled his fingers at him richard felt a wave of sympathetic vertigo run through him bastard he said under his breath and he let go of the rung with his right hand and moved it up eight inches until it found the next rung then he moved his right leg up one rung then he did it again with his left hand after a while he found himself at the edge of a flat roof and he stepped over it and collapsed he was aware that the marquis was striding along the roof away from him richard felt the rooftop with his hands and felt the solid structure beneath him his heart was pounding in his chest a gruff voice some distance away shouted youre not wanted here de carabas get away clear off old bailey he heard de carabas say youre looking wonderfully healthy and then footsteps shuffled toward him and a finger prodded him gently in the ribs you all right laddie ive got some stew cookin back there you want some its starling richard opened his eyes no thank you he said he saw the feathers first he wasnt sure if it was a coat or a cape or some kind of strange covering that had no name but whatever kind of outer garment it was it was covered thickly and entirely in feathers a face kind and creased with grey muttonchop whiskers peered out from the top of the feathers the body beneath the face where it was not covered with feathers was wound round and about with ropes richard found himself remembering a theatrical performance of robinson crusoe he had been taken to as a child this was what robinson crusoe might have looked like if he had been shipwrecked on a rooftop instead of a desert island they call me old bailey lad said the man he fumbled at a battered pair of glasses on a string around his neck and pulled them on staring through them at richard i dont recognize ye what barony do you give fealty to whats your name richard pulled himself into a sitting position they were on the roof of an old building built of brown stone with a tower above them weathered gargoyles missing wings and limbs and in a couple of cases even heads jutted sadly from the corners of the tower from far below he could hear the wail of a police siren and the muted roar of traffic across the rooftop in the shadow of the tower was something that looked like a tent an old brown tent much mended spackled white with bird shit he opened his mouth to tell the old man his name you shut up said the marquis de carabas dont say another word then he turned to old bailey people who put their noses where they arent wanted sometimeshe snapped his fingers loudly beneath the old mans nose making him jumplose them now youve owed me a favor for twenty years old bailey a big favor and im calling it in the old man blinked i was a fool he said quietly no fool like an old fool agreed the marquis he reached a hand into an inside pocket of his coat and pulled out a silver box larger than a snuffbox smaller than a cigar box and a good deal more ornate than either do you know what this is i wish i didnt youll keep it safe for me i dont want it you dont have any choice said the marquis the old roofman took the silver box from him and held it awkwardly in both hands as if it were something that might explode at any moment the marquis prodded richard gently with his squaretoed black boot right he said wed better get a move on hadnt we he strode off across the roof and richard got to his feet and followed keeping well away from the side of the building the marquis opened a door in the side of the tower beside a high cluster of chimneys and they went down a poorly lit spiral staircase who was that man asked richard peering through the dim light their footsteps echoed and reverberated down the metal stairs the marquis de carabas snorted you havent heard a word ive said have you youre in trouble already everything you do everything you say everything you hear just makes it worse you had better pray you havent stepped too far in it was now completely dark and richard stumbled slightly as he reached the last of the steps and found himself looking for a step that wasnt there mind your head said the marquis and he opened a door richard banged his forehead into something hard and said ow and then he stepped out through a low door shielding his eyes against the light richard rubbed his forehead then he rubbed his eyes the door they had just come through was the door to the broom closet in the stairwell of his apartment building it was filled with brooms an elderly mop and a huge variety of cleaning fluids powders and waxes it had no stairs at the back of it that he could see just a wall on which a stained old calendar hung quite uselesslyunless ever came back around the marquis was examining the have you seen this girl poster stuck beside richards front door not her best side he said richard shut the door to the broom closet he took his keys from his back pocket unlocked his front door and he was home it was he was rather relieved to see through the kitchen windows nighttime once more richard said door you did it she had washed herself while he was gone and her layers of clothes looked like she had at least made an effort to get the worst of the filth and the blood off them the grime was gone from her face and hands her hair when washed was a dark shade of auburn with copper and bronze highlights richard wondered how old she was fifteen sixteen older he still couldnt tell she had put on the brown leather jacket she had been wearing when he had found her huge and enveloping like an old flying jacket which somehow made her look smaller than she was and even more vulnerable well yes said richard the marquis de carabas went down on one knee to the girl and lowered his head my lady he said she seemed uncomfortable oh do get up de carabas im pleased you came he stood in one smooth movement i understand he said that the words favor really and big have been used in conjunction later she walked over to richard and took his hands in hers richard thanks i really appreciate everything youve done i changed the sheets on the bed and i wish there was something i could do to pay you back youre leaving she nodded ill be safe now more or less i hope for a little while where are you going now she smiled gently and shook her head uhuh im out of your life and youve been wonderful she went up on tiptoes then and kissed him on the cheek as friends kiss friends if i ever need to get in touch with you you dont ever and and then she paused look im sorry okay richard inspected his feet in an awkward sort of way theres nothing to be sorry about he said and added doubtfully it was fun then he looked up again but there was nobody there three on sunday morning richard took the batmobileshaped telephone he had been given for christmas several years earlier by his aunt maude out of the drawer at the bottom of the closet and plugged it into the wall he tried telephoning jessica but without success her answering machine was turned off as was her cellular phone he supposed she had gone back to her parents house in the country and he had no desire to phone her there richard found jessicas parents deeply intimidating each in their separate ways neither of them had entirely approved of him as a future soninlaw in fact her mother had on one occasion mentioned to him quite casually how disappointed they were by richard and jessicas engagement and her conviction that jessica could if she wanted to do so much better richards own parents were both dead his father had died quite suddenly when richard was still a small boy of a heart attack his mother died very slowly after that and once richard left home she simply faded away six months after he moved to london he took the train back up to scotland to spend her last two days in a small county hospital sitting beside her bed sometimes she had known him at other times she had called him by his fathers name richard sat on his couch and he brooded the events of the previous two days became less and less real increasingly less likely what was real was the message that jessica had left on his machine telling him she did not want to see him again he played it and replayed it that sunday hoping each time that she would relent that hed hear warmth in her voice he never did he thought about going out and buying a sunday paper but decided not to arnold stockton jessicas boss a manychinned selfmade caricature of a man owned all the sunday papers that rupert murdoch had failed to buy his own papers talked about him and so did the rest reading a sunday paper would richard suspected probably end up reminding him of the dinner he had failed to attend on friday night so instead richard had a long hot bath and a number of sandwiches and several cups of tea he watched a little sunday afternoon television and constructed conversations with jessica in his head at the end of each mental dialogue they would fall into each others arms make wild angry tearstained and passionate love and then everything would be all right on monday morning richards alarm failed to go off he came out onto the street at a run at ten to nine briefcase swinging staring up and down the road like a madman praying for a taxi then he sighed with relief because a big black car was heading down the road toward him its yellow taxi sign bright he waved at it and yelled the taxi slid gently past him ignoring him completely it turned a corner and was gone another taxi another yellow light that meant the taxi was available this time richard stepped out into the middle of the road to flag it down it swerved past him and continued on its way richard began to swear under his breath then he ran for the nearest tube station he pulled out a pocketful of coins stabbed the button of the ticket machine for a single ticket to charing cross and thumbed his change into the slot every coin he put in went straight through the guts of the machine and clattered into the tray at the bottom no ticket appeared he tried another ticket machine with the same lack of result and another the ticket seller in the office was speaking to someone on the telephone when richard went over to complain and to buy his ticket manually and despiteor perhaps because ofrichards cries of hey and excuse me and his desperate tapping on the plastic barrier with a coin the man remained resolutely on the telephone fuck it announced richard and he vaulted the barrier no one stopped him no one seemed to care he ran breathless and sweating down the escalator and made it onto the crowded platform just as a train came in as a child richard had had nightmares in which he simply wasnt there in which no matter how much noise he made no matter what he did nobody ever noticed him at all he began to feel like that now as people pushed in front of him he was buffeted by the crowd pushed this way and that by commuters getting off by others getting on he persisted pushing and shoving in his turn until he was almost on the trainhe had one arm insidewhen the doors began to hiss closed he pulled his hand back but his coatsleeve was trapped richard began to hammer on the door and to shout expecting the driver at least to open the door enough for him to free his sleeve but instead the train began to move off and richard was forced to run down the platform stumbling faster and faster he dropped his briefcase onto the platform pulled desperately at his sleeve with his free hand the sleeve ripped and he fell forward scraping his hand on the platform ripping his trousers at the knee richard climbed a little unsteadily to his feet then walked back down the platform and retrieved his briefcase he looked at his ripped sleeve and his grazed hand and his torn trousers then he walked up the stone stairs and out of the underground station nobody asked him for a ticket on the way out im sorry im late said richard to no one in particular in the crowded office the clock on the office wall said that it was he dropped his briefcase on his chair wiped the sweat from his face with his handkerchief you wouldnt believe what it was like getting here he continued it was a nightmare he looked down at his desktop there was something missing or more precisely there was everything missing where are my things he asked the room a little more loudly where is my telephone where are my trolls he checked the desk drawers they were empty too not even a mars bar wrapper or a twisted paper clip to show that richard had ever been there sylvia was coming toward him in conversation with two rather hefty gentlemen richard walked over to her sylvia whats going on im sorry said sylvia politely she pointed the desk out to the hefty gentlemen who each took an end of it and began to carry it out of the office careful now she told them my desk where are they taking it sylvia stared at him gently puzzled and you are dont need this shit thought richard richard he said sarcastically richard mayhew ah said sylvia then her attention slid off richard like water off an oiled duck and she said no not over there for heavens sakes to the removal men and hurried after them as they carried off richards desk richard watched her go then he walked through the office until he got to garys workstation gary was answering email richard looked at the screen the email gary seemed to be writing was both sexually explicit and addressed to someone who was not garys girlfriend embarrassed richard moved around to the other side of the desk gary whats going on is this a joke or something gary looked around as if he had heard something he flicked the keyboard activating a screensaver of dancing hippopotami then he shook his head as if to clear it picked up the telephone and began to dial richard slammed his hand down on the phone cutting gary off look this isnt funny i dont know what everyones playing at finally to his enormous relief gary looked up at him richard continued if ive been fired then just tell me ive been fired but all this pretending im not here and then gary smiled and said hi yeah im gary perunu can i help you i dont think so said richard coldly and he walked out of the office leaving his briefcase behind him richards offices were on the third floor of a big old drafty building just off the strand jessica worked about halfway up a large crystalline mirrored structure in the city of london fifteen minutes walk up the road richard jogged up that road he got to the stockton building in ten minutes walked straight past the uniformed security guards on duty on the ground floor stepped into the elevator and went up the inside of the elevator was mirrored and he stared at himself as he went up his tie was halfundone and askew his coat was ripped his pants torn his hair was a sweaty mess god he looked awful there was a fluting tone and the elevator door opened jessicas floor was quite opulent in an underdecorated sort of way there was a receptionist by the elevator a poised and elegant creature who looked like her takehome pay beat richards hands down she was reading cosmopolitan she did not look up as richard came over i need to talk to jessica bartram said richard its important i have to speak with her the receptionist ignored him intent upon examining her nails richard walked down the corridor until he got to jessicas office he opened the door and went in she was standing in front of three large posters each advertising angels over englanda traveling exhibition each with a different image of an angel on it she turned as he came in and she smiled warmly at him jessica thank god listen i think im going mad or something it started when i couldnt get a taxi this morning and then the office and the tube and he showed her his ragged sleeve its like ive become some kind of nonperson she smiled at him some more reassuringly look said richard im sorry about the other night well not about what i did but about upsetting you and look im sorry and its all crazy and i dont honestly know what to do and jessica nodded and continued to smile sympathetically and then she said youre going to think im absolutely awful but i have a really dreadful memory for faces give me a second and i know ill get it and at that point richard knew that it was real and a heavy dread settled in the pit of his stomach whatever madness was happening that day was really happening it was no joke no trick or prank its okay he said dully forget it and he walked away out the door and down the corridor he was almost at the lift when she called his name richard he turned it had been a joke some kind of petty revenge something he could explain richard maybury she seemed proud of herself for remembering that much mayhew said richard and he got into the elevator and the doors sang a sad fluting downward trill as they closed behind him richard walked back to his flat upset and confused and angry sometimes he would wave at taxis but never with any real hope that they would stop and none of them did his feet hurt and his eyes stung and he knew that soon enough he would wake up from today and a proper monday a sensible monday a decent honest monday would begin when he reached the apartment he filled the bathtub with hot water abandoned his clothes on the bed and naked walked through the hall and climbed into the relaxing waters he had almost dozed off when he heard a key turn a door open and close and a smooth male voice say of course youre the first ive shown around today but ive got a list of people as long as your arm who are interested its not as large as i imagined from the details your office sent us said a woman its compact yes but i like to think of that as a virtue richard had not bothered locking the bathroom door he was after all the only person there a gruffer rougher male voice said thought you said it was an unfurnished apartment looks pretty damned furnished to me the previous tenant must have left some of his accoutrements behind funny they never told me anything about that richard stood up in the bathtub then because he was naked and the people could walk in at any moment he sat back down rather desperately he looked around the bathroom for a towel oh look george said the woman in the hallway someones left a towel on this chair richard inspected and rejected as poor towel substitutes a loofah a halfempty bottle of shampoo and a small yellow rubber duck whats the bathroom like asked the woman richard grabbed a washcloth and draped it in front of his crotch then he stood up with his back to the wall and prepared to be mortified the door was pushed open three people walked into the bathroom a young man in a camelhair coat and a middleaged couple richard wondered if they were as embarrassed as he was its a bit small said the woman compact corrected the camelhair coat smoothly easy to take care of the woman ran her finger along the side of the sink and wrinkled her nose i think weve seen it all said the middleaged man they walked out of the bathroom it would be very convenient for everything said the woman a conversation continued in lower tones richard climbed out of the bath and edged over to the door he spotted the towel on the chair in the hall and he leaned out and grabbed it well take it said the woman you will said the camelhair coat its just what we want she explained or it will be once weve made it homey could it be ready for wednesday of course well have all of this rubbish cleaned out of here tomorrow no problem richard cold and dripping and wrapped in his towel glared at them from the doorway its not rubbish he said its my stuff well pick up the keys from your office then excuse me said richard plaintively i live here they pushed past richard on their way to the front door pleasure doing business with you said the camelhair coat can you can any of you hear me this is my apartment i live here if you fax contract details to my office said the gruff man then the door slammed behind them and richard stood in the hallway of what used to be his apartment he shivered in the silence from the cold this announced richard to the world in direct defiance of the evidence of his senses is not happening the batphone shrilled and its headlights flashed richard picked it up warily hello the line hissed and crackled as if the call were coming from a long way away the voice at the other end of the phone was unfamiliar mister mayhew it said mister richard mayhew yes he said and then delighted you can hear me oh thank god who is this my associate and i met you on saturday mister mayhew i was enquiring as to the whereabouts of a certain young lady do you remember the tones were oily nasty foxy oh yes its you mister mayhew you said door wasnt with you we have reason to believe that you were embroidering the truth more than perhaps a little well you said you were her brother all men are brothers mister mayhew shes not here anymore and i dont know where she is we know that mister mayhew we are perfectly cognizant of both of those facts and to be magnificently frank mister mayhewand im sure you want me to be frank dont youwere i you i would no longer worry about the young lady her days are numbered and the number in question isnt even in the double digits why are you calling me mister mayhew said mr croup helpfully do you know what your own liver tastes like richard was silent because mister vandemar has promised me that hes personally going to cut it out and stuff it into your mouth before he slits your sad little throat so youll find out wont you im calling the police you cant threaten me like this mister mayhew you can call anyone you wish but id hate you to think we were making a threat neither myself nor mister vandemar make threats do we mister vandemar no then what the hell are you doing were making a promise said mr croup through the static and the echo and the hiss and we do know where you live and he hung up richard held the phone tightly staring at it then he stabbed the nine key three times fire police and ambulance emergency services said the emergency operator what service do you require can you put me through to the police please a man just threatened to kill me and i dont think he was joking there was a pause he hoped he was being put through to the police after a few moments the voice said emergency services hello is there anyone there hello and then richard put down the phone went into his bedroom and put his clothes on because he was cold and naked and scared and there wasnt really anything else he could do eventually and after some deliberation he took the black sports bag from under the bed and put socks into it underpants some tshirts his passport his wallet he was wearing jeans sneakers a thick sweater he remembered the way the girl who called herself door had said goodbye the way she had paused the way she had said she was sorry you knew he said to the empty apartment you knew this would happen he went into the kitchen took some fruit from the bowl put that into the bag then he zipped it up and walked out onto the darkened street the atm took his card with a whirr please enter your pin number it said richard typed in his secret pin number the screen went blank please wait it said and the screen went blank somewhere in the depths of the machine something grumbled and growled this card is not valid please contact card issuer there was a chunking noise and the card slid out again spare any change said a tired voice from behind him richard turned the man was short and old and balding his scraggly beard a matted tangle of yellow and gray the lines of his face were etched deeply in black dirt he wore a filthy coat over the ruin of a dark gray sweater his eyes were gray as well and rheumy richard handed the man his card here he said keep it theres about fifteen hundred pounds in there if you can get to it the man took the card in his streetblackened hands looked at it turned it over and said flatly thanks a bunch that and sixty pencell get me a nice cup of coffee he gave richard his card back and began to walk down the street richard picked up his bag then he went after the man and said hey hang on you can see me nothing wrong with my eyes said the man listen said richard have you ever heard of a place called the floating market i need to get there theres a girl called door but the man had begun nervously to back away from richard look i really need help said richard please the man stared at him without pity richard sighed okay he said im sorry i troubled you he turned away and clenching the handle of his bag in both hands so that they hardly shook at all he began to walk down the high street oy hissed the man richard looked back at him he was beckoning come on down here quickly man the man hurried down some steps on the derelict houses at the side of the roadgarbagestrewn steps leading down to abandoned basement apartments richard stumbled after him at the bottom of the steps was a door which the man pushed open he waited for richard to go through and shut the door behind them through the door they were in darkness there was a scratch and the noise of a match flaring into life the man touched the match to the wick of an old railwaymans lamp which caught casting slightly less light than the match had and they walked together through a dark place it smelled musty of damp and old brick of rot and the dark where are we richard whispered his guide shushed him to silence they reached another door set in a wall the man rapped on it rhythmically there was a pause and then the door swung open for a moment richard was blinded by the sudden light he was standing in a huge vaulted room an underground hall filled with firelight and smoke small fires burned around the room shadowy people stood by the flames roasting small animals on spits people scurried from fire to fire it reminded him of hellor rather the way that he had thought of hell as a schoolboy the smoke irritated his lungs and he coughed a hundred eyes turned then and stared at him a hundred eyes unblinking and unfriendly a man scuttled toward them he had long hair a patchy brown beard and his ragged clothes were trimmed with furorangeandwhiteandblack fur like the coat of a calico cat he would have been taller than richard but he walked with a pronounced stoop his hands held up at his chest fingers pressed together what what is it what is this he asked richards guide whove you brought us iliaster talktalktalk hes from the upside said the guide was asking about the lady door and the floating market brought him to you lord ratspeaker figured youd know what to do with him there were now more than a dozen of the furtrimmed people standing around them women and men and even a few children they moved in scurries moments of stillness followed by hasty dashes toward richard the lord ratspeaker reached inside his furtrimmed rags and pulled out a wickedlooking sliver of glass about eight inches long some poorly cured fur had been tied around the bottom half of it to form an improvised grip firelight glinted from the glass blade the lord ratspeaker put the shard to richards throat oh yes yesyesyes he cluttered excitedly i know exactly what to do with him four mr croup and mr vandemar had set up their home in the cellar of a victorian hospital closed down ten years earlier because of national health service budget cutbacks the property developers who had announced their intention of turning the hospital into an unparalleled block of unique luxuryliving accommodations had faded away as soon as the hospital had been closed and so it stood there year after year gray and empty and unwanted its windows boarded up its doors padlocked shut the roof was rotten and rain dripped through the empty hospitals interior spreading damp and decay through the building the hospital was ranged around a central well which let in a certain amount of gray and unfriendly light the basement world beneath the empty hospital wards comprised more than a hundred tiny rooms some of them empty others containing abandoned hospital supplies one room held a squat giant metal furnace while the next room housed the blocked and waterless toilets and showers most of the basement floors were covered with a thin layer of oily rainwater which reflected the darkness and the decay back toward the rotting ceilings if you were to walk down the hospital steps as far down as you could go through the abandoned shower rooms past the staff toilets past a room filled with broken glass where the ceiling had collapsed entirely leaving it open to the stairwell above you would reach a small rusting iron staircase from which the oncewhite paint was peeling in long damp strips and if you went down the staircase and traversed the marshy place at the bottom of the steps and pushed your way through a halfdecayed wooden door you would find yourself in the subcellar a huge room in which a hundred and twenty years of hospital waste had accumulated been abandoned and eventually forgotten and it was here that mr croup and mr vandemar had for the present made their home the walls were damp and water dripped from the ceiling odd things moldered in corners some of them had once been alive mr croup and mr vandemar were killing time mr vandemar had obtained from somewhere a centipedea reddish orange creature almost eight inches long with vicious poisonous fangsand was letting it run over his hands watching it as it twined between his fingers vanished up one sleeve appeared a minute later out of the other mr croup was playing with razor blades he had found in a corner a whole box of fiftyyearold razor blades wrapped in wax paper and he had been trying to think of things to do with them if i might have your attention mister vandemar he said at length pipe your beady eyes on this mr vandemar held the centipedes head delicately between a huge thumb and a massive forefinger to stop it wriggling he looked at mr croup mr croup put his left hand against a wall fingers spread he took five razor blades in his right hand took careful aim and threw them at the wall each blade stuck into the wall between mr croups fingers it was like a top knifethrowers act in miniature mr croup took his hand away leaving the blades in the wall outlining the place his fingers had been and he turned to his partner for approval mr vandemar was unimpressed whats so clever about that then he asked you didnt even hit one finger mr croup sighed i didnt he said well slit my gullet youre right how could i have been such a ninny he pulled the razor blades out of the wall one by one and dropped them onto the wooden table why dont you show me how it should have been done mr vandemar nodded he put his centipede back into its empty marmalade jar then he put his left hand against the wall he raised his right arm his knife wicked and sharp and perfectly weighted was in his right hand he narrowed his eyes and he threw the knife flew through the air and thudded into the damp plaster wall bladefirst the blade having first hit and penetrated the back of mr vandemars hand on its way a telephone began to ring mr vandemar looked around at croup satisfied his hand still pinned to the wall thats how its done he said there was an old telephone in the corner of the room an antique twopart telephone unused in the hospital since the s made of wood and bakelite mr croup picked up the earpiece which was on a long clothwrapped cord and spoke into the mouthpiece which was attached to the base croup and vandemar he said smoothly the old firm obstacles obliterated nuisances eradicated bothersome limbs removed and tutelary dentistry the person at the other end of the phone said something mr croup cringed mr vandemar tugged at his left hand it wasnt coming free oh yes sir yes indeed and might i say how your telephonic confabulation brightens up and cheers our otherwise dreary and uneventful day another pause of course ill stop toadying and crawling delighted to an honor andwhat do we know we know that an interruption he picked his nose reflectively patiently then no we dont know where she is at this precise moment but we dont have to shell be at the market tonight and his mouth tightened and we have no intention of violating their market truce more of waiting till she has left the market and scrobbling her he was silent then and listened nodding from time to time mr vandemar tried to pull the knife out of the wall with his free hand but the knife was stuck quite fast that might be arranged yes said mr croup into the mouthpiece i mean it will be arranged of course yes i realize that and sir perhaps we could talk about but the caller had hung up mr croup stared at the earpiece for a moment then put it back on its hook you think youre so damned clever he whispered then he noticed mr vandemars predicament and said stop that he leaned over pulled the knife out of the wall and out of the back of mr vandemars hand and put it down on the table mr vandemar shook his left hand and flexed the fingers then wiped the fragments of damp plaster from his knifeblade who was that our employer said mr croup it seems the other one isnt going to work out not old enough its going to have to be the door female so we arent allowed to kill her any more that mister vandemar would be about the short and the long of it yes now it seems that little miss door has announced that she shall be hiring a bodyguard at the market tonight so mr vandemar spat on the back of his hand where the knife had gone in and on the palm of his hand where the knife had come out he rubbed at the spit with a massive thumb the flesh closed knitted was whole again mr croup picked up his old coat heavy black and shiny with age from the floor he put it on so mister vandemar he said shall we not also hire ourselves a bodyguard mr vandemar slid his knife back into the holster in his sleeve he put his coat on as well pushed his hands deep into the pockets and was pleasantly surprised to find an almost untouched mouse in one pocket good he was hungry then he pondered mr croups last statement with the intensity of an anatomist dissecting his one true love and realizing the flaw in his partners logic mr vandemar said we dont need a bodyguard mister croup we hurt people we dont get hurt mr croup turned out the lights oh mister vandemar he said enjoying the sound of the words as he enjoyed the sound of all words if you cut us do we not bleed mr vandemar pondered this for a moment in the dark then he said with perfect accuracy no a spy from the upworld said the lord ratspeaker heh i should slit you from gullet to gizzard and tell fortunes with your guts look said richard his back against the wall with the glass dagger pressed against his adams apple i think youre making a bit of a mistake here my name is richard mayhew i can prove who i am ive got my library cards credit cards things he added desperately at the opposite end of the hall richard noticed with the dispassionate clarity that comes when a lunatic is about to slit your throat with a piece of broken glass people were throwing themselves to the ground bowing low and remaining on the floor a small black shape was coming toward them along the ground i think a moments reflection might prove that were all being very silly said richard he had no idea what the words meant just that they were coming out of his mouth and that as long as he was talking he was not dead now why dont you put that away andexcuse me thats my bag this last to a thin bedraggled girl in her late teens who had taken richards bag and was roughly tipping his possessions out onto the ground the people in the hall continued to bow and to stay bowed as the small shape came closer it reached the group of people around richard although not a one of them noticed it they were all looking at richard it was a rat which looked up at richard curiously he had the bizarre and momentary impression that it winked one of its little black oildrop eyes at him then it cluttered loudly the man with the glass dagger threw himself on his knees so did the people gathered around them so too after a moments hesitation and a little more awkwardly did the homeless man the one they had called iliaster in a moment richard was the only one standing the thin girl tugged at his elbow and he too went down on one knee lord ratspeaker bowed so low that his long hair brushed the ground and he chittered back at the rat wrinkling his nose showing his teeth squeaking and hissing for all the world like an enormous rat himself look can anybody tell me muttered richard quiet said the thin girl the rat steppeda little disdainfully it seemedinto the lord ratspeakers grubby hand and the man held it respectfully up in front of richards face it waved its tail languidly as it inspected richards features this is master longtail of the clan gray said the lord ratspeaker he says you looks exceeding familiar he wants to know if hes met you afore richard looked at the rat the rat looked at richard i suppose its possible he admitted he says he was discharging an obligation to the marquis de carabas richard stared at the animal more closely its that rat yes weve met actually i threw the tv remote control at it some of the people standing around looked shocked the thin girl actually squeaked richard hardly noticed them at least something was familiar in this madness hello ratty he said good to see you again do you know where door is ratty said the girl in something between a squeak and a horrified swallow she had a large waterstained red button pinned to her ragged clothes the kind that comes attached to birthday cards it said in yellow letters i am lord ratspeaker waved his glass dagger admonishingly at richard you must not address master longtail save through me he said the rat squeaked an order the mans face fell him he said looking at richard disdainfully look i cant spare a soul how about if i simply slice his throat and send him down to the sewer folk the rat chittered once more decisively then leapt from the mans shoulder onto the ground and vanished into one of the many holes that lined the walls the lord ratspeaker stood up a hundred eyes were fixed on him he turned back to the hall and looked at his subjects crouched beside their greasy fires i dont know what you lot are all looking at he shouted whos turning the spits eh you want the grub to burn theres nothing to see go on getget away with the lot of you richard stood up nervously his left leg had gotten numb and he rubbed life into it as it prickled with pins and needles lord ratspeaker looked at iliaster hes got to be taken to the market master longtails orders iliaster shook his head and spat onto the ground well im not taking him he said more than my lifes worth that journey you ratspeakers have always been good to me but i cant go back there you know that the lord ratspeaker nodded he put his dagger away in the furs of his robe then he smiled at richard with yellow teeth you dont know how lucky you were just then he said yes i do said richard i really do no said the man you dont you really dont and he shook his head and said to himself marvelling ratty the lord ratspeaker took iliaster by the arm and the two of them walked a little way out of earshot and began to talk darting looks back at richard as they did so the thin girl was gulping down one of richards bananas in what was richard reflected the least erotic display of bananaeating he had ever seen you know that was going to be my breakfast said richard she looked up at him guiltily my names richard whats yours the girl who he realized had already managed to eat most of the fruit that richard had brought with him swallowed the last of the banana and hesitated then she halfsmiled and said something that sounded a lot like anaesthesia i was hungry she said well som i he told her she glanced at the little fires across the room then she looked back at richard she smiled again do you like cat she said yes said richard i quite like cats anaesthesia looked relieved thigh she asked or breast the girl called door walked down the court followed by the marquis de carabas there were a hundred other little courts and mews and alleys in london just like this one tiny spurs of oldtime unchanged for three hundred years even the smell of piss here was the same as it had been in pepyss time three hundred years before there was still an hour until dawn but the sky was beginning to lighten turning a stark leaden color strands of mist hung like livid ghosts on the air the door was roughly boarded up and covered with stained posters for forgotten bands and longclosed nightclubs the two of them stopped in front of it and the marquis eyed it all boards and nails and posters and he appeared unimpressed but then unimpressed was his default state so this is the entrance he said she nodded one of them he folded his arms well say open sesame or whatever it is that you do i dont want to do this she said im really not sure that were doing the right thing very well he unfolded his arms ill be seeing you then he turned on his heel and began to walk back the way that they had come door seized his arm youd abandon me she asked just like that he grinned without humor certainly im a very busy man things to see people to do look hold on she let go of his sleeve bit her lower lip the last time i was here she trailed off the last time you were here you found your family dead well there you are you dont have to explain it anymore if we arent going in then our business relationship is at an end she looked up at him her elfin face pale in the predawn light and thats all i could wish you the best of luck in your career but im afraid i rather doubt youll live long enough to have one youre a piece of work arent you he said nothing she walked back toward the door well she said come on ill take us in door put her left hand on the boardedup door and with her right hand she took the marquiss huge brown hand her tiny fingers twined into his larger ones she closed her eyes something whispered and shivered and changed and the door collapsed into darkness the memory was fresh only a few days old door moved through the house without doors calling im home and hello she slipped from the anteroom to the dining room to the library to the drawing room no one answered she moved to another room the swimming pool was an indoor victorian structure constructed of marble and of cast iron her father had found it when he was younger abandoned and about to be demolished and he had woven it into the fabric of the house without doors perhaps in the world outside in london above the room had long been destroyed and forgotten door had no idea where any of the rooms of her house were physically her grandfather had constructed the house taking a room from here a room from there all through london discrete and doorless her father had added to it she walked along the side of the old swimming pool pleased to be home puzzled by the absence of her family and then she looked down there was someone floating in the water trailing twin clouds of blood behind him one from the throat one from the groin it was her brother arch his eyes were open wide and sightless she realized that her mouth was open she could hear herself screaming that hurt said the marquis he rubbed his forehead hard twisted his head around on his neck as if he were trying to ease a sudden painful crick memories she explained theyre imprinted in the walls he raised an eyebrow you could have warned me they were in a huge white room every wall was covered with pictures each picture was of a different room the white room contained no doors no openings of any kind interesting decor acknowledged the marquis this is the entrance hall we can go from here to any room in the house they are all linked where are the other rooms located she shook her head i dont know miles away probably theyre scattered all over the underside the marquis had managed to cover the whole room in a series of impatient strides quite remarkable an associative house every room of which is located somewhere else so imaginative your grandfather was a man of vision door i never knew him she swallowed then continued talking to herself as much as to him we should have been safe here nobody should have been able to hurt us only my family could move around it lets hope your fathers journal gives us some clues he said where do we start looking door shrugged youre certain he kept a journal he pressed she nodded he used to go into his study and private the links until hed finished dictating well start in the study then but i looked there i did i looked there when i was cleaning up the body and she began to cry in low raging sobs that sounded like they were being tugged from inside her there there said the marquis de carabas awkwardly patting her shoulder and he added for good measure there he did not comfort well doors oddcolored eyes were filled with tears can you can you just give me a sec ill be fine he nodded and walked to the far end of the room when he looked back she was still standing there on her own silhouetted in the white entrance chamber filled with pictures of rooms and she was hugging herself and shuddering and crying like a little girl richard was still upset about the loss of his bag the lord ratspeaker remained unmoved he stated baldly that the ratmaster longtailhad said nothing at all about returning richards things just that he was to be taken to market then he told anaesthesia that she was taking the upworlder to the market and that yes it was an order and to stop snivelling and to get a move on he told richard that if he lord ratspeaker ever saw him richard again then he richard would be in a great deal of trouble he reiterated that richard did not know how lucky he was and ignoring richards requests that he return richards stuffor at least the wallethe led them to a door and locked it behind them richard and anaesthesia walked into the darkness side by side she carried an improvised lamp made of a candle a can some wire and a widemouthed glass lemonade bottle richard was surprised at how quickly his eyes became used to the near darkness they seemed to be walking through a succession of underground vaults and storage cellars sometimes he thought he could see movement in far corners of the vaults but whether human or rat or something else altogether it was always gone by the time they reached the place it had been when he tried to talk to anaesthesia about the movements she hissed him to silence he felt a cold draught on his face the ratgirl squatted without warning put down her candlelamp and tugged and pulled hard at a metal grille set in the wall it opened suddenly sending her sprawling she motioned richard to come through he crouched edged through the hole in the wall after about a foot the floor stopped completely excuse me whispered richard theres a hole here its not a big drop she told him go on she shut the grille behind her she was now uncomfortably close to richard here she said she gave him the handle of her little lamp to hold and she clambered down into the darkness there she said that wasnt that bad was it her face was a few feet below richards dangling feet here pass me the lamp he lowered it down to her she had to jump to take it from him now she whispered come on he edged nervously forward climbed over the edge hung for a moment then let go he landed on his hands and feet in soft wet mud he wiped the mud off his hands onto his sweater a few feet forward and anaesthesia was opening another door they went through it and she pulled it closed behind them we can talk now she said not loud but we can if you want to oh thanks said richard he couldnt think of anything to say so um youre a rat are you he said she giggled like a japanese girl covering her hand with her face as she laughed then she shook her head and said i should be so lucky i wish no im a ratspeaker we talk to rats what just chat to them oh no we do stuff for them i mean and her tone of voice implied that this was something that might never have occurred to richard unassisted there are some things rats cant do you know i mean not having fingers and thumbs an things hang on she pressed him against the wall suddenly and clamped a filthy hand over his mouth then she blew out the candle nothing happened then he heard distant voices they waited in the darkness and the cold richard shivered people walked past them talking in low tones when all sounds had died away anaesthesia took her hand from richards mouth relit the candle and they walked on who were they asked richard she shrugged it dunt matter she said then what makes you think that they wouldnt have been pleased to see us she looked at him rather sadly like a mother trying to explain to an infant that yes this flame was hot too all flames were hot trust her please come on she said i know a shortcut we can nip through london above for a bit they went up some stone steps and the girl pushed open a door they stepped through and the door shut behind them richard looked around puzzled they were standing on the embankment the mileslong walkway that the victorians had built along the north shore of the thames covering the drainage system and the newly created district line of the underground and replacing the stinking mudflats that had festered along the banks of the thames for the previous five hundred years it was still nightor perhaps it was night once more he was unsure how long they had been walking through the underplaces and the dark there was no moon but the night sky was a riot of crisp and glittering autumn stars there were streetlights too and lights on buildings and on bridges which looked like earthbound stars and they glimmered repeated as they were reflected with the city in the night water of the thames its fairyland thought richard anaesthesia blew out her candle and richard said are you sure this is the right way yes she said pretty sure they were approaching a wooden bench and the moment he set eyes on it it seemed to richard that that bench was one of the most desirable objects he had ever seen can we sit down he asked just for a minute she shrugged they sat down at opposite ends of the bench on friday said richard i was with one of the finest investment analyst firms in london whats a investment an a thing it was my job she nodded satisfied right and just reminding myself really yesterday it was like i didnt exist anymore to anybody up here thats cos you dont explained anaesthesia a latenight couple who had been slowly walking along the embankment toward them holding hands sat down in the middle of the bench between richard and anaesthesia and commenced to kiss each other passionately excuse me said richard to them the man had his hand inside the womans sweater and was moving it around enthusiastically a lone traveler discovering an unexplored continent i want my life back richard told the couple i love you said the man to the woman but your wife she said licking the side of his face fuck her said the man don wanna fuck her said the woman and she giggled drunkenly wanna fuck you she put a hand on his crotch and giggled some more come on said richard to anaesthesia feeling that the bench had started to become a less desirable neighborhood they got up and walked away anaesthesia peered back curiously at the couple on the bench who were gradually becoming more horizontal richard said nothing something wrong asked anaesthesia only everything said richard have you always lived down there nah i was born up here she hesitated you dont want to hear about me richard realized almost surprised that he really did i do really she fingered the rough quartz beads that hung in a necklace around her neck and she swallowed there was me and my mother and the twins she said and then she stopped talking her mouth clamped shut go on said richard its all right really it is honest the girl nodded she took a deep breath and then she began to talk without looking at him as she talked her eyes fixed on the ground ahead of her well my mother had me an my sisters but she got a bit funny in the head one day i got home from school and she was crying and crying and she didnt have any clothes on and she was breaking stuff plates and stuff but she never hurt us she never did the lady from the social services came and took the twins away an i had to go and stay with my aunt she was living with this man i didnt like him and when she was out of the house the girl paused she was quiet for so long that richard wondered if she had finished then she began once more anyway he used to hurt me do other stuff in the end i told my aunt an she started hitting me said i was lying said shed have the police on me but i wasnt lying so i run away it was my birthday they had reached the albert bridge a kitsch monument spanning the thames joining battersea to the south with the chelsea end of the embankment a bridge hung with thousands of tiny white lights i didnt have anywhere to go and it was so cold said anaesthesia and she stopped again i slept on the streets id sleep in the day when it was a bit warmer and walk around at night just to keep moving i was only eleven stealing bread an milk off peoples doorsteps to eat hated doing that so i started hanging around the street markets taking the rotten apples an oranges an things people threw away then i got really sick i was living under an overpass in notting hill when i come to i was in london below the rats had found me have you ever tried to return to all this he asked gesturing quiet warm inhabited houses latenight cars the real world she shook her head all fire burns little baby youll learn you cant its one or the other nobody ever gets both im sorry said door hesitantly her eyes were red and she looked as if she had been vigorously blowing her nose and scrubbing her tears from her eyes and cheeks the marquis had been amusing himself while he waited for her to collect herself by playing a game of knucklebones with some old coins and bones he kept in one of the many pockets of his coat he looked up at her coldly indeed she bit her lower lip no not really im not sorry ive been running and hiding and running so hard that this was the first chance ive really had to she stopped the marquis swept up the coins and the bones and returned them to their pocket after you he said he followed her back to the wall of pictures she put one hand on the painting of her fathers study and took the marquiss large black hand with the other reality twisted they were in the conservatory watering the plants first portia would water a plant directing the flow of the water toward the soil at the base of the plant avoiding the leaves and the blossoms water the shoes she said to her youngest daughter not the clothes ingress had her own little watering can she was so proud of it it was just like her mothers made of steel painted bright green as her mother finished with each plant ingress would water it with her tiny watering can on the shoes she told her mother she began laughing then spontaneous littlegirl laughter and her mother laughed too until foxy mr croup pulled her hair back hard and sudden and cut her white throat from ear to ear hello daddy said door quietly she touched the bust of her father with her fingers stroking the side of his face a thin ascetic man almost bald caesar as prospero thought the marquis de carabas he felt a little sick that last image had hurt still he was in lord porticos study that was a first the marquis took in the room eyes sliding from detail to detail the stuffed crocodile hanging from the ceiling the leatherbound books an astrolabe convex and concave mirrors odd scientific instruments there were maps on the walls of lands and cities de carabas had never heard of a desk covered in handwritten correspondence the white wall behind the desk was marred by a reddishbrown stain there was a small portrait of doors family on the desk the marquis stared at it your mother and your sister your father and your brothers all dead how did you escape he asked she lowered her hand i was lucky id gone off exploring for a few days did you know there are still some roman soldiers camped out by the kilburn river the marquis had not known this which irritated him hmm how many she shrugged a few dozen they were deserters from the nineteenth legion i think my latins a bit patchy anyway when i got back here she paused swallowed her opalcolored eyes brimming with tears pull yourself together said the marquis shortly we need your fathers journal we have to find out who did this she frowned at him we know who did this it was croup and vandemar he opened a hand waggled his fingers as he spoke theyre arms hands fingers theres a head that ordered it that wants you dead too those two dont come cheap he looked around the cluttered office his journal said the marquis its not here she said i told you i looked i was under the misapprehension that your family was skilled in locating doors both obvious and otherwise she glowered at him then she closed her eyes and put her finger and thumb on each side of the bridge of her nose meanwhile the marquis examined the objects on porticos desk an inkwell a chesspiece a bone die a gold pocketwatch several quillfeathers and interesting it was a small statue of a boar or a crouching bear or perhaps a bull it was hard to tell it was the size of a large chesspiece and it had been roughly carved out of black obsidian it reminded him of something but of what he could not say he picked it up casually turned it over curled his fingers around it door lowered her hand from her face she looked puzzled and confused whats the matter he asked it is here she said simply she began to walk through the study head turning first to one side and then to the other the marquis slipped the carving discreetly into an inside pocket door stood before a high cabinet there she said she reached out a hand there was a click and a small panel in the side of the cabinet swung open door reached into the darkness and removed something roughly the size and shape of a small cannonball she passed it to the marquis it was a sphere constructed of old brass and polished wood inset with polished copper and glass lenses he took it from her this is it she nodded well done she looked grave i dont know how i could have missed it before you were upset said the marquis i was certain it would be here and i am so rarely wrong now he held the little wooden globe up the light caught the polished glass and glinted from the brass and copper fittings it galled him to admit ignorance about anything but he said it anyway how does this work anaesthesia led richard into a small park on the south side of the bridge then down some stone steps set beside a wall she relit her candleinabottle and then she opened a workmans door and closed it behind them they went down some steps with the darkness all around them theres a girl named door said richard shes a bit younger than you do you know her the lady door i know who she is so which um barony is she part of no barony shes of the house of the arch her family used to be very important used to be why did they stop somebody killed them yes he remembered the marquis saying something about that now a rat cut across their path anaesthesia stopped on the steps and performed a deep curtsey the rat paused sire she said to the rat hi said richard the rat looked at them for a heartbeat then it darted off down the steps so said richard what is a floating market its very big she said but ratspeakers hardly ever need to go to the market to tell the truth she hesitated nah youll laugh at me i wont said richard honestly well said the thin girl im a little scared scared of the market they had reached the bottom of the steps anaesthesia hesitated and then turned left oh no theres a truce in the market if anyone hurt anyone there the whole of london below would be down on them like a ton of sewage so what are you scared of getting there they hold it in a different place every time it moves around and to get to the place itll be tonight she fingered the quartz beads around her neck nervously well have to go through a really nasty neighborhood she did sound scared richard suppressed the urge to put an arm around her and where would that be he asked she turned to him pushed the hair from her eyes and told him knightsbridge repeated richard and he began to chuckle gently the girl turned away see she said i said youd laugh the deep tunnels had been dug in the s for a highspeed extension to the northern line of londons underground railway system during the second world war troops had been quartered there in the thousands their waste pumped up by compressed air to the level of the sewers far above both sides of the runnels had been lined with metal bunk beds for the troops to sleep on when the war ended the bunk beds had stayed and on their wire bases cardboard boxes were stored each box filled with letters and files and papers secrets of the dullest kind stored down deep to be forgotten the need for economy had closed the deep tunnels completely in the early s the boxes of secrets were removed to be scanned and stored on computers or shredded or burned varney made his home in the deepest of the deep tunnels far beneath camden town tube he had piled abandoned metal bunk beds in front of the only entrance then he had decorated varney liked weapons he made his own out of whatever he could find or take or steal parts of cars and rescued bits of machinery which he turned into hooks and shivs crossbows and arbalests small mangonels and trebuchets for breaking walls cudgels glaives and knobkerries they hung on the wall of the deep runnel or sat in corners looking unfriendly varney looked like a bull might look if the bull were to be shaved dehorned covered in tattoos and suffered from complete dental breakdown also he snored the oil lamp next to his head was turned down low varney slept on a pile of rags snoring and snuffling with the hilt of a homemade twobladed sword on the ground beside his hand a hand turned up the oil lamp varney had the twobladed sword in his hand and he was on his feet almost before his eyes were open he blinked stared around him there was no one there nothing had disturbed the pile of bunk beds blocking the door he began to lower the sword a voice said psst hh said varney surprise said mr croup stepping into the light varney took a step back a mistake there was a knife at his temple the point of the blade next to his eye further movements are not recommended said mr croup helpfully mister vandemar might have a little accident with his old toadsticker most accidents do occur in the home is that not so mister vandemar i dont trust statistics said mr vandemars blank voice a gloved hand reached down from behind varney crushed his sword and dropped the twisted thing to the floor how are you varney asked mr croup well we trust yes in fine form fetlock and fettle for the market tonight do you know who we are varney did the nearest thing he could to a nod that didnt actually involve moving any muscles he knew who croup and vandemar were his eyes were searching the walls yes there the morningstar a spiked wooden ball studded with nails on a chain in the far corner of the room there is talk that a certain young lady will be auditioning bodyguards this evening had you thought of trying out for the task mr croup picked at his tombstone teeth enunciate clearly varney picked up the morningstar with his mind it was his knack gentle now slowly he edged it off the hook and pulled it up toward the top of the tunnel arch with his mouth he said varneys the best bravo and guard in the underside they say im the best since hunters day varney mentally positioned the morningstar in the shadows above and behind mr croups head he would crush croups skull first then hed take vandemar the morningstar plunged toward mr croups head varney flung himself down away from the knifeblade at his eye mr croup did not look up he did not turn he simply moved his head obscenely fast and the morningstar crashed past him into the floor where it threw up chips of brick and concrete mr vandemar picked varney up with one hand hurt him he asked his partner mr croup shook his head not yet to varney he said not bad so best bravo and guard we want you to get yourself to the market tonight we want you to do whatever you have to to become that certain young ladys personal bodyguard then when you get the job one thing you dont forget you may guard her from the rest of the world but when we want her we take her got it varney ran his tongue over the wreck of his teeth are you bribing me he asked mr vandemar had picked up the morningstar he was pulling the chain apart with his free hand link by link and dropping the bits of twisted metal onto the floor chink no said mr vandemar chink were intimidating you chink and if you dont do what mister croup says were chink hurting you chink very badly before were chink killing you ah said varney then im working for you arent i yes you are said mr croup im afraid we dont have any redeeming features that doesnt bother me said varney good said mr croup welcome aboard it was a large but elegant mechanism built of polished walnut and oak of brass and glass copper and mirrors and carved and inlaid ivory of quartz prisms and brass gears and springs and cogs the whole thing was rather larger than a widescreen television although the actual screen itself was no more than six inches across a magnifying lens placed across it increased the size of the picture there was a large brass horn coming out of the sidethe kind you could find on an antique gramophone the whole mechanism looked rather like a combined television and video player might look if it had been invented and built three hundred years ago by sir isaac newton which was more or less exactly what it was watch said door she placed the wooden ball onto a platform lights shone through the machine and into the ball it began to spin around and around a patrician face appeared on the small screen vividly colored slightly out of time a voice came from the horn crackling in midspeech that two cities should be so near said the voice and yet in all things so far the possessors above us and the dispossessed we who live below and between who live in the cracks door stared at the screen her face unreadable still said her father i am of the opinion that what cripples us who inhabit the underside is our petty factionalism the system of baronies and fiefdoms is both divisive and foolish the lord portico was wearing a threadbare old smoking jacket and a skullcap his voice seemed to be coming to them across the centuries not days or weeks he coughed i am not alone in this belief there are those who wish to see things the way they are there are others who want the situation to worsen there are those can you speed it up asked the marquis find the last entry door nodded she touched an ivory lever at the side the image ghosted fragmented reformed now portico wore a long coat his skullcap was gone there was a scarlet gash down one side of his head he was no longer sitting at his desk he was talking urgently quietly i do not know who will see this who will find this but whoever you are please take this to my daughter the lady door if she lives a static burst wiped across the picture and the sound then door girl this is bad i dont know how long ive got before they find this room i think my poor portia and your brother and sister are dead the sound and picture quality began to degrade the marquis glanced at door her face was wet tears were brimming from her eyes glistening down her cheeks she seemed unaware that she was crying made no attempt to wipe away the tears she just stared at her fathers image listened to his words crackle wipe crackle listen to me girl said her dead father go to islington you can trust islington you must believe in islington he ghosted blood dripped from his forehead into his eyes he he wiped it off door avenge us avenge your family a loud bang came from the gramophone horn portico turned his head to look offscreen puzzled and nervous what he said and he stepped out of frame for a moment the picture remained unchanged the desk the blank white wall behind it then an arc of vivid blood splashed across the wall door flicked a lever on the side blanking the screen and turned away here the marquis passed her a handkerchief thanks she wiped her face blew her nose vigorously then she stared into space eventually she said islington ive never had any dealings with islington said the marquis i thought it was just a legend she said not at all he reached across the desk picked up the gold pocketwatch thumbed it open nice workmanship he observed she nodded it was my fathers he closed the cover with a click time to go to market it starts soon mister time is not our friend she blew her nose once more put her hands deep into the pockets of her leather jacket then she turned to him elfin face frowning oddcolored eyes bright do you honestly think we can find a bodyguard who will be able to deal with croup and vandemar the marquis flashed his white teeth at her theres been no one since hunter whod even have a chance no ill settle for someone who could give you the time you might need to get away he fastened the fob of the watch chain to his waistcoat slid the watch into his vest pocket what are you doing asked door thats my fathers watch hes not using it anymore is he he adjusted the golden chain there that looks rather elegant he watched the emotions flicker across her face quiet anger and finally resignation wed better go was all she said the bridge isnt very far now said anaesthesia richard hoped that was true they were now on their third candle the walls flickered and oozed the passageway seemed to stretch on forever he was astonished that they were still under london he was halfconvinced that they had walked most of the way to wales im really scared she continued ive never crossed the bridge before i thought you said youd been to this market already he asked mystified its the floating market silly i told you already it moves different places last one i went to was held in that big clock tower big someone and the next was big ben he suggested maybe we were inside where all the big wheels went around and that was where i got this she held up her necklace the candlelight glimmered yellow off the shiny quartz she smiled like a child do you like it she asked its great was it expensive i swapped some stuff for it thats how things work down here we swap stuff and then they turned a corner and saw the bridge it could have been one of the bridges over the thames five hundred years ago thought richard a huge stone bridge spanning out over a vast black chasm into the night but there was no sky above it no water below it rose into darkness richard wondered who had built it and when he wondered how something like this could exist beneath the city of london without everyone knowing he felt a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach he was he realized deeply pathetically scared of the bridge itself do we have to go across it he asked cant we get to the market some other way they paused at the base of the bridge anaesthesia shook her head we can get to the place its in she said but the market wouldnt be there huh but thats ridiculous i mean somethings either there or its not isnt it she shook her head there was a buzz of voices from behind them and someone pushed richard to the ground he looked up a huge man crudely tattooed dressed in improvised rubber and leather clothes that looked like they had been cut out of the inside of cars stared back down at him dispassionately behind the huge man were a dozen others male and female people who looked like they were on their way to a particularly lowrent costume party somebody said varney who was not in a good mood was in my way somebody ought to watch where hes going once as a small boy walking home from school richard had encountered a rat in a ditch by the side of the road when the rat saw richard it had reared up onto its hind legs and hissed and jumped terrifying richard he backed away marvelling that something so small had been so willing to fight something so much larger than itself now anaesthesia stepped between richard and varney she was less than half his size but she glared at the big man and bared her teeth and she hissed like an angry rat at bay varney took a step backwards he spat at richards shoes then he turned away and taking the knot of people with him he walked across the bridge and into the dark are you all right asked anaesthesia helping richard back to his feet im fine he said that was really brave of you she looked down shyly im not really brave she said im still scared of the bridge even they were scared that was why they all went over together safety in numbers if you are crossing the bridge i will go with you said a female voice rich as cream and honey coming from behind them richard was not able to place her accent he turned and standing there was a tall woman with long tawny hair and skin the color of burnt caramel she wore dappled leather clothes mottled in shades of gray and brown she had a battered leather duffel bag over her shoulder she was carrying a staff and she had a knife at her belt and an electric flashlight strapped to her wrist she was also without question the most beautiful woman that richard had ever seen safety in numbers youre welcome to come with us he said after a moments hesitation my names richard mayhew this is anaesthesia shes the one us who knows what shes doing the ratgirl preened the leather woman looked him up and looked him down youre from london above she told him yes as lost as he was in this strange otherworld he was at least learning to play the game his mind was too numb to make any sense of where he was or why he was here but it was capable of following the rules travelling with a ratspeaker my word im his guardian said anaesthesia truculently who are you who do you owe fealty to the woman smiled i owe no man fealty ratgirl have either of you crossed nights bridge before anaesthesia shook her head well isnt this going to be fun they walked toward the bridge anaesthesia handed richard her candlelamp here she said thanks richard looked at the woman in leather is there anything really to be scared of only the night on the bridge she said the kind in armor the kind that comes when day is over anaesthesias hand sought richards he held it tightly her tiny hand in his she smiled at him squeezed his hand and then they set foot on nights bridge and richard began to understand darkness darkness as something solid and real so much more than a simple absence of light he felt it touch his skin questing moving exploring gliding through his mind it slipped into his lungs behind his eyes into his mouth with each step they took the light of the candle became dimmer he realized the same thing was happening to the leather womans flashlight it felt not so much as if the lights were being turned down but as if the darkness were being turned up richard blinked and opened his eyes on nothingnothing but darkness complete and utter sounds a rustling a squirming richard blinked blinded by the night the sounds were nastier hungrier richard imagined he could hear voices a horde of huge misshapen trolls beneath the bridge something slithered past them in the dark whats that squeaked anaesthesia her hand was shaking in his hush whispered the woman dont attract its attention whats happening whispered richard darkness is happening said the leather woman very quietly night is happening all the nightmares that have come out when the sun goes down since the cave times when we huddled together in fear for safety and for warmth are happening now she told them now is the time to be afraid of the dark richard knew that something was about to creep over his face he closed his eyes it made no difference to what he saw or felt the night was complete it was then that the hallucinations started he saw a figure falling toward him through the night burning its wings and hair on fire he threw up his hands there was nothing there jessica looked at him with contempt in her eyes he wanted to shout to her tell her he was sorry place one foot after another he was a small child walking home from school at night down the one road with no streetlights no matter how many times he did it it never got any easier never got any better he was deep in the sewers lost in a labyrinth the beast was waiting for him he could hear a slow drip of water he knew the beast was waiting he gripped his spear then a rumbling bellow deep in its throat from behind him he turned slowly agonizingly slowly it charged at him through the dark and it charged he died and kept walking slowly agonizingly slowly it charged at him over and over through the dark there was a sputter and a flare so bright it hurt making richard squint and stagger it was the candle flame in its lemonadebottle holder he had never known how brightly a single candle could burn he held it up gasping and gulping and shaking with relief his heart was pounding and shuddering in his chest we would appear to have crossed successfully said the leather woman richards heart was pounding in his chest so hard that for a few moments he was unable to talk he forced himself to breathe slowly to calm down they were in a large anteroom exactly like the one on the other side in fact richard had the strange feeling that it was the same room they had just left yet the shadows were deeper and there were afterimages floating before richards eyes like those one saw after a camera flash i suppose richard said haltingly we werent in any real danger it was like a haunted house a few noises in the dark and your imagination does the rest there wasnt really anything to be scared of was there the woman looked at him almost pityingly and richard realized that there was nobody holding his hand anaesthesia from the darkness at the crown of the bridge came a gentle noise like a rustle or a sigh a handful of irregular quartz beads pattered down the curve of the bridge toward them richard picked one up it was from the ratgirls necklace his mouth opened but no sound came out then he found his voice wed better we have to go back shes the woman raised her flashlight shone it across the bridge richard could see all the way across the bridge it was deserted where is she he asked gone said the woman flatly the darkness took her weve got to do something said richard urgently such as once again he opened his mouth this time he found no words he closed it again he fingered the lump of quartz looked at the others on the ground shes gone said the woman the bridge takes its toll be grateful it didnt take you too now if youre going to the market its through here up this way she gestured toward a narrow passageway that rose up into the dimness in front of them barely illuminated by the beam of her flashlight richard did not move he felt numb he found it hard to believe that the rat girl was gonelost or stolen or strayed or and harder to believe that the leather woman was able to carry on as if nothing at all out of the ordinary had happenedas if this were utterly usual anaesthesia could not be dead he completed the thought she could not be dead because if she were then it was his fault she had not asked to go with him he held the quartz bead so tightly it hurt his hand thinking of the pride with which anaesthesia had shown it to him of how fond he had become of her in the handful of hours that he had known her are you coming richard stood there in the darkness for a few pounding heartbeats then he placed the quartz bead gently into the pocket of his jeans he followed the woman who was still some paces ahead of him as he followed her he realized that he still did not know her name five people slipped and slid through the darkness about them holding lamps torches flashlights and candles it made richard think of documentary films he had seen of schools of fish glittering and darting through the ocean deep water inhabited by things that had lost the use of their eyes richard followed the leather woman up some steps stone steps edged with metal they were in an underground station they joined a line of people waiting to slip through a grille which had been opened a foot or so to uncover the door which led out onto the pavement immediately in front of them were a couple of young boys each with a string tied around his wrist the strings were held by a pallid bald man who smelled of formaldehyde immediately behind them in the line waited a graybearded man with a blackandwhite kitten sitting on his shoulder it washed itself intently licked the mans ear then curled up on his shoulder and went to sleep the line moved slowly as one by one the figures at the end slipped through the space between the grille and the wall and edged into the night why are you going to the market richard mayhew asked the leather woman in a low voice richard still could not place her accent he was beginning to suspect that she was african or australianor perhaps she came from somewhere even more exotic and obscure i have friends im hoping to meet there well just one friend i dont actually know many people from this world i was sort of getting to know anaesthesia but he trailed off asked the question he had not dared to voice until this moment is she dead the woman shrugged yes or as good as i trust your visit to the market will make her loss worthwhile richard shivered i dont think it could he said he felt empty and utterly alone they were approaching the front of the line what do you do he asked she smiled i sell personal physical services oh he said what kind of personal physical services he asked i rent my body she did not elaborate ah he was too weary to pursue it to press her to explain just what she meant he had an idea though and then they stepped out into the night richard looked back the sign on the station said knightsbridge he didnt know whether to smile or to mourn it felt like the small hours of the morning richard looked down at his watch and was not surprised to notice that the digital face was now completely blank perhaps the batteries had died or he thought more likely time in london below had only a passing acquaintance with the kind of time he was used to he did not care he unstrapped the watch and dropped it into the nearest garbage can the odd people were crossing the road in a stream walking through the double doors facing them there he said appalled the woman nodded there the building was large and it was covered with many thousands of burning lights conspicuous coats of arms on the wall facing them proudly proclaimed that it sold all sorts of things by appointment to various members of the british royal family richard who had spent many a footsore weekend hour trailing behind jessica through every prominent shop in london recognized it immediately even without the huge sign proclaiming it to be harrods the woman nodded only for tonight she said the next market could be anywhere but i mean said richard harrods it seemed almost sacrilegious to be sneaking into this place at night they walked in through the side door the room was dark they passed the bureau de change and the giftwrapping section through another darkened room selling sunglasses and figurines and then they stepped into the egyptian room color and light broke over richard like a wave hitting the shore his companion turned to him she yawned catlike shading the vivid pinkness of her mouth with the back of her caramel hand and then she smiled and said well youre here safe and more or less sound i have business to attend to fare you well she nodded curtly and slipped away into the crowd richard stood there alone in the throng drinking it in it was pure madnessof that there was no doubt at all it was loud and brash and insane and it was in many ways quite wonderful people argued haggled shouted sang they hawked and touted their wares and loudly declaimed the superiority of their merchandise music was playinga dozen different kinds of music being played a dozen different ways on a score of different instruments most of them improvised improved improbable richard could smell food all kinds of foodthe smells of curries and spices seemed to predominate with beneath them the smells of grilling meats and mushrooms stalls had been set up all throughout the shop next to or even on counters that during the day had sold perfume or watches or amber or silk scarves everybody was buying everybody was selling richard listened to the market cries as he began to wander through the crowds lovely fresh dreams firstclass nightmares we got em get yer lovely nightmares here weapons arm yourself defend your cellar cave or hole you want to hit em we got em come on darling come on over here rubbish screamed a fat elderly woman in richards ear as he passed her malodorous stall junk she continued garbage trash offal debris come and get it nothing whole or undamaged crap tripe and useless piles of shit you know you want it a man in armor beat a small drum and chanted lost property roll up roll up and see for yourself lost property none of your found things here everything guaranteed properly lost richard wandered through the huge rooms of the store like a man in a trance he was unable to even guess how many people there were at the night market a thousand two thousand five thousand one stall was piled high with bottles full bottles and empty bottles of every shape and every size from bottles of booze to one huge glimmering bottle that could have contained nothing but a captive djinn another sold lamps with candles made of many kinds of wax and tallow a man thrust what appeared to be a childs severed hand clutching a candle toward him as he passed muttering hand of glory sir send em up the wooden hill to bedfordshire guaranteed to work richard hurried past not wishing to find out what a hand of glory was nor how it worked he passed a stall selling glittering gold and silver jewelry another selling jewelry made from what looked like the valves and wires of antique radios there were stalls that sold every manner of book and magazine others that sold clothesold clothes patched and mended and made strange several tattooists something that he was almost certain was a small slave market a dentists chair with a handoperated manual drill with a line of miserable people standing beside it waiting to have their teeth pulled or filled by a young man who seemed to be having altogether too good a time a bent old man selling unlikely things that might have been hats and might have been modern art something that looked very much like a portable shower facility even a blacksmiths and every few stalls there would be somebody selling food some of them had food cooking over open fires curries and potatoes and chestnuts and huge mushrooms and exotic breads richard found himself wondering why the smoke from the fires didnt set off the buildings sprinkler system then he found himself wondering why no one was looting the store why set up their own little stalls why not just take things from the shop itself he knew better at this point than to risk asking anyone he seemed marked as a man from london above and thus worthy of great suspicion there was something deeply tribal about the people richard decided he tried to pick out distinct groups there were the ones who looked like they had escaped from a historical reenactment society the ones who reminded him of hippies the albino people in gray clothes and dark glasses the polished dangerous ones in smart suits and black gloves the huge almost identical women who walked together in twos and threes and nodded when they saw each other the tanglehaired ones who looked like they probably lived in sewers and who smelled like hell and a hundred other types and kinds he wondered how normal londonhis londonwould look to an alien and that made him bold he began to ask them as he went excuse me im looking for a man named de carabas and a girl called door do you know where id find them people shook their heads apologized averted their eyes moved away richard took a step back and stepped on someones foot someone was well over seven feet tall and was covered in tufty gingercolored hair someones teeth had been sharpened to points someone picked richard up with a hand the size of a sheeps head and put richards head so close to someones mouth that richard almost gagged im really sorry said richard iim looking for a girl named door do you know but someone dropped him onto the floor and moved on another whiff of cooking food wafted across the floor and richard who had managed to forget how hungry he was ever since he had declined the prime cut of tomcathe could not think how many hours beforenow found his mouth watering and his thinking processes beginning to grind to a halt the ironhaired woman running the next food stall he approached did not reach to richards waist when richard tried to talk to her she shook her head drew a finger across her lips she could not talk or did not talk or did not want to talk richard found himself conducting the negotiations for a cottage cheese and lettuce sandwich and a cup of what looked and smelled like homebrewed lemonade in sign language his food cost him a ballpoint pen and a book of matches he had forgotten he had the little woman must have felt that she had got by far the better of the deal for as he took his food she threw in a couple of small nutty cookies richard stood in the middle of the throng listening to the musicsomeone was for no reason that richard could easily discern singing the lyrics of greensleeves to the tune of yakketyyak watching the bizarre bazaar unfold around him and eating his sandwiches as he finished the last of the sandwiches he realized that he had no idea how anything he had just eaten had tasted and he resolved to slow down and chew the cookies more slowly he sipped the lemonade making it last you need a bird sir asked a cheery voice close at hand i got rooks and ravens crows and starlings fine wise birds tasty and wise brilliant richard said no thank you and turned around the handpainted sign above the stall said old baileys birds and information there were other smaller signs scattered about you wants it we knows it and you wont find a plumper starling and when its time for a rook its time for old bailey richard found himself thinking of the man he had seen when he had first come to london who used to stand outside leicester square tube station with a huge handpainted sandwich board that exhorted the world to less lust through less protein eggs meat beans cheese and sitting birds hopped and fluttered about small cages that looked as if they had been woven out of tv antennae information then continued old bailey warming to his own salespitch roofmaps history secret and mysterious knowledge if i dont knows it its probably better forgot thats what i says the old man still wore his feathered coat was still wrapped about with ropes and cords he blinked at richard then pulled on the pair of spectacles tied about his neck with string he inspected richard carefully through them hang oni knows you you was with the marquis de carabas on the rooftops remember eh im old bailey remember me he thrust out his hand pumped richards hand furiously actually said richard im looking for the marquis and for a young lady named door i think theyre probably together the old man did a little jig causing several feathers to detach themselves from his coat this provoked a chorus of raucous disapproval from the various birds around them information information he announced to the crowded room see i told em diversify i said diversify you cant sell rooks for the stewpot foreveranyway they taste like boiled slipper and theyre so stupid thick as custard you ever eaten rook richard shook his head that was something he could be certain of at any rate whatll you give me asked old bailey sorry said richard awkwardly leaping from ice floe to ice floe in the stream of the old mans consciousness ifn i give ye your information whatll i get i dont have any money said richard and i just gave my pen away he began to pull out the contents of richards pockets there said old bailey that my hankie asked richard it was not a particularly clean handkerchief it had been a present from his aunt maude on his last birthday old bailey seized it and waved it above his head happily never you fear laddie he sang triumphantly your quest is at an end go down there through that door you cant miss them theyre auditioning he was pointing towards harrods extensive network of food halls a rook cawed maliciously none of your beak said old bailey to the rook and to richard he said thankee for the little flag he jigged around his stall delighted waving richards handkerchief to and fro auditioning thought richard and then he smiled it didnt matter his quest as the mad old roofman had put it was at an end he walked toward the food halls fashion in bodyguards seemed to be everything they all had a knack of one kind or another and each of them was desperate to demonstrate it to the world at the moment ruislip was facing off against the fop with no name the fop with no name looked somewhat like an early eighteenthcentury rake one who hadnt been able to find real rake clothes and had had to make do with what he could find at the salvation army store his face was powdered to white his lips painted red ruislip the fops opponent resembled a bad dream one might have if one fell asleep watching sumo wrestling on the television with a bob marley record playing in the background he was a huge rastafarian who looked like nothing so much as an obese and enormous baby they were standing face to face in the middle of a cleared circle of spectators and other bodyguards and sightseers neither man moved a muscle the fop was a good head taller than ruislip on the other hand ruislip looked as if he weighed as much as four fops each of them carrying a large leather suitcase entirely filled with lard they stared at each other without breaking eye contact the marquis de carabas tapped door on the shoulder and pointed something was about to happen one moment there were two men standing impassively just looking at each other then the fops head rocked back as if hed just been hit in the face a small reddish purple bruise appeared on his cheek he pursed his lips and fluttered his eyelashes la he said then stretched his rouged lips wide in a ghastly parody of a smile the fop gestured ruislip staggered and clutched his stomach the fop with no name smirked outrageously waggled his fingers and blew kisses to several spectators ruislip stared angrily at the fop redoubling his mental assault blood began to drip from the fops lips his left eye started to swell he staggered the audience muttered appreciatively its not as impressive as it looks whispered the marquis to door the fop with no name stumbled suddenly going onto his knees as if someone were forcing him down and fell awkwardly to the floor then he jerked as if someone had just kicked him hard in the stomach ruislip looked triumphant the spectators clapped politely the fop writhed and spat blood onto the sawdust on the floor of harrods fish and meat hall he was dragged off into the corner by some friends and was violently sick next said the marquis the next wouldbe bodyguard was again thinner than ruislip he was covered in tattoos and dressed in clothes that looked like they had been stitched together from old car seats and rubber mats he was shavenheaded and he sneered at the world through rotten teeth im varney he said and he hawked and spat green on the sawdust he walked into the ring when youre ready gentlemen said the marquis ruislip stamped his bare feet on the floor sumolike onetwo onetwo and commenced to stare hard at varney a small cut opened on varneys forehead and blood began to drip from it into one eye varney ignored it and instead appeared to be concentrating on his right arm he pulled his arm up slowly like a man fighting a great deal of pressure then he slammed his fist into ruislips nose which began to spurt blood ruislip drew one long horrible breath and hit the ground with the sound of half a ton of wet liver being dropped into a bathtub varney giggled ruislip slowly pulled himself back to his feet blood from his nose soaking his mouth and chest dripping onto the sawdust varney wiped the blood from his forehead and bared his ruined mouth at the world in an appalling grin come on he said fat bastard hit me again that ones promising muttered the marquis door raised an eyebrow he doesnt look very nice nice in a bodyguard lectured the marquis is about as useful as the ability to regurgitate whole lobsters he looks dangerous there was a murmur of appreciation then as varney did something rather fast and painful to ruislip something that involved the sudden connection of varneys leatherbound foot and ruislips testicles the murmur was the kind of restrained and deeply unenthusiastic applause one normally only hears in england on sleepy sunny sunday afternoons at village cricket matches the marquis clapped politely with the rest of them very good sir he said varney looked at door and he winked at her almost proprietarily before he returned his attention to ruislip door shivered richard heard the clapping and walked toward it five almost identically dressed pale young women walked past him they wore long dresses made of velvet each dress as dark as night one each of dark green dark chocolate royal blue dark blood and pure black each woman had black hair and wore silver jewelry each was perfectly coifed perfectly made up they moved silently richard was aware only of a swish of heavy velvet as they went past a swish that sounded almost like a sigh the last of the women the one dressed in utter black the palest and the most beautiful smiled at richard he smiled back at her warily then he walked on toward the audition it was being held in the fish and meat hall on the open area of floor beneath harrods fish sculpture the audience had their back to him were standing two or three people deep richard wondered if he would easily be able to find door and the marquis and then the crowd parted and he saw them both sitting on the glass top of the smokedsalmon counter he opened his mouth to shout out doors name and as he did so he realized why the crowd had parted as an enormous dreadlocked man naked but for a green yellow and red cloth wrapped like a diaper around his middle came catapulting through the crowd as if tossed by a giant landing squarely on top of him richard she said he opened his eyes the face swam in and out of focus fire opalcolored eyes peering into his from a pale elfin face door he said she looked furious she looked beyond fury temple and arch richard i dont believe it what are you doing here its nice to see you too said richard weakly he sat up and wondered if he was suffering from a concussion he wondered how hed know if he was and he wondered why he had ever thought that door would have been pleased to see him she stared intently at her nails nostrils flaring as if she did not trust herself to say anything else the big man with the very bad teeth the man who had knocked richard over on the bridge was fighting with a dwarf they were fighting with crowbars and the fight was not as unequal as one might have imagined the dwarf was preternaturally fast he rolled he struck he bounced he dove his every movement made varney appear lumbering and awkward by comparison richard turned to the marquis who was watching the fight intently what is happening he asked the marquis spared him a glance and then returned his gaze to the action in front of them you he said are out of your league in deep shit and i would imagine a few hours away from an untimely and undoubtedly messy end we on the other hand are auditioning bodyguards varney connected his crowbar with the dwarf who instantly stopped bouncing and darting and instantly began lying insensible i think weve seen enough said the marquis loudly thank you all mister varney if you could wait behind why did you have to come here door said to richard frostily i didnt really have much choice said richard she sighed the marquis was walking around the perimeter dismissing the various bodyguards who had already auditioned distributing a few words of praise here of advice there varney waited patiently off to one side richard essayed a smile at door it was ignored how did you get to the market she asked there are these rat people richard began ratspeakers she said and you see the rat who brought us the marquiss message master longtail she said well he told them they had to get me here she raised an eyebrow cocked her head slightly on one side a ratspeaker brought you here he nodded most of the way her name was anaesthesia she well something happened to her on the bridge this other lady brought me the rest of the way here i think she was a you know he hesitated then said it hooker the marquis had returned he stood in front of varney who looked obscenely pleased with himself weapons expertise asked the marquis whew said varney put it like this if you can cut someone with it blow someones head off with it break a bone with it or make a nasty hole in someone with it then varneys the master of it previous satisfied employers include olympia the shepherd queen the crouch enders i done security for the may fair for a bit as well well said the marquis de carabas were all very impressed with your skill i had heard said a female voice that you had put out a call for bodyguards not for enthusiastic amateurs her skin was the color of burnt caramel and her smile would have stopped a revolution she was dressed entirely in soft mottled gray and brown leathers richard recognized her immediately thats her richard whispered to door the hooker varney said varney affronted is the best guard and bravo in the underside everyone knows that the woman looked at the marquis youve finished the trials she asked yes said varney not necessarily said the marquis then she told him i would like to audition there was a beat before the marquis de carabas said very well and stepped backward varney was undoubtedly dangerous not to mention a bully a sadist and actively harmful to the physical health of those around him what he was not though was particularly quick on the uptake he stared at the marquis as the penny dropped and dropped and kept on dropping finally in disbelief he asked i have to fight her yes said the leather woman unless youd like a little nap first varney began to laugh a manic giggle he stopped laughing a moment later when the woman kicked him hard in the solar plexus and he toppled like a tree near his hand on the floor was the crowbar he had used in the fight with the dwarf he grabbed it slammed it into the womans faceor would have had she not ducked out of the way she clapped her open hands onto his ears very fast the crowbar went flying across the room still reeling from the pain in his ears varney pulled a knife from his boot he was not entirely sure what happened after that only that the world swung out from under him and then he was lying face down on the ground with blood coming from his ears and his own knife at his throat while the marquis de carabas was saying enough the woman looked up still holding varneys knife to his throat well she said very impressive said the marquis door nodded richard was thunderstruck it had been like watching emma peel bruce lee and a particularly vicious tornado all rolled into one and sprinkled with a generous helping of a mongoose killing a king cobra that was how she had moved that was how she had fought richard normally found displays of real violence unnerving but he found watching this woman in action exhilarating as if she were finding a part of him he had not known existed it seemed utterly right in this unreal mirror of the london he had known that she should be here and that she should be fighting so dangerously and so well she was part of london below he understood that now and as he thought that he thought about london above and a world in which no one fought like thisno one needed to fight like thisa world of safety and of sanity and for a moment the homesickness engulfed him like a fever the woman looked down at varney thank you mister varney she said politely im afraid we wont be needing your services after all she got off him and put his knife away in her belt and you are called asked the marquis im called hunter she said nobody said anything then door spoke hesitantly the hunter thats right said hunter and she brushed the dust of the floor from her leather leggings im back from somewhere a bell sounded twice a deep bonging noise that made richards teeth vibrate five minutes muttered the marquis then he said to the remains of the crowd i think weve found our bodyguard thank you all very much nothing more to see hunter walked over to door and looked her up and down can you stop people from killing me asked door hunter inclined her head toward richard i saved his life three times today crossing the bridge coming to the market varney who had stumbled to his feet picked up the crowbar with his mind the marquis watched him do it he said nothing the ghost of a smile hovered about doors lips thats funny she said richard thought you were a hunter never found out what richard thought she was the bar came hurtling toward her head she simply reached out a hand and caught it it thwapped satisfyingly into the palm of her hand she walked over to varney is this yours she asked he bared his teeth at her yellow and black and brown right now said hunter were under market truce but if you try something like that again ill waive the truce and ill break off both your arms and make you carry them home in your teeth now she continued bending his wrist behind his back say sorry nicely ow said varney yes she said encouragingly he spat it out as if it were choking him im sorry she let him go varney backed away to a safe distance plainly scared and furious watching hunter when he reached the door to the food halls he hesitated and shouted youre dead youre fucking dead you are in a voice that hovered on the edge of tears and then he turned and he ran from the room amateurs sighed hunter they walked back through the store the way that richard had come the bell he had heard was now tolling deeply and continually when they came upon it he saw that it was a huge brass bell suspended on a wooden frame with a rope suspended from the clapper it was being tolled by a large black man wearing the black robes of a dominican monk and it had been set up next to harrods gourmet jelly bean stand impressive as the market had been to watch richard found the speed at which it was being dismantled broken down and put away even more impressive all evidence that it had ever been there was vanishing stalls were being taken apart loaded onto peoples backs hauled off into the streets richard noticed old bailey his arms filled with his crude signs and with bird cages stumbling out of the store the old man waved happily at richard and vanished off into the night the crowds thinned the market vanished and almost instantly the ground floor of harrods looked as usual as sedate elegant and clean as any time he had walked around it in jessicas wake on a saturday afternoon it was as if the market had never existed hunter said the marquis ive heard of you of course where have you been all this time hunting she said simply then to door can you take orders door nodded if i have to good then maybe i can keep you alive said hunter if i take the job the marquis stopped his eyes flickered over her distrustfully you said if you take the job hunter opened the door and they stepped out onto the pavement of london at night it had rained while they had been at the market and the streetlights now glimmered on the wet tarmac ive taken it said hunter richard stared at the glistening street it all seemed so normal so quiet so sane for a moment he felt that all he needed to get his life back would be to hail a taxi and tell it to take him home and then he would sleep the night through in his own bed but a taxi would not see him or stop for him and he had nowhere to go even if one did im tired he said no one said anything door would not meet his eyes the marquis was cheerfully ignoring him and hunter was treating him as an irrelevance he felt like a small child unwanted following the bigger children around and that made him irritated look he said clearing his throat i know you are all very busy people but what about me the marquis turned and stared at him eyes huge and white in his dark face you he said what about you well said richard how do i get back to normal again its like ive walked into a nightmare last week everything made sense and now nothing makes sense he trailed off swallowed i want to know how to get my life back he explained you wont get it back traveling with us richard said door its going to be hard enough for you anyway i i really am sorry hunter in the lead knelt down on the pavement she took a small metal rod from her belt and used it to unlock the cover to a sewer she pulled up the sewer cover looked into it warily climbed down then ushered door into the sewer door did not look at richard as she went down the marquis scratched the side of his nose young man he said understand this there are two londons theres london abovethats where you livedand then theres london belowthe undersideinhabited by the people who fell through the cracks in the world now youre one of them good night he began to climb down the sewer ladder richard said wait and caught the sewer cover before it could close he followed the marquis down it smelled like drains at the top of the sewera dead soapy cabbagey smell he expected it to get worse as he went down but instead the smell quickly dissipated as he approached the floor of the sewer gray water ran shallow but fast along the bottom of the brick tunnel richard stepped into it he could see the lights of the others up ahead and he ran and splashed down the tunnel until he caught up with them go away said the marquis no he said door glanced up at him i am really sorry richard she said the marquis stepped between richard and door you cant go back to your old home or your old job or your old life he said to richard almost gently none of those things exist up there you dont exist they had reached a junction a place where three tunnels came together door and hunter set off along one of them the one that was empty of water and they did not look back the marquis lingered youll just have to make the best of it down here he said to richard in the sewers and the magic and the dark and then he smiled hugely whitely a gleaming grin monumental in its insincerity welldelightful to see you again best of luck if you can survive for the next day or two he confided you might even make it through a whole month and with that he turned and strode off through the sewer after door and hunter richard leaned against a wall and listened to their footsteps echoing away and to the rush of the water running past on its way to the pumping stations of east london and the sewage works shit he said and then to his surprise for the first time since his father died alone in the dark richard mayhew began to cry the underground station was quite empty and quite dark varney walked through it keeping close to walls darting nervous looks behind him and in front of him and from side to side he had picked the station at random had headed for it over the rooftops and through the shadows making certain that he was not being followed he was not heading back to his lair in the camden town deep tunnels too risky there were other places where varney had cached weapons and food he would go to ground for a little while until this all blew over he stopped beside a ticket machine and listened in the darkness absolute silence reassured that he was alone he allowed himself to relax he stopped at the top of the spiral staircase and drew a deep breath an oily voice from beside him said conversationally varneys the finest bravo and guard in the underside everyone knows that mister varney told us so himself a voice from the other side of him responded dully its not nice to lie mister croup in the pitch darkness mr croup expanded on his theme it isnt mister vandemar i have to say i regard it as a personal betrayal and i was deeply wounded by it and disappointed when you dont have any redeeming features you dont take particularly kindly to disappointment do you mister vandemar not kindly at all mister croup varney threw himself forward and ran headlong in the dark down the spiral staircase a voice from the top of the stairs mr croups really it said we ought to look upon it as a mercy killing the sound of varneys feet clattered off the metal railings echoed throughout the stairwell he puffed and he panted his shoulders glancing off the walls tumbling blindly downwards in the dark he reached the bottom of the steps next to the sign warning travelers that there were steps up to the top and only healthy people should even think about attempting it everyone else suggested the sign should use the elevator the elevator something clanked and the elevator doors opened magnificently slowly flooding the passageway with light varney fumbled for his knife cursed when he realized the hunterbitch still had it he reached for the machete in his shoulder sheath it was gone he heard a polite cough behind him and he turned mr vandemar was sitting on the steps at the bottom of the spiral staircase he was picking his fingernails with varneys machete and then mr croup fell upon him all teeth and talons and little blades and varney never had a chance to scream bye said mr vandemar impassively and he continued paring his nails after that the blood began to flow wet red blood in enormous quantities for varney was a big man and he had been keeping it all inside when mr croup and mr vandemar were finished however one would have been hard put even to notice the slight stain on the floor at the bottom of the spiral staircase the next time the floors were washed it was gone forever hunter was in the lead door walked in the middle the marquis de carabas took up the rear none of them had said a word since leaving richard half an hour earlier door stopped suddenly we cant do this she said flatly we cant leave him back there of course we can said the marquis we did she shook her head she had felt guilty and stupid ever since she saw richard lying on his back beneath ruislip at the audition she was tired of it dont be foolish said the marquis he saved my life she told him he could have left me on the sidewalk he didnt it was her fault she knew that was true she had opened a door to someone who could help her and help her he had he had taken her somewhere warm and he had cared for her and he had brought her help the action of helping her had tumbled him from his world into hers it was foolish to even think about bringing him with them they could not afford to bring someone with them she was unsure that the three of them would be able to take care of themselves on the journey that confronted them she wondered briefly if it were simply the door that she had opened that had taken her to him which had allowed him to notice her or if there were somehow more to it than that the marquis raised an eyebrow he was detached removed a creature of pure irony my dear young lady he said we are not bringing a guest along on this expedition dont patronize me de carabas said door she was so tired and i think i can decide who comes with us you are working for me arent you or is it the other way around her sorrow and exhaustion had drained her of her patience she needed de carabasshe couldnt afford to drive him away but she had reached her limit de carabas stared at her coldly angry he is not coming with us he stated flatly anyway hes probably dead by now richard was not dead he was sitting in the dark on a ledge on the side of a storm drain wondering what to do wondering how much further out of his league he could possibly get his life so far he decided had prepared him perfectly for a job in securities for shopping at the supermarket for watching soccer on the television on the weekends for turning up the thermostat if he got cold it had magnificently failed to prepare him for a life as an unperson on the roofs and in the sewers of london for a life in the cold and the wet and the dark a light glimmered footsteps came toward him if he decided it was a bunch of murderers cannibals or monsters he would not even put up a fight let them end it all for him hed had enough he stared down into the dark to the place where his feet should be the footsteps came closer richard the voice was doors he jumped then he studiously ignored her if it werent for you he thought richard he didnt look up what he said look she said you really wouldnt be in this mess if it werent for me you can say that again he thought and i dont think youll be any safer with us but well she stopped a deep breath im sorry i really am are you coining he looked at her then a small creature with huge eyes staring at him urgently from a heartshaped pale face okay he said to himself i guess im not quite ready to just give up and die well i dont have anywhere else to be right now he said with a studied unconcern that bordered on hysteria why not her face changed she threw her arms around his chest and hugged him tightly and we will try to get you back home again she said promise once weve found what im looking for he wondered if she meant it suspected for the first time that what she was offering might be impossible but he pushed that thought out of his head they began to walk down the tunnel richard could see hunter and the marquis waiting for them at the tunnels mouth the marquis looked as if he had been forced to swallow a pulped lemon what are you looking for anyway asked richard cheering up a little door took a deep breath and answered after a long pause its a long story she said solemnly right now were looking for an angel named islington it was then that richard began to laugh he couldnt help himself there was hysteria in there certainly but there was also the exhaustion of someone who had managed somehow to believe several dozen impossible things in the last twentyfour hours without ever getting a proper breakfast his laughter echoed down the tunnels an angel he said giggling helplessly called islington weve got a long way to go said door and richard shook his head and felt wrung out and emptied and flayed an angel he whispered hysterically to the tunnels and the dark an angel there were candles all over the great hall candles stood by the iron pillars that held the roof up candles waited by the waterfall that ran down one wall and into the small rockpool below candles clustered on the sides of the rock wall candles huddled on the floor candles were set into candlesticks by the huge door that stood between two dark iron pillars the door was built of polished black flint set into a silver base that had tarnished over the centuries almost to black the candles were unlit but as the tall form walked past they flickered into flame no hand touched them no fires touched their wicks the figures robe was simple and white or more than white a color or an absence of all colors so bright as to be startling its feet were bare on the cold rock floor of the great hall its face was pale and wise and gentle and perhaps a little lonely it was very beautiful soon every candle in the hall was burning it paused by the rockpool knelt beside the water cupped its hands lowered them into the clear water raised them and drank the water was cold but very pure when it had finished drinking the water it closed its eyes for a moment as if in benediction then it stood up and walked away back through the hall the way it had come and the candles went out as it passed as they had done for tens of thousands of years it had no wings but still it was unmistakably an angel islington left the great hall and the last of the candles went out and the darkness returned six richard wrote a diary entry in his head dear diary he began on friday i had a job a fiancee a home and a life that made sense then i found an injured girl bleeding on the pavement and i tried to be a good samaritan now ive got no fiancee no home no job and im walking around a couple of hundred feet under the streets of london with the projected life expectancy of a suicidal fruit fly this way said the marquis gesturing elegantly his filthy lace cuff flowing dont all these tunnels look the same asked richard tabling his diary entry for the moment how can you tell which is which you cant said the marquis sadly were hopelessly lost well never be seen again in a couple of days well be killing each other for food really he hated himself for rising to the bait even as he said it no the marquiss expression said that torturing this poor fool was too easy to even be amusing richard found that he cared less and less what these people thought of him however except perhaps for door he went back to writing his mental diary there are hundreds of people in this other london thousands maybe people who come from here or people who have fallen through the cracks im wandering around with a girl called door her bodyguard and her psychotic grand vizier we slept last night in a small tunnel that door said was once a section of regency sewer the bodyguard was awake when i went to sleep and awake when they woke me up i dont think she ever sleeps we had some fruitcake for breakfast the marquis had a large lump of it in his pocket why would anyone have a large lump of fruitcake in his pocket my shoes dried out mostly while i slept i want to go home then he mentally underlined the last sentence three times rewrote it in huge letters in red ink and circled it before putting a number of exclamation marks next to it in his mental margin at least the tunnel they were now walking down was dry it was a hightech tunnel all silvery pipes and white walls the marquis and door walked together in front richard tended to stay a couple of paces behind them hunter moved about sometimes she was behind them sometimes to one side of them or to the other often a little way in front merging with the shadows she made no sound when she moved which richard found rather disconcerting there was a crack of light ahead of them there we go said the marquis bank station good place to start looking youre out of your mind said richard he did not mean it to be heard but the most sotto of voces carried and echoed in the darkness indeed said the marquis the ground began to rumble an underground train was somewhere close at hand richard just leave it said door but it was coming out of his mouth well he said youre both being silly there are no such things as angels the marquis nodded said ah yes i understand you now there are no such things as angels just as there is no london below no ratspeakers no shepherds in shepherds bush there are no shepherds in shepherds bush ive been there its just houses and stores and roads and the bbc thats all pointed out richard flatly there are shepherds said hunter from the darkness just next to richards ear pray you never meet them she sounded perfectly serious well said richard i still dont believe that there are flocks of angels wandering about down here there arent said the marquis just one they had reached the end of the tunnel there was a locked door in front of them the marquis stood back my lady he said to door she rested a hand on it for a moment the door opened silently maybe richard said persisting were thinking of different things the angels i have in mind are all wings haloes trumpets peaceonearthgoodwilluntomen thats right said door you got it angels they went through the door richard shut his eyes involuntarily at the sudden flood of light it stabbed into his head like a migraine as his eyes became used to the light richard found to his surprise that he knew where he was they were in the long pedestrian tunnel that links monument and bank tube stations there were commuters wandering through the tunnels none of whom gave the four of them even a first look the perky wail of a saxophone echoed along the tunnel burt bacharach and hal davids ill never fall in love again being played more or less competently they walked toward bank station who are we looking for again then he asked more or less innocently the angel gabriel raphael michael they were passing a tube map the marquis tapped angel station with one long dark finger islington richard had passed through angel station hundreds of times it was in trendy islington a district filled with antique shops and places to eat he knew very little about angels but he was almost certain that islingtons tube stop was named after a pub or a landmark he changed the subject you know when i tried to get on a tube train a couple of days ago it wouldnt let me you just have to let them know whos boss thats all said hunter softly from behind him door chewed her lower lip this train were looking for will let us on she said if we can find it her words were almost drowned out by music coming from somewhere nearby they went down a handful of steps and turned a corner the saxophone player had his coat in front of him on the floor of the tunnel on the coat were a few coins which looked as if the man had placed them there himself to persuade passersby that everyone was doing it nobody was fooled the saxophone player was extremely tall he had shoulderlength dark hair and a long forked dark beard which framed deepset eyes and a serious nose he wore a ragged tshirt and oilstained blue jeans as the travelers reached him he stopped playing shook the spit from the saxophone mouthpiece replaced it and sounded the first notes the old julie london song cry me a river now you say youre sorry richard realized with surprise that the man could see themand also that he was doing his best to pretend that he couldnt the marquis stopped in front of him the wail of the saxophone trailed off in a nervous squeak the marquis flashed a cold grin its lear isnt it he asked the man nodded warily his fingers stroked the keys of his saxophone were looking for earls court continued the marquis would you happen to have such a thing as a train schedule about your person richard was beginning to catch on he assumed that the earls court he referred to wasnt the familiar tube station he had waited in innumerable times reading a paper or just daydreaming the man named lear moistened his lips with the tip of his tongue s not impossible whatd be in it for me if i did the marquis thrust his hands deep into the pockets of his coat then he smiled like a cat who had just been entrusted with the keys to a home for wayward but plump canaries they say he said idly as if he were simply passing the time that merlins master blaise once wrote a reel so beguiling that it would charm the coins from the pockets of anyone who heard it lears eyes narrowed thatd be worth more than just a train schedule he said if you actually had it the marquis did a perfectly good impression of someone realizing my it would wouldnt it well then he said magnanimously i suppose you would have to owe me wouldnt you lear nodded reluctantly he fumbled in his back pocket pulled out a muchfolded scrap of paper and held it up the marquis reached for it lear moved his hand away let me hear the reel first you old trickster he said and it had better work the marquis raised an eyebrow he darted a hand into one of the inside pockets of his coat when he pulled it out again it was holding a pennywhistle and a small crystal ball he looked at the crystal ball made the kind of hmmm noise that means ah so thats where that went and he put it away again then he flexed his fingers put the pennywhistle to his lips and began to play an odd rollicking tune that leapt and twisted and sang it made richard feel as if he were thirteen years old again listening to the top twenty on his best friends transistor radio at school during lunch hour back when pop music had mattered as it only can in your early teenage years the marquiss reel was everything he had ever wanted to hear in a song a handful of coins chinked onto lears coat thrown by passersby who walked on with a smile on their faces and a spring in their step the marquis lowered his pennywhistle i owe you then you old rascal said lear nodding yes you do the marquis took the paperthe train schedulefrom lear and scanned it and nodded but a word to the wise dont overuse it a little goes a very long way and the four of them walked away down the long corridor surrounded by posters advertising films and underwear and the occasional officiallooking notices warning musicians playing for coins to move away from the station listening to the sob of the saxophone and to the sound of money landing on a coat the marquis led them to a central line platform richard walked over to the edge of the platform and looked down he wondered as he always did which one the live rail was and decided as he always did that it was the one farthest from the platform with the large whitish porcelain insulators between it and the ground and then he found himself smiling involuntarily at a tiny dark gray mouse who was bravely prowling the tracks three feet below him in a mousy quest for abandoned sandwiches and dropped potato chips a voice came over the loudspeaker that formal disembodied male voice that warned mind the gap it was intended to keep unwary passengers from stepping into the space between the train and the platform richard like most londoners barely heard it anymoreit was like aural wallpaper but suddenly hunters hand was on his arm mind the gap she said urgently to richard stand back over there by the wall what said richard i said said hunter mind the and then it erupted over the side of the platform it was diaphanous dreamlike a ghostthing the color of black smoke and it welled up like silk under water and moving astonishingly fast while still seeming to drift almost in slow motion it wrapped itself tightly around richards ankle it stung even through the fabric of his levis the thing pulled him toward the edge of the platform and he staggered he realized as if from a distance that hunter had pulled out her staff and was smacking the tentacle of smoke with it hard repeatedly there was a faraway screaming noise thin and mindless like an idiot child deprived of its toy the smoketentacle let go of richards ankle and slid back over the edge of the platform and it was gone hunter took richard by the scruff of the neck and pulled him toward the back wall where richard slumped against it he was trembling and the world seemed suddenly utterly unreal the color had been sucked from his jeans wherever the thing had touched him making them look as if theyd been ineptly bleached he pulled up the trouser leg tiny purple welts were coming up on the skin of his ankle and calf what he tried to say but nothing came out he swallowed and tried again what was that hunter looked down at him impassively her face could have been carved from brown wood i dont think it has a name she said they live in the gaps i did warn you ive never seen one before you werent part of the underside before said hunter just wait by the wall its safer the marquis was checking the time on a large gold pocketwatch he returned it to his waistcoat pocket consulted the paper lear had given him and nodded satisfied were in luck he pronounced the earls court train should be coming through here in about half an hour earls court station isnt on the central line pointed out richard the marquis stared at richard openly amused what a refreshing mind you have young man he said there really is nothing quite like total ignorance is there the warm wind began to blow an underground train pulled up at the station people got off and other people got on going about the business of their lives and richard watched them with envy mind the gap intoned the recorded voice stand clear of the doors mind the gap door took one look at richard then apparently worried about what she was seeing she walked over to him and she took his hand he was very pale and his breath was coming shallow and fast mind the gap boomed the recorded voice again im fine lied richard bravely to no one in particular the central courtyard of mr croup and mr vandemars hospital was a dank and cheerless place ragged grass grew up through the abandoned desks rubber tires and bits of office furniture the overall impression given by the area was that a decade before a number of people had thrown the contents of their offices out of their windows high above and had left them there on the ground to rot there was broken glass there as well broken glass in abundance there were also several mattresses some of which looked like they had at some point been set on fire grass grew up through the springs an entire ecology had evolved around the ornamental fountain in the center of the well which had for a long time been neither particularly ornamental nor a fountain a cracked and leaking water pipe nearby had with the aid of some rainwater transformed it into a breeding ground for a number of little frogs who plopped about cheerfully rejoicing in their freedom from any nonairborne natural predators crows and blackbirds and even occasional seagulls however regarded the place as a catfree delicatessen specializing in frogs slugs sprawled indolently under the springs of the burnt mattresses snails left slime trails across the broken glass large black beetles scuttled industriously over smashed gray plastic telephones and mysteriously mutilated barbie dolls mr croup and mr vandemar had come up for a change of air they were walking slowly around the perimeter of the central yard broken glass crunching beneath their feet they looked like shadows in their frayed black suits mr croup was in a cold fury he was walking twice as fast as mr vandemar circling him and almost dancing in his anger at times as if unable to contain the rage inside mr croup would fling himself at the hospital wall physically attack it with his fists and feet as if it were a poor substitute for a real person mr vandemar on the other hand simply walked it was too consistent too steady and inexorable a walk to be described as a stroll death walked like mr vandemar mr vandemar watched mr croup impassively as mr croup kicked a sheet of glass that had been leaning against a wall it shattered with a satisfying crash i mister vandemar said mr croup surveying the wreckage i for one have had almost as much as im willing to take almost pussyfooting trifling lollygagging shillyshallying wheyfaced toadi could pop out his eyes with my thumbs mr vandemar shook his head not yet he said hes our boss for this job after weve been paid maybe we could have some fun on our own time mr croup spat on the ground hes a worthless conniving dunderhead we should butcher the bitch annul cancel inhume and amortize her a telephone began to ring loudly mr croup and mr vandemar looked around puzzled eventually mr vandemar found the telephone halfway down a pile of rubble on top of a scree of waterstained medical records broken wires trailed from the back of it he picked it up and passed it to mr croup for you he said mr vandemar did not like telephones mister croup here said croup then obsequiously oh its you sir a pause at present as you requested she is walking around free as a daisy im afraid your bodyguard idea went down like a dead baboon varney yes hes quite dead another pause sir i am commencing to have certain conceptual problems with the role of myself and my partner in these shenanigans there was a third pause and mr croup went paler than pale unprofessional he asked mildly us he curled his hand into a fist which he slammed hard into the side of a brick wall there was no change however in his tone of voice as he said sir might i with due respect remind you that mister vandemar and myself burned down the city of troy we brought the black plague to flanders we have assassinated a dozen kings five popes half a hundred heroes and two accredited gods our last commission before this was the torturing to death of an entire monastery in sixteenthcentury tuscany we are utterly professional mr vandemar who had been amusing himself by catching little frogs and seeing how many he could stuff into his mouth at a time said with his mouth full i liked doing that my point asked mr croup and he flicked some imaginary dust from his threadbare black suit ignoring the real dust as he did so my point is that we are assassins we are cutthroats we kill he listened to something then said well what about the upworlder why cant we kill him mr croup twitched spat once more and kicked the wall as he stood there holding the ruststained halfbroken telephone scare her were cutthroats not scarecrows a pause he took a deep breath yes i understand but i dont like it the person at the other end of the phone had hung up mr croup looked down at the telephone then he hefted it in one hand and proceeded methodically to smash it into shards of plastic and metal by banging it against the wall mr vandemar walked over he had found a large black slug with a bright orange underbelly and he was chewing it like a fat cigar the slug was trying to crawl away down mr vandemars chin who was that asked mr vandemar who the hell do you think it was mr vandemar chewed thoughtfully then sucked the slug into his mouth a scarecrow man he ventured our employer that was going to be my next guess scarecrows spat mr croup disgusted he was moving from a red rage to an oily gray sulk mr vandemar swallowed the contents of his mouth and wiped his lips on his sleeve best way to scare crows said mr vandemar you just creep up behind them and put your hand round their little crow necks and squeeze until they dont move anymore that scares the stuffing out of them and then he was silent and from far above they heard the sound of crows flying cawing angrily crows family corvidae collective noun intoned mr croup relishing the sound of the word a murder richard waited against the wall next to door she said very little she chewed her fingernails ran her hands through her reddish hair until it was sticking up in all directions then tried to push it back down again she was certainly unlike anyone he had ever known when she noticed him looking at her she shrugged and shimmied down further into her layers of clothes deeper into her leather jacket her face looked out at the world from inside the jacket the expression on her face made richard think of a beautiful homeless child he had seen the previous winter behind covent garden he had not been certain whether it was a girl or a boy its mother was begging pleading with the passersby for coins to feed the child and the infant that she carried in her arms but the child stared out at the world and said nothing although it must have been cold and hungry it just stared hunter stood by door looking back and forth down the platform the marquis had told them where to wait and then he had slipped away from somewhere richard heard a baby begin to cry the marquis slipped out of an exitonly door and walked toward them he was chewing on a piece of candy having fun asked richard a train was coming toward them its approach heralded by a gust of warm wind just taking care of business said the marquis he consulted the piece of paper and his watch he pointed to a place on the platform this should be the earls court train stand behind me here you three then as the underground traina rather boringlooking normal train richard was disappointed to observerumbled and rattled its way into the station the marquis leaned across richard and said to door my lady there is something that perhaps i should have mentioned earlier she turned her oddcolored eyes on him yes well he said the earl might not be entirely pleased to see me the train slowed down and stopped the car that had pulled up in front of richard was quite empty its lights were turned off it was bleak and empty and dark from time to time richard had noticed cars like this one locked and shadowy on tube trains and he had wondered what purpose they served the other doors on the train hissed open and passengers got on and got off the doors of the darkened car remained closed the marquis drummed on the door with his fist an intricate rhythmic rap nothing happened richard was just wondering if the train would now pull out without them on it when the door of the dark car was pushed open from the inside it opened about six inches and an elderly bespectacled face peered out at them who knocks he said through the opening richard could see flames burning and people and smoke inside the car through the glass in the doors however he still saw a dark and empty carriage the lady door announced the marquis smoothly and her companions the door slid open all the way and they were inside earls court seven there was straw scattered on the floor over a layer of rushes there was an open log fire sputtering and blazing in a large fireplace there were a few chickens strutting and pecking on the floor there were seats with handembroidered cushions on them and there were tapestries covering the windows and the doors richard stumbled forward as the train lurched out of the station he reached out grabbed hold of the nearest person and regained his balance the nearest person happened to be a short gray elderly manatarms who would have looked richard decided exactly like a recently retired minor official were it not for the tin hat the surcoat the rather clumsily knitted chain mail and the spear instead he looked like a recently retired minor official who had somewhat against his will been dragooned into his local amateur dramatic society where he had been forced to play a manatarms the little gray man blinked shortsightedly at richard as richard grabbed him and then he said lugubriously sorry about that my fault said richard i know said the man an enormous irish wolfhound padded down the aisle and stopped beside a lute player who sat on the floor picking at a melody in a desultory fashion the wolfhound glared at richard snorted with disdain then lay down and went to sleep at the far end of the carriage an elderly falconer with a hooded falcon on his wrist was exchanging pleasantries with a small knot of damsels of a certain age some passengers obviously stared at the four travelers others just as obviously ignored them it was richard realized as if someone had taken a small medieval court and put it as best they could in one car of an underground train a herald raised his bugle to his lips and played a tuneless blast as an immense elderly man in a huge furlined dressing gown and carpet slippers staggered through the connecting door from the next compartment his arm resting on the shoulder of a jester in shabby motley the old man was larger than life in every way he wore an eyepatch over his left eye which had the effect of making him look slightly helpless and unbalanced like a oneeyed hawk there were fragments of food in his redgray beard and what appeared to be pajama pants were visible at the bottom of his shabby fur gown that thought richard correctly must be the earl the earls jester was an elderly man with a pinched humorless mouth and a painted face he led the earl to a thronelike carved wooden seat in which a trifle unsteadily the earl sat down the wolfhound got up padded down the length of the carriage and settled itself at the earls slippered feet earls court thought richard of course and then he began to wonder whether there was a baron in barons court tube station or a raven in ravenscourt or the little old manatarms coughed asthmatically and said right then you lot state your business door stepped forward she held her head up high suddenly seeming taller and more at ease than richard had previously seen her and she said we seek an audience with his grace the earl the earl called down the carriage what did the little girl say halvard he asked richard wondered if he was deaf halvard the elderly manatarms shuffled around and cupped his hand to his mouth they seek an audience your grace he shouted over the rattle of the train the earl pushed aside his thick fur cap and scratched his head meditatively he was balding underneath his cap they do an audience how splendid who are they halvard halvard turned back to them he wants to know who you all are keep it short though dont go on i am the lady door announced door the lord portico was my father the earl brightened at this leaned forward peered through the smoke with his one good eye did she say she was porticos oldest girl he asked the jester yus your grace the earl beckoned to door come here he said comecomecome let me look at you she walked down the swaying carriage grabbing the thick rope straps that hung from the ceiling as she went to keep her balance when she stood before the earls wooden chair she curtseyed he scratched at his beard and stared at her we were all quite devastated to hear of your fathers unfortunate said the earl and then he interrupted himself and said well all your family it was a and he trailed off and said you know i had warmest regards for him did a bit of business together good old portico full of ideas he stopped then he tapped the jester on the shoulder and whispered in a querulous boom loud enough that it could be heard easily over the noise of the train go and make jokes at them tooley earn your keep the earls fool staggered up the aisle with an arthritic step he stopped in front of richard and who might you be he asked me said richard um me my name its richard richard mayhew me squeaked the fool in an elderly rather theatrical imitation of richards scottish accent me um me la nuncle tis not a man but a mooncalf the courtiers sniggered dustily and i de carabas told the jester with a blinding smile call myself the marquis de carabas the fool blinked de carabas the thief asked the jester de carabas the bodysnatcher de carabas the traitor he turned to the courtiers around them but this cannot be de carabas for why because de carabas has long since been banished from the earls presence perhaps it is instead a strange new species of stoat who grew particularly large the courtiers tittered uneasily and a low buzz of troubled conversation began the earl said nothing but his lips were pressed together tightly and he had begun to tremble i am called hunter said hunter to the jester the courtiers were silent then the jester opened his mouth as if he were going to say something and then he looked at her and he closed his mouth again a hint of a smile played at the corner of hunters perfect lips go on she said say something funny the jester stared at the trailing toes of his shoes then he muttered my hound hath no nose the earl who had been staring at the marquis de carabas with eyes like a slowburning fuse now exploded to his feet a graybearded volcano an elderly berserker his head brushed the roof of the carriage he pointed at the marquis and shouted spittle flying i will not stand for it i will not make him come forward halvard waggled a gloomy spear at the marquis who sauntered to the front of the train until he stood beside door in front of the earls throne the wolfhound growled in the back of its throat you said the earl stabbing the air with a huge knotted finger i know you de carabas i havent forgotten i may be old but i havent forgotten the marquis bowed might i remind your grace he said urbanely that we had a deal i negotiated the peace treaty between your people and the ravens court and in return you agreed to provide a little favor so there is a ravens court thought richard he wondered what it was like a little favor said the earl he turned a deep beet red color is that what you call it i lost a dozen men to your foolishness in the retreat from white city i lost an eye and if you dont mind my saying so your grace said the marquis graciously that is a very fetching patch it sets off your face perfectly i swore fulminated the earl beard bristling i swore that if you ever set foot in my domain i would he trailed off shook his head confused and forgetful then he continued itll come back to me i do not forget he might not be entirely pleased to see you whispered door to de carabas well hes not he muttered back door stepped forward once more your grace she said loudly clearly de carabas is here with me as my guest and my companion for the fellowship there has ever been between your family and mine for the friendship between my father and he abused my hospitality boomed the earl i swore that if he ever again entered my domain i would have him gutted and dried like like something that had been gutted first like perchancethen dried a kipper my lord suggested the jester the earl shrugged it is of no matter guards seize him and they did while neither of the guards would ever see sixty again each of them was holding a crossbow pointed at the marquis and their hands did not tremble neither with age nor with fear richard looked at hunter she seemed untroubled by this she was watching it almost with amusement like someone attending the theater door folded her arms and stood taller putting her head back raising her pointed chin she looked less like a ragged street pixie more like someone used to getting her own way the opal eyes flashed your grace the marquis is with me as my companion on my quest our families have been friends for a long time now yes they have interrupted the earl helpfully hundreds of years hundreds and hundreds knew your grandfather too funny old fellow bit vague he confided but i am forced to say that i will regard an act of violence against my companion as an act of aggression against myself and my house the girl stared up at the old man he towered over her they stood for some moments frozen he tugged on his redandgray beard agitatedly then he thrust out his lower lip like a small child i will not have him here he said the marquis took out the golden pocketwatch that he had found in porticos study he examined it carelessly then he turned to door and said as if none of the events around them had occurred my lady i will obviously be of more use to you off this train than on and i have other avenues to explore no she said if you go we all go i dont think so said the marquis hunter will look after you as long as you stay in london below ill meet you at the next market dont do anything too stupid in the meantime the train was coming into a station door fixed the earl with her look there was something more ancient and powerful in that glance than her young years would have seemed to allow richard noticed that the room fell quiet whenever she spoke will you let him go in peace your grace she asked the earl ran his hands over his face rubbed his good eye and his eyepatch then looked back at her just make him go said the earl he looked at the marquis next time he ran a thick old finger across his adams apple kipper the marquis bowed low ill see myself out he said to the guards and stepped toward the open door halvard raised his crossbow and pointed it toward the marquiss back hunter reached out her hand and pushed the end of the crossbow back down toward the floor the marquis stepped onto the platform turned and waved with an elaborate flourish the door hissed closed behind him the earl sat down on his huge chair at the end of the car he said nothing the train rattled and lurched through the dark tunnel where are my manners muttered the earl to himself he looked at them with one staring eye then he said it again in a desperate boom that richard could feel in his stomach like a bass drumbeat where are my manners he motioned one of the elderly menatarms to him they will be hungry after their journey dagvard thirsty too i shouldnt wonder yes your grace stop the train called the earl the doors hissed open and dagvard scuttled off onto a platform richard watched the people on the platform no one came into their car no one seemed to notice that anything was at all unusual dagvard walked over to a vending machine on the side of the platform he took off his metal helmet then he rapped with one mailed glove on the side of the machine orders from the earl he said choclits a ratcheting whirr came from deep in the guts of the machine and it began to spit out dozens of cadburys fruit and nut chocolate bars one after another dagvard held his helmet below the opening to catch them the doors began to close halvard put the handle of his pike between the doors and they opened again and began bumping open and shut on the pike handle please stand clear of the doors said a loudspeaker voice the train cannot leave until the doors are all closed the earl was staring at door lopsidedly with his one good eye so what brings you here to me he asked she licked her lips well indirectly your grace my fathers death he nodded slowly yes you seek vengeance quite right too he coughed then recited in a basso profundo brave the battling blade flashes the furious fire steel sword sheathed in hated heart crimsons the the something yes vengeance door thought for a moment yes that was what my father said but i mostly just want to understand what happened and to protect myself my family had no enemies dagvard staggered back onto the train then his helmet filled with chocolate bars and cans of coke the doors were permitted to close and the train moved off once more lears coat still on the floor of the tunnel was covered in coins and bills now but it was also covered with shoeskicking the coins smearing and tearing the bills ripping the fabric of the coat lear had begun to cry please why wont you leave me alone he begged he was backed against the wall of the passage blood ran down his face and dripped crimson into his beard his saxophone hung limply awkwardly on his chest dented and scraped he was surrounded by a small crowd of peoplemore than twenty less than fiftyevery one of them shoving and pushing in a mindless mob their eyes blank and staring each man and woman desperately fighting and clawing in order to give lear their money there was blood on the tiled wall where lear had knocked his head lear flailed out at one middleaged woman her purse wide open a fistful of fivepound notes thrust out at him she clawed at his face in her eagerness to give him her money he twisted to avoid her fingernails and fell to the tunnel floor someone stepped on his hand his face was pushed into a slurry of coins he began to sob and to curse i told you not to overuse that tune said an elegant voice nearby naughty help me gasped lear well there is a countercharm admitted the voice almost reluctantly the crowd was pressing closer now a flung fiftypence coin opened lears cheek he curled into a fetal ball hugging himself burying his face in his knees play it damn you sobbed lear whatever you want just make them stop a pennywhistle piping began softly and echoed down the passage a simple phrase repeated over and over slightly different every time the de carabas variations the footsteps were moving away shuffling at first then picking up pace moving away from him lear opened his eyes the marquis de carabas was leaning against the wall playing the pennywhistle when he saw lear looking at him he took the whistle from his lips and replaced it in an inside pocket of his coat he tossed lear a laceedged handkerchief of patched linen lear wiped the blood from his forehead and face they would have killed me he said accusingly i did warn you said de carabas just count yourself lucky that i was coming back this way he helped lear into a sitting position now he said i think you owe me another favor lear picked up his coattorn and muddy and imprinted with the marks of many feetfrom the passage floor he suddenly felt very cold and he wrapped the shredded coat around his shoulders coins fell and bills fluttered to the floor he let them lie was i really lucky or did you set me up the marquis looked almost offended i dont know how you could even bring yourself to think such a thing cos i know you thats how so what is it that you want me to do this time theft arson lear sounded resigned and a little sad and then murder de carabas reached down and took back his handkerchief theft im afraid you were right the first time he said with a smile i find myself in rather urgent need of a piece of tang dynasty sculpture lear shivered then slowly he nodded richard was handed a bar of cadburys fruit and nut chocolate and a large silver goblet ornamented around the rim with what appeared to richard to be sapphires the goblet was filled with cocacola the jester whose name seemed to be tooley cleared his throat loudly i would like to propose a toast to our guests he said a child a bravo a fool may they each get what they deserve which one am i whispered richard to hunter the fool of course she said in the old days said halvard dismally after sipping his coke we had wine i prefer wine its not as sticky do all the machines just give you things like that asked richard oh yes said the old man they listen to the earl ysee he rules the underground the bit with the trains hes lord of the central the circle the jubilee the victorious the bakerloowell all of them except the underside line whats the underside line asked richard halvard shook his head and pursed his lips hunter brushed richards shoulder with her fingers remember what i told you about the shepherds of shepherds bush you said i didnt want to meet them and there were some things i was probably better off not knowing good she said so now you can add the underside line to the list of those things door came back down the carriage toward them she was smiling the earls agreed to help us she said come on hes meeting us in the library richard began to follow as he realized that the question what library had not risen to his lips the longer he was here the more he took at face value instead he followed door toward the earls empty throne and round the back of it and through the connecting door behind it and into the library it was a huge stone room with a high wooden ceiling each wall was covered with shelves each shelf was laden with objects there were books yes but the shelves were filled with a host of other things tennis rackets hockey sticks umbrellas a spade a notebook computer a wooden leg several mugs dozens of shoes pairs of binoculars a small log six glove puppets a lava lamp various cds records cassette tapes and eighttracks dice toy cars assorted pairs of dentures watches flashlights four garden gnomes of assorted sizes piles of newspapers magazines grimoires threelegged stools a box of cigars a plastic noddinghead alsatian socks the room was a tiny empire of lost property this is his real domain muttered hunter things lost things forgotten there were windows set in the stone wall through them richard could see the rattling darkness and the passing lights of the underground tunnels the earl was sitting on the floor with his legs splayed patting the wolfhound and scratching it underneath the chin the jester stood beside him looking embarrassed the earl clambered to his feet when he saw them his forehead creased ah there you are now there was a reason i asked you here itll come to me he tugged at his redgray beard a tiny gesture from such a huge man the angel islington your grace said door politely oh yes your father had a lot of ideas for changes you know asked me about them i dont trust change i sent him to islington he stopped blinked his one eye did i tell you this already yes your grace and how can we get to islington the earl nodded as if door had said something profound only once by the quick way after that you have to go the long way down dangerous door said patiently and the quick way is no no need to be an opener to use it only good for porticos family he rested a huge hand on her shoulder then his hand slid up to her cheek better off staying here with me keep an old man warm at night eh he leered at her and touched her tangle of hair with his old fingers hunter took a step toward door door gestured with her hand no not yet door looked up at the earl and said your grace i am porticos oldest daughter how do i get to the angel islington richard found himself amazed that door was able to keep her temper in the face of the earls losing battle with temporal drift the earl winked his single eye in a solemn blink an old hawk his head tipped on one side then he took his hand from her hair so you are so you are porticos daughter how is your dear father keeping well i hope fine man good man how do we get to the angel islington said door but now there was a tremble in her voice hmm use the angelus of course richard found himself imagining the earl sixty eighty five hundred years ago a mighty warrior a cunning strategist a great lover of women a fine friend a terrifying foe there was still the wreckage of that man in there somewhere that was what made him so terrible and so sad the earl fumbled on the shelves moving pens and pipes and peashooters little gargoyles and dead leaves then like an aged cat stumbling on a mouse he seized a small rolledup scroll and handed it to the girl here ygo lassie said the earl all in here and i suppose wed better drop you off where you need to go youll drop us off asked richard in a train the earl looked around for the source of the sound focused on richard and smiled enormously oh think nothing of it he boomed anything for porticos daughter door clutched the scroll tightly triumphantly richard could feel the train beginning to slow and he and door and hunter were led out of the stone room and back into the car richard peered out at the platform as they slowed down excuse me what station is this he asked the train had stopped facing one of the station signs british museum it said somehow this was one oddity too many he could accept mind the gap and the earls court and even the strange library but damn it like all londoners he knew his tube map and this was going too far there isnt a british museum station said richard firmly there isnt boomed the earl then mm then you must be very careful as you get off the train and he guffawed delightedly and tapped his jester on the shoulder hear that tooley i am as funny as you are the jester smiled as bleak a smile as ever was seen my sides are splitting my ribs are cracking and my mirth is positively uncontainable your grace he said the doors hissed open door smiled up at the earl thank you she said off off said the vast old man shooing door and richard and hunter out of the warm smoky carriage onto the empty platform and then the doors closed and the train moved away and richard found himself staring at a sign which no matter how many times he blinkednor even if he looked away from it and looked back suddenly to take it by surprisestill obstinately persisted in saying british museum eight it was early evening and the cloudless sky was transmuting from royal blue to a deep violet with a smudge of fire orange and lime green over paddington four miles to the west where from old baileys perspective anyway the sun had recently set skies thought old bailey in a satisfied sort of a way never a two of them alike not by day nor not by night neither he was a bit of a connoisseur of skies was old bailey and this was a good un the old man had pitched his tent for the night on a roof opposite st pauls cathedral in the center of the city of london he was fond of st pauls and it at least had changed little in the last three hundred years it had been built in white portland stone which had before it was even completed begun to turn black from the soot and the filth in the smoky london air and now following the cleaning of london in the s was more or less white again but it was still st pauls he was not sure that the same could be said for the rest of the city of london he peered over the roof stared away from his beloved sky down to the sodiumlit pavement below he could see security cameras affixed to a wall and a few cars and one late office worker locking a door and then walking toward the tube brrr even the thought of going underground made old bailey shudder he was a roofman and proud of it had fled the world at ground level so long ago old bailey remembered when people had actually lived here in the city not just worked when they had lived and lusted and laughed built ramshackle houses one leaning against the next each house filled with noisy people why the noise and the mess and the stinks and the songs from the alley across the way had been legendary in their time but no one lived in the city now it was a cold and cheerless place of offices of people who worked in the day and went home to somewhere else at night it was not a place for living anymore he even missed the stinks the last smudge of orange sun faded into nocturnal purple the old man covered the cages so the birds could get their beauty sleep they grumbled then slept old bailey scratched his nose after which he went into his tent and fetched a blackened stewpot some water some carrots and potatoes salt and a wellhanged pair of dead plucked starlings he walked out onto the roof lit a small fire in a sootblackened coffee can and was putting his stew on to cook when he became aware that someone was watching him from the shadows by a chimney stack he picked up his toasting fork and waved it threateningly at the chimney stack whos there the marquis de carabas stepped out of the shadows bowed perfunctorily and smiled gloriously old bailey lowered his toasting fork oh he said its you well what do you want knowledge or birds the marquis walked over picked a slice of raw carrot from old baileys stew and munched it information actually he said old bailey chortled hah he said theres a first ehh then he leaned toward the marquis whatll you trade for it what do you need maybe i should do what you do i should ask for another favor an investment for one day down the road old bailey grinned much too expensive in the long run said the marquis without humor old bailey nodded now the sun had gone down it was getting very cold very fast shoes then he said and a balaclava hat he inspected his fingerless gloves they were more hole than glove and new gloveses its going to be a bastard winter very well ill bring them to you the marquis de carabas put his hand into an inside pocket and produced like a magician producing a rose from thin air the black animal figure he had taken from porticos study now what can you tell me about this old bailey pulled on his glasses he took the object from de carabas it was cold to the touch he sat down on an airconditioning unit then turning the black obsidian statue over and over in his hand he announced its the great beast of london the marquis said nothing his eyes flickered from the statue to old bailey impatiently old bailey enjoying the marquiss minor discomfort continued at his own pace now they say that back in first king charlies dayhim as got his head all chopped off silly buggerbefore the fire and the plague this was there was a butcher lived down by the fleet ditch had some poor creature he was going to fatten up for christmas some says it was a piglet and some says it wusnt and theres someand i list meself as one of themthat wusnt never properly certain one night in december the beast runned away ran into the fleet ditch and vanished into the sewers and it fed on the sewage and it grew and it grew and it got meaner and nastier theyd send in hunting parties after it from time to time the marquis pursed his lips it must have died three hundred years ago old bailey shook his head things like that theyre too vicious to die too old and big and nasty the marquis sighed i thought it was just a legend he said like the alligators in the sewers of new york city old bailey nodded sagely what the big white buggers theyre down there i had a friend lost a head to one of them a moment of silence old bailey handed the statue back to the marquis then he raised his hand and snapped it like a crocodile head at de carabas it was okay gurned old bailey with a grin that was most terrible to behold he had another the marquis sniffed uncertain whether or not old bailey was pulling his leg he made the statue of the beast vanish inside his coat once more hang on said old bailey he went back inside his brown tent and returned holding the ornate silver box the marquis had given him on their previous meeting he held it out to the marquis how about this then he asked are you ready to take it back it fair gives me the creepy shivers having it around the marquis walked to the edge of the roof dropped the eight feet to the next building ill take it back when all this is over he called let us hope that you dont have to use it old bailey leaned over how will i know if i do youll know called the marquis and the rats will tell you what to do with it and with that he was over the side of the building slipping down using drainpipes and ledges as handholds hope i never finds out thats all i can say said old bailey to himself then a thought struck him hoy he called out to the night and the city dont forget the shoeses and the gloveses the advertisements on the walls were for refreshing and healthgiving malted drinks for twoshilling day excursions by train to the seaside for kippered herrings moustache wax and bootblack they were smokeblackened relics of the late twenties or the early thirties richard stared at them in disbelief it seemed completely abandoned a forgotten place it is british museum station admitted richard but but there never was a british museum station this is all wrong it was closed down in about and sealed off said door how bizarre said richard it was like walking through history he could hear trains echoing through tunnels nearby felt the push of air as they passed are there many stations like this about fifty said hunter they arent all accessible though not even to us there was a movement in the shadows at the edge of the platform hello said door how are you she went down into a crouch a brown rat stepped out into the light it sniffed at doors hand thank you said door cheerfully im glad you arent dead too richard edged over um door could you tell the rat something for me the rat turned its head toward him miss whiskers says that if theres anything youve got to say to her you can tell it to her yourself said door miss whiskers door shrugged its a literal translation she said it sounds better in rat richard did not doubt it um hello miss whiskers look there was one of your ratspeaker people a girl named anaesthesia she was taking me to the market we were crossing this bridge in the dark and she just never made it across the rat interrupted him with a sharp squee door began to talk hesitantly like a simultaneous translator she says that the rats do not blame you for the loss your guide was mm taken by the night as tribute but the rat squeaked again sometimes they come back said door she has taken note of your concern and thanks you for it the rat nodded to richard blinked her beadblack eyes then leapt to the floor and scurried back into the dark nice rat said door her disposition seemed to have improved remarkably now that she had the scroll up there she said indicating an archway effectively blocked by an iron door they walked over to it richard pushed against the metal but it was locked from the other side looks like its been sealed up said richard well need special tools door smiled suddenly her face seemed to be illuminated for a moment her elfin face became beautiful richard she said my family were openers its our talent look she reached out a grubby hand touched the door for a long moment nothing happened then there was a loud crash from the other side of the door and a chunk from their side door pushed against the door and with a fierce squeal from the rusted hinges it opened door turned up the collar of her leather jacket and thrust her hands deep into the pockets hunter shone her flashlight into the blackness beyond the doorway a flight of stone steps going up into the dark hunter can you take the rear asked door ill go on in front richard can take the middle she walked up a couple of steps hunter stayed where she was lady said hunter you are going to london above thats right said door were going to the british museum hunter bit her lower lip then she shook her head i must stay in london below she said there was a tremble in her voice richard realized that this was the first time he had ever seen hunter display any emotion other than effortless competence or occasionally tolerant amusement hunter said door bewildered youre my bodyguard hunter looked ill at ease i am your bodyguard in london below she said i cannot go with you to london above but you have to my lady i cannot i thought you understood the marquis knows hunter will look after you as long as you stay in london below thought richard yes no said door her pointed chin pushed out and up her oddcolored eyes narrowed i dont understand what is it she added scornfully some kind of curse or something hunter hesitated licked her lips then nodded it was as if she were admitting to having some socially embarrassing disease look hunter richard heard his own voice saying dont be silly for a moment he thought she was about to hit him which would have been bad or even to start crying which would have been much much worse then she took a deep breath and said in measured tones i will walk by your side when you are in london below my lady and i shall guard your body from all harm that might befall you but do not ask me to follow you to london above i cannot she folded her arms beneath her breasts planted her legs a little apart and looked for all the underworld like a statue of a woman not going anywhere cast in brass and in bronze and in burnt caramel right said door come on richard and she set off up the steps look said richard why dont we stay down here we can find the marquis and then all set off together and door was disappearing into the darkness above him hunter was planted at the foot of the stairs i shall wait here until she returns hunter told him you may go or stay as you will richard chased up the steps as fast as he could in the dark soon he saw doors lamplight above him wait he panted please she stopped and waited for him to catch up and then when he had caught up and was standing next to her on a claustrophobically small landing she waited for him to catch his breath you cant just go running off like that said richard door said nothing the line of her lips became slightly more compressed the angle of her chin was eversoslightly raised shes your bodyguard he pointed out door began to walk up the next flight of steps richard followed her well well be back soon enough said door she can start guarding me again then the air was close dank and oppressive richard wondered how you could tell if the air was bad in the absence of a canary and he contented himself with hoping that it wasnt i think the marquis probably did know about her curse or whatever it is he said yes she said i expect he did he richard began the marquis well you know to be honest he seems a little bit dodgy to me door stopped the steps deadended in a rough brick wall mm she agreed hes a little bit dodgy in the same way that rats are a little bit covered in fur then why go to him for help wasnt there someone else who could have helped you well talk about it later she opened the scroll the earl had given her glanced over the spidery handwriting then rolled it back up well be fine she said decisively its all in here weve just got to get into the british museum we find the angelus we get out easy nothing to it close your eyes richard closed his eyes obediently nothing to it he repeated when people say that on films it always means that something awful is going to happen he felt a breeze against his face something in the quality of the darkness beyond his closed eyelids changed so whats your point asked door the acoustics had altered as well they were in a bigger room you can open your eyes now he opened his eyes they were on the other side of the wall he assumed in what appeared to be a junk room not just any old junk room though there was something rather strange and special about the quality of this junk it was the kind of magnificent rare strange and expensive junk one would only expect to see somewhere like are we in the british museum he asked she frowned and seemed to be thinking or listening not exactly were very near i think this must be some kind of storage space or something she reached up to touch the fabric of a suit of antique clothing displayed on a wax dummy i wish wed stayed back with the bodyguard said richard door tipped her head on one side and looked at him gravely and what do you need guarding from richard mayhew nothing he admitted and then they turned the corner and he said well maybe them and at the same time door said shit mr croup and mr vandemar were standing on plinths on each side of the aisle down which they walked they reminded richard horridly of an exhibition of contemporary art jessica had once taken him to an exciting young artist had announced that he would break down all the taboos of art and to this end had embarked on a campaign of systematic grave robbery displaying the thirty most interesting results of his depredations in glass cases the exhibit was closed after the artist sold stolen cadaver number to an advertising agency for a sixfigure sum and the relatives of stolen cadaver number seeing a photo of the sculpture in the sun had sued both for a share of the proceeds and to change the name of the art piece to edgar fospring loving husband father and uncle rest in peace daddy richard had stared at the glassbound corpses in their stained suits and damaged dresses with horror he hated himself for looking but he had not been able to turn away mr croup smiled like a snake with a crescent moon stuck in its mouth and his resemblance to stolen cadavers numbers to was if anything increased by this what said the smiling mr croup no mister im so clever and know everything marquis no oh didnt i tell you whoops i cant go upstairs hunter he paused for dramatic effect so paint me gray and call me a dire wolf if it isnt two little lost lambs out on their own after dark you could call me a wolf too mister croup said mr vandemar helpfully mr croup clambered down from his plinth a gentle word in your woolly ears little lambkins he said richard looked around them there had to be somewhere they could run he reached down clasped doors hand and looked around desperately no please stay just where you are said mr croup we like you like that and we dont want to have to hurt you we do said mr vandemar well yes mister vandemar once you put it like that we want to hurt you both we want to hurt you a lot but thats not why were here right now were here to make things more interesting you see when things get dull my partner and i become restive and hard as you may find this to believe we lose our sunny and delightful dispositions mr vandemar showed them his teeth demonstrating his sunny and delightful disposition it was unquestionably the most horrible thing that richard had ever seen leave us alone said door her voice was clear and steady richard squeezed her hand if she could be brave so could he if you want to hurt her he said youll have to kill me first mr vandemar seemed genuinely pleased by this all right he said thanks and well hurt you too said mr croup not yet though said mr vandemar you see explained mr croup in a voice like rancid butter right now were just here to worry you mr vandemars voice was a night wind blowing over a desert of bones make you suffer he said spoil your day mr croup sat down at the base of mr vandemars plinth you visited earls court today he said in what richard suspected he fondly imagined were light and conversational tones so said door she was edging away from them now mr croup smiled how did we know that how did we know where to find you now can get to you any time at all said mr vandemar almost in a whisper youve been sold out little ladybird said mr croup to doorand richard realized to door alone theres a traitor in your nest a cuckoo come on she said and she ran richard ran with her through the hall filled with junk toward a door at doors touch it opened bid them farewell mister vandemar said mr croups voice from behind them bye bye said mr vandemar nono corrected mr croup au revoir he made a noise thenthe cuckkoo cuckkoo that a cuckoo might make if it were five and a half feet high and had a weakness for human fleshwhile mr vandemar truer to his nature threw back his bullet head and howled like a wolf ghostly and feral and mad they were outside in the open air at night running down a pavement in bloomsburys russell street richard thought his heart would pound its way through his chest a large black car went by the british museum was on the other side of some high blackpainted railings discreet concealed lights illuminated the outside of the high white victorian building the huge pillars of the facade the steps up to the front door this was the repository of so many of the worlds treasures looted and found and rescued and donated over hundreds of years they reached a gate in the railings door grabbed it with both hands and pushed against it nothing happened cant you make it open asked richard what does it look like im trying to do she snapped back an unfamiliar edge to her voice a few hundred feet down the pavement at the main gate large cars were drawing up couples in smart clothes were climbing out walking along the drive toward the museum down there said richard the main gate door nodded she looked behind them those two dont seem to be following us she said they hurried toward the main gate are you all right asked richard what happened just then door hunched deep into her leather jacket she was looking paler than usual which was extremely pale indeed and there were dark semicircles beneath her eyes im tired she said flatly opened too many doors today takes a lot out of me each time i need a little time to recover something to eat and ill be fine there was a guard on the gate minutely examining the engraved invitations that each of the wellshaven men in dinner jackets and the fragrant women in evening dresses needed to present then ticking their names off on a list before allowing them through a uniformed policeman beside him surveyed the guests implacably richard and door walked through the gate and no one glanced at them twice there was a line of people standing on the stone steps that led up to the museum doors and richard and door joined the line a whitehaired man accompanied by a woman bravely wearing a mink coat joined the line immediately and neatly behind them a thought struck richard can they see us he asked door turned to the gentleman behind them in the line she stared up at him hello she said the man looked around a puzzled expression on his face as if he was unsure what had attracted his attention then he caught sight of door standing just in front of him hello he said im door she told him this is richard oh said the man then he fumbled in an inner pocket pulled out a cigar case and forgot all about them there see said door i think so he replied they said nothing for some time as the line moved slowly toward the single open glass door at the museums main entrance door looked at the writing on her scroll as if she needed to reassure herself of something then richard said a traitor they were just winding us up said door trying to upset us doing a bloody good job of it too said richard and they walked through the open door and then they were in the british museum mr vandemar was hungry so they walked back through trafalgar square scare her muttered mr croup disgustedly scare her that we should be brought to this mr vandemar had found half a shrimp and lettuce sandwich in a garbage can and was gently tearing it into small pieces which he was tossing down onto the flagstones in front of him attracting a small flock of hungry latenight pigeons should have followed my idea said mr vandemar would have scared her lots more if id pulled his head off while she wasnt looking then put my hand up through his throat and wiggled my fingers about they always scream he confided when the eyeballs fall out he demonstrated with his right hand mr croup was having none of it why get so squeamish at this stage in the game he asked im not squeamish mister croup said mr vandemar i like it when the eyeballs fall out peepers and tarriwags more gray pigeons strutted over to peck at the fragments of bread and shrimp and to disregard the lettuce not you said mr croup the boss kill her kidnap her scare her why doesnt he make up his mind mr vandemar ran out of the sandwich he had been using as bait and now he made a dash into the crowd of pigeons who took to the wing with some clacking noises and the occasional grumbling coo well caught mister vandemar said mr croup approvingly mr vandemar was holding a surprised and upset pigeon which grumbled and fidgeted in his grasp and pecked ineffectively at his fingers mr croup sighed dramatically well anyway weve certainly put the cat amongst the pigeons now he said with relish mr vandemar held the pigeon up to his face there was a crunching noise as he bit off its head and commenced to chew the security guards were directing the museums guests to a hallway that seemed to be functioning as some kind of holding area door ignored the guards entirely and set off into the museum halls with richard trailing along behind her they went through the egyptian rooms up several flights of back stairs and into a room marked early english according to this scroll she said the angelus is in this room somewhere then door looked down at her scroll some more and looked around the hall more carefully she made a face tch she explained and took off back down the stairs the way they had come richard had an intense feeling of dйjа vu before realizing that yes of course this felt familiar it was how he had spent his weekends in the jessica days which were starting to seem already like things that had happened to someone else a long long time ago the angelus wasnt in that room then asked richard no it wasnt there said door a little more fiercely than richard felt the question had actually warranted oh he said i only wondered they went into another room richard wondered if he were starting to hallucinate i can hear music he said it sounded like a string quartet the party said door right the people in the dinner jackets they had lined up with no the angelus didnt seem to be here either door walked into the next hall and richard trailed in her wake he wished he could be of more use this angelus he said what does it look like for a moment he thought she was going to reprimand him simply for asking but she stopped rubbed her forehead this just says its got a picture of an angel on it but it cant be that hard to find after all she added hopefully how many things with angels on them are there here nine jessica was under a little pressure she was worried and nervous and jittery she had catalogued the collection arranged with the british museum to host the exhibition organized the restoration of the prime exhibit assisted in hanging and exhibiting the collection and put together the list of invitees to the fabulous launch it was just as well she didnt have a boyfriend she would tell her friends thered be no time for one even if she had one still it would be nice she thought when she got a moment someone to go to galleries with on the weekends someone to no she did not go to that place in her head she could no more pin it down than she could put her finger on a bead of mercury and she refocused on the exhibition even now at the last minute there were so many things that could go wrong many a horse had fallen at the final hurdle many an overconfident general had seen certain victory turn to defeat in the closing minutes of a battle jessica was simply going to ensure that nothing went wrong she was wearing a green silk dress an offtheshoulder general marshalling her troops and stoically pretending that mr stockton was not half an hour late her troops consisted of a head waiter a dozen serving staff three women from the caterers a string quartet and her assistant a young man named clarence she inspected the drinks table were fine for champagne yes the head waiter pointed to the crate of champagne beneath the table and sparkling mineral water another nod another crate jessica pursed her lips what about plain mineral water bubbles arent everybodys cup of tea you know they had plenty of plain mineral water good the string quartet was warming up they were not quite loud enough to drown the noise coming from the hallway outside it was the noise of a small but affluent crowd the grumbling of ladies in mink coats and men who were it not for the no smoking signs on the wallsand perhaps the advice of their doctorswould be smoking cigars the grumbling of journalists and celebrities who could smell the canapes volauvents sundry nibbles and free champagne clarence was talking to someone on his portable phone a slimline piece of foldout engineering that made the star trek communicators look bulky and oldfashioned he turned it off pushed down the antenna put it into the armani pocket of his armani suit where it did not even make a bulge he smiled reassuringly jessica mister stocktons drivers phoned from the car theyre still running a couple of minutes late nothing to worry about nothing to worry about echoed jessica doomed doomed the whole thing was going to be a disaster her disaster she picked up a glass of champagne from the table emptied it and handed the empty glass to the wine waiter clarence tipped his head on one side listening to the grumbling reverberation from the hallway outside the crowd wanted in he looked at his watch then looked at jessica questioningly a captain querying his general into the valley of death then boss mister stockton is on his way clarence jessica said calmly he has requested a private viewing before the event begins shall i go out and see how theyre doing no she said decisively then just as decisively yes food and drink dealt with jessica turned to the string quartet and asked them for the third time that evening exactly what they planned to play clarence opened the double doors to check on the crowd it was worse than he had thought there had to be more than a hundred people in the hall and they werent just people they were people some of them were even personalities excuse me said the chairman of the arts council the invitations said eight oclock sharp its twenty past eight already well just be a few more minutes reassured clarence smoothly security arrangements a woman in a hat bore down on him her voice was stentorian bullying and decidedly parliamentary young man she announced do you know who i am not really no lied clarence who knew exactly who all of them were hold onill see if anyone in here does he shut the door behind him jessica theyre going to riot dont exaggerate clarence she was moving around the room like a green silk whirlwind positioning her serving staff with their trays of canapes or drinks in strategic corners of the hall checking the publicaddress system the podium the curtain and the pullrope i can see the headlines now said clarence unfolding an imaginary newspaper geritol billionaires crush marketing babe in museum canape dash horror somebody began knocking at the door the volume in the hallway began to increase somebody was saying very loudly excuse me um excuse me someone else was informing the crowd that it was a disgrace quite simply a disgrace no other word for it executive decision said clarence suddenly im letting them in jessica shouted no if you but it was too late the doors were open and the horde was pushing its way into the hall the expression on jessicas face morphed from one of horror to one of charmed delight she shimmered toward the door baroness she said with a happy smile i cant tell you how delighted we are that you were able to come to our little exhibition this evening mister stocktons been unavoidably delayed but hell be here momentarily please have some canapes over the baronesss minkdraped shoulder clarence winked at her cheerfully jessica ran through all the bad words she knew in her head as soon as the baroness had headed for the volauvents jessica walked over to clarence and in a whisper and still smiling called him several of them richard froze a security guard was coming straight toward them the beam of his flashlight flashing from side to side richard looked around for somewhere to hide too late another guard was walking their way past the huge statues of dead greek gods flashlight beam swinging all right called the first guard the other guard kept coming and stopped just beside richard and door i suppose she said ive already had to stop a couple of idiots in suits from carving their initials on the rosetta stone i hate these functions the first guard shone his flashlight straight into richards eyes then let the beam slide off skittering over shadows i keep telling you he said with the satisfied relish of any true prophet its the masque of the red death all over again a decadent elite party while civilization crumbles about their ears he picked his nose wiped it on the leather sole of his wellpolished black boot the second guard sighed thank you gerald right back on patrol the guards walked out of the hall together last one of these events we found someone had puked in a sarcophagus said one of the guards and then the door closed behind them if youre part of london below said door to richard in a conversational voice as they walked side by side into the next hall they normally dont even notice you exist unless you stop and talk to them and even then they forget you pretty quickly but i saw you said richard it had been bothering him for a while i know said door isnt that odd everythings odd said richard with feeling the string music was getting louder the surges of anxiety were somehow worse up here in london above where he was forced to reconcile these two universes at least below he could just proceed dreamlike putting one foot in front of the other like a sleepwalker the angelus is through there announced door interrupting his reverie pointing to the direction from which the music was coming how do you know i know she said with utter certainty come on they stepped out of the darkness into a lighted corridor there was a huge sign hanging across the corridor it said angels over england an exhibition at the british museum sponsored by stocktons plc they crossed the corridor and walked through an open door into a large room in which a party was going on there was a string quartet playing and a number of serving staff were providing a roomful of welldressed people with food and drink there was a small stage in one corner of the room with a podium on it beside a high curtain the room was completely filled with angels there were statues of angels on tiny plinths there were paintings of angels on the walls there were angel frescoes there were huge angels and tiny angels stiff angels and amiable angels angels with wings and haloes and angels with neither warlike angels and peaceable angels there were modern angels and classical angels hundreds upon hundreds of angels of every size and shape western angels middle eastern angels eastern angels michelangelo angels joel peter witkin angels picasso angels warhoi angels mr stocktons angel collection was indiscriminate to the point of trashiness but certainly impressive in its eclecticism would you think richard asked that i was being picky if i pointed out that trying to find something with an angel on it in here is going to be like trying to find a needle in an oh my god its jessica richard felt the blood drain from his face until now he had thought that that was simply a figure of speech he hadnt thought it actually happened in real life someone you knew asked door richard nodded she was my well we were going to be married weve been together for a couple of years she was with me when i found you she was the one on the she left that message on the answering machine he pointed across the room jessica was making animated conversation with sir andrew lloyd webber bob geldof and a bespectacled gentleman who looked suspiciously like a saatchi every few minutes she checked her watch and glanced toward the door her said door recognizing the woman then obviously feeling that she should say something nice about someone richard had cared for she said well shes very and she paused and thought and then said clean richard stared across the room will she is she going to be upset that were here i doubt it said door frankly unless you do something stupid like talk to her she probably wont even notice you and then with more enthusiasm she said food she descended on the canapes like a small smutnosed girl in a toolarge leather jacket who had not eaten properly for sometime enormous quantities of food were immediately crammed into her mouth masticated and swallowed while at the same time the more substantial sandwiches were wrapped in paper napkins and placed into her pockets then with a paper plate heaped high with chicken legs melon slices mushroom volauvents caviar puffs and small venison sausages she began to circle the room staring intently at each and every angelic artefact richard trailed along behind her with a brie and fennel sandwich and a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice jessica was deeply puzzled she had noticed richard and having noticed him she had noticed door there was something familiar about them both it was like a tickle at the back of her throat impossible to get rid of utterly irritating it reminded jessica of something her mother had once told her about of how jessicas mother had one evening encountered a woman she had known all her lifehad been to school with had served on the parish council withand how her mother encountering the woman at a party had suddenly realized that she was unable to recall the womans name although she knew the woman had a husband in publishing named eric and a golden retriever named major it had left jessicas mother quite disgruntled it was driving jessica to distraction who are those people she asked clarence them well hes the new editor of vogue shes the arts correspondent of the new york times the one between them is kate moss i think no not them said jessica them there clarence looked in the place that she was pointing hm oh them he couldnt understand how he had failed to see them before old age he thought he would soon be twentythree journalists he said without much conviction they do look rather trendoid grunge chic please i know i invited the face i know him said jessica frustrated then mr stocktons chauffeur phoned from holborn to say that he was almost at the british museum and richard slid out of her head like mercury trickling through her fingers see anything asked richard door shook her head and swallowed a mouthful of hastily chewed chicken leg its like playing spot the pigeon in trafalgar square she said theres nothing that feels like the angelus the paper said id know it if i saw it and she wandered off inspecting angels pushing her way past a captain of industry the deputy leader of the opposition and the highestpaid call girl in the south of england richard turned away and found himself facetoface with jessica her hair was piled on her head and it framed her face perfectly in corkscrews of chestnut curls she was very beautiful she was smiling at him it was the smile that did it hello jessica he said how are you hello you wont believe this she said but my assistant failed to make a note of your newspaper mister uh paper said richard did i say newspaper said jessica with a tinkling sweet and selfdeprecating laugh magazine television station you are with the media youre looking very fine jessica said richard you have the advantage of me she said smiling roguishly youre jessica bartram youre a marketing executive at stocktons youre twentysix your birthday is april the twentythird and in the throes of extreme passion you have a tendency to hum the monkees song im a believer jessica was no longer smiling is this some kind of joke she asked coldly oh and weve been engaged for the last eighteen months said richard jessica smiled nervously perhaps this really was some kind of joke one of those jokes that everyone else seemed to get and she never did i rather think id know if id been engaged to someone for eighteen months mister um said jessica mayhew said richard helpfully richard mayhew you dumped me and i dont exist anymore jessica waved urgently at no one in particular all the way across the room be right there she called desperately and she began to back away im a believer sang richard cheerfully i couldnt leave her if i tried jessica snatched a glass of champagne from a passing tray downed it in a gulp at the far end of the room she could see mr stocktons chauffeur and where mr stocktons chauffeur was she headed toward the doors so who was he asked clarence edging alongside her who your mystery man i dont know she admitted then she said look maybe you ought to call security okay why just just get me security and then mr arnold stockton entered the hall and everything else went out of her head expansive he was and expensive a hogarth cartoon of a man enormous of girth manychinned and broadstomached he was over sixty his hair was gray and silver and it was cut too long in the back because it made people uncomfortable that his hair was too long and mr stockton liked making people uncomfortable compared to arnold stockton rupert murdoch was a shady little pipsqueak and the late robert maxwell was a beached whale arnold stockton was a pit bull which was how caricaturists often chose to draw him stocktons owned a little bit of everything satellites newspapers record companies amusement parks books magazines comics television stations film companies ill make the speech now said mr stockton to jessica by way of introduction then ill bugger off come back some other time when there arent all these stuffed shirts about right said jessica yes the speech now of course and she led him up onto the little stage up to the podium she tinked her fingernail against a glass for silence nobody heard her so she said excuse me into the microphone this time the conversation quieted ladies and gentlemen honored guests id like to welcome all of you to the british museum she said to the stocktonsponsored exhibition angels over england and to the man behind it all our chief executive and chairman of the board mister arnold stockton the guests applauded none of them in any doubt as to who had assembled the collection of angels or for that matter paid for their champagne mr stockton cleared his throat okay he said this wont take long when i was a small boy i used to come to the british museum on saturdays because it was free and we didnt have much money but id come up the big steps to the museum and id come down to this room round the back and look up at this angel it was like it knew what i was thinking just at that moment clarence came back in a couple of security guards beside him he pointed to richard who had stopped to listen to mr stocktons speech door was still examining exhibits no him clarence kept saying to the guards in an undertone no look there yes him anyway like anything thats not cared for continued mr stockton it decayed fell apart under the stresses and strains of modern times went rotten went bad well its taken a shitload of money he paused to let it sink inif he arnold stockton thought it was a shitload then a shitload it certainly wasand a dozen craftsmen have spent a great deal of time restoring it and fixing it up after this the exhibitionll be going to america and then around the world so it maybe can inspire some other little penniless brat to start his own communications empire he looked around turning to jessica he muttered what do i do now she pointed to the pullrope at the side of the curtain mr stockton pulled the rope the curtain billowed and opened revealing an old door behind it again there was a small flurry of activity in clarences corner of the room no him said clarence for heavens sake are you blind it looked like it had once been the door to a cathedral it was the height of two men and wide enough for a pony to walk through carved into the wood of the door and painted with red and white and gold leaf was an extraordinary angel it stared out at the world with blank medieval eyes there was an impressed gasp from the guests then they began to applaud the angelus door tugged at richards sleeve thats it richard come on she ran for the stage excuse me sir said a guard to richard might we see your invitation said another taking richard firmly but discreetly by the arm and do you have any identification no said richard door was up on the stage richard tried to yank free and follow her hoping that the guards would forget about him they didnt now that he had been brought to their attention they were going to proceed to treat him as they might any other shabby unwashed somewhat unshaven gatecrasher the guard who was holding richard increased his grip on his arm muttering none of that door paused on the stage wondering how to make the guards let richard go then she did the only thing she could think of she went over to the microphone went up on tiptoes and she screamed as loudly as she possibly could into the publicaddress system she had a remarkable scream it could with no artificial assistance go through your head like a new power drill with a bonesaw attachment and amplified it was simply unearthly a waitress dropped her tray of drinks heads turned hands covered ears all conversation stopped people stared at the stage in puzzlement and horror and richard made a break for it sorry he said to the stunned guard as he yanked his arm out of the mans grip and fled wrong london he reached the stage grabbed doors outstretched left hand her right hand touched the angelus the enormous cathedral door touched it and opened it this time no one dropped any drinks they were frozen staring utterly overwhelmedand momentarily blinded the angelus had opened and light from behind the door had flooded the room with radiance people covered their eyes then hesitantly opened them again and simply stared it was as if fireworks had been let off in the room not indoor fireworks strange crawling things that sputter and smell bad nor even the kind of fireworks that you set off in your back yard but the kind of industrialstrength fireworks that get fired up high enough to cause a potential menace to the airways the kind of fireworks that end a day at disney world or that give the fire marshals headaches at pink floyd concerts it was a moment of pure magic the audience stared entranced and amazed the only noise to be heard was the gentle gasping almostgroan of wonderment that people make when they watch fireworks the sound of awe then a grubby young man and a dirtyfaced girl in a huge leather jacket walked into the light show and vanished the door closed behind them the light show was over and everything was normal again the guests and guards and serving staff blinked shook their respective heads and having dealt with something entirely outside of their experience agreed somehow without a word that it had simply never happened the string quartet began to play once more mr stockton walked off nodding brusquely to various acquaintances as he did so jessica walked over to clarence what she asked quietly are those security guards doing in here the guards in question were standing among the guests looking around as if they were themselves unsure what they were doing there clarence began to explain just what the guards were doing there and then he realized he had absolutely no idea ill deal with it said clarence efficiently jessica nodded she looked out over her party and smiled benignly it was all going rather well richard and door walked into the light and then it was dark and chill and richard was blinking at the retinal afterimage of the light which left him almost blinded a ghostly series of orangegreen splotches that slowly faded as his eyes accustomed themselves to the darkness that surrounded them they were in a huge hall carved from rock iron pillars black and rustdusted held up the roof went off into the distant dark perhaps for miles from somewhere he could hear the gentle splash of water a fountain perhaps or a spring door was still holding his hand tightly in the distance a tiny flame flickered and flared and another and then another it was a host of candles flickering into flame richard realized and walking toward them through the candles was a tall figure dressed in a simple white robe the figure seemed to be moving slowly but it must have been walking very fast as it was only seconds before it was standing beside them it had golden hair and a pale face it was not much taller than richard but it made him feel like a little child it was not a man it was not a woman it was very beautiful its voice was quiet it said the lady door yes door said yes a gentle smile it nodded its head to her almost humbly it is an honor finally to meet you and your companion i am the angel islington its eyes were clear and wide its robes were not white as richard had initially thought they seemed to have been woven from light richard did not believe in angels he never had he was damned if he was going to start now still it was much easier not to believe in something when it was not actually looking directly at you and saying your name richard mayhew it said you too are welcome here in my halls it turned away please it said follow me richard and door followed the angel through the caverns the candles extinguished themselves behind them the marquis de carabas strode through the empty hospital broken glass and old syringes crunching beneath his squaretoed black motorcycle boots he stepped through a double door that led into a back staircase he went down the stairs to the cellars beneath the hospital he walked through the rooms beneath the building stepping fastidiously around the heaps of moldering rubbish he walked through the showers and the toilets down an old iron staircase through a wet swampy place and then pulled open a halfrotted wooden door and went inside he looked around the room in which he found himself he inspected with magnificent disdain the halfeaten kitten and the heap of razor blades then he cleared the debris off a chair sat down comfortably luxuriantly in the dankness of the cellar and closed his eyes eventually the door to the cellar was opened and people came in the marquis de carabas opened his eyes and yawned then he flashed mr croup and mr vandemar a huge smile hello boys said de carabas i thought it high time i came down here to talk to you in person ten do you drink wine it asked richard nodded i had a little wine once said door hesitantly my father he at dinner would let us taste it the angel islington lifted the bottle it looked like some kind of decanter richard wondered if the bottle was made of glass it refracted and reflected the candlelight so strangely perhaps it was some kind of crystal or one huge diamond it even made it seem that the wine inside was glowing as if it were made of light the angel took the top off the crystal and poured an inch of the liquid inside it into a wine glass it was a white wine but a wine unlike any richard had ever seen it threw light around the caverns like sunlight on a swimming pool door and richard sat around an ageblackened wooden table on huge wooden chairs and said nothing this wine said islington is the last bottle of its kind i was given a dozen bottles by one of your ancestors it handed the glass to door and began to pour another inch of the glowing wine from the decanter into another glass it did this reverently almost lovingly like a priest performing a ritual it was a welcome gift this was oh thirty forty thousand years ago quite a while ago at any rate it passed the wine glass to richard i suppose that you could accuse me of squandering something i should treasure it told them but i receive guests so rarely and the way here is hard the angelus murmured door you traveled here using the angelus yes but that way works only once for each traveler the angel raised its glass high staring at the light drink it carefully it advised them it is most potent it sat down at the table between richard and door when one tastes it it said wistfully i like to imagine that one is actually tasting the sunlight of bygone days it held up its glass a toast to former glories former glories chorused richard and door and then a little warily they tasted the wine sipping it not drinking its amazing said door it really is said richard i thought old wines turned to vinegar when they were exposed to air the angel shook its head not this one it is all a matter of the type of grape and the place it was grown this kind of grape alas perished when the vineyard vanished beneath the waves its magical said door sipping the liquid light ive never tasted anything like it and you never will again said islington there is no more wine from atlantis somewhere inside richard a small reasonable voice pointed out that there never was an atlantis and thus emboldened went on to state that there were no such things as angels and that furthermore most of his experiences of the last few days had been impossible richard ignored it he was learning awkwardly to trust his instincts and to realize that the simplest and most likely explanations for what he had seen and experienced recently were the ones that had been offered to himno matter how unlikely they might seem he opened his mouth and tasted the wine once more it made him feel happy it made him think of skies bigger and bluer than any he had ever seen a golden sun hanging huge in the sky everything simpler everything younger than the world he knew there was a waterfall to the left of them clear water ran down the rock and collected in the rockpool to the right of them was a door set between two iron pillars the door was made of polished flint set in a metal that was almost black you really claim to be an angel richard asked i mean youve actually met god and everything islington smiled i claim nothing richard it said but i am an angel you honor us said door no you do me much honor by coming here your father was a good man door and a friend to me i was deeply saddened by his death he said in his journal he said i should come to you he said i could trust you i only hope that i can be worthy of that trust the angel sipped its wine london below is the second city that i have cared for the first sank beneath the waves and there was nothing i could do to prevent it i know what pain is and loss you have my sympathies what would you like to know door paused my family they were killed by croup and vandemar butwho ordered it i want i want to know why the angel nodded many secrets find their way down to me it said many rumors and halftruths and echoes then it turned to richard and you what do you want richard mayhew richard shrugged i want my life back and my apartment and my job that can happen said the angel yeah right said richard flatly do you doubt me richard mayhew asked the angel islington richard looked into its eyes they were a luminescent gray eyes as old as the universe eyes that had seen galaxies congeal from stardust ten million million years ago richard shook his head islington smiled at him kindly it will not be easy and you and your companions will face some very real difficulties both in the task and in the return but there could be a way that we can learn a key to all of our problems it got up and walked over to a small rock shelf where it picked up a figurine one of several on the shelf it was a small black statuette depicting some kind of animal made of volcanic glass the angel handed it to door this will bring you safely through the last stage of your journey back to me it said the rest is up to you what do you want us to do asked richard the black friars are custodians of a key it said bring it to me and you can use it to find out who killed my family asked door i hope so said the angel richard finished his glass of wine he felt it warming him running through him he had the strange feeling that if he looked down at his fingers he would be able to see the wine glowing through them as if he were made of light good luck whispered the angel islington there was a rushing sound like a wind soughing across a lost forest or the beating of mighty wings richard and door were sitting on the floor in a room in the british museum staring up at a carved painting of an angel on a cathedral door the room was dark and empty the party had been over for a long time the sky outside was beginning to lighten richard stood up then leaned down and helped door up black friars he asked door nodded he had crossed blackfriars bridge in the city of london many times and he had often passed through blackfriars station but he had learned by now not to assume anything people richard walked over to the angelus he ran a finger down its painted robe do you think he can really do it get me my life back ive never heard of such a thing but i dont think he would have lied to us he is an angel door opened her hand looked at the statue of the beast my father had one of these she said sadly she put it deep in one of the pockets of her brown leather jacket well said richard were not going to get the key back by lollygagging around here are we they walked through the empty museum corridors so what do you know about this key then asked richard nothing said door they had reached the main doors of the museum ive heard of the black friars but ive never actually had anything to do with them she pressed her fingers against a seriously locked glass door which swung open at her touch a bunch of monks said richard thoughtfully i bet if we just tell them its for an angel a real one theyll give us the sacred key andand throw in the magic canopener and the amazing whistling corkscrew as a surprise bonus he began to laugh he wondered if the wine was still affecting him youre in good spirits said door he nodded enthusiastically im going to go home everything is going to be normal again boring again wonderful again richard looked at the stone steps that lead up the british museum and decided that they were made to be danced down by fred astaire and ginger rogers and seeing that neither of them happened to be available he began to dance down the steps doing a fred astaire impersonation while humming something approximately halfway between puttin on the ritz and top hat white tie and tails yatatadadatataya he sang softshoeing down the steps and up again door stood at the top of the steps staring at him in horror then she began to giggle helplessly he looked up at her and doffed his imaginary white silk top hat to her mimed tossing it high in the air catching it and putting it back on his head twit said door and smiled at him in response richard grabbed her hand and continued dancing up and down the steps door hesitated for a moment then she too began to dance she danced much better than richard did at the bottom of the steps they tumbled breathless and exhausted and giggling into each others arms richard felt his world spin he felt her heart beating against his chest the moment began to transmute and he wondered if there was something he should do he wondered if he should kiss her he wondered if he wanted to kiss her and he realized that he truly did not know he looked into her amazing eyes door put her head on one side and pulled free she pulled up the collar on her brown leather jacket pulled it around her armor and protection lets go and find our bodyguard said door and they walked away together down the sidewalk toward british museum station stumbling only a little from time to time what asked mr croup do you want what asked the marquis de carabas a little more rhetorically does anyone want dead things suggested mr vandemar extra teeth i thought perhaps we could make a deal said the marquis mr croup began to laugh it sounded like a piece of blackboard being dragged over the nails of a wall of severed fingers oh messire marquis i think i can confidently state with no risk of contradiction from any parties here present that you have taken leave of whatever senses you are reputed to have had you are he confided if you will permit the vulgarism completely off your head say the word said mr vandemar who was now standing behind the marquiss chair and itll be off his neck before you can say jack ketch the marquis breathed heavily on his fingernails and polished them on the lapel of his coat i have always felt he said that violence was the last refuge of the incompetent and empty threats the final sanctuary of the terminally inept mr croup glared what are you doing here he hissed the marquis de carabas stretched like a big cat a lynx perhaps or a huge black panther and at the end of the stretch he was standing up with his hands thrust deep in the pockets of his magnificent coat you are he said idly and conversationally i understand mister croup a collector of tang dynasty figurines how did you know that people tell me things im approachable the marquiss smile was pure untroubled guileless the smile of a man selling you a used bible even if i were began mr croup if you were said the marquis de carabas you might be interested in this he took one hand out of his pocket and displayed it to mr croup until earlier that evening it had sat in a glass case in the vaults of one of londons leading merchant banks it was listed in certain catalogues as the spirit of autumn it was roughly eight inches high a piece of glazed pottery that had been shaped and painted and fired while europe was in the dark ages six hundred years before columbuss first voyage mr croup hissed involuntarily and reached for it the marquis pulled it out of reach cradled it to his chest no no said the marquis its not as simple as that no asked mr croup but whats to stop us taking it and leaving pieces of you all over the underside weve never dismembered a marquis before have said mr vandemar in york in the fourteenth century in the rain he wasnt a marquis said mr croup he was the earl of exeter and marquis of westmorland mr vandemar looked rather pleased with himself mr croup sniffed whats to stop us hacking you into as many pieces as we hacked the marquis of westmorland he asked de carabas took his other hand out of his pocket it held a small hammer he tossed the hammer in the air and caught it by the handle ending with the hammer poised over the china figurine oh please he said no more silly threats i think id feel better if you were both standing back over there mr vandemar shot a look at mr croup who nodded almost imperceptibly there was a tremble in the air and mr vandemar was standing beside mr croup who smiled like a skull i have indeed been known to purchase the occasional tang piece he admitted is that for sale we dont go in so much for buying and selling here in the underside mister croup barter exchange thats what we look for but yes indeed this desirable little piece is certainly up for grabs mr croup pursed his lips he folded his arms he unfolded them he ran one hand through his greasy hair then name your price said mr croup the marquis let himself breathe a deep relieved and almost audible sigh it was possible that he was going to be able to pull this whole grandiose ruse off after all first three answers to three questions he said croup nodded each way we get three answers too fair enough said the marquis secondly i get safe conduct out of here and you agree to give me at least an hours head start croup nodded violently agreed ask your first question his gaze was fixed on the statue first question who are you working for oh thats an easy one said mr croup thats a simple answer we are working for our employer who wishes to remain nameless hmph why did you kill doors family orders from our employer said mr croup his smile becoming more foxy by the moment why didnt you kill door when you had a chance before mr croup could answer mr vandemar said got to keep her alive shes the only one that can open the door mr croup glared up at his associate thats it he said tell him everything why dont you i wanted a turn muttered mr vandemar right said mr croup so youve got three answers for all the good that will do you my first question why are you protecting her her father saved my life said the marquis honestly i never paid off my debt to him i prefer debts to be in my favor ive got a question said mr vandemar as have i mr vandemar the upworlder richard mayhew why is he traveling with her why does she permit it sentimentality on her part said the marquis de carabas he wondered as he said it if that was the whole truth he had begun to wonder whether there might perhaps be more to the upwortder than met the eye now me said mr vandemar what number am i thinking of i beg your pardon what number am i thinking of repeated mr vandemar its between one and a lot he added helpfully seven said the marquis mr vandemar nodded impressed mr croup began where is the but the marquis shook his head uhuh he said now were getting greedy there was a moment of utter silence in that dank cellar then once more water dripped and maggots rustled and the marquis said an hours head start remember of course said mr croup the marquis de carabas tossed the figurine to mr croup who caught it eagerly like an addict catching a plastic baggie filled with white powder of dubious legality and then without a backward glance the marquis left the cellar mr croup examined the figurine minutely turning it over and over in his hands a dickensian curator of the museum of the damned contemplating a prize exhibit his tongue flicked out from time to time like a snakes a perceptible flush appeared on his pallid cheeks oh fine fine he whispered tang dynasty indeed twelve hundred years old the finest pottery figurines ever made on this earth this was created by kai lung finest of potters there is not a twin to it in existence examine the color of the glaze the sense of proportion the life he was smiling now like a baby the innocent smile looked lost and confused on the shady terrain of mr croups face it adds a little wonder and beauty to the world and then he grinned too widely and lowered his face to the figurine and crushed its head in his teeth chomping and chewing wildly swallowing in lumps his teeth ground the china to a fine powder which dusted the lower part of his face he gloried in its destruction throwing himself into it with the strange madness and uncontrolled blood lust of a fox in a henhouse and then when the statue was nothing but dust he turned to mr vandemar he seemed strangely mellow almost languid how long did we say wed give him an hour mmm and how long has it been six minutes mr croup lowered his head he ran a finger across his chin licked the powdered clay from his fingertip you follow him mister vandemar said mr croup i need a little more time in which to savor the occasion hunter could hear them walking down the steps she was standing in the shadows with her arms folded in the same position she had been in when they left her richard was humming loudly door was giggling helplessly then she would stop and tell richard to be quiet then she would start giggling again they walked past hunter without noticing her she stepped out of the shadows and said you have been gone for eight hours it was a statement of fact without reproach or curiosity door blinked at her it didnt seem that long hunter said nothing richard grinned wearily at her dont you want to know what happened well we got ambushed by mister croup and mister vandemar unfortunately we didnt have a bodyguard around still i gave them a good run for their money hunter raised a perfect eyebrow i am in awe of your pugilistic talents she said coolly door giggled hes kidding actuallythey killed us as an expert in the termination of bodily functions hunter said i must beg to differ you are neither of you dead at a guess you are both very drunk door stuck her tongue out at her bodyguard nonsense touched hardly a drop that much she held out two fingers to show how tiny an amount that much was just went to a party said richard and saw jessica and saw a real angel and got a little black pig and came back here just a little drink continued door intently old old drink tiiiiny little drink very small almost not there she began to hiccup then she giggled again a hiccup interrupted her and she sat down suddenly on the platform i think maybe we are a bit smashed she said soberly then she closed her eyes and began solemnly to snore the marquis de carabas was running through the underways as if all the hounds of hell had his scent and were on his trail he was splashing through six gray inches of the tyburn the hangmans river kept safe in the darkness in a brick sewer beneath park lane on its way south to buckingham palace he had been running for seventeen minutes thirty feet below marble arch he paused the sewer divided into two branches the marquis de carabas ran down the lefthand branch several minutes later mr vandemar walked through the sewer and when he reached the junction he too paused for a few moments sniffing the air and then he too walked down the lefthand branch hunter dropped richard mayhews unconscious body into a pile of straw with a grunt he rolled in the straw said something that sounded like forthril bjugly mobble wug and went back to sleep she put door down in the straw next to him more gently then she stood beside door in the dark stables under the ground on guard still the marquis de carabas was exhausted he leaned against the tunnel wall and stared at the steps that went up ahead of him then he pulled out the golden pocketwatch and looked at the time thirtyfive minutes had passed since he had fled the hospital cellar is it an hour yet asked mr vandemar he was sitting on the steps ahead of the marquis picking his nails with a knife not even close gasped the marquis felt like an hour said mr vandemar helpfully there was a shiver in the world and mr croup stood behind the marquis de carabas he still had powder on his chin de carabas stared at mr croup he turned back to look at mr vandemar and then spontaneously the marquis de carabas began to laugh mr croup smiled you find us funny messire marquis do you not a source of amusement is that not so with our pretty clothes and our convoluted circumlocutions mr vandemar murmured i havent got a circumlo and our little sillinesses of manner and behavior and perhaps we are funny mr croup raised one finger then and waggled it at de carabas but you must never imagine he continued that just because something is funny messire marquis it is not also dangerous and mr vandemar threw his knife at the marquis hard and accurately it hit him hilt first on the temple his eyes rolled up in his head and his knees buckled circumlocution said mr croup to mr vandemar its a way of speaking around something a digression verbosity mr vandemar picked up the marquis de carabas by his waistband and dragged him up the stairs his head bumpbumpbumping on each step as they went and mr vandemar nodded i wondered he said watching their dreams now as they sleep hunter sleeps standing up in her dream hunter is in the undercity beneath bangkok it is partly a maze and partly a forest for the wilderness of thailand has retreated deep beneath the ground under the airport and the hotels and the streets the world smells of spice and dried mango and it also smells not unpleasantly of sex it is humid and she is sweating it is dark broken by phosphorescent patches on the wall greenish grey fungi that give light enough to fool the eye light enough to walk by in her dream hunter moves silent as a ghost through the wet tunnels pushing her way through vegetation she holds a weighted throwing stick in her right hand a leather shield covers her left forearm she smells it in her dream acrid and animal and she pauses beside a wall of ruined masonry and she waits part of the shadows one with the darkness hunting like life hunter believes consists chiefly of waiting in hunters dream however she does not wait upon her arrival it comes through the underbrush a fury of brown and of white undulating gently like a wetfurred snake its red eyes bright and peering through the darkness its teeth like needles a carnivore and a killer the creature is extinct in the world above it weighs almost three hundred pounds and is a little over fifteen feet long from the tip of its nose to the tip of its tail as it passes her she hisses like a snake and momentarily old instincts kicking in it freezes and then it leaps at her nothing but hate and sharp teeth she remembers then in her dream that this had happened before and that when it had happened that time in the past she had pushed the leather armshield into its mouth and crushed its skull with the leaden throwing stick taking care not to damage the pelt she had given the great weasels pelt to a girl who had caught her eye and the girl had been appropriately grateful but now in her dream that is not happening instead the weasel is reaching out a forepaw toward her and she is dropping her throwing stick and taking its paw and then and there in the undercity beneath bangkok they are dancing together m one intricate unending dance and hunter is watching them from outside herself and she is admiring the elaborate movements they make as they move tail and legs and arms and fingers and eyes and hair all tumbling and twisting powerfully and strangely into the underneath and out across forever there is a tiny noise in the waking world a dreaming whimper from the child door and hunter moves from sleeping to waking fluidly and instantly she is alert once more and on guard she forgets her dream entirely upon waking door is dreaming of her father in her dream he is showing her how to open things he picks up an orange and gestures in one smooth movement it inverts and twists the orange flesh is on the outside now and the skin is in the center on the inside one must always maintain parity her father tells her peeling off an insideout orange segment for her parity symmetry topology these will be our subjects for the months to come door but the most important thing for you to understand is this all things want to open you must feel that need and use it her fathers hair is brown and thick as it was a decade before his death and he has an easy smile which she remembers but which time had diminished as the years went on in her dream he passes her a padlock she takes it from him her hands are the size and shape of her hands today although she knows that in truth this occurred when she was a tiny child that she is taking moments and conversations and lessons from over a dozen years and is compressing them into one lesson open it he tells her she holds it in her hand feeling the cold metal feeling the weight of the lock in her hands something is bothering her there is something she has to know door learned to open some time after she learned to walk she remembers her mother holding her tightly opening a door from doors bedroom to the playroom remembers watching her brother arch separating linked silver rings joining them back together she tries to open the padlock she fumbles at it with her fingers and with her mind nothing happens she throws the padlock down onto the floor and begins to cry her father reaches down and picks up the padlock puts it back into her hand his long finger brushes away a tear from her cheek remember he tells her the padlock wants to open all you have to do is let it do what it wants it sits there in her hand cold and inert and heavy and then suddenly she understands and somewhere in her heart she lets it be what it wants to be there is a loud click and the padlock opens her father is smiling there she says good girl says her father thats all there is to opening everything else is just technique she realizes what it is that is bothering her father she asks your journal who put it away who could have hidden it but he is receding from her and already she is forgetting she calls to him but he cannot hear her and although she can hear his voice in the distance she can no longer make out what he is saying in the waking world door whimpers softly then she rolls over cradles her arm around her face snorts once twice then sleeps once more sleeps without dreaming richard knows it waits for them each tunnel he goes down each turning each branch he walks the feeling grows in urgency and weight he knows it is there waiting and the sense of impending catastrophe increases with every step he knows that it should have been a relief when he turns the final corner and sees it standing there framed in the tunnel waiting for him instead he feels only dread in his dream it is the size of the world there is nothing left in the world but the beast its flanks steaming broken spars and juts of old weapons prickling from its hide there is dried blood on its horns and on its tusks it is gross and vast and evil and then it charges he raises his hand and he throws the spear at the creature he sees its eyes wet and vicious and gloating as they float toward him all in a fraction of a second that becomes a tiny forever and then it is upon him the water was cold and it hit richards face like a slap his eyes jerked open and he caught his breath hunter was looking down at him she was holding a large wooden bucket it was empty he reached up one hand his hair was soaked and his face was wet he wiped the water from his eyes and shivered with cold you didnt have to do that said richard his mouth tasted like several small animals had been using it as a rest room he tried to stand and then he sat down again suddenly ooh he explained hows your head asked hunter professionally its been better said richard hunter picked up another wooden bucket this one filled with water and hauled it across the stable floor i dont know what you drank she said but it must have been potent hunter dipped her hand into the bucket and flicked it at doors face spraying her with water doors eyes flickered no wonder atlantis sank muttered richard if they all felt like this in the morning it was probably a relief where are we hunter flicked another handful of water at doors face in the stables of a friend she said richard looked around the place did look a little like a stable he wondered if it were for horsesand if so what kind of horses would live beneath the ground there was a device painted on the wall the letter s circled by seven stars door reached a tentative hand up to her head and touched it experimentally as if she were unsure just what she might find ooh she said in a nearwhisper temple and arch am i dead no said hunter pity hunter helped her to a standing position well said door sleepily he did warn us it was strong and then door woke up completely very hard very fast she grabbed richards shoulder pointed to the device on the wall the snaky s with the stars surrounding it she gasped serpentine she said to richard to hunter thats serpentines crest richard get up we have to runbefore she finds out were here and do you think asked a dry voice from the doorway that you could enter serpentines house without serpentine knowing child door pushed herself back against the wood of the stable wall she was trembling richard realized through the pounding in his head that he had never seen door so actually and obviously scared before serpentine stood in the doorway she was wearing a white leather corset and high white leather boots and the remains of what looked like it had once long ago been a silkandlace confection of a white wedding dress now shredded and dirtstained and torn she towered above them all her shock of graying hair brushed the door lintel her eyes were sharp and her mouth was a cruel slash in an imperious face she looked at door as if she took terror as her due as if she had become so used to fear that she now expected it even liked it calm yourself said hunter but shes serpentine wailed door of the seven sisters serpentine inclined her head cordially then she stepped out of the doorway and walked toward them behind her was a thin woman with a severe face and long dark hair wearing a black dress pinched waspthin at the waist the woman said nothing serpentine walked over to hunter hunter worked for me long ago said serpentine she reached out a white finger and gently stroked hunters brown cheek with it a gesture of affection and possession and then youve kept your looks better than i hunter hunter looked down her friends are my friends child said serpentine you are door yes said door drymouthed serpentine turned on richard and what are you she asked unimpressed richard said richard i am serpentine she told him graciously so i gathered said richard there is food waiting for all of you said serpentine should you wish to break your fast oh god no whimpered richard politely door said nothing she was still backed against the wall still trembling gently like a leaf in an autumn breeze the fact that hunter had clearly brought them here as a safe haven was doing nothing to assuage her fear what is there to eat asked hunter serpentine looked at thewaspwaisted woman in the doorway well she asked the woman smiled the chilliest smile richard had ever seen cross a human face then she said fried eggs poached eggs pickled eggs curried venison pickled onions pickled herrings smoked herrings salted herrings mushroom stew salted bacon stuffed cabbage calvesfoot jelly richard opened his mouth to plead with her to stop but it was too late he was suddenly violently awfully sick he wanted someone to hold him to tell him that everything would be all right that hed soon be feeling better someone to give him an aspirin and a glass of water and show him back to his bed but nobody did and his bed was another life away he washed the sick from his face and hands with water from the bucket then he washed out his mouth then swaying gently he followed the four women to breakfast pass the calvesfoot jelly said hunter with her mouth full serpentines dining room was on what appeared to be the smallest underground platform that richard had ever seen it was about twelve feet long and much of that space was taken up with a dinner table a white damask cloth was laid on the table and a formal silver dinnerservice on that the table was piled high with evilsmelling foodstuffs the pickled quails eggs thought richard smelled the worst his skin felt clammy and his eyes felt like they had been put in their sockets wrong while his skull gave him the general impression that someone had removed it while he had slept and swapped it for another two or three sizes too small an underground train went past a few feet from them the wind of its passage whipped at the table the noise of its passage went through richards head like a hot knife through brains richard groaned your hero is unable to hold his wine i see observed serpentine dispassionately hes not my hero said door im afraid he is you learn to recognize the type something in the eyes perhaps she turned to the woman in black who appeared to be some kind of majordomo a restorative for the gentleman the woman smiled thinly and glided away door picked at a mushroom dish we are very grateful for all this lady serpentine she said serpentine sniffed just serpentine child i have no time for silly honorifics and imaginary titles so youre porticos oldest girl yes serpentine dipped her finger in the briny sauce that held what appeared to be several small eels she licked her finger nodded approvingly i had little time for your father all that foolishness about uniting the underside stuff and nonsense silly man just asking for trouble the last time i saw your father i told him that if he ever came back here id turn him into a blindworm she turned to door how is your father by the way hes dead said door serpentine looked perfectly satisfied see she said my point exactly door said nothing serpentine picked at something that was moving in her gray hair she examined it closely crushed it between finger and thumb and dropped it onto the platform then she turned to hunter who was demolishing a small hill of pickled herrings youre beasthunting then she said hunter nodded her mouth full youll need the spear of course said serpentine the waspwaisted woman was now standing next to richard holding a small tray on the tray was a small glass containing an aggressively emeraldcolored liquid richard stared at it then looked at door what are you giving him asked door nothing that will hurt him said serpentine with a frosty smile you are guests richard knocked back the green liquid which tasted of thyme and peppermint and winter mornings he felt it go down and prepared himself to try to keep it from coming back up again instead he took a deep breath and realized with a little surprise that his head no longer hurt and that he was starving old bailey was not intrinsically one of those people put in the world to tell jokes despite this handicap he persisted in trying he loved to tell shaggydog stories of inordinate length which would end in a sad pun although often as not old bailey would be unable to remember it by the time he got there the only public for old baileys jokes consisted of a small captive audience of birds who particularly the rooks viewed his jokes as deep and philosophical parables containing profound and penetrating insights into what it meant to be human and who would actually ask him from time to time to tell them another of his amusing stories all right all right all right old bailey was saying stop me if youve heard this one before there was a man walked into a bar no he wasnt a man thats the joke sorry he was a horse a horse no a piece of string three pieces of string right three pieces of string walk into a bar a huge old rook croaked a question old bailey rubbed his chin then shrugged they just do its a joke they can walk in the joke he asks for a drink for himself and one for each of his friends and the barman says we dont serve pieces of string here to one of the pieces of string so it goes back to its friends and says they dont serve strings here and its a joke so the middle one does it too three of them you see then the last one he ties himself around the middle and he pulls the end of him all out and he orders a drink the rook croaked again sagely three drinks right and the barman says here arent you one of those pieces of string and he says the piece of string he says noim a frayed knot afraid not ysee a frayed knot pun very very funny the starlings made polite noises the rooks nodded their heads put their heads on one side then the oldest rook cawed at old bailey another im not made of hilarity yknow let me think there was a noise from the tent a deep pulsing noise like the beating of a distant heart old bailey hurried into his tent the noise was coming from an old wooden chest in which old bailey kept those things he most prized he opened the chest the throbbing noise became much louder the small silver box was sitting on the top of old baileys treasures he reached down one gnarly hand and picked it up a red light rhythmically pulsed and glowed inside it like a heartbeat and shone out through the silver filigree and through the cracks and fastenings hes in trouble said old bailey the oldest rook cawed a question no its not a joke its the marquis said old bailey hes in deep trouble richard was halfway through his second plate of breakfast when serpentine pushed her chair back from the table i think i have had my fill of hospitality she said child young man good day hunter she paused then she ran one clawlike finger along the line of hunters jaw hunter you are always welcome here she nodded to them imperiously and stood up and walked away followed by her waspwaisted butler we should leave now said hunter she stood up from the table and door and richard more reluctantly followed her they walked along a corridor that was too thin to allow more than one of them to pass at a time they went up some stone steps they crossed an iron bridge in the darkness while underground trains echoed by beneath them then they entered what seemed like an endless network of underground vaults that smelled of damp and decay of brick and stone and time that was your old boss eh she seemed nice enough said richard to hunter hunter said nothing door who had been somewhat subdued said when they want to make children behave themselves in the underside they tell them behave or serpentine will take you oh said richard and you worked for her hunter i worked for all the seven sisters i thought that they hadnt spoken to each other for oh at least thirty years said door quite possibly but they were still talking then how old are you asked door richard was pleased she had asked he would never have dared as old as my tongue said hunter primly and a little older than my teeth anyway said richard in the untroubled tone of voice of one whose hangover had left him and who knew that somewhere far above them someone was having a beautiful day that was okay nice food and no one was trying to kill us im sure that will remedy itself as the day goes on said hunter accurately which way to the black friars my lady door paused and concentrated well go the river way she said over here is he coming round yet asked mr croup mr vandemar prodded the marquiss prone body with one long finger the breathing was shallow not yet mister croup i think i broke him you must be more careful with your toys mister vandemar said mr croup eleven so what are you after richard asked hunter the three of them were walking with extreme care along the bank of an underground river the bank was slippery a narrow path along dark rock and sharp masonry richard watched with respect as the gray water rushed and tumbled within arms reach this was not the kind of river you fell into and got out of again it was the other kind after well he said personally im trying to get back to the real london and my old life door wants to find out who killed her family what are you after they edged along the bank a step at a time hunter in the lead she said nothing in reply the river slowed and fed into a small underground lake they walked beside the water their lamps reflecting in the black surface their reflections smudged by the river mist so what is it asked richard he did not expect any kind of answer hunters voice was quiet and intense she did not break her step as she spoke i fought in the sewers beneath new york with the great blind white alligatorking he was thirty feet long fat from sewage and fierce in battle and i bested him and i killed him his eyes were like huge pearls in the darkness her strangely accented voice echoed in the underground twined in the mist in the night beneath the earth i fought the bear that stalked the city beneath berlin he had killed a thousand men and his claws were stained brown and black from the dried blood of a hundred years but he fell to me he whispered words in a human tongue as he died the mist hung low on the lake richard fancied that he could see the creatures she spoke of white shapes writhing in the vapor there was a black tiger in the undercity of calcutta a maneater brilliant and bitter the size of a small elephant a tiger is a worthy adversary i took him with my bare hands richard glanced at door she was listening to hunter intently this was news to her too then and i shall slay the beast of london they say his hide bristles with swords and spears and knives stuck in him by those who have tried and failed his tusks are razors and his hooves are thunderbolts i will kill him or i will die in the attempt her eyes shone as she spoke of her prey the river mist had become a thick yellow fog a bell was struck a little way away three times the sound carrying across the water the world began to lighten richard thought he could see the squat shapes of buildings around them the yellowgreen fog became thicker it tasted of ash and soot and the grime of a thousand urban years it clung to their lamps muffling the light what is this he asked london fog said hunter but they stopped years ago didnt they clean air act smokeless fuels all that richard found himself remembering the sherlock holmes books of his childhood what did they call them again peasoupers said door london particulars thick yellow river fogs mixed with coalsmoke and whatever rubbish was going into the air for the last five centuries hasnt been one in the upworld for oh forty years now we get the ghosts of them down here mm not ghosts more like echoes richard breathed in a strand of the yellowgreen fog and began to cough that doesnt sound good said door fog in my throat said richard the ground was becoming stickier muddier it sucked at richards feet as he walked still he said to reassure himself a little fog never hurt anyone door looked up at him with big pixie eyes there was one in that they reckon killed four thousand people people from here he asked under london your people said hunter richard was willing to believe it he thought about holding his breath but the fog was getting thicker the ground was becoming mushier i dont understand he asked why do you have fogs down here when we dont have them up there anymore door scratched her nose there are little pockets of old time in london where things and places stay the same like bubbles in amber she explained theres a lot of time in london and it has to go somewhereit doesnt all get used up at once i may still be hung over sighed richard that almost made sense the abbot had known that this day would bring pilgrims the knowledge was a part of his dreams it surrounded him like the darkness so the day became one of waiting which was he knew a sin moments were to be experienced waiting was a sin against both the time that was still to come and the moments one was currently disregarding still he was waiting through each of the days services through their scant meals the abbot was listening intently waiting for the bell to sound waiting to know who and how many he found himself hoping for a clean death the last pilgrim had lasted for almost a year a gibbering screaming thing the abbot regarded his own blindness as neither a blessing nor a curse it simply was but even so he had been grateful he had never been able to see the poor creatures face brother jet who had cared for the creature still woke in the night screaming with its twisted face before him the bell tolled late in the afternoon three times the abbot was in the shrine on his knees contemplating their charge he pulled himself to his feet and made his way to the corridor where he waited father the voice was that of brother fuliginous who guards the bridge the abbot asked him his voice was surprisingly deep and melodious for such an old man sable came the reply from the darkness the abbot reached out a hand grasped the young mans elbow and walked beside him slowly through the corridors of the abbey there was no solid ground there was no lake their feet were splashing through some kind of marsh in the yellow fog this announced richard is disgusting it was seeping through his shoes invading his socks and making a much closer acquaintance with his toes than richard was entirely happy with there was a bridge ahead of them rising up out of the marsh a figure dressed in black waited at the foot of the bridge he wore the black robes of a dominican monk his skin was the dark brown of old mahogany he was a tall man and he held a wooden staff as tall as he was hold fast he called tell me your names and your stations i am the lady door said door i am porticos daughter of the house of the arch i am hunter i am her bodyguard richard mayhew said richard wet and you wish to pass richard stepped forward yes we do actually were here for a key the monk said nothing he lifted his staff and pushed richard gently in the chest with it richards feet slid out from under him and he landed in the muddy water the monk waited a few moments to see if richard would swing up and begin to fight richard didnt hunter did richard pulled himself up from the mud and watched mouth open as the monk and hunter fought with quarterstaves the monk was good he was bigger than hunter and richard suspected stronger hunter on the other hand was faster than the monk the wooden staves clacked and whapped in the mist the monks staff made sudden contact with hunters midriff she stumbled in the mud he came in closetoo closeas he discovered that her stumble had been a feint and her staff slammed into him hard and precisely on the backs of his knees and his legs no longer held his weight the man tumbled into the wet mud and hunter rested the tip of her staff on the back of his neck enough called a voice from the bridge hunter took a step back she stood beside richard and door once more she had not even broken a sweat the big monk got up from the mud his lip was bleeding he bowed low to hunter then walked to the foot of the bridge who are they brother sable called the voice the lady door lord porticos daughter of the house of the arch hunter her bodyguard and richard mayhew their companion said brother sable through bruised lips she bested me in fair fight brother fuliginous let them come up said the voice hunter led the way up the bridge at the apex of the bridge another monk was waiting for them brother fuliginous he was younger and smaller than the first monk they had met but he was dressed the same way his skin was a deep rich brown there were other blackclad figures just barely visible further into the yellow fog these were the black friars then richard realized the second monk stared at the three of them for a second and then recited i turn my head and you may go where you want i turn it again you will stay till you rot i have no face but i live or die by my crooked teethwho am i door took a step forward she licked her lips and half closed her eyes i turn my head she said puzzling to herself crooked teeth go where you then a smile spread over her face she stared up at brother fuliginous a key she said the answer is youre a key a wise one acknowledged brother fuliginous thats two steps taken one more to take a very old man stepped out of the yellow fog and walked cautiously toward them his gnarled hand holding onto the stone side of the bridge he stopped when he reached brother fuliginous his eyes were a glaucous bluewhite thick with cataracts richard liked him on sight how many of them are there he asked the younger man in a deep and reassuring voice three father abbot and has one of them bested the first gatekeeper yes father abbot and did one of them answer the second gatekeeper correctly yes father abbot there was regret in the old mans voice so one of them is left to face the ordeal of the key let him or her stand forward now door said oh no hunter said let me take his place i will face the ordeal brother fuliginous shook his head we cannot permit that when richard was a small boy he had been taken as part of a school trip to a local castle with his class he had climbed the many steps to the highest point in the castle a partly ruined tower they had clustered together at the top while the teacher pointed out to them the whole of the countryside spread out below even at that age richard had not been very good at heights he had clutched the safety rail and closed his eyes and tried not to look down the teacher had told them that the drop from the top of the old tower to the bottom of the hill it overlooked was three hundred feet then she told them that a penny dropped from the top of the tower would have enough force to penetrate the skull of a man at the bottom of the hill that it would crack a skull like a bullet that night richard lay in bed unable to sleep for imagining the penny falling with the power of a thunderbolt still looking like a penny but such a murderous penny when it dropped an ordeal the penny dropped for richard it was a thunderbolt sort of a penny hang on a sec he said back up mmmm ordeal someones got an ordeal waiting for them somebody who didnt have a little fight down in the mud and didnt get to answer the riddle he was babbling he could hear himself babbling and he just didnt care this ordeal of yours richard asked the abbot how much of an ordeal is it this way now said the abbot you dont want him said door take one of us three of you come there are three tests each of you faces one test that is fair said the abbot if he passes the ordeal he will return to you a light breeze eased the fog the other dark figures were holding crossbows each crossbow was pointed at richard or hunter or door the friars closed ranks cutting richard off from hunter and from door were looking for a key said richard to the abbot in a low voice yes said the abbot placidly its for an angel explained richard yes said the abbot he reached out a hand found the crook of brother fuliginouss arm richard lowered his voice look you cant say no to an angel especially a man of the cloth like yourself why dont we just skip the ordeal you could just hand it over the abbot began to walk down the curve of the bridge there was a door open at the bottom richard followed him sometimes there is nothing you can do when our order was founded said the abbot we were entrusted with the key it is one of the holiest and the most powerful of all sacred relics we must pass it on but only to the one who passes the ordeal and proves worthy they walked through winding narrow corridors richard leaving a trail of wet mud behind him if i fail the ordeal then we dont get the key do we no my son richard thought about this for a moment could i come back later for a second try brother fuliginous coughed not really my son said the abbot if that should happen you will in all probability be he paused and then said beyond caring but do not fret perhaps you will be the one to win the key eh there was a ghastly attempt at reassurance in his voice more terrifying than any attempt to scare him could have been you would kill me the abbot stared ahead with bluemilk eyes there was a touch of reproof in his voice we are holy men he said no it is the ordeal that kills you they walked down a flight of steps into a low cryptlike room with oddly decorated walls now said the abbot smile there was the electric fizz of a camera flash going off blinding richard for a moment when he could see again brother fuliginous was lowering a battered old polaroid camera and was yanking out the photograph the friar waited until it had developed and then he pinned it to the wall this is our wall of those who failed sighed the abbot to ensure that they are none of them forgotten that is our burden also memorial richard stared at the faces a few polaroids twenty or thirty other photographic snapshots some sepia prints and daguerreotypes and after that pencil sketches and watercolors and miniatures they went all the way along one wall the friars had been at this a very long time door shivered im so stupid she muttered i should have known three of us i should never have come straight here hunters head was moving from side to side she had noted the position of each of the friars and each of the crossbows she had calculated the odds of getting door over the side of the bridge first unharmed then with only minor injuries and lastly with major injury to herself but only minor injury to door she was now recalculating and what would you have done differently if you had known she asked i wouldnt have brought him here for a start said door id have found the marquis hunter put her head on one side you trust him she asked directly and door knew she was talking of de carabas not richard yes said door i more or less trust him door had been five years old for just two days the market was being held in the gardens at kew on that day and her father had taken her with him as a birthday treat it was her first market they were in the butterfly house surrounded by brightly colored wings iridescent weightless things that entranced and fascinated her when her father crouched down beside her door he said turn around slowly and look over there she turned and looked a darkskinned man wearing a big coat his black hair tied behind him in a long pony tail was standing by the door talking to two goldenskinned twins a young man and a young woman the young woman was crying in the way that grownups cry keeping it inside as much as they can and hating it when it still pushes out at the edges making them ugly and funnylooking on the way door turned back to the butterflies you saw him asked her father she nodded he calls himself the marquis de carabas he said hes a fraud and a cheat and possibly even something of a monster if youre ever in trouble go to him he will protect you girl he has to door looked back at the man he had a hand on the shoulder of each of the twins and was leading them from the room but he glanced back over his shoulder as he left and he looked straight at her and smiled an enormous smile and then he winked at her the friars who surrounded them were dark ghosts in the fog door raised her voice excuse me brother she called to brother sable but our friend whos gone to get the key if he fails what happens to us he took a step toward them hesitated and then said we escort you away from here and we let you go what about richard she asked beneath his cowl she could see him shaking his head sadly finally i should have brought the marquis said door and she wondered where he was and what he was doing the marquis de carabas was being crucified on a large xshaped wooden construction mr vandemar had knocked together from several old pallets part of a chair and a wooden gate he had also used most of a large box of rusting nails it had been a very long time since they had crucified anybody the marquis de carabass arms and legs were spread into a wide x shape rusty nails went into his hands and feet he was also roped around the waist after experiencing terrible pain he was now more or less unconscious the whole construction dangled in the air from several ropes in a room that had once been the hospital staff cafeteria on the ground below mr croup had assembled a large mound of sharp objects ranging from razors and kitchen knives to abandoned scalpels and lancets there was even a poker from the furnace room why dont you see how hes doing mister vandemar asked mr croup mr vandemar reached out his hammer and prodded the marquis experimentally with it the marquis de carabas was not a good man and he knew himself well enough to be perfectly certain that he was not a brave man he had long since decided that the world above or below was a place that wished to be deceived and to this end he had named himself from a lie in a fairy tale and created himselfhis clothes his manner his carriageas a grand joke there was a dull pain at his wrists and his feet and he was finding it harder and harder to breathe there was nothing more to be gained by feigning unconsciousness and he raised his head as best he could and spat a gob of scarlet blood into mr valdemars face it was a brave thing to do he thought and a stupid one perhaps they would have let him die quietly if he had not done that now he had no doubt they would hurt him more and perhaps his death would come the quicker for it the open kettle was boiling fiercely richard watched the bubbling water and the thick steam and wondered what they were going to do with it his imagination was able to provide any number of answers most of which would have been unimaginably painful none of which turned out to be correct the boiling water was poured into a pot to which brother fuliginous added three spoons of dried shredded leaves the resultant liquid was poured from the pot through a tea strainer into three china cups the abbot raised his blind head sniffed the air and smiled the first part of the ordeal of the key he said is the nice cup of tea do you take sugar no thank you said richard warily brother fuliginous added a little milk to the tea and passed a cup and saucer to richard is it poisoned he asked the abbot looked almost offended good gracious no richard sipped the tea which tasted more or less exactly like tea always tasted but this is part of the ordeal brother fuliginous took the abbots hands and placed a cup of tea in them in a manner of speaking said the abbot we always like to give the seekers a cup of tea before they start part of the ordeal for us not for you he sipped his own tea and a beatific smile spread across his ancient face rather nice tea all things considered richard put down his teacup almost untouched would you mind he asked if we just began the ordeal not at all said the abbot not at all he stood up and the three of them walked toward a door at the far end of the room is there richard paused trying to decide what he was trying to ask then he said is there anything you can tell me about the ordeal the abbot shook his head there really was nothing to say he led the seekers to the door and then he would wait foran hour or two in the corridor outside then he would go back in and remove the remains of the seeker from the shrine and inter it in the vaults and sometimes which was worse they would not be dead although you could not call what was left of them alive and those unfortunates the black friars cared for as best they could right said richard and he smiled unconvincingly and added well lead on macduff brother fuliginous pulled back the bolts on the door they opened with a crash like twin gunshots he pulled the door open richard stepped through it brother fuliginous pushed the door closed behind him and swung the bolts back into place he led the abbot back to his chair and placed the cup of tea back in the old mans hand the abbot sipped his tea in silence and then he said with honest regret in his voice its lay on macduff actually but i hadnt the heart to correct him he sounded like such a nice young man twelve richard mayhew walked down the underground platform it was a district line station the sign said blackfriars the platform was empty somewhere in the distance an underground train roared and rattled driving a ghostwind along the platform which scattered a copy of the tabloid sun into its component pages fourcolor breasts and blackandwhite invective scurrying and tumbling off the platform and down onto the rails richard walked the length of the platform then he sat down on a bench and waited for something to happen nothing happened he rubbed his head and felt slightly sick there were footsteps on the platform near him and he looked up to see a prim little girl walking past him hand in hand with a woman who looked like a larger older version of the girl they glanced at him and then rather obviously looked away dont get too near to him melanie advised the woman in a very audible whisper melanie looked at richard staring in the way children stare without embarrassment or self consciousness then she looked back at her mother why do people like that stay alive she asked curiously not enough guts to end it all explained her mother melanie risked another glance at richard pathetic she said their feet pattered away down the platform and soon they were gone he wondered if he had imagined it he tried to remember why he was standing on this platform was he waiting for a tube train where was he going he knew the answer was somewhere in his head somewhere close at hand but he could not touch it could not bring it back from the lost places he sat there alone and wondering was he dreaming with his hands he felt the hard red plastic seat beneath him stamped the platform with mudencrusted shoes touched his face no this was no dream wherever he was was real he felt odd detached and depressed and horribly strangely saddened someone sat down next to him richard did not look up did not turn his head hello said a familiar voice how are you dick you all right richard looked up he felt his face creasing into a smile hope hitting him like a blow to the chest gary he asked scared then you can see me gary grinned you always were a kidder he said funny man funny gary was wearing a suit and tie he was cleanshaven and had not a hair out of place richard realized what he must look like muddy unshaven rumpled gary i listen i know what i must look like i can explain he thought for a moment no i cant not really its okay said gary reassuringly his voice was soothing sane not sure how to tell you this bit awkward he paused look he explained im not really here yes you are said richard gary shook his head sympathetically no he said im not im you talking to yourself richard wondered vaguely if this was one of garys jokes maybe this will help said gary he raised his hands to his face pushed at it molded shaped his face oozed like warm silly putty is that better said the person who had been gary in a voice that was jarringly familiar richard knew the new face he had shaved it most weekday mornings since he had left school he had brushed its teeth combed its hair and on occasion wished it looked more like tom cruises or john lennons or anyone elses really it was of course his face youre sitting on blackfriars station at rush hour said the other richard casually youre talking to yourself and you know what they say about people who talk to themselves its just that youre starting to edge a little closer to sanity now the damp muddy richard stared into the face of the clean welldressed richard and he said i dont know who you are or what youre trying to do but you arent even very convincing you dont really look like me he was lying and he knew it his other self smiled encouragingly and shook his head im you richard he said im whatevers left of your sanity it was not the embarrassing echo of his voice he heard on answering machines on tapes and home videos that horrid parody of a voice that passed for his the man spoke with richards true voice the voice he heard in his head when he spoke resonant and real concentrate shouted the man with richards face look at this place try to see the people try to see the truth youre already the closest to reality that youve been in a week this is bullshit said richard flatly desperately he shook his head denying everything his other self was saying but still he looked at the platform wondering what it was he was meant to be seeing then something flickered at the corner of his vision he followed it with his head but it was gone look whispered his double see see what he was standing on an empty dimly lit station platform a lonely mausoleum of a place and then the noise and the light struck him like a bottle across the face he was standing on blackfriars station in the middle of the rush hour people bustled by him a riot of noise and light of shoving moving humanity there was an underground train waiting at the platform and reflected in its window richard could see himself he looked crazy he had a weeks growth of beard food was crusted around his mouth one eye had recently been blackened and a boil an angry red carbuncle was coming up on the side of his nose he was filthy covered in a black encrusted dirt which filled his pores and lived under his fingernails his eyes were red and bleary his hair was matted and snarled he was a crazy homeless person standing on a platform of a busy underground station in the heart of the rush hour richard buried his face deep in his hands when he raised his face the other people were gone the platform was dark again and he was alone he sat down on a bench and closed his eyes a hand found his hand held it for some moments and then squeezed it a womans hand he could smell a familiar perfume the other richard sat on his left and now jessica sat on his right holding his hand in hers looking at him compassionately he had never seen that expression on her face before jess he said jessica shook her head she let go of his hand im afraid not she said im still you but you have to listen darling youre the closest to reality youve been you people keep saying the closest to reality the closest to sanity i dont know what you he paused something came back to him then he looked at the other version of himself at the woman he had loved is this part of the ordeal he demanded ordeal asked jessica she exchanged a concerned glance with theotherrichardwhowasnthim yes ordeal with the black friars who live under london richard said as he said it it became more real theres a key i have to get for this angel called islington if i get him the key hell send me home again his mouth dried up and he could talk no longer listen to yourself said the other richard gently cant you tell how ridiculous all this sounds jessica looked as if she were trying not to cry her eyes glistened youre not going through an ordeal richard youyou had some kind of nervous breakdown a couple of weeks ago i think you just cracked up i broke off our engagementyoud been acting so strangely it was like you were a different person ii couldnt cope then you vanished the tears began to run down her cheeks and she stopped talking to blow her nose on a tissue the other richard began to speak i wandered alone and crazy through the streets of london sleeping under bridges eating food from garbage cans shivering and lost and alone muttering to myself talking to people who werent there im so sorry richard said jessica she was crying now her face contorted and unattractive her mascara was beginning to run and her nose was red he had never seen her hurting before and he realized how much he wanted to take her pain away richard reached out for her to try to hold her to comfort and reassure her but the world slid and twisted and changed someone stumbled into him cursed and walked away richard was lying prone on the platform in the rushhour glare the side of his face was sticky and cold he pulled his head up off the ground he had been lying in a pool of his own vomit at least he hoped it was his own passersby stared at him with revulsion or after one flick of the eyes did not look at him again he wiped at his face with his hands and tried to get up but he could no longer remember how richard began to whimper he shut his eyes tightly and he kept them shut when he opened them thirty seconds or an hour or a day later the platform was in semidarkness he climbed to his feet there was nobody there hello he called help me please gary was sitting on the bench watching him what you still need someone to tell you what to do gary got up and walked over to where richard was standing richard he said urgently im you the only advice i can give you is what youre telling yourself only maybe youre too scared to listen you arent me said richard but he no longer believed it touch me said gary richard reached a hand out his hand pushed into garys face squashing and distorting it as if it were pushing into warm bubble gum richard felt nothing in the air around his hand he pulled his fingers out of garys face see said gary im not here all there is is you walking up and down the platform talking to yourself trying to get up the courage to richard had not meant to say anything but his mouth moved and he heard his voice saying trying to get up the courage to do what a deep voice came over the loudspeaker and echoed distorted down the platform london transport would like to apologize for the delay this is due to an incident at blackfriars station to do that said gary inclining his head become an incident at blackfriars station to end it all your lifes a joyless loveless empty sham youve got no friends ive got you whispered richard gary appraised richard with frank eyes i think youre an asshole he said honestly a complete joke ive got door and hunter and anaesthesia gary smiled there was real pity in the smile and it hurt richard more than hatred or enmity could ever have done more imaginary friends we all used to laugh at you round the office for those trolls remember them on your desk he laughed richard started to laugh too it was all too horrible there was nothing else to do but laugh after some time he stopped laughing gary put his hand into his pocket and produced a small plastic troll it had frizzy purple hair and it had once sat on the top of richards computer screen here said gary he tossed the troll to richard richard tried to catch it he reached out his hands but it fell through them as if they were not there he went down onto his hands and knees on the empty platform fumbling for the troll it seemed to him then as if it were the only fragment he had of his real life that if he could only get the troll back perhaps he could get everything back flash it was rush hour again a train disgorged hundreds of people onto the platform and hundreds of others tried to get on and richard was down on his hands and knees being kicked and buffeted by the commuters somebody stepped on his fingers hard he screamed shrilly and stuck his fingers into his mouth instinctively like a burned child they tasted disgusting he did not care he could see the troll at the platforms edge now only ten feet away and he crawled slowly on all fours through the crowd across the platform people swore at him they got in his way they buffeted him he had never imagined that ten feet could be such a long distance to travel richard heard a highpitched voice giggling as he crawled and he wondered who it could belong to it was a disturbing giggle nasty and strange he wondered what manner of crazy person could giggle like that he swallowed and the giggling stopped and then he knew he was almost at the edge of the platform an elderly woman stepped onto the train and as she did so her foot knocked the purplehaired troll down into the darkness down into the gap between the train and the platform no said richard he was still laughing an awkward wheezing laugh but tears stung his eyes and spilled down his cheeks he rubbed his eyes with his hands making them sting even more flash the platform was deserted and dark again he climbed to his feet and walked unsteadily the last few feet to the edge of the platform he could see it there down on the tracks by the third rail a small splash of purple his troll he looked ahead of him there were enormous posters stuck to the wall on the other side of the tracks the posters advertised credit cards and sports shoes and holidays in cyprus as he looked the words on the posters twisted and mutated new messages end it all was one of them put yourself out of your misery be a mando yourself in have a fatal accident today he nodded he was talking to himself the posters did not really say that yes he was talking to himself and it was time that he listened he could hear the rattling of a train not far away coming toward the station richard clenched his teeth and swayed back and forth as if he were still being buffeted by commuters although he was alone on the platform the train was coming toward him its headlights shining out from the tunnel like the eyes of a monstrous dragon in a childhood nightmare and he understood then just how little effort it would take to make the pain stopto take all the pain he ever had had all the pain he ever would have and make it all go away for ever and ever he pushed his hands deep into his pockets and took a deep breath it would be so easy a moment of pain and then it would all be over and done there was something in his pocket he felt it with his fingers something smooth and hard and roughly spherical he pulled it out of his pocket and examined it a quartz bead he remembered picking it up then he had been on the far side of nights bridge the bead had been part of anaesthesias necklace and from somewhere in his head or out of it he thought he heard the ratgirl say richard hold on he did not know if there was anyone helping him at that moment he suspected that he was truly talking to himself that this was the real him speaking and he was finally listening he nodded and put the bead back into his pocket and he stood on the platform and waited for the train to come in it arrived at the platform slowed came to a full stop the train doors hissed open the carriage was filled with every manner and kind of people all of whom were unmistakably quite dead there were fresh corpses with ragged cuts in their throats or bullet holes in their temples there were old desiccated bodies there were straphanging cadavers covered with cobwebs and cancerous things lolling in their seats each corpse seemed as much as one could tell to have died by its own hand some were male and some were female richard thought he had seen some of those faces pinned to a long wall but he could no longer remember where he had seen them could not remember when the carriage smelled like a morgue might at the end of a long hot summer during the course of which the refrigeration equipment had failed for good richard had no idea who he was anymore no idea what was or what was not true nor whether he was brave or cowardly mad or sane but he knew the next thing he had to do he stepped onto the train and all the lights went out the bolts were drawn back two loud bangs echoed through the room the door to the tiny shrine was pushed open letting in lamplight from the hall outside it was a small room with a high arched ceiling a silver key hung from a thread attached to the highest point of the ceiling the wind caused by the opening of the door made the key swing back and forth and then spin slowly first one way and then the other the abbot held brother fuliginouss arm and the two men walked into the shrine side by side then the abbot let go of the brothers arm and said take the body brother fuliginous but but father what is it brother fuliginous went down on one knee the abbot could hear fingers against cloth and skin hes not dead the abbot sighed it was an evil thing to think he knew but he honestly felt it was so much kinder if they died outright this was so much worse one of those eh he said ah well we will look after the poor creature until it passes on to its ultimate reward lead it to the infirmary and a weak voice said quietly but firmly i am not a poor creature the abbot heard someone stand up heard brother fuliginouss sharp intake of breath i i think i got through it said richard mayhews voice suddenly uncertain unless this is more of the ordeal no my son said the abbot there was something in his voice that might have been awe and might have been regret there was silence i i think i will have that cup of tea now if you dont mind said richard of course said the abbot this way richard stared at the old man the glaucous eyes gazed out at nothing at all he seemed pleased that richard was alive but excuse me said brother fuliginous respectfully to richard breaking his train of thought dont forget your key oh yes thanks he had forgotten about the key he reached out and closed his hand upon the cold silver key rotating slowly on its thread he rugged and the thread snapped easily richard opened his hand and the key stared up at him from his palm by my crooked teeth asked richard remembering who am i he put it into his pocket next to the small quartz bead and together they left that place the fog had begun to thin hunter was pleased she was confident now that should it become necessary she could get the lady door away from the friars entirely unharmed and get herself away with only minor flesh wounds there was a flurry of movement on the far side of the bridge somethings happening said hunter to door under her breath get ready to make a run for it the friars drew back richard mayhew the upworlder came toward them through the fog walking beside the abbot richard looked different somehow hunter scrutinized him trying to work out what had changed his center of balance had moved lower become more centered no it was more than that he looked less boyish he looked as if he had begun to grow up still alive then said hunter he nodded put his hand into his pocket and pulled out a silver key he tossed it to door who caught it then flung herself at him wrapping her arms around him squeezing him as tightly as she could then door let go of richard and ran to the abbot i cant tell you how much this means to us she said to him he smiled weakly but graciously may the temple and the arch be with you all on your journey through the underside he said door curtseyed and then clutching the key tightly in her hand she went back to richard and to hunter the three travelers walked down the bridge and away the friars stood on the bridge until they were out of sight lost in the old fog of the world beneath the world we have lost the key said the abbot to himself as much as to any of them god help us all thirteen the angel islington was dreaming a dark and rushing dream huge waves were rising and crashing over the city the night sky was rent with forks of white lightning from horizon to horizon the rain fell in sheets the city trembled fires started near the great amphitheater and spread quickly through the city defying the storm islington was looking down on everything from far above hovering in the air as one hovers in dreams as it had hovered in those longago times there were buildings in that city that were many hundreds of feet high but they were dwarfed by the graygreen atlantic waves and then it heard the people scream there were four million people in atlantis and in its dream islington heard each and every one of their voices clearly and distinctly as one by one they screamed and choked and burned and drowned and died the waves swallowed the city and at length the storm subsided when dawn broke there was nothing to indicate there had ever been a city there at all let alone an island twice the size of greece nothing of atlantis remained but the waterbloated bodies of children of women and of men floating on the cold morning waves bodies the seagulls gray and white were already beginning to pick with their cruel beaks and islington woke it was standing in the octagon of iron pillars beside the great black door made of flint and tarnished silver it touched the cold smoothness of the flint the chill of the metal it touched the table it ran its finger lightly along the walls then it walked through chambers of its hall one after another touching things as if to reassure itself of their existence to convince itself it was here and now it followed patterns as it walked smooth channels its bare feet had worn over the centuries in the rock it stopped when it reached the rockpool kneeling down and letting its fingers touch the cold water there was a ripple in the water which began with its fingertips and echoed out to the edges the reflections in the pool of the angel itself and the candle flames that framed it shimmered and transformed it was looking into a cellar the angel concentrated for a moment it could hear a telephone ring somewhere in the distance mr croup walked over to the telephone and picked up the receiver he looked rather pleased with himself croup and vandemar he barked eyes gouged noses twisted tongues pierced chins cleft throats slit mister croup said the angel they now have the key i want the girl called door kept safe on her journey back to me safe repeated mr croup unimpressed right well keep her safe what a marvelous ideasuch originality positively astounding most people would be content with hiring assassins for executions sly killings vile murders even only you sir would hire the two finest cutthroats in the whole of space and time and then ask them to ensure a little girl remains unharmed see that she is mister croup nothing is to hurt her permit her to be harmed in any way and you will displease me deeply do you understand yes croup shifted uncomfortably is there anything else asked islington yes sir croup coughed into his hand do you remember the marquis de carabas of course i take it that there is no such similar prohibition on extirpating the marquis not any longer said the angel just protect the girl it removed its hand from the water the reflection was now merely candle flames and an angel of astonishing perfectly androgynous beauty the angel islington stood up and returned to its inner chambers to await its eventual visitors what did he say asked mr vandemar he said mister vandemar that we should feel free to do whatsoever we wished to the marquis vandemar nodded did that include killing him painfully he asked a little pedantically yes mister vandemar i would say on reflection it did thats good mister croup wouldnt like another tellingoff he looked up at the bloody thing hanging above them better get rid of the body then one of the front wheels on the supermarket shopping cart squeaked and it had a pronounced tendency to pull to the left mr vandemar had found the metal cart on a grassedin traffic island near the hospital it was he had realized on seeing it just the right size for moving a body he could have carried the body of course but then it could have bled on him or dripped other fluids and he only had the one suit so he pushed the shopping cart with the body of the marquis de carabas in it through the storm drain and the cart went squee squee and pulled to the left he wished that mr croup would push the shopping cart for a change but mr croup was talking you know mister vandemar he was saying i am currently too overjoyed too delighted not to mention too utterly and illimitably ecstatic to grouse gripe or grumblehaving finally been permitted to do what we do best mr vandemar negotiated a particularly awkward corner kill someone you mean he asked mr croup beamed kill someone i mean indeed mister vandemar brave soul glittering noble fellow however by now you must have sensed a lurking but skulking beneath my happy blithe and chipper exterior a minuscule vexation like the teeniest lump of raw liver sticking to the inside of my boot you must i have no doubt be saying to yourself all is not well in mister croups breast i shall induce him to unburden himself to me mr vandemar pondered this while he forced open the round iron door between the storm drain and the sewer and clambered through then he manhandled the wire cart with the marquis de carabass body through the doorway and then more or less certain that he had been thinking nothing of the sort he said no mr croup ignored this and continued and were i then in response to your pleadings to divulge to you what vexes me i would confess that my soul is irked by the necessity to hide our light under a bushel we should be hanging the former marquiss sad remains from the highest gibbet in london below not tossing it away like a used he paused searching for the exact simile rat suggested mr vandemar thumbscrew spleen squee squee went the wheels of the shopping cart ah well said mr croup in front of them was a deep channel of brown water drifting on the waters surface were offwhite suds of foam used condoms and occasional fragments of toilet paper mr vandemar stopped the shopping cart mr croup leaned down and picked up the marquiss head by the hair hissing into its dead ear the sooner this business is over and done with the happier ill be theres other times and other places that would properly appreciate two pair of dab hands with the garrotting wire and the boning knife then he stood up goodnight good marquis dont forget to write mr vandemar tipped over the cart and the marquiss corpse tumbled out and splashed into the brown water below them and then because he had come to dislike it intensely mr vandemar pushed the shopping cart into the sewer as well and watched the current carry it away then mr croup held his lamp up high and he stared out at the place in which they stood it is saddening to reflect said mr croup that there are folk walking the streets above who will never know the beauty of these sewers mister vandemar these redbrick cathedrals beneath their feet craftsmanship agreed mr vandemar they turned their backs on the brown water and made their way back into the tunnels with cities as with people mister vandemar said mr croup fastidiously the condition of the bowels is allimportant door tied the key around her neck with a piece of string that she found in one of the pockets of her leather jacket thats not going to be safe said richard the girl made a face at him well he said its not she shrugged okay she said ill get a chain for it when we get to the market they were walking through a maze of caves deep tunnels hacked from the limestone that seemed almost prehistoric richard chuckled whats so funny door asked he grinned i was just thinking of the expression on the marquiss face when we tell him we got the key from the friars without his help im sure hell have something sardonic to say about it she said and then back to the angel by the long and dangerous way whatever that is richard admired the paintings on the cave walls russets and ochres and siennas outlined charging boars and fleeing gazelles woolly mastodons and giant sloths he imagined that the paintings had to be thousands of years old but then they turned a corner and he noticed that in the same style there were lorries house cats cars andmarkedly inferior to the other images as if only glimpsed infrequently and from a long way awayairplanes none of the paintings were very high off the ground he wondered if the painters were a race of subterranean neanderthal pygmies it was as likely as anything else in this strange world so where is the next market he asked no idea said door hunter hunter slipped out of the shadows i dont know a small figure dashed past them going back the way they had come a few moments later another couple of tiny figures came toward them in fell pursuit hunter whipped out a hand as they passed snagging a small boy by the ear ow he said in the manner of small boys let me go she stole my paintbrush thats right said a piping voice from further down the corridor she did i didnt came an even higher and more piping voice from even further down the corridor hunter pointed to the paintings on the cave wall you did these she asked the boy had the towering arrogance only seen in the greatest of artists and all nineyearold boys yeah he said truculently some of them not bad said hunter the boy glared at her wheres the next floating market asked door belfast said the boy tonight thanks said door hope you get your paintbrush back let him go hunter hunter let go of the boys ear he did not move he looked her up and down then made a face to indicate that he was without any question at all unimpressed youre hunter he asked she smiled down at him modestly he sniffed youre the best bodyguard in the underside so they tell me the boy reached one hand back and forward again in one smooth movement he stopped puzzled and opened his hand examined his palm then he looked up at hunter confused hunter opened her hand to reveal a small switchblade with a wicked edge she held it up out of the boys reach he wrinkled his nose howd you do that scram said hunter she closed the knife and tossed it back to the boy who took off down the corridor without a backward glance in pursuit of his paintbrush the body of the marquis de carabas drifted east through the deep sewer face down londons sewers had begun their lives as rivers and streams flowing north to south carrying garbage animal carcasses and the contents of chamber pots into the thames which would for the most part carry the offending substances out to sea this system had more or less worked for many years until in the enormous volume of effluent produced by the people and industries of london combined with a rather hot summer produced a phenomenon known at the time as the great stink the thames itself had become an open sewer people who could leave london left it the ones who stayed wrapped cloths doused in carbolic around their faces and tried not to breathe through their noses parliament was forced to recess early in arid the following year it ordered that a programme of sewerbuilding begin the thousands of miles of sewers that were built were constructed with a gentle slope from the west to the east and somewhere beyond greenwich they were pumped into the thames estuary and the sewage was swept off into the north sea it was this journey that the body of the late marquis de carabas was making traveling west to east toward the sunrise and the sewage works rats on a high brick ledge doing the things that rats do when no people are watching saw the body go by the largest of them a big black male chittered a smaller brown female chittered back then she leapt down from the ledge onto the marquiss back and rode it down the sewer a little way sniffing at the hair and the coat tasting the blood and then precariously leaning over and scrutinizing what could be seen of the face she hopped off the head into the filthy water and swam industriously to the side where she clambered up the slippery brickwork she hurried back a long a beam and rejoined her companions belfast asked richard door smiled impishly and would say nothing more than youll see when he pressed her about it he changed his tack how do you know that kid was telling you the truth about the market he asked its not something anyone down here ever lies about i dont think we can lie about it she paused the markets special how did that kid know where it was someone told him said hunter richard brooded on this for a moment how did they know someone told them explained door but he wondered who chose the locations in the first place how the knowledge was spread trying to frame the question in such a way that he did not sound stupid a rich female voice asked from the darkness hss any idea when the next market is she stepped into the light she wore silver jewelry and her dark hair was perfectly coifed she was very pale and her long dress was jet black velvet richard knew immediately that he had seen her before but it took him a few moments to place her the first floating market that was itin harrods she had smiled at him tonight said hunter belfast thank you said the woman she had the most amazing eyes thought richard they were the color of foxgloves ill see you there she said and she looked at richard as she said it then she looked away a little shyly she stepped into the shadows and she was gone who was that asked richard they call themselves velvets said door they sleep down here during the day and walk the upworld at night are they dangerous asked richard everybodys dangerous said hunter look said richard going back to the market who decides where it gets held and when and how do the first people find out where its being held hunter shrugged door he asked ive never thought about it they turned a corner door held up her lamp not bad at all said door and fast too said hunter she touched the painting on the rock wall with her fingertip the paint was still wet it was a painting of hunter and door and richard it was not flattering the black rat entered the lair of the golden deferentially his head lowered ears back he crawled forward squeeing and chittering the golden had made their lair in a pile of bones this pile of bones had once belonged to a woolly mammoth back in the cold times when the great hairy beasts walked across the snowy tundra of the south of england as if in the opinion of the golden they owned the place this particular mammoth at least had been disabused of that idea rather thoroughly and quite terminally by the golden the black rat made its obeisance at the base of the bone pile then he lay on his back with his throat exposed closed his eyes and waited after a while a chittering from above told him that he could roll over one of the golden crawled out of the mammoth skull on top of the heap of bones it crawled along the old ivory tusk a goldenfurred rat with coppercolored eyes the size of a large house cat the black rat spoke the golden thought briefly and chattered an order the black rat rolled on his back exposing his throat again for a moment then a twist and a wriggle and he was on his way there had been sewer folk before the great stink of course living in the elizabethan sewers or the restoration sewers or the regency sewers as more and more of londons waterways were forced into pipes and covered passages as the expanding population produced more filth more rubbish more effluent but after the great stink after the great plan of victorian sewerbuilding that was when the sewer folk came into their own they could be found anywhere in the length and breadth of the sewers but they made their permanent homes in some of the churchlike redbrick vaults toward the east at the confluence of many of the churning foamy waters there they would sit rods and nets and improvised hooks beside them and watch the surface of the brown water they wore clothesbrown and green clothes covered in a thick layer of something that might have been mold and might have been a petrochemical ooze and might conceivably have been something much worse they wore their hair long and matted they smelled more or less as one would imagine old storm lanterns were hung about the tunnel nobody knew what the sewer folk used for fuel but their lanterns burned with a rather noxious blueandgreen flame it was not known how the sewer folk communicated among themselves in their few dealings with the outside world they used a kind of sign language they lived in a world of gurgles and drips the men the women and the silent little sewer children dunnikin spotted something in the water he was the chief of the sewer folk the wisest and the oldest he knew the sewers better than their original builders did dunnikin reached for a long shrimping net one practiced hand movement and he was fishing out a rather bedraggled mobile telephone from the water he walked over to a small heap of rubbish in the corner and put the telephone down with the rest of their haul the days catch so far consisted of two odd gloves a shoe a cat skull a sodden packet of cigarettes an artificial leg a dead cocker spaniel a pair of antlers and the bottom half of a baby carriage it had not been a good day and tonight was a market night in the open air so dunnikin kept his eyes on the water you never knew what would turn up old bailey was hanging his wash out to dry blankets and sheets fluttered and blew in the wind on the top of centre point the ugly and distinctive sixties skyscraper that marks the eastern end of oxford street far above tottenham court road station old bailey did not care very much for centre point itself but as hed often tell the birds the view from the top was without compare and furthermore the top of centre point was one of the few places in the west end of london where you did not have to look at centre point itself the wind ripped feathers from old baileys coat and blew them away off over london he did not mind as he also often told his birds there were more where those came from a large black rat crawled out through a ripped airvent cover looked around then came over to old baileys birdspattered tent it ran up the side of the tent then along the top of old baileys washing line it squealed at him urgently slower slower said old bailey the rat repeated itself at a lower pitch but just as urgently bless me said old bailey he ran into his tent and returned with weaponshis toasting fork and a coal shovel then he hurried back into the tent again and came out with some bargaining tools and then he walked back into the tent for the last time and opened his wooden chest and pocketed the silver box i really dont have time for this tomfoolery he told the rat on his final exit from the tent im a very busy man birds dont catch themselves yknow the rat squeaked at him old bailey was unfastening the coil of rope around his middle well he told the rat theres others could get the body im not as young as i was i dont like the underplaces im a roofman i am born and bred the rat made a rude noise more haste less speed replied old bailey im goin young whippersnapper i knew your greatgreatgrandfather young fellermerat so dont you try putting on airs now wheres the market going to be the rat told him then old bailey put the rat in his pocket and climbed over the side of the building sitting on the ledge beside the sewer in his plastic lawn chair dunnikin was overcome by a presentiment of wealth and prosperity he could feel it drifting from west to east toward them he clapped his hands loudly other men ran to him and the women and the children seizing hooks and nets and lines as they did so they assembled along the slippery sewer ledge in the sputtering green light of their lanterns dunnikin pointed and they waited in silence which is how the sewer folk wait the body of the marquis de carabas came floating facedown along the sewer the current carrying him as slow and stately as a funeral barge they pulled it in with their hooks and their nets in silence and soon had it up on the ledge they removed the coat the boots the gold pocketwatch and the contents of the coat pockets although they left the rest of the clothes on the corpse dunnikin beamed at the loot he clapped again and the sewer folk began to ready themselves for the market now they truly had something of value to sell are you sure the marquis will be at the market richard asked door as the path began slowly to climb he wont let us down she said as confidently as she could im sure hell be there fourteen hms belfast is a gunship of tons commissioned in which saw active service in the second world war since then it has been moored on the south bank of the thames in postcardland between tower bridge and london bridge opposite the tower of london from its deck one can see st pauls cathedral and the gilt top of the columnlike monument to the great fire of london erected as so much of london was erected by christopher wren the ship serves as a floating museum as a memorial as a training ground there is a walkway onto the ship from the shore and they came down the walkway in their twos and threes and in their dozens they set up their stalls as early as they could all the tribes of london below united both by the market truce and by a mutual desire to pitch their own stalls as far as possible from the sewer folks stall it had been agreed well over a century before that the sewer folk could only set up a stall at those markets held in the open air dunnikin and his folk dumped their booty in a large pile on a rubber sheet beneath a large gun tower nobody ever came to the sewer folks stall immediately but toward the end of the market they would come the bargain hunters the curious and those few fortunate individuals blessed with no sense of smell richard and hunter and door pushed their way through the crowds on the deck richard realized that he had somehow lost the need to stop and stare the people here were no less strange than at the last floating market but he supposed he was every bit as strange to them wasnt he he looked around scanning the faces in the crowd as they walked hunting for the marquiss ironic smile i dont see him he said they were approaching a smiths stall where a man who could easily have passed for a small mountain if one were to overlook the shaggy brown beard tossed a lump of redmolten metal from a brazier onto an anvil richard had never seen a real anvil before he could feel the heat from the molten metal and the brazier from a dozen feet away keep looking de carabasll turn up said door looking behind them like a bad penny she thought for a moment and added what exactly is a bad penny anyway and then before richard could answer she squealed hammersmith the bearded mountainman looked up stopped hitting the molten metal and roared by the temple and the arch lady door then he picked her up as if she weighed no more than a mouse hello hammersmith said door i hoped youd be here never miss a market lady he thundered cheerfully then he confided like an explosion with a secret thiss where the business is ysee now he said recollecting the cooling lump of metal on his anvil just you wait here a moment he put door down at eye level on the top of his booth seven feet above the deck he banged the lump of metal with his hammer twisting it as he did so with implements richard assumed correctly were tongs under the hammer blows it changed from a shapeless blob of orange metal into a perfect black rose it was a work of astonishing delicacy each petal perfect and distinct hammersmith dipped the rose into a bucket of cold water beside the anvil it hissed and steamed then he pulled it out of the bucket wiped it and handed it to a fat man in chain mail who was standing patiently to one side the fat man professed himself well satisfied and gave hammersmith in return a green plastic marks and spencer shopping bag filled with various kinds of cheese hammersmith said door from her perch these are my friends hammersmith enveloped richards hand in one several sizes up his handshake was enthusiastic but very gentle as if he had in the past had a number of accidents shaking hands and had practiced it until he got it right charmed he boomed richard said richard hammersmith looked delighted richard fine name i had a horse called richard he let go of richards hand turned to hunter and said and you are hunter hunter as i live breathe and defecate it is hammersmith blushed like a schoolboy he spat on his hand and attempted awkwardly to plaster his hair back then he stuck his hand out and realized that he had just spat on it and he wiped it on his leather apron and shifted his weight from foot to foot hammersmith said hunter with a perfect caramel smile hammersmith asked door will you help me down he looked shamefaced beg pardon lady he said and lifted her down it came to richard then that hammersmith had known door as a small child and he found himself feeling unaccountably jealous of the huge man now hammersmith was saying to door what can i do for you couple of things she said but first of all she turned to richard richard ive got a job for you hunter raised an eyebrow for him door nodded for both of you will you go and find us some food please richard felt oddly proud he had proved himself in the ordeal he was one of them he would go and he would bring back food he puffed out his chest i am your bodyguard i stay by your side said hunter door grinned her eyes flashed in the market its okay hunter market truce holds no ones going to touch me here and richard needs looking after more than i do richard deflated but no one was watching and what if someone violates the truce asked hunter hammersmith shivered despite the heat of his brazier violate the market truce brrrr its not going to happen go on both of you curry please and get me some papadums please spicy ones hunter ran her hand through her hair then she turned and walked off into the crowd and richard went with her so what would happen if someone violated market truce asked richard as they pushed through the crowds hunter thought about this for a moment the last time it happened was about three hundred years ago a couple of friends got into an argument over a woman in the market a knife was pulled and one of them died the other fled what happened to him was he killed hunter shook her head quite the opposite he still wishes he had been the one to have died hes still alive hunter pursed her lips ish she said after a while aliveish a moment passed then phew richard thought he was going to be ill whats thatthat stink sewer folk richard averted his head and tried not to breathe through his nose until they were well away from the sewer folks stall any sign of the marquis yet he asked hunter shook her head she could have reached out her hand and touched him they went up a gangplank toward the food stalls and more welcoming aromas old bailey found the sewer folk with little difficulty following his nose he knew what he had to do and he took a certain pleasure in making a bit of a performance of it ostentatiously examining the dead cocker spaniel the artificial leg and the damp and moldy portable telephone and shaking his head dolorously at each of them then he made a point of noticing the marquiss body he scratched his nose he put on his spectacles and peered at it he nodded to himself glumly hoping to give the vague impression of being a man in need of a corpse who was disappointed by the selection but was going to have to make do with what they had then he beckoned to dunnikin and pointed to the corpse dunnikin opened his hands wide smiled beatifically and gazed up toward the heavens conveying the bliss with which the marquiss remains had entered their life he put a hand to his forehead lowered it and looked devastated in order to convey the tragedy that losing such a remarkable corpse would be old bailey put a hand in his pocket and produced a halfused stick of deodorant he handed it to dunnikin who squinted at it licked it and handed it back unimpressed old bailey pocketed it he looked back at the corpse of the marquis de carabas halfdressed barefoot still damp from its journey through the sewers the body was ashen drained of blood from many cuts small and large and the skin was wrinkled and prunelike from its time in the water then he pulled out a bottle threequarters filled with a yellow liquid and passed it to dunnikin dunnikin looked at it suspiciously the sewer folk know what a bottle of chanel no looks like and they gathered around dunnikin staring carefully selfimportantly he unscrewed the top of the bottle and dabbed the tiniest amount on his wrist then with a gravity the finest parisian parfumier would have envied dunnikin sniffed then he nodded his head enthusiastically and approached old bailey to embrace him and conclude the deal the old man averted his face and held his breath until the embrace was concluded old bailey held up one finger and tried his best to mime that he was not so young as once he was and that dead or not the marquis de carabas was a bit on the heavy side dunnikin picked his nose thoughtfully and then with a hand gesture indicating not only magnanimity but also a foolish and misplaced generosity that would obviously send him dunnikin and the rest of the sewer folk to the poorhouse he had one of the younger sewer folk tie the corpse to the bottom half of the old baby carriage the old roofman covered the body with a cloth and he pulled it away from the sewer folk across the crowded deck one portion of vegetable curry please said richard to the woman at the curry stall and um i was wondering the meat curry what kind of meat is it then the woman told him oh said richard right um better just make that vegetable curries all round hello again said a rich voice beside him it was the pale woman they had met in the caves with the black dress and the foxglove eyes hullo said richard with a smile oh and some papadums please you um here for curry she fixed him with her violet gaze and said in mock bela lugosi i do not eat curry and then she laughed a lavish delighted laugh and richard found himself realizing how long it had been since he had shared a joke with a woman oh um richard richard mayhew he stuck out his hand she touched it with her own hand in something a little like a handshake her fingers were very cold but then late at night at the end of autumn on a ship out on the thames everything is very cold lamia she said im a velvet ah he said right are there a lot of you a few she said richard collected the containers with the curry what do you do he asked when im not looking for food she said with a smile im a guide i know every inch of the underside hunter who richard could have sworn had been over on the other side of the stall was standing next to lamia she said hes not yours lamia smiled sweetly ill be the judge of that she said richard said hunter this is lamia shes a velcro velvet corrected lamia sweetly shes a guide ill take you wherever you want to go hunter took the bag with the food in it from richard time to go back she said well said richard if were off to see the youknowwhat maybe she could help hunter said nothing instead she looked at richard had she looked at him that way the day before he would have dropped the subject but that was then lets see what door thinks said richard any sign of the marquis not yet said hunter old bailey had dragged the corpse down the gangplank tied to its baby carriagebase like a ghastly guy fawkes one of the effigies that not so very long ago the children of london had wheeled and dragged around in early november displaying to passersby before tossing them to their flaming demise on the bonfires of the fifth of november bonfire night he pulled the corpse over tower bridge and muttering and complaining he hauled it up the hill past the tower of london he made his way west toward tower hill station and stopped a little before the station beside a large gray jut of wall it wasnt a roof thought old bailey but it would do it was one of the last remnants of the london wall the london wall according to tradition was built on the orders of the roman emperor constantine the great in the third century ad at the request of his mother helena at that point london was one of the few great cities of the empire that did not yet have a magnificent wall when it was finished it enclosed the small city completely it was thirty feet high and eight feet wide and was unarguably the london wall it was no longer thirty feet high the ground level having risen since constantines mothers day and it no longer enclosed the city but it was still an imposing lump of wall old bailey nodded vigorously to himself he fastened a length of rope to the baby carriage and he scrambled up the wall then grunting and blessmeing he hauled the marquis up to the top of the wall he untied the body from the carriage wheels and laid it gently out on its back arms at its side there were wounds on the body that were still oozing it was very dead you stupid bugger whispered old bailey sadly what did you want to get yourself killed for anyway the moon was bright and small and high in the cold night and autumn constellations speckled the blueblack sky like the dust of crushed diamonds a nightingale fluttered onto the wall examined the corpse of the marquis de carabas and chirruped sweetly none of your beak said old bailey gruffly you birds dont smell like flipping roses neither the bird chirped a melodious nightingale obscenity at him and flew off into the night old bailey reached into his pocket and pulled out the black rat who had gone to sleep it stared about it sleepily then yawned displaying a vast and ratty expanse of piebald tongue personally said old bailey to the black rat ill be happy if i never smell anything ever again he put it down by his feet on the stones of london wall and it chittered at him and gestured with its front paws old bailey sighed carefully he took the silver box out of his pocket and from an inner pocket he pulled the toasting fork he placed the silver box on de carabass chest then nervously he reached out the toasting fork and flipped open the lid of the box inside the silver box on a nest of red velvet was a large ducks egg pale blue green in the moonlight old bailey raised the toasting fork closed his eyes and brought it down on the egg there was a whup as it imploded there was a great stillness for several seconds after that then the wind began it had no direction but seemed somehow to be coming from everywhere a swirling sudden gale fallen leaves newspaper pages all the citys detritus blew up from the ground and was driven through the air the wind touched the surface of the thames and carried the cold water into the sky in a fine and driving spray it was a dangerous crazy wind the stall holders on the deck of the belfast cursed it and clutched their possessions to keep them from blowing away and then when it seemed that the wind would become so strong that it would blow the world away and blow the stars away and send the people tumbling through the air like so many desiccated autumn leaves just then it was over and the leaves and the papers and the plastic shopping bags tumbled to the earth and the road and the water high on the remnant of the london wall the silence that followed the wind was in its way as loud as the wind had been it was broken by a cough a horrid wet coughing this was followed by the sound of someone awkwardly rolling over and then the sound of someone being sick the marquis de carabas vomited sewer water over the side of the london wall staining the gray stones with brown foulness it took a long time to purge the water from his body and then he said in a hoarse voice that was little more than a grinding whisper i think my throats been cut have you anything to bind it with old bailey fumbled in his pockets and pulled out a grubby length of cloth he passed it to the marquis who wrapped it around his throat a few times and then tied it tight old bailey found himself reminded incongruously of the highwrapped beau brummel collars of the regency dandies anything to drink croaked the marquis old bailey pulled out his hipflask and unscrewed the top and passed it to the marquis who swigged back a mouthful then winced with pain and coughed weakly the black rat who had watched all this with interest now began to climb down the fragment of wall and away it would tell the golden all favors had been repaid all debts were done the marquis gave old bailey back his hipflask old bailey put it away how are ye feeling he asked ive felt better the marquis sat up shivering his nose was running and his eyes flickered about he was staring at the world as if he had never seen it before what did you have to go and get yourself killed for anyway thats what i want to know asked old bailey information whispered the marquis people tell you so much more when they know youre just about to be dead and then they talk around you when you are then you found out what you wanted to know the marquis fingered the wounds in his arms and his legs oh yes most of it i have more than an inkling of what this affair is actually about then he closed his eyes once more and wrapped his arms about himself and swayed slowly back and forth whats it like then asked old bailey being dead the marquis sighed and then he twisted his lips up into a smile and with a glitter of his old self he replied live long enough old bailey and you can find out for yourself old bailey looked disappointed bastard after all i done to bring you back from that dread bourne from which there is no returning well usually no returning the marquis de carabas looked up at him his eyes were very white in the moonlight and he whispered whats it like being dead its very cold my friend very dark and very cold door held up the chain the silver key hung from it red and orange in the light of hammersmiths brazier she smiled fine work hammersmith thank you lady she hung the chain around her neck and hid the key away inside her layers of clothes what would you like in return the smith looked abashed i hardly want to presume upon your good nature he mumbled door made her get on with it face he bent down and produced a black box from beneath a pile of metalworking tools it was made of dark wood inlaid with ivory and motherofpearl and was the size of a large dictionary he turned it over and over in his hands its a puzzlebox he explained i took it in return for some smithing a handful of years back i cant get it to open though ive tried so hard door took the box and ran her fingers over the smooth surface im not surprised you havent been able to open it the mechanisms all jammed its completely fused shut hammersmith looked glum so ill never find out whats in it door made an amused face her fingers explored the surface of the box a rod slidout of the side of the box she halfpushed the rod back into the box then twisted there was a clunk from deep inside it and a door opened in the side here said door my lady said hammersmith he took the box from her and pulled the door open all the way there was a drawer inside the box which he pulled open the small toad in the drawer croaked and looked about itself with copper eyes incuriously hammersmiths face fell i was hoping it would be diamonds and pearls he said door reached out a hand and stroked the toads head hes got pretty eyes she said keep him hammersmith hell bring you luck and thank you again i know i can rely on your discretion you can rely on me lady said hammersmith earnestly they sat together on the top of the london wall not speaking old bailey slowly lowered the baby carriage wheels to the ground below them wheres the market asked the marquis old bailey pointed to the gunship over there door and the others theyll be expecting me you arent in any condition to go anywhere the marquis coughed painfully it sounded to old bailey like there was still plenty of sewer in his lungs ive made a long enough journey today de carabas whispered a little farther wont hurt he examined his hands flexed the fingers slowly as if to see whether or not they would do as he wished and then he twisted his body around and began awkwardly to climb down the side of the wall but before he did so he said hoarsely and perhaps a little sadly it would seem old bailey that i owe you a favor when richard returned with the curries door ran to him and threw her arms around him she hugged him tightly and even patted his bottom before seizing the paper bag from him and pulling it open with enthusiasm she took a container of vegetable curry and began happily to eat thanks said door with her mouth full any sign of the marquis yet none said hunter croup and vandemar no yummy curry this is really good got the chain all right asked richard door pulled the chain up from around her neck enough to show it was there and she let it fall again the weight of the key pulling it back down door said richard this is lamia shes a guide she says she can take us anywhere in the underside anywhere door munched a papadum anywhere said lamia door put her head on one side do you know where the angel islington is lamia blinked slowly long lashes covering and revealing her foxglovecolored eyes islington she said you cant go there do you know down street said lamia the end of down street but its not safe hunter had been watching this conversation arms folded and unimpressed now she said we dont need a guide well said richard i think we do the marquis isnt around anywhere we know its going to be a dangerous journey we have to get the the thing i got to the angel and then hell tell door about her family and hell tell me how to get home lamia looked up at hunter with delight and he can give you brains she said cheerfully and me a heart door wiped the last of the curry from her bowl with her fingers and licked them well be fine just the three of us richard we cannot afford a guide lamia bridled ill take my payment from him not you and what payment would your kind demand asked hunter that said lamia with a sweet smile is for me to know and him to wonder door shook her head i really dont think so richard snorted you just dont like it that im figuring everything out for once instead of following blindly behind you going where im told thats not it at all richard turned to hunter well hunter do you know the way to islington hunter shook her head door sighed we should get a move on down street you say lamia smiled with plumcolored lips yes lady by the time the marquis reached the market they were gone fifteen they walked off the ship down the long gangplank and onto the shore where they went down some steps through a long unlit underpass and up again lamia strode confidently ahead of them she brought them out in a small cobbled alley gaslights burned and sputtered on the walls third door along she said they stopped in front of the door there was a brass plate on it which said the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to houses and beneath that in smaller letters down street please knock you get to the street through the house asked richard no said lamia the street is in the house richard knocked on the door nothing happened they waited and they shivered from the early morning cold richard knocked again finally he rang the doorbell the door was opened by a sleepylooking footman wearing a powdered crooked wig and scarlet livery he looked at the motley rabble on his doorstep with an expression that indicated that they had not been worth getting out of bed for can i help you said the footman richard had been told to fuck off and die with more warmth and good humor down street said lamia imperiously this way sighed the footman if youll wipe your feet they walked through an impressive lobby then they waited while the footman lit each of the candles on a candelabra they went down some impressive richly carpeted stairs they went down a flight of less impressive less richly carpeted stairs they went down a flight of entirely unimpressive stairs carpeted in a threadbare brown sacking and finally they went down a flight of drab wooden stairs with no carpet on them at all at the bottom of those stairs was an antique service elevator with a sign on it the sign said out of order the footman ignored the sign and pulled open the wire outer door with a metallic thud lamia thanked him politely and stepped into the elevator the others followed the footman turned his back on them richard watched him through the wire mesh clutching his candelabra going back up the wooden stairs there was a short row of black buttons on the wall of the elevator lamia pressed the bottommost button the metal lattice door closed automatically with a bang a motor engaged and the elevator began slowly creakily to descend the four of them stood packed in the elevator richard realized that he could smell each of the women in the elevator with him door smelled mostly of curry hunter smelled not unpleasantly of sweat in a way that made him think of great cats in cages at zoos while lamia smelled intoxicatingly of honeysuckle and lily of the valley and musk the elevator continued to descend richard was sweating in a clammy cold sweat and digging his fingernails deep into his palms in the most conversational tones he could muster he said now would be a very bad time to discover that one was claustrophobic wouldnt it yes said door then i wont said richard and they went down finally there was a jerk and a clunk and a ratcheting noise and the elevator stopped hunter pulled open the door looked about and then stepped out onto a narrow ledge richard looked out of the open elevator door they were hanging in the air at the top of something that reminded richard of a painting he had once seen of the tower of babel or rather of how the tower of babel might have looked were it inside out it was an enormous and ornate spiral path carved out of rock which went down and down around a central well lights flickered dimly here and there in the walls beside the paths and far far below them tiny fires were burning it was at the top of the central well a few thousand feet above solid ground that the elevator was hanging it swayed a little richard took a deep breath and followed the others onto the wooden ledge then although he knew it was a bad idea he looked down there was nothing but a wooden board between him and the rock floor thousands of feet below there was a long plank stretched between the ledge on which they stood and the top of the rocky path twenty feet away and i suppose he said with a great deal less insouciance than he imagined this wouldnt be a good time to point out that im really bad at heights its safe said lamia or it was the last time i was here watch she walked across the board a rustle of black velvet she could have balanced a dozen books on her head and never dropped one when she reached the stone path at the side she stopped and turned and smiled at them encouragingly hunter followed her across then turned and waited beside her on the edge see said door she reached out a hand squeezed richards arm its fine richard nodded and swallowed fine door walked across she did not seem to be enjoying herself but she crossed nonetheless the three women waited for richard who stood there richard noticed after a while that he did not seem to be starring to walk across the wooden plank despite the walk commands he was sending to his legs far above them a button was pressed richard heard the thunk and the distant grinding of an elderly electric motor the door of the elevator slammed closed behind him leaving richard standing precariously on a narrow wooden platform no wider than a plank itself richard shouted door move the elevator began to ascend richard stepped off the shaking platform and onto the wooden board then his legs turned to jelly beneath him and he found himself on all fours on the plank holding on for dear life there was a tiny rational part of his mind that wondered about the elevator who had called it back up and why the rest of his mind however was engaged in telling all his limbs to clutch the plank rigidly and in screaming at the top of its mental voice i dont want to die richard closed his eyes as tightly as he could certain that if he opened them and saw the rock wall below him he would simply let go of the plank and fall and fall and im not scared of falling he told himself the part im scared of is where you finish falling but he knew he was lying to himself it was the fall he was scared ofafraid of flailing and tumbling helplessly through the air down to the rock floor far below knowing there was nothing he could do to save himself no miracle that would save him he slowly became aware that someone was talking to him just climb along the plank richard someone was saying i cant he whispered you went through worse than this to get the key richard someone said it was door talking im really not very good at heights he said obstinately his face pressed against the wooden board his teeth chartering then i want to go home he felt the wood of the plank pressing against his face and then the plank began to shake hunters voice said im really not sure how much weight the board will bear you two put your weight here the plank vibrated as someone moved along it toward him he clung to it with his eyes closed then hunter said quietly confidently in his ear richard mm just edge forward richard a bit at a time come on her caramel fingers stroked his whiteknuckled hand clasping the plank come on he took a deep breath and inched forward and froze again youre doing fine said hunter thats good come on and inch by inch creep by crawl she talked richard along the plank and then at the end of the plank she simply picked him up her hands beneath his arms and placed him on solid ground thank you he said he could not think of anything else to say to hunter that would be big enough to cover what she had just done for him he said it again thank you and then he said to all of them im sorry door looked up at him its okay she said youre safe now richard looked at the winding spiral road beneath the world going down and down and he looked at hunter and door and lamia and he laughed until he wept what door demanded when at length he had stopped laughing is so funny safe he said simply door stared at him and then she too smiled so where do we go now richard asked down said lamia they began to walk down down street hunter was in the lead with door beside her richard walked next to lamia breathing in the lilyofthevalleyhoneysuckle scent of her and enjoying her company i really appreciate you coming with us he told her being a guide i hope its not going to be bad luck for you or anything she fixed him with her foxglovecolored eyes why should it be bad luck do you know who the ratspeakers are of course there was a ratspeaker girl named anaesthesia she well we got to be sort of friends and she was guiding me somewhere and then she got stolen on nights bridge i keep wondering what happened to her she smiled at him sympathetically my people have stories about that some of them may even be true youll have to tell me about them he said it was cold his breath was steaming in the chilly air one day she said her breath did not steam its very good of you taking me with you least we could do door and hunter went around the curve in front of them and went out of sight you know said richard the other two are getting a bit ahead of us we might want to hurry let them go she said gently well catch up it was thought richard peculiarly like going to a movie with a girl as a teenager or rather like walking home afterwards stopping at bus shelters or beside walls to snatch a kiss a hasty fumble of skin and a tangle of tongues then hurrying on to catch up with your friends lamia ran a cold finger down his cheek youre so warm she said admiringly it must be wonderful to have so much warmth richard tried to look modest its not something i think about much really he admitted he heard distantly from above the metallic slam of the elevator door lamia looked up at him pleadingly sweetly would you give me some of your heat richard she asked im so cold richard wondered if he should kiss her what i she looked disappointed dont you like me she asked he hoped desperately that he had not hurt her feelings of course i like you he heard his voice saying youre very nice and you arent using all your heat are you she pointed out reasonably i suppose not and you said youd pay me for being your guide and its what i want as my payment warmth can i have some anything she wanted anything the honeysuckle and the lily of the valley wrapped around him and his eyes saw nothing but her pale skin and her dark plumbloom lips and her jet black hair he nodded somewhere inside him something was screaming but whatever it was it could wait she reached up her hands to his face and pulled it gently down toward her then she kissed him long and languorously there was a moment of initial shock at the chill of her lips and the cold of her tongue and then he succumbed to her kiss entirely after some time she pulled back he could feel the ice on his lips he stumbled back against the wall he tried to blink but his eyes felt as if they were frozen open she looked up at him and smiled delightedly her skin flushed and pink and her lips scarlet her breath steamed in the cold air she licked her red lips with a warm crimson tongue his world began to go dark he thought he saw a black shape at the edge of his vision more she said and she reached out to him he watched the velvet pull richard to her for the first kiss watched the rime and the frost spread over richards skin he watched her pull back happily and then he walked up behind her and as she moved in to finish what she had begun he reached out and seized her hard by the neck and lifted her off the ground give it back he rasped in her ear give him back his life the velvet reacted like a kitten who had just been dropped into a bathtub wriggling and hissing and spitting and scratching it did her no good she was held tight by the throat you cant make me she said in decidedly unmusical tones he increased the pressure give him his life back he told her hoarsely and honestly or ill break your neck she winced he pushed her toward richard frozen and crumpled against the rock wall she took richards hand and breathed into his nose and mouth vapor came from her mouth and trickled into his the ice on his skin began to thaw the rime on his hair to vanish he squeezed her neck again all of it lamia she hissed then extremely grudgingly and opened her mouth once more a final puff of steam drifted from her mouth to his and vanished inside him richard blinked the ice on his eyes had melted to tears and they were running down his cheeks what did you do to me he asked she was drinking your life said the marquis de carabas in a hoarse whisper taking your warmth turning you into a cold thing like her lamias face twisted like a tiny child deprived of a favorite toy her foxglove eyes flashed i need it more than he does she wailed i thought you liked me said richard stupidly the marquis picked lamia up onehanded and brought her face close to his go near him again you or any of the velvet children and ill come by day to your cavern while you sleep and ill burn it to the ground understand lamia nodded he let go of her and she dropped to the floor then she pulled herself up to her full size which was not terribly tall threw back her head and spat hard into the marquiss face she picked up the front of her black velvet dress and ran up the slope and away her footsteps echoing through the winding rock path of down street while her icecold spittle ran down the marquiss cheek he wiped it away with the back of his hand she was going to kill me stammered richard not immediately said the marquis dismissively you would have died eventually though when she finished eating your life richard stared at the marquis his skin was filthy and he seemed ashen beneath the dark of his skin his coat was gone instead he wore an old blanket wrapped about his shoulders like a poncho with something bulkyrichard could not tell what strapped beneath it he was barefoot and in what richard took to be some kind of bizarre fashion affectation there was a discolored cloth wrapped all the way around his throat we were looking for you said richard and now youve found me croaked the marquis drily we were expecting to see you at the market yes well some people thought i was dead i was forced to keep a low profile why why did some people think you were dead the marquis looked at richard with eyes that had seen too much and gone too far because they killed me he said come on the others cant be too far ahead richard looked over the side of the path across the central well he could see door and hunter across the well on the level below they were looking aroundfor him he assumed he called to them shouted and waved but the sound did not carry the marquis laid a hand upon richards arm look he said he pointed to the level beneath door and hunter something moved richard squinted he could make out two figures standing in the shadows croup and vandemar said the marquis its a trap what do we do run said the marquis warn them i cant run yet go damn you and richard ran he ran as fast as he could as hard as he could down the sloping stone road under the world he felt a sudden stabbing pain in his chest a stitch and he pushed himself on and still he ran he turned a corner and he saw them all hunter door he gasped breathless stop watch out door turned mr croup and mr vandemar stepped out from behind a pillar mr vandemar yanked doors hands behind her back and bound them in one movement with a nylon strip mr croup was holding something long and thin in a brown cloth cover like the kind richards father had used to carry his fishing poles in hunter stood there her mouth open richard shouted hunter quickly she nodded spun around and kicked out one foot in a smooth almost balletic motion her foot caught richard squarely in the stomach he fell to the floor several feet away winded and breathless and hurt hunter he gasped im afraid so said hunter and she turned away richard felt sick and saddened the betrayal hurt him as much as the blow mr croup and mr vandemar ignored richard and hunter entirely mr vandemar was trussing doors arms while mr croup stood and watched dont think of us as murderers and cutthroats miss mr croup was saying conversationally think of us as an escort service hunter stood beside the rock face looking at none of them and richard lay on the rock floor and writhed and tried somehow to suck air back into his lungs mr croup turned back to door and smiled showing many teeth you see lady door we are going to make sure you get safely to your destination door ignored him hunter she called whats happening hunter did not move nor did she answer mr croup beamed proudly before hunter agreed to work for you she agreed to work for our principal taking care of you we told you crowed mr vandemar we told you one of you was a traitor he threw back his head and howled like a wolf i thought you were talking about the marquis said door mr croup scratched his head of orange hair theatrically talking of the marquis i wonder where he is hes a bit late isnt he mister vandemar very late indeed mister croup as late as he possibly could be mr croup coughed sententiously and delivered his punch line then from now on well have to call him the late marquis de carabas im afraid hes eversoslightly dead as a doornail finished mr vandemar richard finally managed to get enough air into his lungs to gasp you traitorous bitch hunter glanced at the ground no hard feelings she whispered the key you obtained from the black friars said mr croup to door who has it i do gasped richard you can search me if you like look he fumbled in his pocketsnoticing something hard and unfamiliar in his back pocket but there was no time to investigate that nowand he pulled out the frontdoor key of his old flat he dragged himself to his feet and staggered over to mr croup and mr vandemar here mr croup reached over and took the key from him good gracious me he said scarcely glancing at it i find myself utterly taken in by his cunning ploy mister vandemar he passed the key to mr vandemar who held it up between finger and thumb and crushed it like brass foil fooled again mister croup he said hurt him mister vandemar said mr croup with pleasure mister croup said mr vandemar and he kicked richard in the kneecap richard fell to the ground in agony as if from a long way away he could hear mr vandemars voice it appeared to be lecturing him people think its how hard you kick that hurts mr vandemars voice was saying but its not how hard you kick its where i mean thiss really a very gentle kick something slammed into richards left shoulder his left arm went numb and a purplewhite blossom of pain opened up in his shoulder it felt like his whole arm was on fire and freezing as if someone had jabbed an electrical prod deep into his flesh and turned up the current as high as it would go he whimpered and mr vandemar was saying but it hurts just as much as thiswhich is much harder and the boot rammed into richards side like a cannonball he could hear himself screaming ive got the key he heard door say if only you had a swiss army knife mr vandemar told richard helpfully i could show you what i do with all the different bits even the bottleopener and the thing for getting stones out of horses hooves leave him mister vandemar there will be time enough for swiss army knives does she have the token mr croup fumbled in doors pockets and took out the carved obsidian figure the tiny beast the angel had given her hunters voice was low and resonant what about me wheres my payment mr croup sniffed he tossed her the fishing pole case she caught it onehanded good hunting said mr croup then he and mr vandemar turned and walked off down the twisting slope of down street with door between them richard lay on the floor and watched them go with a terrible feeling of despair spreading outward from his heart hunter knelt on the ground and began to undo the straps on the case her eyes were wide and shining richard ached what is it he asked thirty pieces of silver she pulled it slowly from its fabric cover her fingers caressing it stroking it loving it a spear she said simply it was made of a bronzecolored metal the blade was long and it curved like a kris sharp on one side serrated on the other there were faces carved into the side of the haft which was green with verdigris and decorated with strange designs and odd curlicues it was about five feet long from the tip of the blade to the end of the haft hunter touched it almost fearfully as if it was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen you sold door out for a spear said richard hunter said nothing she wetted a fingertip with her pink tongue then gently ran it across the side of the head of the spear testing the edge on the blade and then she smiled as if she were satisfied with what she felt are you going to kill me richard asked he was surprised to find himself no longer scared of deathor at least he realized he was not scared of that death she turned her head then and looked at him she looked more alive than he had ever seen her more beautiful and more dangerous and what kind of challenge would i have hunting you richard mayhew she asked with a vivid smile i have bigger game to kill this is your greatbeastoflondonhunting spear isnt it he said she looked at the spear in a way that no woman had ever looked at richard they say that nothing can stand against it but door trusted you i trusted you she was no longer smiling enough slowly the pain was beginning to abate dwindling to a dull ache in his shoulder and his side and his knee so who are you working for where are they taking her whos behind all this tell him hunter rasped the marquis de carabas he was holding a crossbow pointed at hunter his bare feet were planted on the ground his face was implacable i wondered whether you were as dead as croup and vandemar claimed you were said hunter barely turning her head you struck me as a hard man to kill he inclined his head in an ironic bow but his eyes did not move and his hands remained steady and you strike me that way too dear lady but a crossbow bolt to the throat and a fall of several thousand feet may prove me wrong eh put the spear down and step back she placed the spear on the floor gently lovingly then she stood up and stepped back from it you may as well tell him hunter said the marquis i know i found out the hard way tell him whos behind all this islington she said richard shook his head as if he were trying to brush away a fly it cant be he said i mean ive met islington hes an angel and then almost desperately he asked why the marquiss eyes had not left hunter nor had the point of the crossbow wavered i wish i knew but islington is at the bottom of down street and at the bottom of this mess and between us and islington is the labyrinth and the beast richard take the spear hunter walk in front of me please richard picked up the spear and then awkwardly using the spear to lean on he pulled himself up to a standing position you want her to come with us he asked puzzled would you prefer her behind us asked the marquis drily you could kill her said richard i will if there are no other alternatives said the marquis but i would hate to remove an option before it was entirely necessary anyway death is so final isnt it is it asked richard sometimes said the marquis de carabas and they went down sixteen they walked for hours in silence following the winding stone road downwards richard was still in pain he was limping and experiencing a strange mental and physical turmoil feelings of defeat and betrayal roiled within him which combined with the near loss of his life to lamia the damage inflicted by mr vandemar and his experiences on the plank far above left him utterly wrecked yet he was certain that his experiences of the last day paled into something small and insignificant when placed beside whatever the marquis had experienced so he said nothing the marquis kept silent as every word he uttered hurt his throat he was content to let it heal and to concentrate on hunter he knew that should he let his attention flag for even a moment she would know it and she would be away or she would turn on them so he said nothing hunter walked a little ahead of them she also said nothing after some hours they reached the bottom of down street the street ended in a vast cyclopean gatewaybuilt of enormous rough stone blocks giants built that gate thought richard halfremembered tales of longdead kings of mythical london churning in his head tales of king bran and of the giants gog and magog with hands the size of oak trees and severed heads as big as hills the portal itself had long since rusted and crumbled away fragments of it could be seen in the mud beneath their feet dangling uselessly from a rusted hinge on the side of the gate the hinge was taller than richard the marquis gestured for hunter to stop he moistened his lips and said this gate marks the end of down street and the beginning of the labyrinth and beyond the labyrinth waits the angel islington and in the labyrinth is the beast i still dont understand said richard islington i actually met him it him hes an angel i mean a real angel the marquis smiled without humor when angels go bad richard they go worse than anyone remember lucifer used to be an angel hunter watched richard with nut brown eyes the place you visited is islingtons citadel and also its prison she said it was the first thing she had said in hours it cannot leave the marquis addressed her directly i assume that the labyrinth and the beast are there to discourage visitors she inclined her head so i would assume also richard turned on the marquis all his anger and impotence and frustration spewing out of him in one angry blast why are you even talking to her why is she still with us she was a traitorshe tried to make us think that you were the traitor and i saved your life richard mayhew said hunter quietly many times on the bridge at the gap on the board up there she looked into his eyes and it was richard who looked away something echoed through the tunnels a bellow or a roar the hairs on the back of richards neck prickled it was far away but that was the only thing about it in which he could take any comfort he knew that sound he had heard it in his dreams but now it sounded neither like a bull nor like a boar it sounded like a lion it sounded like a dragon the labyrinth is one of the oldest places in london below said the marquis before king lud founded the village on the thames marshes there was a labyrinth here no beast though said richard not then richard hesitated the distant roaring began again i i think ive had dreams about the beast he said the marquis raised an eyebrow what kind of dreams bad ones said richard the marquis thought about this eyes flickering and then he said look richard im taking hunter but if you want to wait here well no one could accuse you of cowardice richard shook his head sometimes there is nothing you can do im not turning back not now theyve got door right said the marquis well then shall we go hunters perfect caramel lips twisted into a sneer youd have to be mad to go in there she said without the angels token you could never find your way never get past the boar the marquis reached his hand under his poncho blanket and produced the little obsidian statue he had taken from doors fathers study one of these you mean he asked the marquis felt then that much of what he had gone through in the previous week was made up for by the expression on hunters face they went through the gate into the labyrinth doors arms were bound behind her back and mr vandemar walked behind her one huge beringed hand resting on her shoulder pushing her along mr croup scuttled on ahead of them holding the talisman he had taken from her on high and peering edgily from side to side like a particularly pompous weasel on its way to raid the henhouse the labyrinth itself was a place of pure madness it was built of lost fragments of london above alleys and roads and corridors and sewers that had fallen through the cracks over the millennia and entered the world of the lost and the forgotten the two men and the girl walked over cobbles and through mud and through dung of various kinds and over rotting wooden boards they walked through daylight and night through gaslit streets and sodiumlit streets and streets lit with burning rushes and links it was an everchanging place and each path divided and circled and doubled back on itself mr croup felt the tug of the talisman and let it take him where it wanted to go they walked down a tiny alleyway which had once been part of a victorian rookerya slum comprised in equal parts of theft and penny gin of twopennyhalfpenny squalor and threepenny sexand they heard it snuffling and snorting somewhere nearby and then it bellowed deep and dark mr croup hesitated before hurrying forward up a short wooden staircase and then at the end of the alley he stopped squinting about him before he led them down some steps into a long stone tunnel that had once run across the fleet marshes in the templars time door said youre afraid arent you croup glared at her hush your tongue she smiled although she did not feel like smiling youre scared that your safeconduct token wont get you past the beast what are you planning now to kidnap islington sell both of us to the highest bidder quiet said mr vandemar but mr croup simply chuckled and door knew then that the angel islington was not her friend she began to shout hey beast here mr vandemar cuffed her head and knocked her against the wall said to be quiet he told her calmly she tasted blood in her mouth and spat scarlet on the mud then she parted her lips to begin shouting once more mr vandemar anticipating this had taken a handkerchief from his pocket and he forced it into her mouth she tried to bite his thumb as he did so but it made no appreciable impression on him now youll be quiet he told her mr vandemar was very proud of his handkerchief which was spattered with green and brown and black and had originally belonged to an overweight snuff dealer in the s who had died of apoplexy and been buried with his handkerchief in his pocket mr vandemar still occasionally found fragments of snuff merchant in it but it was he felt a fine handkerchief for all that they continued in silence richard made another entry in his mental diary today he thought ive survived walking the plank the kiss of death and a lecture on inflicting pain right now im on my way through a labyrinth with a mad bastard who came back from the dead and a bodyguard who turned out to be a whatever the opposite of a bodyguard is i am so far out of my depth that metaphors failed him then he had gone beyond the world of metaphor and simile into the place of things that are and it was changing him they were wading through a narrow passage of wet marshy ground between dark stone walls the marquis held both the token and the crossbow and he took care to walk at all times about ten feet behind hunter richard in the lead was carrying hunters beast spear and a yellow flare the marquis had produced from beneath his blanket which illuminated the stone walls and the mud and he walked well in front of hunter the marshland stank and huge mosquitoes had begun to settle upon richards arms and legs and face biting him painfully and raising huge itching welts neither hunter nor the marquis so much as mentioned the mosquitoes richard was beginning to suspect that they were quite lost it did not help his mood any that there were a large number of dead people in the marsh leathery preserved bodies discolored skeletal bones and pallid waterswollen corpses he wondered how long the corpses had been there and whether they had been killed by the beast or by the mosquitoes he said nothing as they walked on for another five minutes and eleven mosquito bites and then he called out i think were lost weve been through this way before the marquis held up the token no were fine he said the token is leading us straight clever little thing yeah said richard who was not impressed very clever it was then that the marquis stepped barefoot on the shattered rib cage of a halfburied corpse puncturing his heel and causing him to stumble the little black statue went flying through the air and tumbled into the black marsh with the satisfied plop of a leaping fish returning to the water the marquis righted himself and pointed the crossbow at hunters back richard he called i dropped it can you come back here richard walked back holding the flare high hoping for the glint of flame on obsidian seeing nothing but wet mud get down into the mud and look said the marquis richard groaned youve dreamed of the beast richard said the marquis do you really want to encounter it richard thought about this for not very long then he pushed the haft of the bronze spear into the surface of the marsh and stood the flare up into the mud beside it illuminating the surface of the marsh with a fitful amber light he got down on his hands and knees in the bog searching for the statue he ran his hands over the surface of the marsh hoping not to encounter any dead faces or hands its hopeless it could be anywhere keep looking said the marquis richard tried to remember how he usually found things first he let his mind go as blank as he could then he let his gaze wander over the surface of the marsh purposelessly idly something glittered on the boggy surface five feet to his left it was the beast statue i can see it called richard he floundered toward it through the mud the little glassy beast was headdown in a puddle of dark water perhaps the mud was disturbed by richards approach more likely as richard was convinced forever after it was just the sheer cussedness of the material world whatever the cause he was almost next to the little statue when the marsh made a noise that sounded like a giant stomach rumbling and a large bubble of gas floated up and popped noxiously and obscenely beside the talisman which vanished beneath the water richard reached the place where the talisman had been and pushed his arms deep into the mud searching for it wildly not caring what else his fingers might encounter it was no use it was gone forever what do we do now asked richard the marquis sighed get back over here and well figure out something richard said quietly too late it was coming toward them so slowly so ponderously that he thought for a fragment of a second that it was old sick even dying that was his first thought and then he realized how much ground it was covering as it approached mud and foul water splashing up from its hooves as it ran and he realized how wrong he had been in thinking it slow thirty feet away from them the beast slowed and stopped with a grunt its flanks were steaming it bellowed in triumph and in challenge there were broken spears and shattered swords and rusted knives bristling from its sides and back the yellow flare light glinted in its red eyes and on its tusks and its hooves it lowered its massive head it was some kind of boar thought richard and then realized that that had to be nonsense no boar could be so huge it was the size of an ox of a bull elephant of a lifetime it stared at them and it paused for a hundred years which transpired in a dozen heartbeats hunter knelt in one fluid motion and pulled up the spear from the fleet marsh which released it with a sucking noise and in a voice that was pure joy she said yes at last she had forgotten them all forgotten richard down in the mud and the marquis and his foolish crossbow and the world she was delighted and transported in a perfect place the world she lived for her world contained two things hunter and the beast the beast knew that too it was the perfect match the hunter and the hunted and who was who and which was which only time would reveal time and the dance the beast charged hunter waited until she could see the white spittle dripping from its mouth and as it lowered its head she stabbed up with the spear but as she tried to sink the spear into its side she understood that she had moved just a fraction of a second too late and the spear went tumbling out of her numbed hands and a tusk sharper than the sharpest razor blade opened her side and as she fell beneath its monstrous weight she felt its sharp hooves crushing down on her arm and her hip and her ribs and then it was gone vanished back into the darkness and the dance was done mr croup was more relieved than he would have admitted to be through the labyrinth but he and mr vandemar were through it unharmed as was their prey there was a rock face in front of them an oaken double door set in the rock face and an oval mirror set in the righthand door mr croup touched the mirror with one grimy hand the surface of the mirror clouded at his touch seethed for a moment bubbling and roiling like a vat of boiling quicksilver and then was still the angel islington looked out at them mr croup cleared his throat good morning sir it is us and we have the young lady you sent us to fetch for you and the key the angels gentle voice seemed to come from all around them hanging around her swanlike neck said mr croup a little more anxiously than he intended to then enter said the angel the oak doors swung open at his words and they went in it had all happened so fast the beast had come out of the darkness hunter had snatched the spear and it had charged her and disappeared back into the darkness richard strained to hear the beast he could hear nothing but somewhere close to him the slow drip drip of water and the high maddening whine of mosquitoes hunter lay on her back in the mud one arm was twisted at a peculiar angle he crawled toward her through the mire hunter he whispered can you hear me there was a pause and then a whisper so faint he thought for a moment he had imagined it yes the marquis was still some yards away standing stockstill beside a wall now he called out richardstay where you are the creatures just biding its time itll be back richard ignored him he spoke to hunter are you he paused it seemed such a stupid thing to say he said it anyway are you going to be all right she laughed then with bloodflecked lips and shook her head are there any medical people down here he asked the marquis not in the sense youre thinking of we have some healers a handful of leeches and chirurgeons hunter coughed then and winced bright red arterial blood trickled from the corner of her mouth the marquis edged a little closer do you keep your life hidden anywhere hunter he asked im a hunter she whispered disdainfully we dont go in for that kind of thing she pulled air into her lungs with an effort then exhaled as if the simple effort of breathing were becoming too much for her richard have you ever used a spear no take it she whispered but do it her voice was low and urgent pick it up hold it at the blunt end richard picked up the fallen spear he held it at the blunt end i knew that part he told her a glimmer of a smile breathed across her face i know look said richard feeling not for the first time like the only sane person in a madhouse why dont we just stay very quiet maybe itll go away well try to get you some help and not for the first time the person he was talking to ignored him utterly i did a bad thing richard mayhew she whispered sadly i did a very bad thing because i wanted to be the one to kill the beast because i needed the spear and then impossibly she began to haul herself to her feet richard had not realized how badly she had been injured nor could he now imagine what pain she must be in he could see her right arm hanging uselessly a white shard of bone protruding horribly from the skin blood ran from a cut in her side her rib cage looked wrong stop it he hissed futilely get down with her left hand she pulled a knife from her belt put it into her right hand closed the nerveless fingers around the hilt i did a bad thing she repeated and now i make amends she began humming then humming high and humming low until she found the note that made the walls and the pipes and the room reverberate and she hummed that note until it felt like the entire labyrinth must be echoing to her hum and then sucking the air into her shattered rib cage she shouted hey big boy where are you there came no reply no noise but the low drip of water even the mosquitoes were quiet maybe its gone away said richard gripping the spear so tightly that it hurt his hands i doubt it muttered the marquis come on you bastard hunter screamed are you scared there was a deep bellow from off front of them and the beast came out of the dark and it charged once more this time there could be no room for mistakes the dance whispered hunter the dance is not yet over as the beast came toward her its horns lowered she shouted nowrichard strike under and up now before the beast hit her and her words turned into a wordless scream richard saw the beast come out from the darkness into the light of the flare it all happened very slowly it was like a dream it was like all his dreams the beast was so close he could smell the shitandblood animal stench of it so close he could feel its warmth and richard stabbed with the spear as hard as he could pushing up into its side and letting it sink in a bellow then or a roar of anguish and hatred and pain and then silence he could hear his heart thudding in his ears and he could hear water dripping the mosquitoes began to whine once more he realized he was still holding tight to the haft of the spear although the blade of it was buried deep within the body of the immobile beast he let go of it and staggered around the beast looking for hunter she was trapped beneath the beast it occurred to him that if he moved her pulling her out from under it he might cause her death so instead he pushed as hard as he could against the warm dead flanks of the beast trying to move it it was like trying to pushstart a sherman tank but eventually awkwardly he tumbled it halfoff her hunter lay on her back staring up at the darkness above them her eyes were open and unfocussed and richard knew somehow that they saw nothing at all hunter he said im still here richard mayhew her voice sounded almost detached she made no effort to find him with her eyes no effort to focus is it dead i think so its not moving and then she laughed it was a strange sort of laugh as if she had just heard the funniest joke that ever the world told a hunter and between her spasms of laughter and the wet racking coughs that interrupted them she shared the joke with him you killed the beast she said so now youre the greatest hunter in london below the warrior and then she stopped laughing i cant feel my hands take my right hand richard fumbled under the beasts body and wrapped his hand around hunters chill fingers they felt so small suddenly is there still a knife in my hand she whispered yes he could feel it cold and sticky take the knife shes yours i dont want your take her he pried the knife free from her fingers shes yours now whispered hunter nothing was moving save her lips and her eyes were clouding shes always looked after me clean my blood off her though mustnt rust the blade a hunter always looks after her weapons she gulped air now touch the beasts blood to your eyes and tongue richard was not sure that he had heard her correctly nor that he believed what he had heard what richard had not noticed the marquis approach but now he spoke intently into richards ear do it richard shes right itll get you through the labyrinth do it richard put his hand down to the spear ran it up the haft until he felt the beasts hide and the warm stickiness of the beasts blood feeling slightly foolish he touched his hand to his tongue tasting the salt of the creatures blood it did not to his surprise revolt him it tasted utterly natural like tasting an ocean he touched his bloody fingers to his eyes where the blood stung like sweat then i did it he told her thats good whispered hunter she said nothing more the marquis de carabas reached out his hand and closed her eyes richard wiped hunters knife on his shirt it was what she had told him to do it saved having to think better get a move on said the marquis standing up we cant just leave her here we can we can come back for the body later richard polished the blade as hard as he could on his shirt he was crying now but he had not noticed and if there isnt any later then well just have to hope that someone disposes of all our remains including the lady doors and she must be getting tired of waiting for us richard looked down he wiped the last of hunters blood off her knife and put it through his belt then he nodded you go said de carabas ill follow as fast as i can richard hesitated and then as best he could he ran perhaps it was the beasts blood that did it he certainly had no other explanation whatever the reason he ran straight and true through the labyrinth which no longer held any mysteries for him he felt that he knew every twist every path every alley and lane and runnel of it he ran stumbling and falling and still running exhausted through the labyrinth his blood pounding in his temples a rhyme coursed through his head as he ran pounding and echoing to the rhythm of his feet it was something he had heard as a child this aye night this aye night every night and all fire and fleet and candlelight and christ receive thy soul the words went around and around dirgelike in his head fire and fleet and candlelight at the end of the labyrinth was a sheer granite cliff and set in the cliff were high wooden double doors there was an oval mirror hanging on one of the doors the doors were closed he touched the wood and the door opened silently to his touch richard went inside seventeen richard followed the path between the burning candles which led him through the angels vault to the great hall he recognized his surroundings this was where they had drunk islingtons wine an octagon of iron pillars supporting the stone roof above them the huge black stone and metal door the old wooden table the candles door was chained up spreadeagled between two pillars beside the flint and silver door she stared at him as he came in her oddcolored pixie eyes wide and scared the angel islington standing beside her turned and smiled at richard as he entered that was the most chilling thing of all the gentle compassion the sweetness of that smile come in richard mayhew come in said the angel islington dear me you do look a mess there was honest concern in its voice richard hesitated please the angel gestured curling a white forefinger urging him further in i think we all know each other you know the lady door of course and my associates mister croup mister vandemar richard turned croup and vandemar were standing on each side of him mr vandemar smiled at him mr croup did not i was hoping you would show up continued the angel it tipped its head on one side and asked by the bye where is hunter shes dead said richard he heard door gasp oh the poor dear said islington it shook its head sadly obviously regretting the senseless loss of human life the frailty of all mortals born to suffer and to die still said mr croup chirpily cant make an omelette without killing a few people richard ignored them as best he could door are you all right more or less thanks so far her lower lip was swollen and there was a bruise on her cheek i am afraid said islington that miss door was proving a little intransigent i was just discussing having mister croup and mister vandemar it paused there were obviously some things it found distasteful actually to say torture her suggested mr vandemar helpfully we are said mr croup after all famed across the entirety of creation for our skill in the excrutiatory arts good at hurting people clarified mr vandemar the angel continued staring intently at richard as it spoke as if it had heard neither of them but then miss door does not strike me as someone who will easily change her mind give us time enough said mr croup wed break her into little wet pieces said mr vandemar islington shook his head and smiled indulgently at this display of enthusiasm no time it said to richard no time however she does strike me as someone who would indeed act to end the pain and suffering of a friend a fellow mortal such as yourself richard mr croup hit richard in the stomach then a vicious rabbit punch to the gut and richard doubled up he felt mr vandemars fingers on the back of his neck pulling him back to a standing position but its wrong said door islington looked thoughtful wrong it said puzzled and amused mr croup pulled richards head close to his and smiled his graveyard smile hes traveled so far beyond right and wrong he couldnt see them with a telescope on a nice clear night he confided now mister vandemar if youll do the honors mr vandemar took richards left hand in his he took richards little finger between his huge fingers and bent it back until it broke richard cried out the angel turned slowly it seemed distracted by something it blinked its pearl gray eyes theres someone else out there mister croup there was a dark shimmer where mr croup had been and he was there no longer the marquis de carabas was flattened against the side of the red granite cliff staring at the oak doors that led into islingtons dwelling plans and plots whirled through his head each scheme fizzling out uselessly as he imagined it he had thought he would have known what to do when he got to this point and he was discovering to his disgust that he had absolutely no idea there were no more favors to call in no levers to press or buttons to push so he scrutinized the doors and wondered whether they were guarded whether the angel would know if they were opened there had to be an obvious solution he was missing if only he thought hard enough perhaps something would occur to him at least he thought slightly cheered he had surprise on his side that was until he felt the cold point of a sharp knife placed against his throat and he heard mr croups oily voice whispering in his ear i already killed you once today it was saying what does it take to teach some people richard was manacled and chained between a pair of iron pillars when mr croup returned prodding the marquis de carabas with his knife the angel looked at the marquis with disappointment on its face then gently it shook its beautiful head you told me he was dead it said he is said mr vandemar he was corrected mr croup the angels voice was a fraction less gentle and less caring i will not be lied to it said we dont lie said mr croup affronted do said mr vandemar mr croup ran a grimy hand through his filthy orange hair in exasperation indeed we do but not this time the pain in richards hand showed no indication of subsiding how can you behave like this he asked angrily youre an angel what did i tell you richard asked the marquis drily richard thought you said lucifer was an angel islington smiled superciliously lucifer it said lucifer was an idiot it wound up lord and master of nothing at all the marquis grinned and you wound up lord and master of two thugs and a roomful of candles the angel licked its lips they told me it was my punishment for atlantis i told them there was nothing more i could have done the whole affair was it paused as if it were hunting for the correct word and then it said with regret unfortunate but millions of people were killed said door islington clasped its hands in front of its chest as if it were posing for a christmas card these things happen it explained reasonably of course they do said the marquis mildly the irony implicit in his words not in his voice cities sink every day and you had nothing to do with it it was as if the lid had been pulled off something dark and writhing a place of derangement and fury and utter viciousness and in a time of scary things it was the most frightening thing richard had seen the angels serene beauty cracked its eyes flashed and it screamed at them crazyscary and uncontrolled utterly certain in its righteousness they deserved it there was a moment of silence and then the angel lowered its head and sighed and raised its head and said very quietly and with deep regret just one of those things then it pointed to the marquis chain him up it said croup and vandemar fastened manacles around the marquiss wrists and chained the manacles securely to the pillars beside richard the angel had turned its attention back to door it walked over to her reached out its hand placed it beneath her pointed chin and raised her head to stare into her eyes your family it said gently you come from a very unusual family quite remarkable then why did you have us killed not all of you it said richard thought it was talking about door but then it said there was always the possibility that you might not have worked out as well as you did it released her chin and stroked her face with long white fingers and it said your family can open doors they can create doors where there were no doors they can unlock doors that are locked open doors that were never meant to be opened it ran its fingers down her neck gently as if it were caressing her then closed its hand on the key about her neck when i was sentenced here they gave me the door to my prison and they took the key to the door and put it down here too an exquisite form of torture it rugged gently on the chain pulling it out from under doors layers of silk and cotton and lace revealing the silver key and then it ran its fingers over the key as if it were exploring her secret places richard knew then the black friars were keeping the key safe from you he said islington let go of the key door was chained up beside the door made of black flint and tarnished silver the angel walked to it and placed a hand on it white against the blackness of the door from me agreed islington a key a door an opener of the door there must be the three you see a particularly refined sort of joke the idea being that when they decided i had earned forgiveness and my freedom they would send me an opener and give me the key i just decided to take matters into my own hands and will be leaving a little early it turned back to door once more it caressed the key then it closed its hand about the key and tugged hard the chain snapped door winced i spoke first to your father door the angel continued he worried about the underside he wanted to unite london below to unite the baronies and fiefdomsperhaps even to forge some kind of bond with london above i told him i would help him if he would help me then i told him the nature of the help i needed and he laughed at me it repeated the words as if it still found them impossible to believe he laughed at me door shook her head you killed him because he turned you down i didnt kill him islington corrected her gently i had him killed but he told me i could trust you he told me to come here in his journal mr croup began to giggle he didnt he said he never did that was us what was it he actually said mister vandemar door child fear islington said mr vandemar with her fathers voice the voice was exact islingtons got to be behind all this its dangerous door keep away from it islington caressed her cheek with the key i thought my version would get you here a little faster we took the journal said mr croup we fixed it and we returned it where does the door lead to called richard home said the angel heaven and islington said nothing but it smiled so you figure they wont notice youre back sneered the marquis just oh look theres another angel here grab a harp and on with the hosannas islingtons gray eyes were bright not for me the smooth agonies of adulation of hymns and halos and selfsatisfied prayers it said i have my own agenda well now youve got the key said door and i have you said the angel youre the opener without you the key is useless open the door for me you killed her family said richard youve had her hunted through london below now you want her to open a door for you so you can singlehandedly invade heaven youre not much of a judge of character are you shell never do it the angel looked at him then with eyes older than the milky way then it said ah me and turned its back as if it were illprepared to watch the unpleasantness that was about to occur hurt him some more mister vandemar said mr croup cut off his ear mr vandemar raised his hand it was empty he jerked his arm almost imperceptibly and now he was holding a knife told you one day youd find out what your own liver tastes like he said to richard todays going to be your lucky day he slid the knife blade gently beneath richards earlobe richard felt no painperhaps he thought he had felt too much pain already that day perhaps the blade was too sharp to hurt but he felt the warm blood drip wetly from his ear down his neck door was watching him and her elfin face and huge opalcolored eyes filled his vision he tried to send her mental messages hold out dont let them make you do this ill be fine then mr vandemar put a little pressure on the knife and richard bit back a scream he tried to stop his face from grimacing but another jab from the blade jerked a grimace and a moan from him stop them said door ill open your door islington gestured curtly and mr vandemar sighed piteously and put his knife away the warm blood dripped down richards neck and pooled and puddled in the hollow of his clavicle mr croup walked over to door and unlocked the righthand manacle she stood there rubbing her wrist framed by the pillars she was still chained to the pillar on the left but she now had a certain amount of freedom of movement she put her hand out for the key remember said islington i have your friends door looked at him with utter contempt every inch lord porticos oldest daughter give me the key she said the angel passed her the silver key door called richard dont do it dont set it free we dont matter actually said the marquis i matter very much but i have to agree dont do it she looked from richard to the marquis her eyes lingering on their manacled hands on the heavy chains that bound them to the black iron pillars she looked very vulnerable and then she turned away and walked to the limit of her own chain until she stood in front of the black door made of flint and tarnished silver there was no keyhole she put the palm of her right hand on the door and closed her eyes let the door tell her where it opened what it could do finding those places inside herself that corresponded with the door when she pulled her hand away there was a keyhole that had not been there before a white light lanced out from behind the keyhole sharp and bright as a laser in the candlelit darkness of the hall the girl pushed the silver key into the keyhole there was a pause and then she turned it in the lock something went click and there was a chiming noise and suddenly the door was framed in light when i am gone said the angel very quietly to mr croup and mr vandemar with charm and with kindness and with compassion kill them all howsoever you wish it turned back to the door which door was pulling open it was opening slowly as if there was great resistance she was sweating so your employers leaving said the marquis to mr croup i hope youve both been paid in full croup peered at the marquis and said what well said richard wondering what the marquis was trying to do but willing to play along you dont think youre ever going to see him again do you mr vandemar blinked slowly like an antique camera and said what mr croup scratched his chin the corpsestobe have a point he said to mr vandemar he walked toward the angel who stood arms folded in front of the door sir it might be wise for you to settle up before you commence the next stage of your travels the angel turned and looked down at him as if he were less important than the least speck of dirt then it turned away richard wondered what it was contemplating it is of no matter now said the angel soon all the rewards your revolting little minds can conceive of will be yours when i have my throne jam tomorrow eh said richard dont like jam said mr vandemar makes me belch mr croup waggled a finger at mr vandemar hes welching out on us he said you dont welch on mister croup and mister vandemar me bucko we collect our debts mr vandemar walked over to where mr croup was standing in full he said with interest barked mr croup and meat hooks said mr vandemar from heaven called richard from behind them mr croup and mr vandemar walked toward the contemplative angel hey said mr croup the door had opened only a crack but it was open light flooded through the crack in the door the angel took a step forward it was as if it were dreaming with its eyes wide open the light from the crack in the door bathed its face and it drank it in like wine have no fear it said for when the vastness of creation is mine and they gather about my throne to sing hosannas to my name i shall reward the worthy and cast down those who are hateful in my sight with an effort door wrenched the black door fully open the view through the door was blinding in its intensity a swirling maelstrom of color and light richard squinted his eyes and turned his head away from the glare all vicious orange and retinal purple is that what heaven looks like it seems more like hell and then he felt the wind a candle flew past his head and vanished through the door and then another and then the air was filled with candles all spinning and tumbling through the air heading for the light if was as if the whole room were being sucked through the door it was more than a wind though richard knew that his wrists began to hurt where they were manacledit was as if suddenly he weighed twice as much as he ever had before and then his perspective changed the view through the doorway it was looking down it was not merely the wind that was pulling everything toward the door it was gravity the wind was only the air in the hall being sucked into the place on the other side of the door he wondered what was on the other side of the doorthe surface of a star perhaps or the event horizon of a black hole or something he could not even imagine islington grabbed hold of the pillar beside the door and held on desperately thats not heaven it shouted gray eyes flashing spittle on its perfect lips you mad little witch what have you done door was clutching the chains that held her to the black pillar whiteknuckled there was triumph in her eyes mr vandemar had caught hold of a table leg while mr croup in his turn had caught hold of mr vandemar it wasnt the real key said door triumphantly over the roar of the wind that was just a copy of the key i had hammersmith make in the market but it opened the door screamed the angel no said the girl with the opal eyes distantly i opened a door as far and hard away as i could i opened a door there was no longer any trace of kindness or compassion on the angels face only hatred pure and honest and cold i will kill you it told her like you killed my family i dont think youre going to kill anyone anymore the angel was hanging onto the pillar with pale fingers but its body was at a ninetydegree angle to the room and was most of the way through the door it looked both comical and dreadful it licked its lips stop it it pleaded close the door ill tell you where your sister is shes still alive door flinched and islington was sucked through the door a tiny plummeting figure shrinking as it tumbled into the blinding gulf beyond the pull was getting stronger richard prayed that his chains and manacles would hold he could feel himself being sucked toward the opening and from the corner of his eye he could see the marquis dangling from his chains like a stringpuppet being sucked up by a vacuum cleaner the table the leg of which mr vandemar was holding tightly flew through the air and jammed in the open doorway mr croup and mr vandemar were dangling out of the door mr croup who was clinging quite literally to mr vandemars coattails took a deep breath and began slowly to clamber hand over hand up mr vandemars back the table creaked mr croup looked at door and he smiled like a fox i killed your family said mr croup not him and now imfinallygoing to finish the it was at that moment that the fabric of mr vandemars dark suit gave way mr croup tumbled screaming into the void clutching a long strip of black material mr vandemar looked down at the flailing figure of mr croup as it fell away from them he too looked over at door but there was no menace in his gaze he shrugged as best as one can shrug while holding on to a table leg for dear life and then he said mildly byebye and let go of the table leg silently he plunged through the door into the light shrinking as he fell heading for the tiny figure of mr croup soon the two shapes merged into one little blob of blackness in a sea of churning purple and white and orange light and then the black dot too was gone it made some sort of sense richard thought they were a team after all it was getting harder to breathe richard felt giddy and lightheaded the table in the doorway splintered and was sucked away through the door one of richards manacles popped open and his right arm whipped free he grabbed the chain holding the left hand and gripped it as tightly as he could grateful that the broken finger was on the hand that was still in the manacle even so red and blue flashes of pain were shooting up his left arm he could hear himself distantly shouting in pain he could not breathe white blotches of light exploded behind his eyes he could feel the chain beginning to give way the sound of the black door slamming closed filled his whole world richard fell violently back against the cold iron pillar and slumped to the floor there was silence then in the hallsilence and utter darkness in the great hall under the earth richard closed his eyes it made no difference to the darkness and he opened his eyes once more the hush was broken by the marquiss voice asking drily so where did you send them and then richard heard a girls voice talking he knew it had to be doors but it sounded so young like the voice of a tiny child at bedtime at the end of a long and exhausting day i dont know a long way away im very tired now i door said the marquis snap out of it it was good that he was saying it thought richard somebody had to and richard could no longer remember how to talk there was a click then in the darkness the sound of a manacle opening followed by the sound of chains falling against a metal pillar then the sound of a match being struck a candle was lit it burned weakly and flickered in the thin air fire and fleet and candlelight thought richard and he could not remember why door walked unsteadily to the marquis holding her candle she reached out a hand touched his chains and his manacles clicked open he rubbed his wrists then she walked over to richard and touched his single remaining manacle it fell open door sighed then and sat down beside him he reached out his good arm and cradled her head holding her close to him he rocked her slowly back and forth crooning a wordless lullaby it was cold cold there in the angels empty hall but soon the warmth of unconsciousness reached out and enveloped them both the marquis de carabas watched the sleeping children the idea of sleepof returning even for a short time to a state so horribly close to deathscared him more than he would have ever believed but eventually even he put his head down on his arm and closed his eyes and then there were none eighteen the lady serpentine who was but for olympia the oldest of the seven sisters walked through the labyrinth beyond down street her head held high her white leather boots squashing through the dank mud this was after all the furthest she had been from her house in over a hundred years her waspwaisted majordomo dressed from head to foot all in black leather walked ahead of her holding a large carriagelamp two of serpentines other women similarly dressed walked behind her at a respectful distance the ripped lace train of serpentines dress dragged in the mire behind her but she paid it no mind she saw something glinting in the lamplight ahead of them and beside it a dark and bulky shape there it is she said the two women who had been walking behind her hurried forward splashing through the marsh and as serpentines butler approached bringing with her a swinging circle of warm light the shape resolved into objects the light had been glinting from a long bronze spear hunters body twisted and bloody and wretched lay on its back halfburied in the mud in a large pool of scarlet gore its legs trapped beneath the body of an enormous boarlike creature her eyes were closed serpentines women hauled the body out from under the beast and lay it in the mud serpentine knelt in the wet mire and ran one finger down hunters cold cheek until it reached her bloodblackened lips where she let it linger for some moments then she stood up bring the spear said serpentine one of the women picked up hunters body the other pulled the spear from the carcass of the beast and put it over her shoulder and then the four figures turned and went back the way they had come a silent procession deep beneath the world the lamplight flickered on serpentines ravaged face as she walked but it revealed no emotion of any kind neither happy nor sad nineteen for a moment upon waking he had no idea at all who he was it was a tremendously liberating feeling as if he were free to be whatever he wanted to be he could be anyone at allable to try on any identity he could be a man or a woman a rat or a bird a monster or a god and then someone made a rustling noise and he woke up the rest of the way and in waking he found that he was richard mayhew whoever that was whatever that meant he was richard mayhew and he did not know where he was there was crisp linen pressed against his face he hurt all over in some placesthe little finger on his left hand for examplemore than others someone was nearby richard could hear breathing and the hesitant rustling noises of a person in the same room he was in trying to be discreet richard raised his head and discovered in the raising more places that hurt some of them hurt very badly far awayrooms and rooms awaypeople were singing the song was so distant and quiet he knew he would lose it if he opened his eyes a deep melodious chanting he opened his eyes the room was small and dimly lit he was on a low bed and the rustling sound he had heard was made by a cowled figure in a black robe with his back to richard the black figure was dusting the room with an incongruously brightly colored feather duster where am i asked richard the black figure nearly dropped its feather duster then it turned revealing a very nervous thin dark brown face would you like some water the black friar asked in the manner of one who has been told that if the patient wakes up he is to be asked if he would like some water and has been repeating it to himself over and over for the last forty minutes to make sure that he didnt forget i and richard realized that he was most dreadfully thirsty he sat up in the bed yes i would thank you very much the friar poured some water from a battered metal jug into a battered metal cup and passed it to richard richard sipped the water slowly restraining the impulse to gulp it down it was crystal cold and clear and tasted like diamonds and ice richard looked down at himself his clothes were gone he had been dressed in a long robe like one of the black friars habits but gray his broken finger had been splinted and neatly bandaged he raised a finger to his ear there was a bandage on it and what felt like stitches beneath the bandage youre one of the black friars said richard yes sir how did i get here where are my friends the friar pointed to the corridor wordlessly and nervously richard got out of the bed he checked under his gray robe he was naked his torso and legs were covered in a variety of deep indigo and purple bruises all of which seemed to have been rubbed with some kind of ointment it smelt like cough syrup and buttered toast his right knee was bandaged he wondered where his clothes were there were sandals beside the bed and he put them on then he walked out into the corridor the abbot was coming down the passage toward him holding onto the arm of brother fuliginous his blind eyes pearlescent in the darkness beneath his cowl you are awake then richard mayhew said the abbot how do you feel richard made a face my hand we set your finger it had been broken we tended your bruises and your cuts and you needed rest which we gave you wheres door and the marquis how did we get here i had you brought here said the abbot the two friars began to walk down the corridor and richard walked with them hunter said richard did you bring back her body the abbot shook his head there was no body only the beast ah um my clothes they came to the door of a cell much like the one richard had woken in door was sitting on the edge of her bed reading a copy of mansfield park that richard was certain the friars had not previously known that they had she too wore a gray monks robe which was much much too big for her almost comically so she looked up as they entered hello she said youve been asleep for ages how are you feeling fine i think how are you she smiled it was not a very convincing smile a bit shaky she admitted there was a loud rattling in the corridor and richard turned to see the marquis de carabas being wheeled toward them in a rickety and antique wheelchair the wheelchair was being pushed by a large black friar richard wondered how the marquis managed to make being pushed around in a wheelchair look like a romantic and swashbuckling thing to do the marquis honored them with an enormous smile good evening friends he said now said the abbot that you are all here we must talk he led them to a large room warmed by a roaring scrap wood fire they arranged themselves around a table the abbot gestured for them all to sit down he felt for his chair and sat down in it then he sent brother fuliginous and brother tenebrae out of the room so said the abbot to business where is islington door shrugged as far away as i could send him halfway across space and time i see said the abbot and then he said good why didnt you warn us about him asked richard that was not our responsibility richard snorted what happens now he asked them all the abbot said nothing happens in what way asked door well you wanted to avenge your family and you have and youve sent everyone involved off to some distant corner of nowhere i mean no ones going to try and kill you anymore are they not for right now said door seriously and you richard asked the marquis de carabas have you got what you wanted the marquis nodded i believe so my debt to lord portico has been paid in full and the lady door owes me a significant favor richard looked to door she nodded so what about me he asked well said door we couldnt have done it without you thats not what i meant what about getting me back home the marquis raised an eyebrow who do you think she isthe wizard of oz we cant send you home this is your home door said i tried to tell you that before richard there has to be a way said richard and he slammed his left hand down on the table hard for emphasis it hurt his finger but he kept his face composed and then he said ow but he said it very quietly because he had gone through much worse where is the key asked the abbot richard inclined his head door he said she shook her pixy head i dont have it she told him i slipped it back into your pocket at the last market when you brought the curry richard opened his mouth and then he closed it again then he opened it and said you mean when i told croup and vandemar that i had it and they were welcome to search me i had it she nodded he remembered the hard object in his back pocket on down street remembered her hugging him on the ship the abbot reached out his wrinkled brown fingers picked up a small bell from the table which he shook summoning brother fuliginous bring me the warriors trousers he said fuliginous nodded and left im no warrior said richard the abbot smiled gently you killed the beast he explained almost regretfully you are the warrior richard folded his arms exasperated so after all this i still dont get to go home but as a consolation prize ive made it onto some kind of archaic underground honors list the marquis looked unsympathetic you cant go back to london above a few individuals manage a kind of halflifeyouve met iliaster and lear but thats the best you could hope for and it isnt a good life door reached out a hand and touched richards arm im sorry she told him but look at all the good youve done you got the key for us well he asked what was the point of that you just forged a new key brother fuliginous reappeared carrying richards jeans they were ripped and covered in mud and splashed with dried blood and they stank the friar handed the trousers to the abbot who commenced to go through the pockets door smiled sweetly i couldnt have had hammersmith copy it without the original she reminded him the abbot cleared his throat you are all very stupid people he told them graciously and you do not know anything at all he held up the silver key it glinted in the firelight richard passed the ordeal of the key he is its master until he returns it to our keeping the key has power its the key to heaven said richard unsure of what the abbot was getting at of what point he was trying to make the old mans voice was deep and melodious the key is the key to all reality if richard wants to return to london above then the key will take him back to london above its that simple asked richard the old man nodded his blind head beneath the shadows of his cowl then when could we do this as soon as you are ready said the abbot the friars had washed and repaired his clothes and returned them to him brother fuliginous led him through the abbey up a vertiginous series of ladders and steps up into the bell tower there was a heavy wooden trapdoor in the top of the tower brother fuliginous unlocked it and the two men pushed through it and found themselves in a narrow tunnel thickly cobwebbed with metal rungs set in the side of one wall they climbed the rungs going up for what seemed like thousands of feet and came out on a dusty underground station platform nightingale lane said the old signs on the wall brother fuliginous wished richard well and told him to wait there and he would be collected and then he clambered down the side of the wall and he was gone richard sat on the platform for twenty minutes he wondered what kind of station this was it seemed neither abandoned like british museum nor real like blackfriars instead it was a ghoststation an imaginary place forgotten and strange he wondered why the marquis had not said goodbye when richard had asked door she had said that she didnt know but that maybe goodbyes were something else like comforting people at which the marquis wasnt much good then she told him that she had something in her eye and she gave him a paper with his instructions on and she went away something waved from the darkness of the tunnel something white it was a handkerchief on a stick hello called richard the featherwrapped roundness of old bailey stepped out of the gloom looking selfconscious and ill at ease he was waving richards handkerchief and he was sweating its me little flag he said pointing to the handkerchief im glad its come in useful old bailey grinned uneasily right just wanted to say something i got for you here you go he thrust a hand into a coat pocket and pulled out a long black feather with a bluepurplegreen sheen to it red thread had been wound around the quill end of the feather urn well thanks said richard unsure of what he ought to do with it its a feather explained old bailey and a good one memento souvenir keepsake and its free a gift me to you bit of a thankyou yes well very kind of you richard put it in his pocket a warm wind blew through the tunnel a train was coming thisll be your train now said old bailey i dont take trains me give me a good roof any day he shook richards hand and fled the train pulled in at the station its headlights were turned off and there was nobody standing in the drivers compartment in the front it came to a full stop all the carriages were dark and no doors opened richard knocked on the door in front of him hoping that it was the correct one the door gaped open flooding the imaginary station with warm yellow light two small elderly gentlemen holding long coppercolored bugles stepped off the train and onto the platform richard recognized them dagvard and halvard from earls court although he could no longer recall if he had ever known which gentleman was which they put their bugles to their lips and performed a ragged but sincere fanfare richard got onto the train and they walked in behind him the earl was sitting at the end of the carriage petting the enormous irish wolfhound the jester tooley thought richard that was his namestood beside him other than that and the two menatarms the carriage was deserted who is it asked the earl its him sire said his jester richard mayhew the one who killed the beast the warrior the earl scratched his redgray beard thoughtfully bring him here richard walked down to the earls chair the earl eyed him up and down pensively and gave no indication that he remembered ever meeting richard before thought youd be taller said the earl at length sorry well better get on with it the old man stood up and addressed the empty car good evening here to honor young mayflower what was it the bard said and then he recited in a rhythmic alliterative boom crimson the cuts in the carcass fast falls the foe dauntless devout defender bravest of boys not really a boy anymore though is he tooley not particularly your grace the earl reached out his hand give me your sword boy richard put his hand to his belt and pulled out the knife that hunter had given him will this do he asked yesyes said the old man taking the knife from him kneel said tooley in a stage whisper pointing to the train floor richard went down on one knee the earl tapped him gently on each shoulder with the knife arise he bellowed sir richard of maybury with this knife i do give to you the freedom of the underside may you be allowed to walk freely without let or hindrance and so on and so forth et cetera blah blah blah he trailed of vaguely thanks said richard its mayhew actually but the train was coming to a stop this is where you get off said the earl he gave richard his knifehunters knifeonce more patted him on the back and pointed toward the door the place that richard got off was not an underground station it was above ground and it reminded richard a little of st pancras stationthere was something similarly oversized and mockgothic about the architecture but there was also a wrongness that somehow marked it as part of london below the light was that strange strained gray one only sees shortly before dawn and for a few moments after sunset the times when the world washes out into gloom and color and distance become impossible to judge there was a man sitting on a wooden bench watching him and richard approached him cautiously unable to tell in the gloaming who the man was whether it was someone he had met before richard was still holding hunters knifehis knife and now he gripped the hilt more tightly for reassurance the man looked up as richard approached and he sprang to his feet he tugged at his forelock something richard had previously only seen done on television adaptations of classic novels he looked both comical and unpleasant richard recognized the man as the lord ratspeaker wellwell yesyes said the ratspeaker agitatedly beginning in midsentence just to say the girl anaesthesia no hard feelings the rats are your friends still and the ratspeakers you come to us well do you all right thanks said richard anaesthesia will take him he thought shes expendable the lord ratspeaker fumbled on the bench and presented richard with a black vinyl zipup sports bag it was extremely familiar its all there everything take a look richard opened the bag all his possessions were in there including on top of some neatly folded jeans his wallet he zipped the bag up threw it over his shoulder and walked away from the man without a thankyou or a backward glance richard walked out of the station and down some gray stone steps all was silent all was empty dead autumn leaves blew across an open court a flurry of yellow and ochre and brown a sudden burst of muted color in the dim light richard crossed the court and walked down some steps into an underpass there was a fluttering in the halfdark and warily he turned there were about a dozen of them in the corridor behind him and they slipped toward him almost silently just a rustle of dark velvet and here and there the clink of silver jewelery the rustle of the leaves had been so much louder than these pale women they watched him with hungry eyes he was scared then he had the knife true but he could no more fight with it than he could jump across the thames he hoped that if they attacked he might be able to scare them away with it he could smell honeysuckle and lily of the valley and musk lamia edged her way to the front of the velvets and stepped forward richard raised the knife nervously remembering the chilly passion of her embrace how pleasant it was and how cold she smiled at him and inclined her head sweetly then she kissed her fingertips and blew the kiss toward richard he shivered something fluttered in the darkness of the underpass and when he looked again there was nothing but shadows through the underpass and richard walked up some steps and found himself at the top of a small grassy hill it was dawn and he could just make out details of the countryside around him almost leafless oak and ash and beech trees readily identifiable by the shapes of their trunks a wide clean river meandered gently through the green countryside as he looked around he realized that he was on an island of some kindtwo smaller rivers ran into the larger one cutting him off on his little hill from the mainland he knew then without knowing how but with total certainty that he was still in london but london as it had been perhaps three thousand years ago or more before ever the first stone of the first human habitation was laid upon a stone he unzipped his bag and put the knife away in it beside his wallet then he zipped it up again the sky was starting to lighten but the light was odd it was younger somehow than the sunlight he was familiar withpurer perhaps an orangered sun rose in the east where docklands would one day be and richard watched the dawn breaking over forests and marshes that he kept thinking of as greenwich and kent and the sea hello said door he had not seen her approach she was wearing different clothes beneath her battered brown leather jacket they were still layered and ripped and patched though in taffeta and lace and silk and brocade her short red hair shone in the dawn like burnished copper hello said richard she stood beside him and twined her small fingers into his right hand the hand that was holding the sports bag where are we he asked on the awesome and terrible island of westminster she told him it sounded as if she were quoting from somewhere but he did not believe he had ever heard that phrase before they began to walk together over the long grass wet and white with melting frost their footprints left a dark green trail in the grass behind them showing where they had come from look said door with the angel gone theres a lot of sorting out to do in london below and theres only me to do it my father wanted to unite london below i suppose i ought to try to finish what he started they were walking north away from the thames hand in hand white seagulls wheeled and called in the sky above them richard you heard what islington said to us about keeping my sister alive just in case i may not be the only one of my family left and youve saved my life more than once she paused and then all in a rush blurted youve been a really good friend to me richard and ive sort of got to like having you around please dont go he squeezed her hand in his gently well he said ive sort of got to like having you around too but i dont belong in this world in my london well the most dangerous thing you ever have to watch out for is a taxi in a bit of a hurry i like you too i like you an awful lot but i have to go home she looked up at him with her oddcolored eyes green and blue and flame then we wont ever see each other again she said i suppose we wont thanks for everything you did she said seriously then she threw her arms around him and she squeezed him tightly enough that the bruises on his ribs hurt and he hugged her back just as tightly making all of his bruises complain violently and he simply didnt care well he said eventually it was very nice knowing you she was blinking hard he wondered if she were going to tell him again that she had something in her eye instead she said are you ready he nodded have you got the key he put down his bag and rummaged in his back pocket with his good hand he took out the key and handed it to her she held it out in front of her as if it were being inserted in an imaginary door okay she said just walk dont look back he began walking down a small hill away from the blue waters of the thames a gray gull swooped past at the bottom of the hill he looked back she stood at the top of the hill silhouetted by the rising sun her cheeks were glistening the orange sunlight gleamed on the key door turned it with one decisive motion the world went dark and a low roar filled richards head like the maddened growling of a thousand enraged beasts twenty the world went dark and a low roar filled richards head like the maddened growling of a thousand enraged beasts he blinked at the darkness held tight to his bag he wondered if he had been foolish putting the knife away some people brushed past him in the dark richard started away from them there were steps in front of him richard began to ascend and as he did so the world began to resolve to take shape and to reform the growling was the roar of traffic and he was coming out of an underpass in trafalgar square the sky was the perfect untroubled blue of a television screen tuned to a dead channel it was midmorning on a warm october day and he stood in the square holding his bag and blinking at the sunlight black taxis and red buses and multicolored cars roared and careered about the square while tourists threw handfuls of pigeon feed down for the legions of tubby pigeons and took their snapshots of nelsons column and the huge landseer lions that flanked it he walked through the square wondering if he was real or not the japanese tourists ignored him he tried talking to a pretty fairhaired girl who laughed and shook her head and said something in a language richard thought might have been italian but was actually finnish there was a small child of indeterminate sex staring at some pigeons while orally demolishing a chocolate bar he crouched down next to it ur hello kiddie said richard the child sucked its chocolate bar intently and gave no indication of recognizing richard as another human being hello repeated richard a slight note of desperation creeping into his voice can you see me kiddie hello two small eyes glared at him from a chocolate covered face and then its lower lip began to tremble and the child fled throwing its arms around the legs of the nearest adult female and wailing mommy this mans bothering me hes bothering me the childs mother turned on richard with a formidable scowl what are you doing she demanded bothering our leslie there are places for people like you richard began to smile it was a huge and happy smile i really am most frightfully sorry he said grinning like a cheshire cat and then clutching his bag he ran through trafalgar square accompanied by bursts of sudden pigeons who took to the air in astonishment he took his cashcard out of his wallet and he put it into the cash machine it recognized his fourdigit pin number advised him to keep it a secret and not disclose it to anyone and asked what kind of service he would like he asked for cash and it gave him cash in abundance he punched the air in delight and then embarrassed pretended that he had been hailing a cab a cab stopped for himit stoppedfor himand he climbed in and sat in the back and beamed he asked the driver to take him to his office and when the cab driver pointed out that it would almost be quicker to walk richard grinned even wider and said he did not care and as soon as they were underway he askedpractically beggedthe cab driver to regale him richard with his opinions on innercity traffic problems how best to deal with crime and thorny political issues of the day the cab driver accused richard of taking the mickey and sulked for all of the fiveminute journey up the strand richard did not care he tipped the man ridiculously anyway and then he walked into his office as he entered the building he felt the smile begin to leave his face each step he took left him more anxious more uneasy what if he still had no job what did it matter if small chocolatecovered children and cab drivers could see him if it turned out that by some appalling mischance he remained invisible to his colleagues mr figgis the security guard looked up from a copy of naughty teenage nymphets which he had hidden inside his copy of the sun and he sniffed morning mister mayhew he said it was not a welcoming morning it was the kind of morning that implied that the speaker really did not care if the recipient lived or diednor indeed for that matter if it was even morning figgis exclaimed richard in delight and hello to you too mister figgis you exceptional security guard nobody had ever said anything remotely like that to mr figgis before not even naked ladies in his imagination figgis stared suspiciously at richard until he got into the elevator and vanished from sight then he returned his attention to the naughty teenage nymphets none of whom he was beginning to suspect was ever likely to see twentynine again lollipops or no lollipops richard got out of the elevator and walked slightly hesitantly down the corridor everything will be all right he told himself if only my desk is there if my desk is there everything will be fine he walked into the large room full of cubicles he had worked in for three years people were working at desks talking on telephones rummaging through filing cabinets drinking bad tea and worse coffee it was his office and there was the place by the window where his desk had once been which was now occupied by a gray cluster of filing cabinets and a yucca plant he was about to turn and run when someone handed him a cup of tea in a styrofoam cup the return of the prodigal eh said gary here you go hello gary said richard wheres my desk this way said gary how was majorca majorca dont you always go to majorca asked gary they were walking up the back stairs that led to the fourth floor not this time said richard i was going to say said gary not much of a tan no agreed richard well you know i needed a change gary nodded he pointed to a door that had for as long as richard had been there been the door to the executive files and supplies room a change well youve certainly got one now and may i be the first to congratulate you the plaque on the door said r b mayhew junior partner lucky bastard said gary affectionately he wandered off and richard went through the door utterly bemused the room was no longer an executive supplies and file room it had been emptied of files and supplies and painted in gray and black and white and recarpeted in the center of the office was a large desk he examined it it was unmistakably his very own desk his trolls had all been neatly put away in one of the desk drawers and he took them all out and arranged them around the office he had his own window with a nice view of the sludgebrown river and the south bank of the thames beyond there was even a large green plant with huge waxy leaves of the kind that looks artificial but isnt his old dusty creamcolored computer terminal had been replaced with a much sleeker cleaner black computer terminal which took up less desk space he walked over to the window and sipped his tea staring out at the dirty brown river youve found everything all right then he looked up crisp and efficient sylvia the mds pa was standing in the doorway she smiled when she saw him um yes look there are things i have to take care of at home dyou think itd be all right if took the rest of the day off and suit yourself you arent meant to be back in till tomorrow anyway im not he asked right sylvia frowned what happened to your finger i broke it he told her she looked at his hand with concern you werent in a fight were you me she grinned just teasing i suppose you shut it in a door thats what my sister did no richard began to admit i was in a fi sylvia raised an eyebrow a door he finished lamely he went to the building he had once lived in by taxi he was not sure that he trusted himself to travel by the underground not yet having no door key he knocked at the door of his flat and was more than disappointed when it was opened by the woman richard last remembered meeting or rather failing to meet in his bathroom he introduced himself as the previous tenant and quickly established that a he richard no longer lived there and b she mrs buchanan had no idea what had happened to any of his personal possessions richard took some notes and then he said goodbye very nicely and took another black taxi to go and see a man in a camelhair coat the smooth man in the camelhair coat was not wearing his camelhair coat and was in fact a good deal less smooth than the last time richard had encountered him they were sitting in his office and he had listened to richards list of complaints with the expression of someone who has recently and accidentally swallowed whole a live spider and has just begun to feel it squirm well yes he admitted after looking at the files there does seem to have been some kind of problem now you mention it i cant quite see how it could have happened i dont think it matters how it happened said richard reasonably the fact of the matter is that while i was away for a few weeks you rented my apartment to he consulted his notes george and adele buchanan who have no intention of leaving the man closed the file well he said mistakes do happen human error im afraid theres nothing we can do about it the old richard the one who had lived in what was now the buchanans home would have crumbled at this point apologized for being a nuisance and gone away instead richard said really nothing you can do about it you rented a property i was legally renting from your company to someone else and in the process lost all my personal possessions and theres nothing you can do about it now i happen to think and im sure my lawyer will also think that there is a great deal you can do about it the man without the camelhair coat looked as if the spider was beginning to crawl back up his throat but we dont have any other vacant apartments like yours in the building he said theres only the penthouse suite that richard told the man coldly would be fine the man relaxed for living accommodation now said richard lets talk about compensation for my lost possessions the new apartment was much nicer than the one he had left behind it had more windows and a balcony a spacious lounge and a proper spare bedroom richard prowled it dissatisfied the manwithoutacamelhaircoat had extremely grudgingly had the apartment furnished with a bed a sofa several chairs and a television set richard put hunters knife on the mantelpiece he bought a takeaway curry from the indian restaurant across the road sat on the carpeted floor of his new apartment and ate it wondering if he had ever really eaten curry late at night in a streetmarket held on the deck of a gunship moored by tower bridge it did not seem very likely now that he thought about it the doorbell rang he got up and answered the door we found a lot of your stuff mr mayhew said the man who was once more wearing his camelhair coat turned out itd been put into storage right bring the stuff in lads a couple of burly men hauled in several large wooden packing cases filled with richards stuff and deposited them on the carpet in the middle of the living room thanks said richard he reached into the first box unwrapped the first papercovered object which turned out to be a framed photograph of jessica he stared at it for some moments and then he put it down again in the case he found the box with his clothes in it removed them and put them away in his bedroom but the other boxes sat untouched in the middle of the living room floor as the days went on he felt increasingly guilty about not unpacking them but he did not unpack them he was in his office sitting at his desk staring out of the window when the intercom buzzed richard said sylvia the md wants a meeting in his office in twenty minutes to discuss the wandsworth report ill be there he said then because he had nothing else to do for the next ten minutes he picked up an orange troll and menaced a slightly smaller greenhaired troll with it i am the greatest warrior of london below prepare to die he said in a dangerous trollish voice waggling the orange troll then he picked up the greenhaired troll and said in a smaller trollish voice aha but first you shall drink the nice cup of tea someone knocked on the door and guiltily he put down the trolls come in the door opened and jessica came in and stood in the doorway she looked nervous he had forgotten quite how beautiful she was hello richard she said hello jess said richard and then he corrected himself sorryjessica she smiled and tossed her hair oh jess is fine she said and looked as if she almost meant it jessicajess nobodys called me jess for ages i rather miss it so said richard what brings do i have the honor you um just wanted to see you really he was not sure what he ought to say thats nice he said she closed the door to his office and took a few steps toward him richard you know something strange i remember calling the engagement off but i hardly remember what we were arguing about no its not important though is it she looked around the office you got a promotion yes im happy for you she put a hand into the pocket of her coat and pulled out a small brown box she put it down on richards desk he opened the box although he knew what was inside it its our engagement ring i thought that well maybe id give it back to you and then well if things worked out well perhaps one day youd give it back to me it glittered in the sunlight the most money he had ever spent on anything he closed the box and gave it back to her you keep it jessica he said and then im sorry she bit her lower lip did you meet someone he hesitated he thought of lamia and hunter and anaesthesia and even door but none of them were someones in the way that she meant no no one else he said and then realizing it was true as he said it ive just changed thats all his intercom buzzed richard were waiting for you he pressed the button be right down sylvia he looked at jessica she said nothing perhaps there was nothing she could trust herself to say she walked away and she closed the door quietly behind her richard picked up the papers he would need with one hand he ran the other hand across his face as if he were wiping something away sorrow perhaps or tears or jessica he started taking the tube again to and from work although he soon found that he had stopped buying newspapers to read on his journey in the morning and the evening and instead of reading he would scan the faces of the other people on the train faces of every kind and color and wonder if they were all from london above wonder what went on behind their eyes during the evening rush hour a few days after his encounter with jessica he thought he saw lamia across the carriage with her back to him her dark hair piled high on her head and her dress long and black his heart began to pound in his chest he pushed his way toward her through the crowded compartment as he got closer the train pulled into a station the doors hissed open and she stepped off but it was not lamia just another young london gothgirl he realized disappointed off for a night on the town one saturday afternoon he saw a large brown rat sitting on top of the plastic garbage cans at the back of newton mansions cleaning its whiskers and looking as if it owned the world at richards approach it leapt down onto the pavement and waited in the shadow of the garbage cans staring up at him with wary beadblack eyes richard crouched down hello he said gently do we know each other the rat made no kind of response that richard was able to perceive but it did not run away my name is richard mayhew he continued in a low voice im not actually a ratspeaker but i um know a few rats well ive met some and i wondered if you were familiar with the lady door he heard a shoe scrape behind him and he turned to see the buchanans looking at him curiously have you lost something asked mrs buchanan richard heard but ignored her husbands gruff whisper of just his marbles no said richard honestly i was um saying hello to a the rat scurried off and away was that a rat barked george buchanan ill complain to the council its a disgrace but thats london for you isnt it yes agreed richard it was it really was richards possessions continued to sit untouched in the wooden packing cases in the middle of the living room floor he had not yet turned on the television he would come home at night and eat then he would stand at the window looking out over london at the cars and the rooftops and the lights as the late autumn twilight turned into night and the lights came on all over the city he would watch standing alone in his darkened flat until the citys lights began to be turned off eventually reluctantly he would undress and climb into bed and go to sleep sylvia came into his office one friday afternoon he was opening envelopes using his knifehunters knifeas a letteropener richard she said i was wondering are you getting out much these days he shook his head well a bunch of us are going out this evening do you fancy coming along um sure he said yes id love it he hated it there were eight of them sylvia and her young man who had something to do with vintage cars gary from corporate accounts who had recently broken up with his girlfriend due to what gary persisted in describing as a slight misunderstanding several perfectly nice people and friends of nice people and the new girl from computer services first they saw a film on the huge screen of the odeon leicester square the good guy won in the end and there were plenty of explosions and flying objects on the way sylvia decided that richard should sit next to the girl from computer services as she explained she was new to the company and did not know many people they walked down to old compton street on the edge of soho where the tawdry and the chic sit side by side to the benefit of both and they ate at la reache filling up on couscous and dozens of marvelous plates of exotic food which covered their table and spilled over onto an unused table nearby and they walked from there to a small pub sylvia liked in nearby berwick street and they had a few drinks and they chatted the new girl from computer services smiled at richard a lot as the evening went on and he had nothing at all to say to her he bought a round of drinks for the party and the girl from computer services helped him carry them from the bar back to their table gary went off to the mens room and the girl from computer services came and sat next to richard taking his place richards head was filled with the clink of glasses and the blare of the jukebox and the sharp smell of beer and spilt bacardi and cigarette smoke he tried to listen to the conversations going on at the table and he found that he could no longer concentrate on what anyone was saying and which was worse that he was not interested in any of what he was able to hear and it came to him then as clearly and as certainly as if he had been watching it on the big screen at the odeon leicester square the rest of his life he would go home tonight with the girl from computer services and they would make gentle love and tomorrow it being saturday they would spend the morning in bed and then they would get up and together they would remove his possessions from the packing cases and put them away in a year or a little less he would marry the girl from computer services and get another promotion and they would have two children a boy and a girl and they would move out to the suburbs to harrow or croydon or hampstead or even as far away as distant reading and it would not be a bad life he knew that too sometimes there is nothing you can do when gary came back from the toilet he looked around in puzzlement everyone was there except dick he asked has anyone seen richard the girl from computer services shrugged gary went outside to berwick street the cold of the night air was like a splash of water to his face he could taste winter in the air he called dick hey richard over here richard was leaning against a wall in the shadows just getting a breath of fresh air are you all right asked gary yes said richard no i dont know well said gary that covers your options do you want to talk about it richard looked at him seriously youll laugh at me ill do that anyway richard looked at gary then gary was relieved to see him smile and he knew that they were still friends gary looked back at the pub then he put his hands into his coat pockets come on he said lets walk you can get it off your chest then ill laugh at you bastard said richard sounding a lot more like richard than he had in recent weeks its what friends are for they began to amble off under the streetlights look gary richard began do you ever wonder if this is all there is what richard gestured vaguely taking in everything work home the pub meeting girls living in the city life is that all there is i think that sums it up yes said gary richard sighed well he said for a start i didnt go to majorca i mean i really didnt go to majorca richard talked as they walked up and down the warren of tiny soho back streets between regent street and the charing cross road he talked and talked beginning with finding a girl bleeding on the pavement and trying to help because he couldnt just leave her there and what happened next and when they got too cold to walk they went into an allnight greasy spoon cafe it was a proper one the kind that cooked everything in lard and served cups of serious tea in large chipped white mugs shiny with bacon grease richard and gary sat and richard talked while gary listened and then they ordered fried eggs and baked beans and toast and sat and ate them while richard continued to talk and gary continued to listen they mopped up the last of their egg yolks with the toast they drank more tea until eventually richard said and then door did something with the key and i was back again in london above well the real london and well you know the rest there was a silence thats all said richard he finished his tea gary scratched his head look he said at length is this real not some kind of horrible joke i mean somebody with a camera isnt about to leap out from behind a screen or something and tell me im on candid camera i sincerely hope not said richard you do you believe me gary looked at the bill on their table counted out pound coins and dropped them onto the formica where they sat beside a plastic tomato ketchup container in the shape of an oversized tomato old ketchup caked black about its nozzle i believe that well something happened to you obviously look more to the point do you believe it richard stared up at him there were dark circles beneath richards eyes do i believe it i dont know anymore i did i was there there was a part in there when you turned up you know you didnt mention that before it was a pretty horrid part you told me that id gone mad and i was just wandering around london hallucinating they walked out of the cafe and walked south toward piccadilly well said gary you must admit it sounds more likely than your magical london underneath where the people who fall through the cracks go ive passed the people who fall through the cracks richard they sleep in shop doorways all down the strand they dont go to a special london they freeze to death in the winter richard said nothing gary continued i think maybe you got some kind of blow on the head or maybe some kind of shock when jessica chucked you for a while you went a little crazy then you got better richard shivered you know what scares me i think you could be right so life isnt exciting continued gary great give me boredom at least i know where im going to eat and sleep tonight ill still have a job on monday yeah he turned and looked at richard richard nodded hesitantly yeah gary looked at his watch bloody hell he exclaimed its after two oclock lets hope there are still a few taxis about they walked into brewer street at the piccadilly end of soho wandering past the lights of the peep shows and the strip clubs gary was talking about taxis he was not saying anything original or even interesting he was simply fulfilling his obligation as a londoner to grumble about taxis had his light on and everything he was saying i told him where i wanted to go he said sorry im on my way home i said where do all you taxi drivers live anyway and why dont any of you live near me the trick is to get in first then tell them you live south of the river i mean what was he trying to tell me the way he was carrying on battersea might as well have been in bloody katmandu richard had tuned him out when they reached windmill street richard crossed the road and stared into the window of the vintage magazine shop examining the cartoonish models of forgotten film stars and the old posters and comics and magazines on display it had been a glimpse into a world of adventure and imagination and it was not true he told himself that so what do you think gary asked richard jerked back to the present of what gary realized richard had not heard a word he had said he said it again if there arent any taxis we could get night buses yeah said richard great fine gary grimaced you worry me sorry they walked down windmill street toward piccadilly richard thrust his hands deep into his pockets he looked puzzled for a moment and pulled out a rather crumpled black crows feather with red thread tied around the quill whats that asked gary its a he stopped its just a feather youre right its only rubbish he dropped the feather in the gutter at the curb and did not look back gary hesitated then he said picking his words with care have you thought about seeing somebody see somebody look im not crazy gary are you sure about that a taxi came toward them yellow forhire light burning no said richard honestly heres a taxi you take it ill take the next one thanks gary waved down the taxi and climbed into the back before telling the driver that he wished to go to battersea he pulled down the window and as the taxi pulled out he said richardthis is reality get used to it its all there is see you on monday richard waved at him and watched the taxi drive away then he turned around and walked slowly away from the lights of piccadilly back up toward brewer street there was no longer a feather by the curb richard paused beside an old woman fast asleep in a shop doorway she was covered with a ripped old blanket and her few possessionstwo small junkfilled cardboard boxes and a dirty oncewhite umbrellawere tied together with string beside her and the string was tied around her wrist to keep anyone from stealing them while she slept she wore a wool hat of no particular color he pulled out his wallet found a tenpound note and bent down to slide the folded note into the womans hand her eyes opened and she jerked awake she blinked at the money with old eyes whats this she said sleepily displeased at having been woken keep it said richard she unfolded the money then pushed it up her sleeve whatchyouwant she asked richard suspiciously nothing said richard i really dont want anything nothing at all and then he realized how true that was and how dreadful a thing it had become have you ever got everything you ever wanted and then realized it wasnt what you wanted at all cant say that i have she said picking the sleep from the corner of her eyes i thought i wanted this said richard i thought i wanted a nice normal life i mean maybe i am crazy i mean maybe but if this is all there is then i dont want to be sane you know she shook her head he reached into his inside pocket you see this he said he held up the knife hunter gave this to me as she died he told her dont hurt me said the old lady i aint done nuffing he heard a strange intensity in his own voice i wiped her blood from the blade a hunter looks after her weapons the earl knighted me with it he gave me the freedom of the underside i dont know anyfing about that she said please put it away thats a good lad richard hefted the knife then he lunged toward the brick wall next to the doorway in which the woman had been sleeping he slashed three rimes once horizontally twice vertically what you doin asked the woman warily making a door he told her she sniffed you ought to put that thing away if the police see you theyll run you in for offensive weapons richard looked at the outline of a doorway he had scratched on the wall he put his knife back into his pocket and he began to hammer on the wall with his fists hey is there anyone there can you hear me its merichard door someone he hurt his hands but he kept banging and flailing at the brickwork and then the madness left him and he stopped sorry he said to the old lady she did not answer she had either gone back to sleep or more probably pretended to go back to sleep elderly snores real or feigned came from the doorway richard sat down on the pavement and wondered how someone could make such a mess of their life as he had made of his then he looked back at the doorway he had scratched on the wall there was a doorshaped hole in the wall where he had scratched his outline there was a man standing in the doorway with his arms folded theatrically he stood there until he was certain that richard had seen him and then he yawned hugely covering his mouth with a dark hand the marquis de carabas raised an eyebrow well he said irritably are you coming richard stared at him for a heartbeat then richard nodded without trusting himself to speak and stood up and they walked away together through the hole in the wall back into the darkness leaving nothing behind them not even the doorway
