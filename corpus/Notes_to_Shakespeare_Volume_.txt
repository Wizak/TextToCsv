notes to shakespeare volume iii the tragedies introduction on tragedies dr johnsons reaction to shakespeares tragedies is a curious one compounded as it is of deep emotional involvement in a few scenes in some plays and a strange dispassionateness toward most of the others i suspect that his emotional involvement took root when he read shakespeare as a boy one remembers the terror he experienced in reading of the ghost in hamlet and it was probably also as a boy that he suffered that shock of horrified outrage and grief at the death of cordelia that prevented him from rereading the scene until be came to edit the play johnsons deepest feelings and convictions professor clifford has recently reminded us can be traced back to his childhood and adolescence but it is surprising to learn as one does from his commentary that other scenes in these very plays hamlet and king lear and in macbeth too leave him unmoved if one can so interpret the absence of any but an explanatory note on say lears speech beginning pray do not mock mei am a very foolish fond old man besides this negative evidence there is also the positive evidence of many notes which display the dispassionate editorial mind at work where one might expect from johnson an outburst of personal feeling there are enough of these outbursts to warrant our expecting others but we are too frequently disappointed perhaps johnson thought of most of shakespeares tragedies as imperial tragedies and that is why he could maintain a stance of aloofness conversely the play of timon is a domestick tragedy and therefore strongly fastens on the attention of the reader but the tragedy of timon does not capture the attention of the modern reader and perhaps all attempts to fix johnsons likes and dislikes and the reasons for them in the canon of shakespeares plays must circle endlessly without ever getting to their destination tragedies vol iv macbeth most of the notes which the present editor has subjoined to this play were published by him in a small pamphlet in ii enter three witches in order to make a true estimate of the abilities and merit of a writer it it always necessary to examine the genius of his age and the opinions of his contemporaries a poet who should now make the whole action of his tragedy depend upon enchantment and produce the chief events by the assistance of supernatural agents would be censured as transgressing the bounds of probability be banished from the theatre to the nursery and condemned to write fairy tales instead of tragedies but a survey of the notions that prevailed at the time when this play was written will prove that shakespeare was in no danger of such censures since he only turned the system that was then universally admitted to his advantage and was far from overburthening the credulity of his audience the reality of witchcraft or enchantment which though not strictly the same are confounded in this play has in all ages and countries been credited by the common people and in most by the learned themselves these phantoms have indeed appeared more frequently in proportion as the darkness of ignorance has been more gross but it cannot be shown that the brightest gleams of knowledge have at any time been sufficient to drive them out of the world the time in which this kind of credulity was at its height seems to have been that of the holy war in which the christians imputed all their defeats to enchantments or diabolical opposition as they ascribed their success to the assistance of their military saints and the learned dr warburton appears to believe suppl to the introduction to don quixote that the first accounts of enchantments were brought into this part of the world by those who returned from their eastern expeditions but there is always some distance between the birth and maturity of folly as of wickedness this opinion had long existed though perhaps the application of it had in no foregoing age been so frequent nor the reception so general olympiodorus in photiuss extracts tells us of one libanius who practised this kind of military magic and having promised greek choris opliton kata barbaron energein to perform great things against the barbarians without soldiers was at the instances of the empress placidia put to death when he was about to have given proofs of his abilities the empress shewed some kindness in her anger by cutting him off at a time so convenient for his reputation but a more remarkable proof of the antiquity of this notion may be found in st chrysostoms book de sacerdotia which exhibits a scene of enchantments not exceeded by any romance of the middle age he supposes a spectator overlooking a field of battle attended by one that points out all the various objects of horror the engines of destruction and the arts of slaughter greek deichnuto de eti para tois enantiois kai petomenous hippous dia tinos magganeias kai oplitas di aeros pheromenous kai pasaen goaeteias dunomin kai idean let him then proceed to shew him in the opposite armies horses flying by enchantment armed men transported through the air and every power and form of magic whether st chrysostom believed that such performances were really to be seen in a day of battle or only endeavoured to enliven his description by adopting the notions of the vulgar it is equally certain that such nations were in his time received and that therefore they were not imported from the saracens in a later age the wars with the saracens however gave occasion to their propagation not only as bigotry naturally discovers prodigies but as the scene of action was removed to a great distance the reformation did not immediately arrive at its meridian and though day was gradually encreasing upon us the goblins of witchcraft still continued to hover in the twilight in the time of queen elizabeth was the remarkable trial of the witches of warbois whose conviction is still commemorated in an annual sermon at huntingdon but in the reign of king james in which this tragedy was written many circumstances concurred to propagate and confirm this opinion the king who was much celebrated for his knowledge had before his arrival in england not only examined in person a woman accused of witchcraft but had given a very formal account of the practices and illusions of evil spirits the compacts of witches the ceremonies used by them the manner of detecting them and the justice of punishing them in his dialogues of daemonologie written in the scottish dialect and published at edinburgh this book was soon after his accession reprinted at london and as the ready way to gain king jamess favour was to flatter his speculations the system of daemonologie was immediately adopted by all who desired either to gain preferment or not to lose it thus the doctrine of witchcraft was very powerfully inculcated and as the greatest part of mankind have no other reason for their opinions than that they are in fashion it cannot be doubted but this persuasion made a rapid progress since vanity and credulity cooperated in its favour the infection soon reached the parliament who in the first year of king james made a law by which it was enacted chap xii that if any person shall use any invocation or conjuration of any evil or wicked spirit or shall consult covenant with entertain employ feed or reward any evil or cursed spirit to or for any intent or purpose or take up any dead man woman or child out of the grave or the skin bone or any part of the dead person to be employed or used in any manner of witchcraft sorcery charm or enchantment or shall use practise or exercise any sort of witchcraft sorcery charm or enchantment whereby any person shall be destroyed killed wasted consumed pined or lamed in any part of the body that every such person being convicted shall suffer death this law was repealed in our own time thus in the time of shakespeare was the doctrine of witchcraft at once established by law and by the fashion and it became not only unpolite but criminal to doubt it and as prodigies are always seen in proportion as they are expected witches were every day discovered and multiplied as fast in some places that bishop hall mentions a village in lancashire where their number was greater than that of the houses the jesuits and sectaries took advantage of this universal error and endeavoured to promote the interest of their parties by pretended cures of persons afflicted by evil spirits but they were detected and exposed by the clergy of the established church upon this general infatuation shakespeare might be easily allowed to found a play especially since he has followed with great exactness such histories as were then thought true nor can it be doubted that the scenes of enchantment however they may now be ridiculed were both by himself and his audience thought awful and affecting ii fair is foul and foul is fair i believe the meaning is that to us perverse and malignant as we are fair is foul and foul is fair iii and fortune on his damned quarry smiling thus the old copy but i am inclined to read quarrel quarrel was formerly used for cause or for the occasion of a quarrel and is to be found in that sense in hollingsheds account of the story of macbeth who upon the creation of the prince of cumberland thought says the historian that he had a just quarrel to endeavour after the crown the sense therefore is fortune smiling on his excrable cause c this is followed by dr warburten see vi iii discomfort swells discomfort the natural opposite to comfort welld for flawed was an emendation the common copies have discomfort swells iii as cannons overchargd with double cracks so they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe mr theobald has endeavoured to improve the sense of this passage by altering the punctuation thus they were as cannons overchargd with double cracks so they redoubled strokes he declares with some degree of exultation that he has no idea of a cannon charged with double cracks but surely the great author will not gain much by an alteration which makes him say of a hero that he redoubles strokes with double cracks an expression not more loudly to be applauded or more easily pardoned than that which is rejected in its favour that a cannon is charged with thunder or with double thunders may be written not only without nonsense but with elegance and nothing else is here meant by cracks which in the time of this writer was a word of such emphasis and dignity that in this play he terms the general dissolution of nature the crack of doom the old copy reads they doubly redoubled strokes iii so should he look that seems to speak things strange the meaning of this passage as it now stands is so should he look that looks as if he told things strange but rosse neither yet told strange things nor could look as if he told them lenox only conjectured from his air that he had strange things to tell and therefore undoubtedly said what haste looks thro his eyes so should he look that teems to speak thinks strange he looks like one that is big with something of importance a metaphor so natural that it is every day used in common discourse iii confronted him with selfcomparisons theobald interpreted him as cawdor johnson in accused shakespeare of forgetfulness on the basis of theobalds error and warburton here speaks of blunder upon blunder the second blunderer was the present editor iiii aroint thee witch in one of the folio editions the reading is anoint thee in a sense very consistent with the common accounts of witches who are related to perform many supernatural acts by the means of unguents and particularly to fly through the air to the places where they meet at their hellish festivals in this sense anoint thee witch will mean away witch to your infernal assembly this reading i was inclined to favour because i had met with the word aroint in no other authour till looking into hearnes collections i found it in a very old drawing that he has published in which st patrick is represented visiting hell and putting the devils into great confusion by his presence of whom one that is driving the damned before him with a prong has a label issuing out of his mouth with these words out out arongt of which the last is evidently the same with aroint and used in the same sense as in this passage iiii and the very points they blew as the word very is here of no other use than to fill up the verse it is likely that shakespeare wrote various which might be easily mistaken for very being either negligently read hastily pronounced or imperfectly heard iiii he shall live a man forbid mr theobald has very justly explained forbid by accursed but without giving any reason of his interpretation to bid is originally to pray as in this saxon fragment e i i bit y bote he is wise that prays and makes amends as to forbid therefore implies to prohibit in opposition to the word bid in its present sense it signifies by the same kind of opposition to curse when it is derived from the same word in its primitive meaning iiii are you aughtthat man may question are ye any beings with which man is permitted to hold converse or of which it is lawful to ask questions iiii are ye fantastical by fantastical he means creatures of fantasy or imagination the question is are these real beings before us or are we deceived by illusions of fancy iiii as thick as tale as thick as hail was mr popes correction the old copy has as thick as tale can post with post which perhaps is not amiss meaning that the news came as thick as a tale can travel with the post or we may read perhaps yet better as thick as tale came post with post that is posts arrived as fast as they could be counted iiii this supernatural solliciting solliciting is rather in my opinion incitement than information iiii why do i yield to yield is simply to give way to iiii present fearsare less than horrible imaginings w feats present fears are fears of things present which macbeth declares and every man has found to be less than the imagination presents them while the objects are yet distant fears is right iiii single state of man the single state of man seems to be used by shakespeare for an individual in opposition to a commonwealth or conjunct body iiii functionis smotherd in surmise and nothing is but what is not all powers of action are oppressed and crushed by one overwhelming image in the mind and nothing is present to me but that which is really future of things now about me i have no perception being intent wholly on that which has yet no existence iiii time and the hour runs through the roughest day i suppose every reader is disgusted at the tautology in this passage time and the hour and will therefore willingly believe that shakespeare wrote it thus come what come may time on the hour runs thro the roughest day macbeth is deliberating upon the events which are to befall him but finding no satisfaction from his own thoughts he grows impatient of reflection and resolves to wait the close without harrassing hinaelf with conjectures come what come may but to shorten the pain of suspense he calls upon time in the usual stile of ardent desire to quicken his motion time on he then comforts himself with the reflection that all his perplexity must have an end the hour runs thro the roughest day this conjecture is supported by the passage in the letter to his lady in which he says they referred me to the coming on of time with hail king that shalt be iiii my dull brain was wrought my head was worked agitated put into commotion iiv studied in his death instructed in the art of dying it was usual to say studied for learned in science iiv to find the minds construction in the face the construction of the mind is i believe a phrase peculiar to shakespeare it implies the frame or disposition of the mind by which it is determined to good or ill iiv which do but what they should by doing everything safe toward your love and honour of the last line of this speech which is certainly as it is now read unintelligible an emendation has been attempted which dr warburton and dr theobald once admitted as the true reading our duties are to your throne and state children and servants which do but what they should in doing every thing fiefs to your love and honour my esteem for these critics inclines me to believe that they cannot be much pleased with these expressions fiefs to love or fiefs to honour and that they have proposed this alteration rather because no other occured to them than because they approved of it i shall therefore propose a bolder change perhaps with no better success but sua cuique placent i read thus our duties are to your throne and state children and servants which do but what they should in doing nothing save toward your love and honour we do but perform our duty when we contract all our views to your service when we act with no other principle than regard to your love and honour it is probable that this passage was first corrupted by writing safe for save and the lines then stood thus doing nothing safe toward your love and honour which the next transcriber observing to be wrong and yet not being able to discover the real fault altered to the present reading dr warburton has since changed fiefs to fiefd and hanmer has altered safe to shapd i am afraid none of us have hit the right word iv by the perfected report by the best intelligence dr warburton would read perfected and explains report by prediction little regard can be paid to an emendation that instead of clearing the sense makes it more difficult iv thoudst have great glamisthat which cries thus thou must do if thou have it as the object of macbeths desire is here introduced speaking of itself it is necessary to read thoudst have great glamis that which cries thus thou must do if thou have me iv the raven himself is hoarse dr warburton reads the raven himselfs not hoarse yet i think the present words may stand the messenger says the servant had hardly breath to make up his message to which the lady answers mentally that he may well want breath such a message would add hoarseness to the raven that even the bird whose harsh voice is accustomed to predict calamities could not croak the entrance of duncan but in a note of unwonted harshness iv mortal thoughts this expression signifies not the thoughts of mortals but murtherous deadly or destructive designs so in act hold fast the mortal sword and in another place with twenty mortal murthers iv nor keep peace betweenthe effect and it the intent of lady macbeth evidently is to wish that no womanish tenderness or conscientious remorse may hinder her purpose from proceeding to effect but neither this nor indeed any other sense is expressed by the present reading and therefore it cannot be doubted that shakespeare wrote differently perhaps thus that no compunctious visitings of nature shake my fell purpose nor keep pace between th effect and it to keep pace between may signify to pass between to intervene pace is on many occasions a favourite of shakespeares this phrase is indeed not usual in this sease but was it not its novelty that gave occasion to the present corruption the sense is that no compunctious visitings of nature may prevail upon her to give place in her mind to peaceful thoughts or to rest one moment in quiet from the hour of her purpose to its full completion in the effect revisal this writer thought himself perhaps very sagacious that be found a meaning which nobody missed the difficulty still remains how such a meaning is made by the words see vi iv take my milk for gall take away my milk and put gall into the place iv you wait on natures mischief natures mischief is mischief done to nature violation of natures order committed by wickedness iv to cry hold hold on this passage there is a long criticism in the rambler iv this ignorant present time ignorant has here the signification of unknowing that it i feel by anticipation these future hours of which according to the process of nature the present time would be ignorant ivi our gentle senses senses are nothing more than each mans sense gentle senses is very elegant as it means placid calm composed and intimates the peaceable delight of a fine day see vi ivi coigne of vantage convenient corner ivi how you should bid godyield as for your pains i believe yield or as it is in the folio of eyld is a corrupted contraction of shield the wish implores not reward but protection ivii if it were done a man of learning recommends another punctuation if it were done when tis done then twere well it were done quickly if c ivii if the assassinationcould tramel up the consequence of this soliloquy the meaning is not very clear i have never found the readers of shakespeare agreeing about it i understand it thus if that which i am about to do when it is once done and executed were done and ended without any following effects it would then be best to do it quickly if the murder could terminate in itself and restrain the regular course of consequences if its success could secure its surcease if being once done successfully without detection it could fix a period to all vengeance and enquiry so that this blow might be all that i have to do and this anxiety all that i have to suffer if this could be my condition even here in this world in this contracted period of temporal existence on this narrow bank in the ocean of eternity i would jump the life to come i would venture upon the deed without care of any future state but this is one of these cases in which judgment is pronounced and vengeance inflicted upon as here in our present life we teach others to do as we have done and are punished by our own example ivii with his surcease success i think the reasoning requires that we should read with its success surcease ivii shoal of time this is theobalds emendation undoubtedly right the old edition has school and dr warburton shelve ivii or heavens cherubin horsdupon the sightless couriers of the air w couriers courier is only runner couriers of air are winds air in motion sightless is invisible ivii that tears shall drown the wind alluding to the remission of the wind in a shower ivii enter lady the arguments by which lady macbeth persuades her husband to commit the murder afford a proof of shakespeares knowledge of human nature she urges the excellence and dignity of courage a glittering idea which has dazzled mankind from age to age and animated sometimes the housebreaker and sometimes the conqueror but this sophism macbeth has for ever destroyed by distinguishing true from false fortitude in a line and a half of which it may almost be said that they ought to bestow immortality on the author though all his other productions had been lost i dare do all that become a man who dares do more is none this topic which has been always employed with too much success is used in this scene with peculiar propriety to a soldier by a woman courage is the distinguishing virtue of a soldier and the reproach of cowardice cannot be borne by any man from a woman without great impatience she then urges the oaths by which he had bound himself to murder duncan another art of sophistry by which men have sometimes deluded their consciences and persuaded themselves that what would be criminal in others is virtuous in them this argument shakespeare whose plan obliged him to make macbeth yield has not confuted though he might easily have shewn that a former obligation could not be vacated by a latter that obligations laid on us by a higher power could not be overruled by obligations which we lay upon ourselves ivii whouldst thou have that which then esteemst the ornament of life and live a coward in thine own esteem in this there seems to be no reasoning i should read or live a coward in thine own esteem unless we choose rather wouldst thou leave that ivii like the poor cat i the adage the adage alluded to is the cat loves fish but dares not wet her feet catus amat pisces sed men vult tingere plantas ivii will i with wine and wassel so convince to convince is in shakespeare to overpower or subdue as in this play their malady convinces the great assay of art ivii a limbeck only that is shall be only a vessel to emit fumes or vapours ivii our great quell quell is murder manquellers being in the old language the term for which murderers is now used iii enter banquo and fleance with a torch before him the place is not markd in the old edition nor is it easy to say where this encounter can be it is not in the hall as the editors have all supposed it for banquo sees the sky it is not far from the bedchamber as the conversation shews it must be in the inner court of the castle which banquo might properly cross in his way to bed iii if you shall cleave to my consent then tisit shall make honour for you macbeth expressed his thought with affected obscurity he does not mention the royalty though he apparently has it in his mind if you shall cleave to my consent if you shall concur with me when i determine to accept the crown when tis when that happens which the prediction promises it shall make honour for you iii now oer the one half worldnature seems dead that is over our hemisphere all action and motion seem to have ceased this image which is perhaps the most striking that poetry can produce has been adopted by dryden in his conquest of mexico all things are hushd as natures self lay dead the mountains seem to nod their drowsy head the little birds in dreams their song repeat and sleeping flowrs beneath the night dews sweat even lust and envy sleep these lines though so well known i have transcribed that the contrast between them and this passage of shakespeare may be more accurately observed night is described by two great poets but one describes a night of quiet the other of perturbation in the night of dryden all the disturbers of the world are laid asleep in that of shakespeare nothing but sorcery lust and murder is awake he that reads dryden finds himself lulld with serenity and disposed to solitude and contemplation he that peruses shakspeare looks round alarmed and starts to find himself alone one is the night of a lover the other of a murderer iii witherd murther thus with hia stealthy pace with tarquins ravishing strides towrds his design moves like a ghost this was the reading of this passage ravishing sides in all the editions before that of mr pope who for sides inserted in the text strides which mr theobald has tacitly copied from him though a more proper alteration might perhaps have been made a ravishing stride is an action of violence impetuosity and tumult like that of a savage rushing at his prey whereas the poet is here attempting to exhibit an image of secrecy and caution of anxious circumspection and guilty timidity the stealthy pace of a ravisher creeping into the chamber of a virgin and of an assassin approaching the bed of him whom he proposes to murder without awaking him these he describes as moving like ghosts whose progression is so different from strides that it has been in all ages represented te be as milton expresses it smooth sliding without step this hemiatic will afford the true reading of this place which is i think to be corrected thus and witherd murder thus with his stealthy pace with tarquin ravishing slides towrds his design moves like a ghost tarquin is in this place the general name of a ravisher and the sense is now is the time in which every one is asleep but those who are employed in wickedness the witch who is sacrificing to hecate and the ravisher and the murderer who like me are stealing upon their prey when the reading is thus adjusted he wishes with great propriety in the following lines that the earth may not hear his steps iii and take the present horrour from the timewhich now suits with it of this passage an alteration was once proposed by me of which i have now a less favourable opinion yet will insert it as it may perhaps give some hint to other critics and take the present horrour from the time which now suits with it i believe every one that has attentively read this dreadful soliloquy is disappointed at the conclusion which if not wholly unintelligible is at least obscure nor can be explained into any sense worthy of the authour i shall therefore propose a slight alteration thou sound and firmset earth hear not my steps which way they walk for fear thy very stones prate of my whereabout and talk the present horrour of the time that now suits with it macbeth has in the foregoing lines disturbed his imagination by enumerating all the terrors of the night at length he is wrought up to a degree of frenzy that makes him afraid of some supernatural discovery of his design and calls out to the stones not to betray him not to declare where he walks nor to talk as he is going to say of what he discovers the absurdity of his suspicion and pauses but is again overwhelmed by his guilt and concludes that such are the horrors of the present night that the stones may be expected to cry out against him that now suits with it he observes in a subsequent passage that on such occasions stones have been known to move it is now a very just and strong picture of a man about to commit a deliberate murder under the strongest conviction of the wickedness of his design of this alteration however i do not now see much use and certainly see no necessity whether to take horrour from the time means not rather to catch it as communicated than to deprive the time of horrour deserves te be considered iiii sleave of care a skein of silk is called a sleave of silk as i learned from mr seward the ingenious editor of beaumont and fletcher iiii gild the faces of the grooms withalfor it must seem their guilt could shakespeare possibly mean to play upon the similitude of gild and guilt iiiii i made a shift to cast him to cast him up to ease my stomach of him the equivocation is between cast or throw as a term of wrestling and cast or cast up iiiii strange screams of death and prophesying with accents terrible of dire combustions and confusd events new hatchd to the woeful time the obscure bird clamourd the livelong night some say the earth was feverous and did shake those lines i think should be rather regulated thus prophecying with accents terrible of dire combustions and cosfusd events newhatchd to th woful time the obscure bird clamourd the livelong night some say the earth was fevrous and did shake a prophecy of an event new hatchd seems to be a prophecy of an event past and a prophecy new hatchd is a wry expression the term new hatchd is properly applicable to a bird and that birds of ill omen should be newhatchd to the woful time that is should appear in uncommon numbers is very consistent with the rest of the prodigies here mentioned and with the universal disorder into which nature is described as thrown by the perpetration of this horrid murder see vi iiiii here lay duncanhis silver skin lacd with his golden blood mr pope has endeavoured to improve one of these lines by substituting goary blood for golden blood but it may easily be admitted that he who could on such an occasion talk of lacing the silyer skin would lace it with golden blood no amendment can be made to this line of which every word is equally faulty but by a general blot it is not improbable that shakespeare put these forced and unnatural metaphors into the mouth of macbeth as a mark of artifice and dissimulation to shew the difference between the studied language of hypocrisy and the natural outcries of sudden passion this whole speech so considered is a remarkable instance of judgment as it consists entirely of antithesis and metaphor iiiii unmannerly breechd with gore an unmannerly dagger and a dagger breechd or as in some editions breechd with gore are expressions not easily to be understood there are undoubtedly two faults in this passage which i have endeavored to take away by reading daggers unmanly drenchd with gore i saw drenchd with the kings blood the fatal daggers not only instruments of murder but evidence of cowardice each of these words might easily be confounded with that which i have substituted for it by a hand not exact a casual blot or a negligent inspection w unmanly reechd dr warburton has perhaps rightly put reachd for breechd iiiii in the great hand of god i stand and thence against the undivulgd pretence i fight of treasonous malice pretence is not act but simulation a pretence of the traitor whoever he might be to suspect some other of the murder i here fly to the protector of innocence from any charge which yet undivulgd the traitor may pretend to fix upon me iiiii this murtherous shaft thats shothath not yet lighted the design to fix the murder opon some innocent person has not yet taken effect iiiv minions of their race theobald reads minions of the race very probably and very poetically iiiv what good could they pretend to pretend is here to propose to themselves to set before themselves as a motive of action iiii as upon thee macbeth their speeches shine shine for appear with all the lustre of conspicuous truth iiii as it is saidmark anthonys was by caesar though i would not often assume the critics privilege of being confident where certainty cannot be obtained nor indulge myself too far in departing from the established reading yet i cannot but propose the rejection of this passage which i believe was an insertion of some player that having so much learning as to discover to what shakespeare alluded was not willing that his audience should be less knowing than himself and has therefore weakened the authours sense by the intrusion of a remote and useless image into a speech bursting from a man wholly possessd with his own present condition and therefore not at leisure to explain his own allusions to himself if these words are taken away by which not only the thought but the numbers are injured the lines of shakespeare close together without any traces of a breach my genius is rebukd he chid the sisters this note was written before i was fully acquainted with shakespeares manner and i do not now think it of much weight for though the words which i was once willing to eject seem interpolated i believe they may still be genuine and added by the authour in his revision the authour of the revisal cannot admit the measure to be faulty there is only one foot he says put for another this is one of the effects of literature in minds not naturally perspicacious every boy or girl finds the metre imperfect but the pedant comes to its defence with a tribrachys or an anapaest and sets it right at once by applying to one language the rules of another if we may be allowed to change feet like the old comic writers it will not be easy to write a line not metrical to hint this once is sufficient see vi iiii for banquos issue have i fild my mind w filed this mark of contraction is not necessary to file is in the bishops bible iiii the common enemy of man it is always an entertainment to an inquisitive reader to trace a sentiment to its original source and therefore though the term enemy of man applied to the devil is in itself natural and obvious yet some may be pleased with being informed that shakespeare probably borrowed it from the first lines of the destruction of troy a book which he is known to have read this expression however he might have had in many other places the word fiend signifies enemy iiii come fate into the listand champion me to the utterance this passage will be best explained by translating it into the language from whence the only word of difficulty in it is borrowed que la destine se rende en lice et quelle me donne un defi a loutrance a challenge or a combat a loutrance to extremity was a fixd term in the law of arms used when the combatants engaged with an odium internecinum an intention to destroy each other in opposition to trials of skill at festivals or on other occasions where the contest was only for reputation or a prize the sense therefore is let fate that has foredoomd the exaltation of the sons of banquo enter the lists against me with the utmost animosity in defence of its own decrees which i will endeavour to invalidate whatever be the danger johnson quotes warburtons note after the former explication dr warburton was desirous to seem to do something and he has therefore made fate the marshal whom i had made the champion and has left macbeth to enter the lists without an opponent iiii are you so gospelld are you of that degree of precise virtue gospeller was a name of contempt given by the papists to the lollards the puritans of early times and the precursors of protestantism iiii showghes showghes are probably what we now call shocks demiwolves lyciscae dogs bred between wolves and dogs iiii the valued file in this speech the word file occurs twice and seems in both places to have a meaning different from its present use the expression valued file evidently means a list or catalogue of value a station in the file and not in the worst rank may mean a place in the list of manhood and not in the lowest place but file seems rather to mean in this place a post of honour the first rank in opposition to the last a meaning which i have not observed in any other place iiii so weary with disasters tugd with fortune tugd with fortune may be tugd or worried by fortune iiii acquaint you with the perfect spy o the time what is meant by the spy of the time it will be found difficult to explain and therefore sense will be cheaply gained by a slight alteration macbeth is assuring the assassins that they shall not want directions to find banquo and therefore says i will acquaint you with a perfect spy o the time accordingly a third murderer joins them afterwards at the place of action perfect is well instructed or well informed as in this play though in your state of honour i am perfect though i am well acquainted with your quality and rank warburton explained this as the critical juncture how the critical juncture is the spy o the time i know not but i think my own conjecture right iiiii natures copys not eternal the copy the lease by which they hold their lives from nature has its time of termination limited iiiiii but who did bid thee join with us the meaning of this abrupt dialogue is this the perfect spy mentioned by macbeth in the foregoing scene has before they enter upon the stage given them the directions which were promised at the time of their agreement yet one of the murderers suborned suspects him of intending to betray them the other observes that by his exact knowledge of what they were to do he appears to be employed by macbeth and needs not be mistrusted iiiiv you know your own degrees sit down at firstand last the hearty welcome as this passage stands sit downat first and last not only the numbers are very imperfect but the sense if any can be found weak and contemptible the numbers will be improved by reading sit down at first and last a hearty welcome but for last should then be written next i believe the true reading is you know your own degrees sit down to first and last the hearty welcome all of whatever degree from the highest to the lowest may be assured that their visit is well received iiiiv tis better thee without than he within the sense requires that this passage should be read thus tis better thee without than him within that is i am better pleased that the blood of banquo should be on thy face than in his body the authour might mean it is better that banquos blood were on thy face than he in this room expressions thus imperfect are common in his works iiiiv the feast is sold the meaning is that which ia not given cheerfully cannot be called a gift it is something that must be paid for iiiiv extend his passion prolong his suffering make his fit longer iiiiv o proper stuff this speech is rather too long for the circumstances in which it is spoken it had begun better at shame itself iiiiv oh these flaws and starts impostors to true fear would well become a womans story at a winters fire authorizd by her grandam flaws are sudden gusts the authour perhaps wrote those flaws and starts impostures true to fear would well become a womans story these symptoms of terrour and amazement might better become impostures true only to fear might become a coward at the recital of such falsehoods as no man could credit whose understanding was not weakend by his terrours tales told by a woman over a fire on the

inhibit which inhibit dr warburton interprets refuse the old reading may stand at least as well as the emendation suppose we read if trembling i evade it iiiiv can such things beand overcome us like a summers cloudwithout our special wonder w cant the alteration is introduced by a misinterpretation the meaning is not that these things are like a summercloud but can such wonders as these pass over us without wonder as a casual summer cloud passes over us iiiiv you make me strangeeven to the disposition that i owe you produce in me an alienation of mind which is probably the expression which our author intended to paraphrase iiiiv augurs and understood relations by the word relation is understood the connection of effects with causes to understand relations as an angur is to know how these things relate to each other which have no visible combination or dependence iiiiv you lack the season of all natures sleep i take the meaning to be you want sleep which seasons or gives the relish to all nature indiget somni vitae condimenti iiiv vaporous drop profound that is a drop that has profound deep or hidden qualities iiiv slights arts subtle practices iiivi enter lenox and another lord as this tragedy like the rest of shakespeares is perhaps overstocked with personages it is not easy to assign a reason why a nameless character should be introduced here since nothing is said that might not with equal propriety have been put into the mouth of any other disaffected man i believe therefore that in the original copy it was written with a very common form of contraction lenox and an for which the transcriber instead of lenox and angus set down lenox and another lord the author had indeed been more indebted to the transcribers fidelity and diligence had he committed no errors of greater importance iiivi and receive free honours free for grateful warburton how can free be grateful it may be either honours freely bestowed not purchased by crimes or honours without slavery without dread of a tyrant ivi as this is the chief scene of enchantment in the play it is proper in this place to observe with how much judgment shakespeare has selected all the circumstances of his infernal ceremonies and how exactly he has conformed to common opinions and traditions thrice the brinded cat hath mewd the usual form in which familiar spirits are reported to converse with witches is that of a cat a witch who was tried about half a century before the time of shakespeare had a cat named rutterkin as the spirit of one of these witches was grimalkin and when any mischief was to be done she used to bid rutterkin go and fly but once when she would have sent rutterkin to torment a daughter of the countess of rutland instead of going or flying he only cried mew from whence she discovered that the lady was out of his power the power of witches being not universal but limited as shakespeare has taken care to inculcate though his bark cannot be lost yet it shall be tempesttost the common afflictions which the malice of witches produced were melancholy fits and loss of flesh which are threatened by one of shakespeares witches weary sevn nights nine times nine shall he dwindle peak and pine it was likewise their practice to destroy the cattle of their neighbours and the farmers have to this day many ceremonies to secure their cows and other cattle from witchcraft but they seem to have been most suspected of malice against swine shakespeare has accordingly made one of his witches declare that she has been killing swine and dr harsenet observes that about that time a sow could not be ill of the measles nor a girl of the sullens but some old woman was charged with witchcraft toad that under the cold stone days and night has thirtyone swelterd venom sleeping got boil thou first ithe charmd pot toads have likewise long lain under the reproach of being by some means accessory to witchcraft for which reason shakespeare in the first scene of this play calls one of the spirits padocke or toad and now takes care to put a toad first into the pot when vaninus was seized at theleuse there was found at his lodgings ingens bufo vitro inclusus a great toad shut in a vial upon which those that prosecuted him veneficium exprebrabent charged him i suppose with witchcraft fillet of fenny snake in the cauldron boil and bakae eye of newt and toe of frog for a charm c the propriety of these ingredients may be known by consulting the books de viribus animalium and de mirabilibus mundi ascribed to albertus magnus in which the reader who has time and credulity may discover very wonderful secrets finger of birthstrangled babe ditch deliverd by a drab it has been already mentioned in the law against witches that they are supposed to take up dead bodies to use in enchantments which was confessed by the woman whom king james examined and who had of a dead body that was divided in one of their assemblies two fingers for her share it is observable that shakespeare on this great occasion which involves the fate of a king multiplies all the circumstanaces of horror the babe whose finger is used must be strangled in its birth the grease must not only be human but must have dropped from a gibbet the gibbet of a murderer and even the sow whose blood is used must have offended nature by devouring her own farrow these are touches of judgment and genius and now about the cauldron sing black spirits and white blue spirits and grey mingle mingle mingle you that mingle say and in a former part weyward sisters hand in hand thus do go about about thrice to thine and thrice to mine and thrice again to make up nine these two passages i have brought together because they both seem subject to the objection of too much levity for the solemnity of enchantment and may both be shewn by one quotation from camdens account of ireland to be founded upon a practice really observed by the uncivilised natives of that country when any one gets a fall says the informer of camden he starts up and turning three times to the right digs a hole in the earth for they imagine that there is a spirit in the ground and if he falls sick in two or three days they send one of their women that is skilled in that way to the place where she says i call thee from the east west north and south from the groves the woods the rivers and the fens from the fairies red black white there was likewise a book written before the time of shakespeare describing amongst other properties the colours of spirits many other circumstances might be particularised in which shakespeare has shown his judgment and his knowledge ivi yesty waves that is foaming or frothy waves ivi the roundand top of sovereignty this round is that part of the crown that encircles the head

proposed this change head for dead rightly observes that head means host or power douglas and the rebels met a mighty and a fearful head they are and again his divisions are in three heads ivi thy crown does sear mine eyeballs the expression of macbeth that the crown sears his eyeballs is taken from the method formerly practised of destroying the sight of captives or competitors by holding a burning bason before the eye which dried up its humidity whence the italian abacinare to blind ivi and thy airthou other goldbound brow is like the first a third is like the former in former editions and thy hair thou other goldbound brow is like the first a third is like the former as macbeth expected to see a train of kings and was only enquiring from what race they would proceed he could not be surprised that the hair of the second was bound with gold like that of the first he was offended only that the second resembled the first as the first resembled banquo and therefore said and thy air thou other goldbound brow is like the first this dr warburton has followed ivi time thou anticipatst my dread exploits to anticipate is here to prevent by taking away the opportunity ivii he wants the natural touch natural sensibility he is not touched with natural affection ivii to do worse to you were fell cruelty to do worse is to let her and her children be destroyed without warning iviii let us ratherhold fast the mortal sword and like good men bestride our downfaln birthdom in former editions let us rather hold fast the mortal sword and like good men bestride our downfal birthdoom he who can discover what is meant by him that earnestly exhorts him to bestride his downfal birthdoom is at liberty to adhere to the present text but it is probable that shakespeare wrote like good men bestride our downfaln birthdom the allusion is to a man from whom something valuable is about to be taken by violence and who that he may defend it without incombrance lays it on the ground and stands over it with his weapon in his hand our birthdom or birthright says he lies on the ground let us like men who are to fight for what is dearest to them not abandon it but stand over it and defend it this is a strong picture of obstinate resolution so falstaff says to hal when i am down if thou wilt bestride me so birthdom for birthright is formed by the same analogy with masterdom in this play signifying the privileges or rights of a master perhaps it might be birthdame for mother let us stand over our mother that lies bleeding on the ground iviii a good and virtuous nature may recoilin an imperial charge a good mind may recede from goodness in the execution of a royal commission iviii though all things foul would wear the brows of graceyet grace must look still so this is not very clear the meaning perhaps is this my suspicions cannot injure you if you be virtuous by supposing that a traitor may put on your virtuous appearance i do not say that your virtuous appearance proves

need of change iviii and the chance of goodnessbe like our warranted quarrel the chance of goodness as it is commonly read conveys no sense if there be not some more important errour in the passage it should at least be pointed thus and the chance of goodness be like our warranted quarrel that is may the event be of the goodness of heaven pro justitia divina answerable to the cause the author of the revisal conceives the sense of the passage to be rather this and may the success of that goodness which is about to exert itself in my behalf be such as may be equal to the justice of my quarrel but i am inclined to believe that shakespeare wrote and the chance o goodness be like our warranted quarrel this some of his transcribers wrote with a small o which another imagined to mean of if we adopt this reading the sense will be and o thou sovereign goodness to whom we now appeal may our fortune answer to our cause see vi iviii a modern ecstacy i believe modern is only foolish or trifling

is only an m inverted and that it was originally written my may of life i am now passed from the spring to the autumn of my days but i am without those comforts that should succeed the spriteliness of

of success so confident that he would not fly but endure their setting down before his castle viv for where there is advantage to be given both more and less have given him the revolt the impropriety of the expression advantage to be given and the disagreeable repetition of the word given in the next line incline me to read where there is a vantage to be gone both more and less have given him the revolt advantage or vantage in the time of shakespeare signified opportunity he shut up himself and his soldiers says malcolm in the castle because when there is an opportunity to be gone they all

vv fell of hair my hairy part my capillitium fell is skin vv she should have dyd hereafter there would have been a time for such a word this passage has very justly been suspected of being corrupt it is not apparent for what word there would have been a time and that there would or would not be a time for any word seems not a consideration of importance sufficient to transport macbeth into the following exclamation i read therefore she should have dyd hereafter there would have been a time for such a world tomorrow c it is a broken speech in which only part of the thought is expressed and may be paraphrased thus the queen is dead macbeth her death should have been deferred to some more peaceful hour had she livd longer there would at length have been a time for the honours due to her as a queen and that respect which i owe her for her fidelity and love such is the world such is the condition of human life that we always think tomorrow will be happier than today but tomorrow and tomorrow steals over us unenjoyed and unregarded and we still linger in the same expectation to the moment appointed for our end all these days which have thus passed away have sent multitudes of fools to the grave who were engrossed by the same dream of future felicity and when life was departing from them were like me reckoning on tomorrow such was once my conjecture but i am now less confident macbeth might mean that there would have been a more convenient time for such a word for such intelligence and so fall into the following reflection we say we send word when we give intelligence vv to the last syllable of recorded time recorded time seems to signify the time fixed in the decrees of heaven for the period of life the record of futurity is indeed no accurate expression but as we only know transactions past or present the language of men affords no term for the volumes of prescience in which future events may be supposed to be written vv the way to dusty death dusty is a very natural epithet the second folio has the way to study death which mr upton prefers but it is only an errour by an accidental transposition of the types vv i pull in resolution and beginto doubt the equivocation of the fiend that lies like truth though this is the reading of all the editions yet as it is a phrase without either example elegance or propriety it is surely

sense that shuffle with ambiguous expressions vviii had i as many sons as i have hairs i would not wish them to a fairer death this incident is thus related from henry of huntingdon by camden in his remains from which our authour probably copied it when seyward the martial earl of northumberland understood that his son whom he had sent in service against the scotchmen was slain he demanded whether his wounds were in the fore part or hinder part of his body when it was answered in the fore part he replied i am right glad neither wish i any other death to me or mine general observation this play is deservedly celebrated for the propriety of its fictions and solemnity grandeur and variety of its action but it has no nice discriminations of character the events are too great to admit the influence of particular dispositions and the course of the action necessarily determines the conduct of the agents the danger of ambition is well described and i know not whether it may not be said in defence of some parts which now seem improbable that in shakespeares time it was necessary to warn credulity against vain and illusive predictions the passions are directed to their true end lady macbeth is merely detested and though the courage of macbeth preserves some esteem yet every reader rejoices at his fall vol vii coriolanus i but they think we are too dear they think that the charge of maintaining us is more than we are worth ii ere we become rakes it is plain that in our authours time we had the proverb as lean as a rake of this proverb the original is obscure rake now signifies a dissolute man a man worn out with disease and debauchery but the signification is i think much more modern than the proverb raekel in islandick is said to mean a curdog and this was probably the first use among us of the word rake as lean as a rake is therefore as lean as it dog too worthless to be fed i i will ventureto scalet a little more warburton had taken theobald to task for emending to stalet offering two quotations to prove that scale meant apply neither of dr warburtons examples afford a sense congruous to the present occasion in the passage quoted to scale may be to weigh and compare but where do we find that scale is to apply if we scale the two criticks i think theobald has the advantage ii fob off our disgraces with a tale disgraces are hardships injuries

blood to ruin to run leadst first to win c thou that art the meanest by birth art the foremost to lead thy fellows to ruin in hope of some advantage the meaning however is perhaps only this thou that art a hound or running dog of the lowest breed leadst the pack when any thing is to be gotten see vi ii what would you have ye curs that like not peace nor war the one affrights you the other makes you proud w likes that to like is to please every one knows but in that sense it is as hard to say why peace should not like the people as in the other sense why the people should not like peace the truth is that coriolanus does not use the two sentences consequentially but reproaches them with unsteadiness then with their other occasional vices ii id make a quarrywith thousands why a quarry i

should they march that four might select those that were best inclind how would their inclinations be known who were the four that should select them perhaps we may read please you to march and fear shall quickly draw out of my command which men are least inclind it is easy to conceive that by a little negligence fear might be changed to four and least to best let us march and that fear which incites desertion will free my army from cowards see vi iviii wert thou the hectorthat was the whip of your braggd progeny the romans boasted themselves descended from the trojans how then was hector the whip of their progeny it must mean the whip with which the trojans scourged the greeks which cannot be but by a very unusual construction or the authour must have forgotten the original of the

in the town says he will enter it yet the old edition exhibits it thus so with me my birthplace have i and my loves upon this enemic towne ill enter if he slay me c the intermediate line seems to be lost in which conformably to his former observation he says that he has lost his birthplace and his loves upon a petty dispute and is trying his chance in this enemy town he then cries turning to the

bound with an oath to yield to his conditions this if apparently wrong sir t hanmer and dr warburton after him read bound with an oath not to yield to new conditions they might have read more smoothly to yield no new conditions but the whole speech is in confusion and i suspect something left out i should read what he would do he sent in writing after what he would not bound with an oath to yield

here is a prize vii for i have ever verifyd my friends of whom hes chief with all the size that verity would without lapsing suffer w narrified hanmer magnified if the commentator had given any example of the word narrify the correction would have been not only received but applauded now since the new word stands without authority we must try what sense the old one will afford to verify is to establish by testimony one may say with propriety he brought false witnesses to verify his title shakespeare considered the word with his usual laxity as importing rather testimony than truth and only meant to say i bore witness to my friends with all the size that verity would suffer vii the virginal palms of your daughters w pasmes or pames french for swooning fits warburton also quotes tarquin and lucrece to dry the old oaks sap and cherish springs and emends to tarnish from the french meaning to dry up used of springs and rivers i have inserted this note because it contains an apology for many others it is not denied that many french words were mingled in the time of elizabeth with our language which have since been ejected and that any which are known to have been then in use may be properly recalled when they will help the sense but when a word is to be admitted the first question should be by whom was it ever received in what book can it be shown if it cannot be proved to have been in use the reasons which can justify its reception must be stronger than any critick will often have to bring even in this certain emendation the new word is very liable to contest i should read and perish springs the verb perish is commonly neutral but in conversation is often used actively and why not in the works of a writer negligent beyond all others of grammatical niceties

performances the old mans merriment in menenius the lofty ladys dignity in volumnia the bridal modesty in virgilia the patrician and military haughtiness in coriolanus the plebeian malignity and tribunitian insolence in brutus and sicinius make a very pleasing and interesting variety and the various revolutions of the heros fortune fill the mind with anxious curiosity there is perhaps too

reply to a saucy sentence directed to his colleague and to whom the speech was probably given that he might not stand too long unemployed upon the stage iii sennet exeunt caesar and train i have here inserted the word sennet from the original edition that i may have an opportunity of retracting a hasty conjecture in one of the marginal directions in henry viii sennet appears to be a particular

oaths iii and i will look on both indifferently dr warburton has a long note on this occasion which is very trifling when brutus first names honour and death he calmly declares them indifferent but as the image kindles in his mind he sets honour above life is not this natural iii eternal devil i should think that our author wrote rather infernal devil iii chew upon this consider this at leisure

honourable metal may be wroughtfrom what it is disposd the best metal or temper may be worked into qualities contrary to its original constitution iii if i were brutus now and he were cassiushe should

iii common proof common experiment iii base degrees low steps iii as his kind according to his nature iii between the acting of a dreadful thing and the first motion all the interim is like a phantasma or a hideous dream the genius and the mortal instruments are then in council and the state of man like to a little kingdom suffers then the nature of an insurrection the greek deinon of the greek critics does not i think mean sentiments which raise fear more than wonder or any other of the tumultuous passions greek to deinon is that which strikes which astonishes with the idea either of some great subject or of the authors abilities dr warburtona pompous criticism might well have been shortened the genius is not the genius of a kingdom nor are the instruments conspirators shakespeare is describing what passes in a single bosom the insurrection which a conspirator feels agitating the little kingdom of his own mind when the genius or power that watches for his protection and the mortal instruments the passions which excite him to a deed of honour and danger are in council and debate when the desire of action and the care of safety keep the mind in continual fluctuation and disturbance iii any mark of favour any distinction of countenance iii for if thou path thy native semblance on if thou walk in thy true form iii no not an oath if not the face of men dr warburten would read fate of men but his elaborate emendation is i think erroneous the face of men is the countenance the regard the esteem of the publick in other terms honour and reputation or the face of men

ancients did not place courage but wisdom in the heart iiii and that great men shall pressfor tinctures stains relicks and cognisance warburton conjectured some lines lost i am not of opinion that any thing is lost and have therefore marked no omission this speech which is intentionally pompous is somewhat confused there are two allusions one to coats armorial to which princes make additions or give new tinctures and new marks of cognisance the other to martyrs whose reliques are preserved with veneration the romans says brutus all come to you as to a saint for reliques as to a prince for honours iiii and reason to my love is liable and reason or propriety of conduct and language is subordinate to my love iiiii the fates with traitors do contrive the fates join with traitors in

the military operations of old times havock was the word by which declaration was made that no quarter should be given in a tract intitled the office of the conestable mareschall in the tyme of werre

muffling up his face even at the base of pompeys statue which all the while ran blood great caesar fell o what a fall was there my countrymen warburton suggested transposing the second and third of these lines the image seems to be that the blood of caesar flew upon the statue and trickled down it and the exclamation o what a fall was there follows better after great caesar fell than with a line interposed see vii iiiii for i have neither writ the old copy reads instead of wit for i have neither writ nor words which may mean i have no penned and premeditated oration ivii your master pindarus in his own change or by ill officers hath given me some worthy cause to wish things done undone w own charge the arguments for the change proposed are insufficient brutus could not but know whether the wrongs committed were done by those who were immediately under the command of cassius or those under his officers the answer of brutus to the servant is only an act of artful civility his question to lucilius proves that his suspicion still continued yet i cannot but suspect a corruption and would read in his own change or by ill offices that is either changing his inclination of himself or by the ill offices and bad influences of others see vii iviii to hedge me in that is to limit my authority by your direction or censure iviii to make conditions that is to know on what terms it is fit to confer the offices which are at my disposal iviii a friend should bear a friends infirmities but brutus makes mine greater than they are bru i do not till you practise them on me the meaning is this i do not look for your faults i only see them and mention them with vehemence when you force them into my notice by practising them on me see vii iviii there is my dagger and here my naked breast within a heart dearer than plutus mine richer than gold if that thou best a roman take it forth w thou needst a romans i am not satisfied with the change proposed yet cannot deny that the words as they now stand require some interpretation i think he means only that he is so far from avarice when the cause of his country requires liberality that if any man should wish for his heart he would not need enforce his desire any otherwise than by showing that he was a roman vi they mean to warn as at philippi here to warn seems to mean here the same as to alarm hanmer reads they mean to wage us vi while damned casca like a cur behindstruck caesar on the neck casca struck caesar on the neck coming like a degenerate cur behind him vi even by the rule of that philosophy by which i did blame cato for the death which he did give himself i know not how but i do find it cowardly and vile for fear of what might fall so to prevent the time of life arming myself with patience dr warburton thinks that in this speech something is lost but there needed only a parenthesis to clear it the construction is this i an determined to act according to that philosophy which directed me to blame the suicide of cato arming myself with patience viv luc only i yield to diethere is so much that then wilt kill me straight dr warburton has been much inclined to find lacunae or passages broken by omission throughout this play i think he has been always mistaken the soldier here says yield or thou diest lucilius replies i yield only on this condition that i may die here is so much gold as thou seest in my hand which i offer thee as a reward for speedy death what now is there wanting general observation of this tragedy many particular passages deserve regard and the contention and reconcilement of brutus and cassius is universally celebrated but i have never been strongly agitated in perusing it and think it somewhat cold and unaffecting compared with some other of shakespeares plays his adherence to the real story and to roman manners seems to have impeded the natural vigour of his genius antony and cleopatra ii and is become the bellows and the fanto cool a gypsys lust in this passage something seems to be wanting the bellows and fan being commonly used for contrary purposes were probably opposed by the author who might perhaps have written is become the bellows and the fan to kindle and to cool a gypsys lust ii gypsys lust gypsy is here used both in the original meaning for an egyptian and in its accidental sense for a bad woman i then must thou needs find out new heaven thou must set the boundary of my love at a greater distance than the present visible universe affords i the sum be brief sum thy business in a few words ii and the wide archof the rangd empire fall taken from the roman custom of raising triumphal arches to perpetuate their victories extremely noble warburton i am in doubt whether shakespeare had any idea but of a fabrick standing on pillars the later editions have all printed the raised empire for the ranged empire as it was first given see vii ii antony will be himself ant but stirrd by cleopatra but in this passage seems to have the old saxon signification of without unless except antony says the queen will recollect his thoughts unless kept he replies in commotion by cleopatra see vii iii change his horns with garlands w charge sir thomas hanmer reads not improbably change for horns his garlands i am in doubt whether to change is not merely to dress or to dress with changes of garlands iii i had rather heat my liver to know why the lady is so averse from heating her liver it must be remembered that a heated liver is supposed to make a pimpled face iii then belike my children shall have no names if i have already had the best of my fortune then i suppose i shall never name children that is i am never to be married however tell me the truth tell me how many boys and wenches ii if every of your wishes had a womb and foretel every wish a million w fertil evry for foretel in ancient editions the latter copies have foretold foretel favours the emendation which is made with great acuteness yet the original reading may i think stand if you had as many wombs as you will have wishes and i should foretel all those wishes i should foretel a million of children it is an ellipsis very frequent in conversation i should shame you and tell all that is and if i should tell all and is for and if which was anciently and is still provincially used for if iii extended asia to extend is a term used for to seize i know not whether that be not the sense here iii oh when we bring forth weedswhen our quick winds lie still the sense is that man not agitated by censure like soil not ventilated by quick winds produces more evil than good iii the present pleasure by revolution lowring does become the opposite of itself the allusion is to the suns diurnal course which rising in the east and by revolution lowering or setting in the west becomes the opposite of itself warb this is an obscure passage the explanation which dr warburton has offered is such that i can add nothing to it yet perhaps shakespeare who was less learned than his commentator meant only that our pleasures as they are revolved in the mind turn to pain iii upon far poorer moment for less reason upon meaner motives iii it shews to man the tailors of the earth comforting therein i have printed this after the original which though harsh and obscure i know not how to amend sir tho hanmer reads they shew to man the tailors of the earth comforting him therein i think the passage with somewhat less alteration for alteration is always dangerous may stand thus it shews to men the tailors of the earth comforting them c iii more urgent touches things that touch me more sensibly more pressing motives iii petition us at home wish us at home call for us to reside at home iii say our pleasure to such whose places under us requires our quick remove from hence this is hardly sense i believe we should read their quick remove from hence tell our design of going away to those who being by their places obliged to attend us must remove in haste iiii i did not send you you must go as if you came without my order or knowledge iiii a race of heaven ie had a smack or flavour of heaven warb this word is well explained by dr warburton the race of wine is the taste of the woil sir t hanmer not understanding the word reads ray iiii remains in use the poet seems to allude to the legal distinction between the use and absolute possession iiii should safe my going t salve mr upton reads i think rightly safe my going iiii o most false love where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill with sorrowful water alluding to the lachrymatory vials or bottles of tears which the romans sometimes put into the urn of a friend iiii the tearsbelong to egypt to me the queen of egypt iiii oh ny oblivion is a very antonyand i am all forgotten the plain meaning is my forgetfulness makes me forget myself warburton hanmer explained all forgotten as apt to forget everything i cannot understand the learned critics explanation it appears to me that she should rather have said o my remembrance is a very antony and i am all forgotten it was her memory not her oblivion that like antony vas forgetting and deserting her i think a slight change will restore the passage the queen having something to say which she is not able or would not seem able to recollect cries out o my oblivion tis a very antony the thought of which i was in quest is a very antony is treacherous and fugitive and has irrevocably left me and i am all forgotten if this reading stand i think the explanation of hanmer must be received see vii iiv one great competitor perhaps our great competitor iiv as the spots of heavenmore fiery by nights blackness if by spots are meant stars as night has no other fiery spots the comparison is forced and harsh stars having been always supposed to beautify the night nor do i comprehend what there is in the counterpart of this simile which answers to nights blackness hanmer reads spots on ermine or fires by nights blackness iiv purchasd procured by his own fault or endeavour iiv say this becomes him as his composure must be rare indeed whom these things cannot blemish this seems inconsequent i read and his composure c grant that this becomes him and if it can become him he must have in him something very uncommon yet c iiv so great weight in his lightness the word light it one of shakespeares favourite playthings the sense is his trifling levity throws so much burden upon us iiv if he filld his vacancy with his voluptuousness full surfeits and the dryness of his bones call on him fort call on him is visit him says caesar if antony followed his debaucheries at a time of leisure i should leave him to be punished by their natural consequences by surfeits and dry bones iiv boys who being mature in knowledge for this hanmer who thought the maturity of a boy an inconsistent idea has put who immature in knowledge but the words experience and judgment require that we read mature though dr warburton has received the emendation by boys mature in knowledge are meant boys old enough to know their duty iiv he is belovd of thesethat only have feard caesar those whom not love but fear made adherents to caesar now shew their affection for pompey iiv which they ear to ear is to plow a common metaphor iiv lack blood to think ont turn pale at the thought of it iv mandragora a plant of which the infusion was supposed to procure sleep shakespeare mentions it in othello not poppy nor mandragora can ever medcine thee to that sweet sleep iv that great medicine hathwith his tinct gilded thee alluding to the philosophers stone which by its touch converts base metal into gold the alchemists call the matter whatever it be by which they perform transmutation a medicine iv armgaunt steed ie his steed worn lean and thin by much service in war so fairfax his stallworn steed the champion stout bestrode warb on this note mr edwards has been very lavish of his pleasantry and indeed has justly censured the misquotation of stallworn for stallworth which means strong but makes no attempt to explain the word in the play mr seyward in his preface to beaumont has very elaborately endeavoured to prove that an armgaunt steed is a steed with lean shoulders arm is the teutonick word for want or poverty armgaunt may be therefore an old word signifying lean for want ill fed edwardss observation that a wornout horse is not proper for atlas to mount in battle is impertinent the horse here mentioned seems to be a post horse rather than a war horse yet as armgaunt seems not intended to imply any defect it perhaps means a horse so slender that a man might clasp him and therefore formed for expedition hanmer reads armgirt steed iv was beastly dumb by him mr theobald reads dumbd put to silence alexas means says he the horse made such a neighing that if he had spoke he could not have been heard iv get me ink and paper he shall have every day a several greeting or ill unpeople aegypt by sending out messengers iii enter pompey menecrates and menas the persons are so named in the first edition but i know not why menecrates appears menas can do all without him iii while we are suitors to their throne decaysthe thing we sue for w delays it is not always prudent to be too hasty in exclamation the reading which dr warburton rejects as nonsense is in my opinion right if delay be what they sue for they have it and the consolation offered becomes superfluous the meaning is while we are praying the thing for which we pray is losing its value iii the neerlustwearied antony theobald emended near lustwearied to neerlustwearied could it be imagined after this swelling exultation that the first edition stands literally thus the neere lust wearied antony iii square that is quarrel iii our lives upon this play is not divided into acts by the authour or first editors and therefore the present division may be altered at pleasure i think the first act may be commodiously continued to this place and the second act opened with the interview of the chief persons and a change of the state of action yet it must be confessed that it is of small importance where these unconnected and desultory scenes are interrupted iiii were i the wearer of antonius beardi would not shavt today i believe he means i would meet him undressed without shew of respect iiii nor curstness grow to the matter let not illhumour be added to the real subject of our difference iiii caes sitant sit sir antony appears to be jealous of a circumstance which seemed to indicate a consciousness of superiority in his too successful partner in power and accordingly resents the invitation of caesar to be seated caesar answers nay then ie if you are so ready to resent what i meant an act of civility there can be no reason to suppose you have temper enough for the business on which at present we are met steevens the following circumstance may serve to strengthen mr steevenss opinion when the fictitious sebastian made his appearance in europe he came to a conference with the conde de lemos to whom after the firat exchange of civilities he said conde de lemos be covered and being asked by that nobleman by what pretences he laid claim to the superiority expressed by such permission he replied i do it by right of my birth i am sebastian iiii their contestationwas theam for you you were the word of war w theamd i am neither satisfied with the reading nor the emendation theamd is i think a word unauthorised and very harsh perhaps we may read their contestation had theme from you you were the word o th war the dispute derived its subject from you it may be corrected by mere transposition their contestation you were theme for you were the word iiii having alike your cause the meaning seems to be having the same cause as you to be offended with me but why because he was offended with antony should he make war upon caesar may it not be read thus did he not rather discredit my authority with yours and make the wars alike against my stomach hating alike our cause iiii as matter whole you have not to make it with the original copy reads as matter whole you have to make it with without doubt erroneously i therefore only observe it that the reader may more readily admit the liberties which the editors of this authours works have necessarily taken iiii fronted ie opposed iiii the honours sacred which he talks on nowsupposing that i lackd it sacred for unbroken unviolated warb dr warburton seems to understand this passage thus the honour which he talks of me as lacking is unviolated i never lacked it this may perhaps be the true meaning but before i read the note i understood it thus lepidus interrupts caesar on the supposition that what he is about to say will be too harsh to be endured by antony to which antony replies no lepidus let him speak the security of honour on which he now speaks on which this conference is held now is sacred even supposing that i lacked honour before iiii your considerate stone this line is passed by all the editors as if they understood it and believed it universally intelligible i cannot find in it any very obvious and hardly any possible meaning i would therefore read go to then you considerate ones you who dislike my frankness and temerity of speech and are so considerate and discreet go to do your on business iiii i do not much dislike the matter butthe manner of his speech i do not says caesar think the man wrong but too free of him interposition fort cannot be we shall remain in friendship yet if it were possible i would endeavour it iiii your reproofwere well deservd in the old edition your proof were well deservd which mr theobald with his usual triumph changes to approof which he explains allowance dr warburton inserted reproof very properly into hanmers edition but forgot it in his own iiii lest my remembrance suffer ill report lest i be thought too willing to forget benefits i must barely

turned again to antony and now has turned to caesar shall i mention what has dropped into my imagination that our author might perhaps have written tripletongued doubletongued is a common term of reproach which rage might improve to tripletongued but the present reading may stand ivxii that pannelld me at heels all the editions read that pannelld me at heels sir t hanmer substituted spanield by an emendation with which it was reasonable to expect that even rival commentators would be satisfied yet dr warburton proposes pantlerd in a note of which he is not injurd by the suppression and mr

peace iras cleo no more but een a woman w peace isis of this note it may be truly said that it at least deserves to be right nor can he that shall question the justness of the emendation refuse his esteem to the ingenuity and learning with which it is proposed hanmer had proposed another emendation not injudiciously he reads thus iras royal aegypt empress cleo peace peace iras no more but a mere woman c that is no more an empress but a mere woman it is somewhat unfortunate that the words mere woman which so much strengthen the opposition to either empress or isis are not in the original edition which stands thus no more but in a woman mere woman was probably the arbitrary reading of rowe i suppose however that we muy justly change the ancient copy thus no more but een a woman which will enough accommodate either of the editors i am inclined to think that she speaks abruptly not answering her woman but discoursing with her own thoughts no more but een a woman i have no more of my wonted greatness but am even a woman on the level with other women were i what i once was it were for me to throw my scepter c if this simple explanation be admitted how much labour has been thrown away peace peace iras is said by charmian when she sees the queen recovering and thinks speech troublesome vi the round worldshould have shook lions into civil streets i think here is a line lost after which it is in vain to go in quest the sense seems to have been this the round world should have shook and this great alteration of the system of things should send lions into streets and citizens into dens there is sense still but it is harsh and violent vi but it is tidingsto wash the eyes of kings that is may the gods rebuke me if this be not tidings to make kings weep but again for if not vi that our starsunreconciliable should divideour equalness to this that is should have made us in our equality of fortune disagree to a pitch like this that one of us must die vi a poor aegyptian yet the queen my mistress if this punctuation be right the man means to say that he is yet an aegyptian that is yet a servant of the queen of aegypt though soon to become a subject of rome vi her life in romewould be eternal in our triumph hanmer reads judiciously enough but without necessity would be eternalling our triumph the sense is if she dies here she will be forgotten but if i send her in triumph at rome her memory and my glory will be eternal vii fortunes knave the servant of fortune vii it is great to do that thing that ends all other deeds which shackles accidents and bolts up change which sleeps and never palates more the dung the beggars nurse and caesars warburton added a whole line and emended dung to dugg i cannot perceive the loss of a line or the need of an emendation the commentator seems to have entangled his own ideas his supposition that suicide is called the beggars nurse and caesars and his concession that the position is intelligible show i think a mind not intent upon the business before it the difficulty of the passage if any difficulty there be arises only from this that the act of suicide and the state which is the effect of suicide are confounded voluntary death says she is an act which bolts up change it produces a state which sleeps and never palates more the dung the beggars nurse and caesars which has no longer need of the gross and terrene sustenance in the use of which caesar and the beggar are on a level the speech is abrupt but perturbation in such a state is surely natural vii i am his fortunes vassal and i send himthe greatness he has got i allow him to be my conqueror i own his superiority with complete submission vii you see how easily she may be surprizd this line in the first edition is given not to charuian but to proculeius and to him it certainly belongs though perhaps misplaced i would put it at the end of his foregoing speech where he for grace is kneeld to aside to gallus you see how easily she may be surprizd then while cleopatra makes a formal answer gallus upon the hint given seizes her and proculeius interrupting the civility of his answer your plight is pityd of him that causd it cries out guard her till caesar come vii who are in thisrelievd but not betrayd w bereavd but i do not think the emendation necessary since the sense is not made better by it and the abruptness in cleopatras answer is more forcible in the old reading vii rids our dogs of languish for languish i think we may read anguish vii worth many babes and beggars why death wilt thou not rather seize a queen than employ thy force upon babes and beggars see vii vii if idle talk will once be necessary this nonsense should be reformed thus if idle time whill once be necessary ie if repose be necessary to cherish life i will not sleep warburton i do not see that the nonsense is made sense by the change sir t hanmer reads if idle talk will once be accessary neither is this better i know not what to offer better than an easy explanation that is i will not eat and if it will be necessary now for once to waste a moment in idle talk of my purpose i will not sleep neither in common conversation we often use will be with as little relation to futurity as now i am going it will be fit for me to dine first vii yet to imagine an antony were natures piece gainst fancy condemning shadows quite w natures prize in this passage i cannot discover any temptation to critical experiments the word piece is a term appropriated to works of art here nature and fancy produce each their piece and the piece done by nature had the preference antony was in reality past the size of dreaming he was more by nature than fancy could present in sleep vii i cannot project mine own cause so well w procter sir t hanmer reads i cannot parget my own cause meaning i cannot whitewash varnish or gloss my cause i believe the present reading to be right to project a cause is to represent a cause to project it well is to plan or contrive a scheme of defense vii tis exactly valued not petty things admitted t omitted notwithstanding the wrath of mr theobald i have restored the old reading she is angry afterwards that she is accused of having reserved more than petty things dr warburton and sir t hanmer follow theobald vii seel my lips sew up my mouth vii parcel the sum of my disgraces by to parcel her disgraces might be expressed in vulgar language to bundle up her calamaties see vii vii cleo bet known that we the greatest are misthought for things that others do and when we fall we answer others merits in our names are therefore to be pitied i do not think that either of the criticks warburton and hanmer have reached the sense of the author which may be very commodiously explained thus we suffer at our highest state of elevation in the thoughts of mankind for that which others do and when we fall those that contented themselves only to think ill before call us to answer in our own names for the merits of others we are therefore to be pitied merits is in this place taken in an ill sense for actions meriting censure if any alteration be necessary i should only propose be t known that we at greatest c vii make not your thoughts your prisons i once wished to read make not your thoughts your poison do not destroy yourself by musing on your misfortune yet i would change nothing as the old reading presents a very proper sense be not a prisoner in imagination when in reality you are free vii scald rhimers sir t hanmer reads stall d rhimers scald was a word of contempt implying poverty disease and filth vii quick comedians the gay inventive players vii their most absurd intents t assured i have preserved the old reading the design certainly appeared absurd enough to cleopatra both as she thought it unreasonable in itself and as she knew it would fail vii the pretty worm of nilus worm is the teutonick word for serpent we have the blindworm and slowworm still in our language and the norwegians call an enormous monster seen sometimes in the northern ocean the seaworm vii the worm will do him kind the serpent will act according to his nature vii hell make demand of her and spend that kiss which is my heaven to have he will enquire of her concerning me and kiss her for giving him intelligence vii something blown the flesh is somewhat puffed or swoln general observation this play keeps curiosity always busy and the passions always interested the continual hurry of the action the variety of incidents and the quick succession of one personage to another call the mind forward without intermission from the first act to the last but the power of delighting is derived principally from the frequent changes of the scene for except the feminine arts some of which are too low which distinguish cleopatra no character is very strongly discriminated upton who did not easily miss what he desired to find has discovered that the language of antony is with great skill and learning made pompous and superb according to his real practice but i think his diction not distinguishable from that of others the most tumid speech in the play is that which caesar makes to octavia the events of which the principal are described according to history are produced without any art of connexion or care of disposition timon of athens ii poet ay thats well known but what particular rarity what strange which manifold record not matches see magick of bounty the learned commentators warburtons note must shift for itself i cannot but think that this passage is at present in confusion the poet asks a question and stays not for an answer nor has his question any apparent drift or consequence i would range the passage thus poet ay thats well known bat what particular rarity what so strange that manifold record not matches pain see poet magick of bounty c it may not be improperly observed here that as there is only one copy of this play no help can be had from collation and more liberty must be allowed to conjecture ii breathd as it wereto an untirable and continuate goodness breathed is inured by constant practice so trained as not to be wearied to breathe a horse is to exercise him for the course ii poet a thing slipt idly from me our poesy is as a gum which oozes from whence tis nourished the fire i the flint shews not till it be struck our gentle flame provokes itself and like the current flies each bound it chafes what have you there this speech of the poet is very obscure he seems to boast the copiousness and facility of his vein by declaring that verses drop from a poet as gums from odoriferous trees and that his flame kindles itself without the violence necessary to elicit sparkles from the flint what follows next that it like a current flies each bound it chafes this may mean that it expands itself notwithstanding all obstructions but the images in the comparison are so illsorted and the effect so obscurely expressed that i cannot but think something omitted that connected the last sentence with the former it is well knovn that the players often shorten speeches to quicken the representation and it may be suspected that they sometimes performed their amputations with more haste than judgment see vi ii poet upon the heels of my presentment sir as soon as my book has been presented to lord timon ii this comes off weil and excellent by this we are to understand what the painters call the goings off of a picture which requires the nicest execution warburton the note i understand less than the text the meaning is this figure rises weil from the canvas cest bien relev ii artificial strife strife is either the contest or act with nature hic ille est raphael timuit quo aospite vinci rerum magna parens moriente mori or it is the contrast of forms or opposition of colours ii this confluence this great flood of visitors mane salutantm totis vomit aedibus undam i halts not particularly my design does not stop at any single characters i no levelld malice infects one comma in the course i hold but flies an eagleflight bold and forth on leaving no tract behind to level is to aim to point the shot at a mark shakespeares meaning is my poem is not a satire written with any particular view or levelled at any single person i fly like an eagle into the general expanse of life and leave not by any private mischief the trace of my passage ii ill unbolt ill open ill explain ii glib and slippery creatures hanmer and warburton after him read natures slippery is smooth unresisting ii glassfacd flatterer that shows in his own look as by reflection the looks of his patron ii rankd with all deserts coverd with ranks of all kinds of men ii to propagate their states to advance or improve their various conditions of life ii conceivd to scope properly imagined appositely to the purpose ii through himdrink the free air that is catch his breath in affected fondness ii a thousand moral paintings i can shew shakespeare seems to intend in this dialogue to express some competition between the two great arts of imitation whatever the poet declares himself to have shewn the painter thinks he could have shewn better ii tis not enough to help the feeble upbut to support him after this thought is better expressed by dr madden in his elegy on archbishop boulter he thought it mean only to help the poor to beg again ii therefore he will be timon i rather think an emendation necessary and read therefore well be him timon his honesty rewards him in itself that is if he in honest bene fit illi i wish him the proper happiness of an honest man but his honesty gives him no claim to my daughter the first transcriber probably wrote will be him which the next not understanding changed to he will be ii never may that state or fortune fall into my keeping which is not owd to you the meaning is let me never henceforth consider any thing that i possess but as owed or due to you held for your service and at your disposal ii pencild figures areeven such as they give out pictures have no hypocrisy they are what they profess to be ii unclew me quite to unclew is to unwind a ball of thread to unclew a man is to draw out the whole mass of his fortunes ii are prized by their masters are rated according to the esteem in which their possessor is held ii tim goodmorrow to thee gentle apemantua apam till i be gentle stay for thy goodmorrow when thou art timons dog and these knaves honest warburton conjectured a line lost and added one of his own making i think my punctuation may clear the passage without any greater effort ii then thou art timons dog when thou hast gotten a better character and instead of being timon as thou art shalt be changed to timons dog and become more worth of kindness and salutation ii that i had no angry wit to be a lord w so hungry a wit the meaning may be i should hate myself for patiently enduring to be a lord this is ill enough expressed perhaps some happy change may set it right i have tried and can do nothing yet i cannot heartily concur with dr warburton ii the strain of mans bred outinto baboon and monkey man is exhausted and degenerated his strain or lineage is worn down into monkey iii if our betters play at that game we must not dare to imitate them faults that are rich are fair warburton gave the second line to apemantus i cannot see that these lines are more proper in any other mouth than timons to whose character of generosity and condescension they are very suitable to suppose that by our betters are meant the gods is very harsh because to imitate the gods has been hitherto reckoned the highest pitch of human virtue the whole is a trite and obvious thought uttered by timon with a kind of affected modesty if i would make any alteration it should be only to reform the numbers thus our betters play that game we must not dare t imitate then faults that are rich are fair iii thou art an atheniantherefore welcome i myself would have no power if this be the true reading the sense is all athenians are welcome to share my fortune i would myself have no exclusive right or power in this house perhaps we might read i myself would have no poor i would have every athenian consider himself as joint possessor of my fortune iii i scorn thy meat twould choke me for i should neer flatter thee w forei should eer of this emendation there is little need the meaning is i could not swallow thy meat for i could not pay for it with flattery and what was given me with an ill will would stick in my throat iii so many dip their meatin one mans blood the allusion is to a pack of hounds trained to pursuit by being gratified with the blood of the animal which they kill and the wonder is that the animal on which they are feeding cheers them to the chase iii windpipes dangerous notes the notes of the windpipe seem to be the only indications which shew where the windpipe is see vi iii my lord in heart that is my lords health with sincerity an emendation hat been proposed thus my love in heart but it is not necessary iii we should think ourselves for ever perfect that is arrived at the perfection of happiness iii did not you chiefly belong to my heart i think it should be inverted thus did i not chiefly belong to your hearts lacius wishes that timon would give him and the rest an opportunity of expressing some part of their zeals timon answers that doubtless the gods have provided that i should have help from you how else are you my friends why are you stiled my friends if what if i do not love you such is the present reading but the consequence is not very clear the proper close must be if you do not love me and to this my alteration restores it but perhaps the old reading may stand the revisals note on this line is quoted the meaning is probably this why are you distinguished from thousands by that title of endearment was there not a particular connection and intercourse of tenderness between you and me see vi iii i confirm you i fix your characters firmly in my own mind iii o joy een made away ere it can be born for this hanmer writes o joy een made a joy eret can be born and is followed by dr warburton i am always inclinable to think well of that which is approved by so much learning and sagacity yet cannot receive this alteration tears being the effect both of joy and grief supplied our author with an opportunity of conceit which he seldom fails to indulge timon weeping with a kind of tender pleasure cries out o joy een made away destroyed turned to tears before it can be born before it can be fully possessed iii mine eyes cannot hold water methinks to forget their faults i drink to you in the original edition the words stand thus mine eyes cannot hold out water methinks to forget their faults i drink to you perhaps the true reading is this mine eyes cannot hold out they water methinks to forget their faults i will drink to you or it may be explained without any change mine eyes cannot hold out water that is cannot keep water from breaking in upon them see vi iii apem thou weepst to make them drink hanmer reads to make then drink thee and is again followed by dr warburton i think without sufficient reason the covert sense of apemantus is what thou losest they get iii like a babe that is a weeping babe iii they dance they are mad women like madness is the glory of this life as this pomp shews to a little oil and root warburton conjectured some lines lost after the second verse when i read this passage i was at first of the same opinion with this learned man but upon longer consideration i grew less confident because i think the present reading susceptible of explanation with no more violence to language than is frequently found in our author the glory of this life is very near to madness as may be made appear from this pomp exhibited in a place where a philosopher is feeding on oil and roots when we see by example how few are the necessaries of life we learn what madness there is in so much superfluity iii who dies that bearsnot one spurn to their graves of their friends gift that is given them by their friends iii mine own device the mask appears to have been designd by timon to surprise his guests iii l lady my lord you take us even at the best this answer seems rather to belong to one of the ladies it was probably only markd l in the copy iii tis pity bounty has not eyes behind to see the miseries that are following her iii that man might neer be wretched for his mind for nobleness of soul iii toadvance this jewel to prefer it to raise it to honour by wearing it iii all the lands thou hast lie in a pitchd field alc i defiled land my lord this is the old reading which apparently depends on a very low quibble alcibiades is told that his estate lies in a pitchd field now pitch as falstaff says doth defile alcibiades therefore replies that his estate lies in defiled land this as it happened was not understood and all the editors published i defy land iii serving of becks w serring the commentator conceives beck to mean the mouth or the head after the french bec whereas it means a salutation made with the head so milton nods and becks and wreathed smiles to serve a beck is to offer a salutation iii i doubt whether their legs he plays upon the word leg as it signifies a limb and a bow or act of obeisance iii i fear me thouwilt give away thyself in paper shortly w in proper hanmer reads very plausibly thou wilt give away thyself in perpetuum iii ill lockthy heaven from thee the pleasure of being flattered iii no porter at his gatebut rather one that smiles and still invites i imagine that a line is lost here in which the behaviour of a surly porter was described iii no reasoncan found his state in safety the supposed meaning of this can sound his state must be no reason by sounding fathoming or trying his state can find it safe but as the words stand they imply that no reason can safely sound his state i read thus no reason can found his state in safety reason cannot find his fortune to have any safe or solid foundation the types of the first printer of this play were so worn and defaced that f and s are not always to be distinguished iiii never mindwas to be so unwise to be so kind of this mode of expression conversation affords many examples i was always to be blamed whatever happened i am in the lottery but i was always to draw blanks iiii good even varro it is observable that this good evening is before dinner for timon tells alcibiades that they will go forth again as soon as dinners done which may prove that by dinner our author meant not the coena of ancient times but the middays repast i do not suppose the passage corrupt such inadvertencies neither author nor editor can escape there is another remark to be made varro and isidore sink a few lines afterwards into the servants of varro and isidore whether servants in our authors time took the names of their masters i know not perhaps it is a slip of negligence iiii enter apemantus and a fool i suspect some scene to be lost in which the entrance of the fool and the page that follows him was prepared by some introductory dialogue in which the audience was informed that they were the fool and page of phrynia timandra or some other courtesan upon the knowledge of which depends the greater part of the ensuing jocularity iiii poor rogues this is said so abruptly that i am inclined to think it misplaced and would regulate the passage thus caph wheres the fool now apem he last askd the question all what are we apemantus apem asses all why apem that you ask me what you are and do not know yourselves poor rogues and usurers men bawds between gold and want speak c thus every word will have its proper place it is likely that the passage transposed was forgot in the copy and inserted in the margin perhaps a little beside the proper place which the transcriber wanting either skill or care to observe wrote it where it now stands iiii shes een setting on water to scald the old name for the disease got at corinth was the brenning and a sense of scalding is one of its first symptoms iiii with two stones more thans artificial one meaning the celebrated philosophers stone which was in those times much talked of sir thomas smith was one of those who lost considerable sums in seeking of it iiii though you hear now yet nows too late a time warburton objected to this an emendation by hanmer i think hanmer right and have received his emendation ilii and at lengthhow goes our reckoning w hold good our it is common enough and the commentator knows it is common to propose interrogatively that of which neither the speaker nor the hearer has any doubt the present reading may therefore stand iiii a wasteful cock ie a cockloft a garret and a wasteful cock signifies a garret lying in waste neglected put to no use hanmer hanmers explanation is received by dr warburton yet i think them both apparently mistaken a wasteful cock is a cock or pipe with a turning stopple running to waste in this sense both the terms have their usual meaning but i know not that cock is ever used for cockloft or wasteful for lying in waste or that lying in waste is at all a phrase ilii and try the arguments arguments for natures warb how arguments should stand for natures i do not see but the licentiousness of our author forces us often upon far fetched expositions arguments may mean contents as the arguments of a book or for evidences and proofs iiii i knew it the most general way general is not speedy but compendious the way to try many at a time iiii and so intending other serious matters intending is regarding turning their notice to other things iiii these hard fractions warburton saw an allusion to fractions in mathematics this is i think no conceit in the head of flavius who by fractions means broken hints interrupted sentences abrupt remarks iiii halfcaps a half

sent him to me w mislookd i rather read yet had he not mistook him and sent to me iiiii if his occasion were not virtuous virtuous for strong forcible pressing warburton the meaning may more naturally be if he did not want it for a good use iiiii that i should purchase the day before for a little part and undo a great deal of honour t a little dirt this emendation is received like all others by sir t hanmer but neglected by dr warburton i think theobald right in suspecting a corruption nor is his emendation injudicious though perhaps we may better read purchase the day before for a little park iiiii and just of the same piece is every flatterers soul this is dr warburtons emendation the other editions read why this is the worlds soul of the same piece is every flatterers sport mr upton has not unluckily transposed the two final words thus why this is the worlds sport of the same piece is evry flatterers soul the passage is not so obscure as to provoke so much enquiry this says he is the soul or spirit of the world every flatterer plays the same game makes sport with the confidence of his friend see vi iiiii he does deny him in respect of his what charitable men afford to beggars that is in respect of his fortune what lucius denies to timon is in proportion to what lucius possesses less than the ususal alms given by good men to beggars iiiii i would have put my wealth into donation and the best half should ha returnd to him hanmer reads i would have put my wealth into partition and the best half should have attornd to him dr warbarton receives attornd the only difficulty is in the word returnd which since he had received nothing from him cannot be used but in a very low and licentious meaning see vi iiiiii they have all been touchd that is tried alluding to the touchstone iiiiii his friends like physiciansthrive give him over the original reading is his friends like physicians thrive give him over which theobald has misrepresented hanmer reads tryd plausibly enough instead of three proposed by mr pope i should read thrice but perhaps the old reading is the true iiiiii i had such a courage such an ardour such an eager desire iiiiii the devil knew not what he did i cannot but think that the negative not has intruded into this passage and the reader will think so too when he reads dr warburtons explanation of the next words iiiiii the devil knew not what he did when he made men politick he crossd himself byt and i cannot think but in the end the villainies of man will set him clear set him clear does not mean acquit him before heaven for then the devil must be supposed to know what he did but it signifies puzzle him outdo him at his own weapons warburton how the devil or any other being should be set clear by being puzzled and outdone the commentator has not explained when in a crowd we would have an opening made we say stand clear that is out of the way of danger with some affinity to this use though not without great harshness to set clear may be to set aside but i believe the original corruption is the insertion of the negative which was obtruded by some transcriber who supposed crossed to mean thwarted when it meant exempted from evil the use of crossing by way of protection or purification was probably not worn out in shakespeares time the sense of set clear is now easy he has no longer the guilt of tempting man to cross himself may mean in a very familiar sense to clear his score to get out of debt to quit his reckoning he knew not what he did may mean he knew not how much good he was doing himself there is then no need of emendation

did he soil the fact with cowardise an honour in him which buys out his fault i have printed these lines after the original copy except that for an honour it is there and honour all the latter editions deviate unwarrantably from the original and give the lines thus he is a man setting his fault aside of virtuous honour which buys out his fault nor did he soil c iiiv he did behave his anger ere twas spent as if he had but provd an argument the original copy reads not behave but behoove i do not well understand the passage in either reading shall we try a daring conjecture with such sober

disease incident to man and beast ivi degrees observances customs and laws decline to your confounding contraries and yet confusion live hanmer reads let confusion but the meaning may be though by such confusion all things seem to hasten to dissolution yet let not dissolution come but the miseries of confusion continue ivii enter flavius nothing contributes more to the exaltation of timons character than the zeal and fidelity of his servants nothing but real virtue can be honoured by domesticks nothing but impartial kindness can gain affection from dependants ivii so his familiars from

reader would wish for a correction but the word harsh as it is stands fortified by the rhyme to which perhaps it owes its introduction i know not what to propose perhaps strange unusual mood may by some be thought better and by others worse iviii o blessed breeding sun w blessing breeding i do not see that this emendation much strengthens the sense iviii thy sisters orb that is the moons this sublunary world iviii not natureto whom all sores lay siege i have preserved this note rather for the sake of the commentator warburton than of the author how nature to whom all sores lay siege can so emphatically express nature in its greatest perfection i shall not endeavour to explain the meaning i take to be this brother when his fortune is inlarged will scorn brother for this is the general depravity of human nature which besieged as it is by misery admonished as it is of want and imperfection when elevated by fortune will despise beings of nature like its own iviii it is the pastor lards the brothers sidesthe want that makes him leave w weathers sides this passage is very obscure nor do i discover any clear sense even though we should admit the emendation let us inspect the text as i have given it from the original edition it is the pastour lards the brothers sides the want that makes him leave dr warburton found the passage already changed thus it is the pasture lards the beggars sides the want that makes him lean and upon this reading of no authority raised another equally uncertain alterations are never to be made without necessity let us see what sense the genuine reading will afford poverty says the poet bears contempt hereditary and wealth native honour to illustrate this position having already mentioned the case of a poor and rich brother he remarks that this preference is given to wealth by those whom it least becomes it is the pastour that greases or flatters the rich brother and will grease him on till want makes him leave the poet then goes on to ask who dares to say this man this pastour is a flatterer the crime is universal through all the world the learned pate with allusion to the pastour ducks to the golden fool if it be objected as it may justly be that the mention of pastour is unsuitable we must remember the mention of grace and cherubims in this play and many such anachronisms in many others i would therefore read thus it is the pastour lards the brothers sides tis want that makes him leave the obscurity is still great perhaps a line is lost i have at least given the original reading iviii no idle votarist no insincere or inconstant supplicant gold will not serve me instead of roots iviii that makes the wappend widow wed again of wappened i have found no example nor know any meaning to awhape is used by spenser in his

again that is to the wedding day called by the poet satirically april day or fools day iviii do thy right nature lie in the earth where nature laid thee iviii thourt quick thou hast life and motion in

man that is however thou mayst act since thou art man hated man i wish thee evil iviii be a whore still they love thee not that use thee give them diseases leaving with thee their lust make use of thy

baths iviii milkpapsthat through the windowbars bore at mens eyes w windowlawn the reading is more probably windowbar the virgin that shews her bosom through the lattice of her chamber iviii exhaust

throat shall cut an allusion to the tale of oedipus iviii and to make whores a bawd w make whole the old edition reads and to make whores a bawd that is enough to make a whore leave whoring and a bawd leave making whores iviii ill trust to your conditions you need not swear to continue whores i will trust to your inclinations iviii yet may your pains six monthsbe quite contrary the explanation warburtons is ingenious but i think it very remote and would willingly bring the author and his readers to meet on easier terms we may read yet may your pains six months be quite contraried timon is wishing ill to mankind but is afraid lest the whores should imagine that he wishes well to them to obviate which he lets them know that he imprecates upon them influence enough to plague others and disappointments enough to plague themselves he wishes that they may do all possible mischief and yet take pains six months of the year in vain in this sense there is a connection of this line with the next finding your pains contraried try new expedients thatch your thin roofs and paint to contrary is on old verb latymer relates that when he went to court he was advised not to contrary the king iviii mens spurring hanmer reads sparring properly enough if there be any ancient example of the word iviii take the bridge quite away of him that his particular to foresee smells from the general weal w to forefend the metaphor is apparently incongruous but the sense is good to foresee his particular is to provide for his private advantage for which he leaves the right scent of publick good in hunting when hares have crossd one another it is common for some of the hounds to smell from the general weal and foresee their own particular shakespeare who seems to have been a skilful sportsman and has alluded often to falconry perhaps alludes here to hunting to the commentators emendation it may be objected that he used forefend in the wrong meaning to forefend is i think never to provide for but to provide against the verbs compounded with for or fore have commonly either an evil or negative sense iviii eyeless venomd worm the serpent which we from the smallness of his eyes call the blind worm and the latins caecilia iviii below crisp heaven w cript mr upton declares for crisp curled bent hollow iviii let it no more bring out ingrateful man w out to ungrateful it is plain that bring out is bring forth with which the following lines correspond so plainly that the commentator might be suspected of writing his note without reading the whole passage iviii dry up thy marrows vines and plough torn leas i cannot concur to censure theobald as warburton did as a critic very unhappy he was weak but he was cautious finding but little power in his mind he rarely ventured far under its conduct this timidity hindered him from daring conjectures and sometimes hindered him happily this passage among many others may pass without change the genuine reading is not marrows veins but marrows vines the sense is this o nature cease to produce men ensear thy womb but if thou wilt continue to produce them at least cease to pamper them dry up thy marrows on which they fatten with unctuous morsels thy vines which give them liquorish draughts and thy plowtorn leas here are effects corresponding with causes liquorish draughts with vines and unctuous morsels with marrows and the old reading literally preserved iviii the cunning of a carper cunning here seems to signify counterfeit appearance ivii moist trees hanmer reads very elegantly mossd trees iviii tim always a villains office or a fools dost please thyself int apem ay tim what a knave too such was dr warburtons first conjecture and knowt too but afterwards he adopted sir t hanmers conjecture what a knave thou but there is no need of alteration timon had just called apemantus fool in consequence of what he had known of him by former acquaintance but when apemantus tells him that he comes to vex him timon determines that to vex is either the office of a villain or a fool that to vex by design is villainy to vex without design is folly he then properly asks apemantus whether he takes delight in vexing and when he answers yes timon replies what and knave too i before only knew thee to be a fool but i now find thee likewise a knave this seems to be so clear as not to stand in need of a comment iviii willing miseryoutlives incertain pomp is crownd before arrives sooner at high wish that is at the completion of its wishes iviii worse than the worst content best states contentless have a wretched being a being worse than that of the worst states that are content this one would think too plain to have been mistaken iviii by his breath it means i believe by his counsel by his direction iv iii l hadst thou like us there is in this speech a sullen haughtiness and malignant dignity suitable at once to the lord and the manhater the impatience with which he bears to have his luxury reproached by one that never had luxury within his reach is natural and graceful there is in a letter written by the earl of essex just before his execution to another nobleman a passage somewhat resembling this with which i believe every reader will be pleased though it is so serious and solemn that it can scarcely be inserted without irreverence god grant your lordship may quickly feel the comfort i now enjoy in my unfettered conversion but that you may never feel the torments i have suffered for my long delaying it i had none but deceivers to call upon me to whom i said if my ambition could have entered into their narrow breasts they would not have been so precise but your lordship hath one to call upon you that knoweth what it is you now enjoy and what the greatest fruit and end is of all contentment that this world can afford think therefore dear earl that i have staked and buoyed all the ways of pleasure unto you and left them as seamarks for you to keep the channel of religious virtue for shut your eyes never so long they must be open at the last and then you must say with me there is no peace to the ungodly iviii from our first swath from infancy swath is the dress of a newborn child iviii precepts of respect of obedience to laws iviii but myself the connection here requires some attention but is here used to denote opposition but what immediately precedes is not opposed to that which follows the adversative particle refers to the two first lines thou art a slave whom fortunes tender arm with favour never claspt but bred a dog but myself who had the world as my confectionary c the intermediate lines are to be considered as a parenthesis of passion iviii if thou wilt curse thy father that poor rag must be thy subject if we read poor rogue it will correspond rather better to what follows iviii thou hadst been knave and flatterer dryden has quoted two verses of virgil to shew how well he could have written satires shakespeare has here given a specimen of the same power by a line bitter beyond all bitterness in which timon tells apemantus that he had not virtue enough for the vices which he condemns dr warburton explains worst by lowest which somewhat weakens the sense and yet leaves it sufficiently vigorous i have heard mr bourke commend the subtilty of discrimination with which shakespeare distinguishes the present character of timon from that of apemantus whom to vulgar eyes he would now resemble see vi rev viii iviii ay though it look like thee timon here supposes that an objection against hatred which through the whole tenor of the conversation appears an argument for it one would have expected him to have answered yes for it looks like thee the old edition which always gives the pronoun instead of the affirmative particle has it i though it look like thee perhaps we should read i thought it lookd like thee iv iii thou art the cap ie the property the bubble warburton i rather think the top the principal the remaining dialogue has more malignity than wit iviii twixt natural son and sire greek dia touton ouk adelphoi dia touton ou toxaeas anac iviii more things like men this line in the old edition is given to aremantus but it apparently belongs to timon hanmer has transposed the foregoing dialogue according to his own mind not unskilfully but with unwarrantable licence iviii you want much of meat t of meet such is mr theobalds emendation in which he is followed by dr warburton sir t hanmer reads you want much of men they have been all busy without necessity observe the series of the conversation the thieves tell him that they are men that much do want here is an ambiguity between much want and want of much timon takes it on the wrong side and tells them that their greatest want is that like other men they want much of meat then telling them where meat may be had he asks want why want see vi iviii the earth hath rootswithin this mile break forth an hundred springs vile plus et duris haerentia mora rubetis pugnantis stomachi composuere famen flumine vicino stultus sitit i do not suppose these to be imitations but only to be similar thoughts on similar occasions iviii the seas a thief whose liquid surge resolvesthe moon into salt tears w the mounds i am not willing to receive mounds which would not be understood but by him that suggested it the moon is supposed to be humid and perhaps a source of humidity but cannot be resolved by the surges of the sea yet i think moon is the true reading here is a circulation of thievary described the sun moon and sea all rob and are robbed iviii tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises us not to have us thrive in our mystery hanmer his malice to hanmers emendation though not necessary is very probable and very unjustly charged with nonsense by warburton the reason of his advice says the thief is malice to mankind not any kindness to us or desire to have us thrive in our mystery iviii what an alteration of honour hasdesperate want made w of humour the original copy has what an alteration of honour has desperate want made the present reading is certainly better but it has no authority to change honour to humour is not necessary an alteration of honour is an alteration of an honourable state to a state of disgrace iviii grant i may ever love and rather woe those that would mischief me than those that do w rather toothat woo in defiance of this criticism i have ventured to replace the former reading as more suitable to the general spirit of these scenes and as free from the absurdities charged upon it it is plain that in this whole speech friends and enemies are taken only for those who profess friendship and profess enmity for the friend is supposed not to be more kind but more dangerous than the enemy in the amendation those that would mischief are placed in opposition to those that woo but in the speakers intention those that woo are those that mischief most the sense is let me rather woo or caress those that would mischief that profess to mean me mischief than those that really do me mischief under false professions of kindness the spaniards i think have this proverb defend me from my friends and from my enemies i will defend myself this proverb is a sufficient comment on the passage iviii alli kept were knaves to serve in meat to villains knave is here in the compounded sense of a servant and a rascal iviii pitys sleeping i do not know that any correction is necessary but i think we might read eyes do never give but thorough lust and laughter pity sleeping eyes never flow to give is to dissolve as saline bodies in moist weather but by lust or laughter undisturbed by emotions of pity iviii it almost turns my dangerous nature wild w mild this emendation is specious but even this may be controverted to turn wild is to distract an appearance so unexpected says timon almost turns my savageness to distraction accordingly he examines with nicety lest his phrenzy should deceive him let me behold thy face surely this man was born of woman and to this suspected disorder of mind he alludes perpetual sober gods ye powers whose intellects are out of the reach of perturbation iviii thou shalt build from men away from human habitations vi enter poet and painter the poet and the painter were within view when apemantus parted from timon and might then have seen timon since apemantus standing by him could not see them but the scenes of the thieves and steward have passed before their arrival and yet passed as the drama is now conducted within their view it might be suspected that some scenes are transposed for all these difficulties would be removed by introducing the poet and painter first and the thieves in this place yet i am afraid the scenes must keep their present order for the painter alludes to the thieves when he says he likewise enriched poor straggling soldiers with great quantity this impropriety is now heightened by placing the thieves in one act and the poet and painter in another but it must be remembered that in the original edition this play is not divided into separate acts so that the present distribution is arbitrary and may be changed if any convenience can be gained or impropriety obviated by alteration vi while the day serves before blackcornerd night w blackcornette blackcornerd night is probably corrupt but blackcornette can hardly be right for it should be blackcornetted night i cannot propose any thing but must leave the place in its present state vi a madeup villain that is a villain that adopts qualities and characters not properly belonging to him a hypocrite vi drown them in a draught that is in the jakes vi but two in company each man apart all single and alone yet an arch villain keeps him company this passage is obscure i think the meaning is this but two in company that is stand apart let only two be together for even when each stands single there are two he himself and a villain vi of its own fall the oxford editor alters fall to fault not knowing that shakespeare uses fall to signify dishonour not destruction so in hamlet what a falling off was there warburton the truth is that neither fall means disgrace nor is fault a necessary emendation falling off in the quotation is not disgrace but defection the athenians had sense that is felt the danger of their own fall by the arms of alcibiades vi restraining aid to timon i think it should be refraining aid that is withholding aid that should have been given to timon vi than their offence can weigh down by the dram this which was in the former editions can scarcely be right and yet i know not whether my reading will be thought to rectify it i take the meaning to be we will give thee a recompence that our offences cannot outweigh heaps of wealth down by the dram or delivered according to the exactest measure a little disorder may perhaps have happened in transcribing which may be reformed by reading ay evn such heaps and sums of love and wealth down by the dram as shall to thee vi allowd with absolute power allowed is licensed privileged uncontrolled so of a buffoon in loves labour lost it is said that he is

degree methodically from highest to lowest viii some beast read this here does not live a man w reard notwithstanding this remark i believe the old reading to be the right the soldier had only seen the rude heap of earth he had evidently seen something that told him timon was dead and what could tell that but his tomb the tomb he sees and the inscription upon it which not being able to read and finding none to read it for him he exclaims peevishly some beast read this for it must be read and in this place it cannot be read by man there is something elaborately unskilful in the contrivance of sending a soldier who cannot read to take the epitaph in wax only that it may close the play by being read with more solemnity in the last scene viv traverst arms arms across viv the time is flush a bird is flush when his feathers are grown and he can leave the nest flush is mature viv so did we woo transformed timon to our citys love by humble message and by promisd means t promisd mends dr warburton agrees with mr theobald but the old reading may well stand viv shame that they wanted cunning in excesshath broke their hearts theobald had emended the punctuation i have no wish to disturb

not a soldier shall quit his station or be let loose upon you and if any commits violence he shall answer it regularly to the law viv our brains flow hanmer and dr warburton read brines flow our brains flow is our tears but we any read our brines flow our salt tears either will serve see vi general observation the play of timon is a domestic tragedy and therefore strongly fastens on the attention of the reader in the plan there is not much art but the incidents are natural and the characters various and exact the catastrophe affords a very powerful warning against that ostentations liberality which scatters bounty but confers no benefits and buys flattery but not friendship in this tragedy are many passages perplexed obscure and probably corrupt which i have endeavoured to rectify or explain with due diligence but having only one copy cannot promise myself that my endeavours shall be much applauded titus andronicus it is observable that this play is printed in the quarto of with exactness equal to that of the other books of those times the first edition was probably corrected by the author so that here is very little room for conjecture or emendation and

coffin is the term of art for the cavity of a raised pye viii break the parley that is begin the parley we yet say he breaks his mind general observation all the editors and critics agree with mr theobald in supposing this play spurious i see no reason for differing from them for the colour of the stile is wholly different from that of the other plays and there is an attempt at regular versification and artificial closes not always inelegant yet seldom pleasing the barbarity of the spectacles and the general massacre which are here exhibited can scarcely be conceived tolerable to any audience yet we are told by jonson that they were not only borne but praised that shakespeare wrote any part though theobald declares it incontestible i see no reason for believing the testimony produced at the beginning of this play by which it is ascribed to shakespeare is by no means equal to the argument against its authenticity arising from the total difference of conduct language and sentiments by which it stands apart from all the rest meeres had probably no other evidence than that of a titlepage which though in our time it be sufficient was then of no great authority for all the plays which were rejected by the first collectors of shakespeares works and admitted in later editions and again rejected by the critical editors had shakespeares name on the title as we must suppose by the fraudulence of the printers who while there were yet no gazettes nor advertisements nor any means of circulating literary intelligence could usurp at pleasure any celebrated name nor had shakespeare any interest in detecting the imposture as none of his fame or profit was produced by the press the chronology of this play does not prove it not to be shakespeares if it had been written twentyfive years in it might have been written when shakespeare was twentyfive years old when he left warwickshire i know not but at the age of twentyfive it was rather too late to fly for deerstealing ravenscroft who in the reign of charles ii revised this play and restored it to the stage tells us in his preface from a theatrical tradition i suppose which in his time might be of sufficient authority that this play was touched in different parts by shakespeare but written by some other poet i do not find shakespeares touches very discernible see vi rev viii vol ix troilus and cressida prologue and hither am i come a prologue armd but not in confidence of authors pen or actors voice but suited in like conditions as our argument i come here to speak the prologue and come in armour not defying the audience in confidence of either the authors or actors abilities but merely in a character suited to the subject in a dress of war before a warlike play ii and skillless as unpractisd infancy mr dryden in his alteration of this play has taken this speech as it stands except that he has changed skillless to artless not for the better because skillless refers to skill and skilful ii the cignets down is harsh and spirit of sensehard as the palm of ploughman in comparison with cressids hand says he the spirit of sense the utmost degree the most exquisite power of sensibility which implies a soft hand since the sense of touching as scaliger says in his exercitations resides chiefly in the fingers is hard as the callous and insensible palm of the ploughman warburton reads spite of sense hanmer to th spirit of sense it is not proper to make a lover profess to praise his mistress in spite of sense for though he often does it in spite of the sense of others his own senses are subdued to his desires ii if she be fair tis the better for her an she be not she has the mends in her own hands she may mend her complexion by the assistance of cosmeticks iii hector whose patienceis as a virtue fixd w is as the i think the present text may stand hectors patience was as a virtue not variable and accidental but fixed and constant if i would alter it it should be thus hector whose patience is all a virtue fixd all in old english is the intensive or enforcing particle iii before the sun rose he was harnessd light warburton stated that harnessed light meant hector was to fight on foot how does it appear that hector was to fight on foot rather today than on any other day it is to be remembered that the ancient heroes never fought on horseback nor does their manner of fighting in chariots seem to require less activity than on foot iii his valour is crushed into folly to be crushed into folly is to be confused and mingled with folly so as that

shall have more w rich i wonder why the commentator should think any emendation necessary since his own sense is fully expressed by the present reading hanmer appears not to have understood the passage that to give the nod signifies to set a mark of folly i do not know the allusion is to the word noddy which as now did in our authors time and long before signify a silly fellow and may by its etymology signify likewise full of nods cressid means that a noddy shall have more nods of such remarks as these is a comment to consist iii money to boot so the folio the old quarto with more force

expresses by the different metals on which he recommends them to be engraven for the instruction of posterity the speech of agamemnon is such that it ought to be engraven in brass and the tablet held up by him on the one side and greece on the other to shew the union of their opinion and nestor ought to be exhibited in silver uniting all his audience in one mind by his soft and gentle elocution

service i have done you i am afraid that after all the learned commentators warburtons efforts to clear the argument of calchas it will still appear liable to objection nor do i discover more to be urged in his defence than that though his skill in divination determined him to leave troy jet that he joined himself to agamemnon and his army by unconstrained goodwill and though he came as a fugitive escaping from destruction yet his services after his reception being voluntary and important deserved reward this argument is not regularly and distinctly deduced but this is i think the best explication that it will yet admit iiiiii through the sight i bear in things to jove this passage in all the modern editions is silently depraved and printed thus through the sight i bear in things to come the word is so printed that nothing but the sense can determine whether it be love or jove i believe that the editors read it as love and therefore made the alteration to obtain some meaning iiiiii he shall buy my daughter and her presence shall quite strike off all service i have done in most accepted pain sir t hanmer and dr warburton after him read in most accepted pay they do not seem

other corruption than such as shakespeares incorrectness often resembles he has omitted the article to in the second line he should have written more laud than to gilt oerdusted rev ix iiiiii made

then be read thus but he as he which heavier for a whore that is for a whore staked down which is the heavier ivi well not commend what we intend to sell i believe the meaning is only this though you

themselves in hector shakespeares thought is not exactly deduced nicety of expression is not his character the cleaning is plain valour says aeneas is in hector greater than valour in other men and

all this contention it is difficult to imagine that the critic believes mirable to have been changed to irascible i should sooner read not neoptolemus th admirable as i know not whether mirable can be found in any other place the correction which the learned commentator gave to hanmer not neoptolemus sire so mirable as it was modester than this was preferable to it but nothing is more remote from justness of sentiment than for hector to characterise achilles as the father of neoptolemus a youth that had not yet appeared in arms and whose name was therefore much less knovn than his fathers my opinion is that by neoptolemus the author meant achilles himself and remembering that the son was pyrrhus neoptolemus considered neoptolemus as the nomen gentilitium and thought the father was likewise achilles neoptolemus ivv well answer it that is answer the expectance ivv beat loud the tabourines for this the quarto and the latter editions have to taste your bounties the reading which i

immaterial skeyn of sleyd silk all the terms used by thersites of patroclus are emblematically expressive of flexibility compliance and mean officiousness vi out gall hanmer reads nutgall which answers well enough to finchegg it has already appeared that our author thought the nutgall the bitter gall he is called nut from the conglobation of his form but both the copies read out gall vi finch egg of this reproach i do not know the exact meaning i suppose he means to call him singing bird as implying an useless favourite and yet more something more worthless a singing bird in the egg

command of passions and appetites in macbeth he cannot buckle his distemperd cause within the belt of rule but i know not how to apply the word in this sense to unity i read if there be rule in purity itself or if there be rule in verity itself such alterations would not offend the reader who saw the state of the old editions in which for instance a few lines lower the almighty sun is called the almighty fenne yet the words may at last mean if there be certainty in unity if it be a rule that one is one vii bifold authority this is the reading of the quarto the folio gives us by foul authority there is madness in that disquisition in which a man reasons at once for and against himself upon authority which he knows not to be valid the quarto is right vii where reason can revolt without perdition and loss assume all reason without revolt the words loss and perdition are used in their common sense but they mean the loss or perdition of reason vii and with another knot fivefingertied a

half attachd with that which here his passion doth express can troilus really feel on this occasion half of what he utters a question suitable to the calm ulysses viii for us to count we give whats gaind by thefts and rob in the behalf of charity this is so oddly confused in the folio that i transcribe it as a specimen of incorrectness do not count it holy to hurt by being just it were as lawful for we would count give much to as violent thefts and rob in the behalf of charity viii cas it is the purpose that makes strong the vow but vows to every purpose must not hold the mad prophetess speaks here with all the coolness and judgment of a skilful casuist the essence of a lawful vow is a lawful purpose and the vow of which the end is wrong must not be regarded as cogent viii life every man holds dear but the dear man holds honour far more precious dear than life valuable man the modern editions read brave man the repetition of the word is in our authors manner viii brother you have a vice of mercy in you which better fits a lion than a man the traditions and stories of the darker ages abounded with examples of the lions generosity upon the supposition that these acts of clemency were true troilus reasons not improperly that to spare against reason by mere instinct of pity became rather a generous beast than a wise man vx hence broker lacquey for brothel the folio reads

sun the vail is i think the sinking of the sun not veil or cover general observation this play is more correctly written than most of shakespeares compositions but it is not one of those in which either the extent of his views or elevation of his fancy is fully displayed as the story abounded with materials he has exerted little invention but he has diversified his characters with great variety and preserved them with great exactness his vicious characters sometimes disgust but cannot corrupt for both cressida and pandarus are detested and contemned the comic characters seem to have been the favourites of the writer they are of the superficial kind and exhibit more of manners than nature but they are copiously filled and powerfully impressed shakespeare has in his story followed for the greater part the old book of caxton which was then very popular but the character of thersites of which it makes no mention is a proof that this play was written after chapman had published his version of homer cymbeline ii you do not meet a man but frowns our bloods no more obey the heavens than our courtiers still seen as does the kings w browsno more this passage is so difficult that commentators may differ concerning it without animosity or shame of the two emendations proposed hanmers is the more licentious but he makes the sense clear and leaves the reader an easy passage dr warburton has corrected with more caution but less improvement his reasoning upon his own reading is so obscure and perplexed that i suspect some injury of the press i am now to tell my opinion which is that the lines stand as they were originally written and that a paraphrase such as the licentious and abrupt expressions of our author too frequently require will make emendation unnecessary we do not meet a man but frowns our bloods our countenances which in popular speech are said to be regulated by the temper of the blood no more obey the laws of heaven which direct us to appear what we really are than our courtiers that is than the bloods of our courtiers but our bloods like theirs still seem as doth the kings ii i do extend him sir within himself i extend him within himself my praise however extensive is within his merit ii livd in courtwhich rare it is to do most praisd most lovd this encomium is high and artful to be at once in any great degree loved and praised is truly rare ii a glass that feated them a glass that featurd them such is the reading in all the modern editions i know not by whom first substituted for a glass that feared them i have displaced featurd though it can plead long prescription because i am inclined to think that feared has the better title mirrour was a favourite word in that age for an example or a pattern by noting which the manners were to be formed as dress is regulated by looking in a glass when don bellianis is stiled the mirrour of knighthood the idea given is not that of a glass in which every knight may behold his own resemblance but an example to be viewed by knights as often as a glass is looked upon by girls to be viewed that they may know not what they are but what they ought to be such a glass may fear the more mature as displaying excellencies which they have arrived at maturity without attaining to fear is here as in other places to fright i believe dr johnson is mistaken as to the reading of the folio which is feated the page of the copy which he consulted is very faintly printed but i have seen another since which plainly gives this reading steevens if feated be the right word it must i think be explained thus a glass that formed them a model by the contemplation and inspection of which they formed their manners see vii ii i something fear my fathers wrath but nothing always reservd my holy duty what his rage can do on me i say i do not fear my father so far as i may say it without breach of duty ii though ink be made of gall shakespeare even in this poor conceit has confounded the vegetable galls used in ink with the animal gall supposed to be bitter ii then heapesta years age on me dr warburton reads a yare age on me it seems to me even from skinner whom he cites that yare is used only as a personal quality nor is the authority of skinner sufficient without some example to justify the alteration hanmers reading is better but rather too far from the original copy thou heapest many a years age on me i read thou heapst years ages on me ii a touch more raresubdues all pangs all fears rare is used often for eminently good but i do not remember any passage in which it stands for eminently bad may we read a touch more near cura deam propior luctusque domesticus angit ovid shall we try again a touch more rear crudum vulnus but of this i know not any example there is yet another interpretation which perhaps will remove the difficulty a touch more rare may mean a nobler passion ii a puttock a kite iii her beauty and her brain go not together i believe the lord

desire vomit emptiness not so allurd to feed ie that appetite which is not allured to feed on such excellence can have no stomach at all but though empty must nauseate every thing warb i explain this passage in a sense almost contrary iachimo in this counterfeited rapture has shewn how the eyes and the judgment would determine in favour of imogen comparing her with the present mistress of posthumus and proceeds to say that appetite too would give the same suffrage desire says he when it approached sluttery and considered it in comparison with such neat excellence would not only be not so allured to feed but seized with a fit of loathing would vomit emptiness would feel the convulsions of disgust though being unfed it had nothing to eject tyrwhitt vomit emptiness allure this is not

particularly upon what he himself writes in the foregoing play on this very subject and made the water which they beat to follow faster as amorous of their strokes warburton it is easy to sit down and give our author meanings which he never had shakespeare has no great right to censure poetical exaggeration of which no poet is more frequently guilty that he intended to ridicule his own lines is very uncertain when there are no means of knowing which of the two plays was written first the commentator has contented himself to suppose that the foregoing play in his book was the play of earlier composition nor is the reasoning better than the assertion if the language of iachimo be such as shews him to be mocking the credibility of his hearer his language is very improper when his business was to deceive but the truth is that his language is such as a skilful villain would naturally use a mixture of airy triumph and serious deposition his gaiety shews his seriousness to be without

mind agitated and perturbed spontaneously and inadvertently discharges itself in words the speech throughout all its tenor if the last conceit be excepted seems to issue warm from the heart he first condemns his own violence then tries to disburden himself by imputing part of the crime to pisanio he next sooths his mind to an artificial and momentary tranquility by trying to think that he has been only an instrument of the gods for the happiness of imogen he is now grown reasonable enough to determine that having done so much evil he will do no more that he will not fight against the

events in any system of life were to waste criticism upon unresisting imbecility upon faults too evident for detection and too gross for aggravation king lear ii in the division of the kingdom there is something of obscurity or inaccuracy in this preparatory scene the king has already divided his kingdom and yet when he enters he examines his daughters to discover in what proportions he should

shall have dread to speak when power to flattery bows to plainness honours bound when majesty stoops to folly reverse thy doom and in thy best consideration check this hideous rashness answer my life my judgment thy youngest daughter does not love thee least i have given this passage according to the old folio from which the modern editions have silently departed for the sake of better numbers with a degree of insincerity which if not sometimes detected and censured must impair the credit of ancient books one of the editors and perhaps only one knew how much mischief may be done by such clandestine alterations the quarto agrees with the folio except that for reserve thy state it gives reverse thy doom and has stoops instead of falls to folly the meaning of answer my life my judgment is let my life be answerable for my judgment or i will stake my life on my opinion the reading which without any right has possessed all the modern copies is this to plainness honour is bound when majesty to folly falls reserve thy state with better judgment check this hideous rashness with my life i answer thy youngest daughter c i am inclined to think that reverse thy doom was shakespeares first reading as more apposite to the present occasion and that he changed it afterwards to reserve thy state which conduces more to the progress of the action ii the true blank of thine eye the blank

copy of dr warburton has very acutely explained and defended the reading that he has chosen but i am not certain that he has chosen right if we take the reading of the folio our potency made good the sense will be less profound indeed but less intricate and equally commodious as thou hast come with unreasonable pride between the sentence which i had passed and the power by which i shall execute it take thy reward in another sentence which shall make good shall establish shall maintain that power if dr warburtons explanation be chosen and every reader will wish to choose it we may better read which nor our nature nor our state can bear or potency make good mr davies thinks that our potency made good relates only to our place which our nature cannot bear nor our place without departure from the potency of that place this is easy and clear lear who is characterized as hot heady and violent is with very just observation of life made to entangle himself with vows upon any sudden provocation

your forevouchd affection falln into taint this line has no clear or strong sense nor is this reading authorized by any copy though it has crept into all the late editions the early quarto reads or you for vouchd affections falln into taint the folio or your forevouchd affection fall into taint taint is used for corruption and for disgrace if therefore we take the oldest reading it may be reformed thus sure her offence must be of such unnatural degree that monsters it or you for vouchd affection fall into taint her offence must be prodigious or you must fal into reproach for having vouched affection which you did not feel if the reading of the folio be preferred we may with a very slight change produce the same sense sure her offence must be of such unnatural degree that monsters it or your forevouchd affection falls into taint that is falls into reproach or censure but there is another possible sense or signifies before and or ever is before ever the meaning in the folio may therefore be sure her crime must be monstrous before your affection can be affected with hatred let the reader determine as i am not much a friend to conjectural emendation i should prefer

literally to supplant the word be has no authority iii subscribd his power to subscribe is to transfer by signing or subscribing a writing of testimony we now use the term he subscribed forty pounds to the new building iii confind to exhibition is allowance the term is yet used in the universities iii all this doneupon the gad so the old copies the later editions read all is gone upon the gad which besides that it is unauthorized is less proper to do upon the gad is to act by the sudden stimulation of caprice as cattle run madding when they are stung by the gad fly iii taste of my virtue though taste may stand in this place yet i believe we should read assay or test of my virtue they are both metallurgical terms and properly joined so in hamlet bring me to the test iii idle and fond weak and foolish iii pretence pretence is design purpose so afterwards in this play pretence and purpose of unkindness iii wind me into him i once thought it should be read you into him but perhaps it is a familiar phrase like do me this iii i would unstate myself to be in a due resolution ie i will throw aside all consideration of my relation to him that i may act as justice requires warburton such is this learned mans explanation i take the meaning to be rather this do you frame the business who can act with less emotion i would unstate myself it would in me be a departure from the paternal character to be in a due resolution to be settled and composed on such an occasion the words would and should are in old language often confounded iiil convey the business convey for introduce warb to convey is rather to carry through than to introduce in this place it is to manage artfully we say of a juggler that he has a clean conveyance iii these late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us tho the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus yet nature finds itself scourgd by the frequent effects that is though natural philosophy can give account of eclipses yet we feel their consequences iii i promise you the effects he writes of succeed unhappily the folio edition commonly differs from the first quarto by augmentations or insertions but in this place it varies by omission and by the omission of something which naturally introduces the following dialogue it is easy to remark that in this speech which ought i think to be inserted as it now is in the text edmund with the common craft of fortunetellers mingles the past and future and tells of the future only what he already foreknows by confederacy or can attain by probable conjecture see vi iii that with the mischief of your person it would scarcely allay this reading is in both copies yet i believe the author gave it that but with the mischief of your person it would scarce allay iiii old fools are babes again and must be usd with checks as flatteries when they are seen abusd these lines hardly deserve a note though mr theobald thinks them very fine whether fools or folks should be read is not worth enquiry the controverted line is yet in the old quarto not as the editors represent it but thus with checks as flatteries when they are seen abusd i am in doubt whether there is any error of transcription the sense seems to be this old men must be treated with checks when as they are seen to be deceived with flatteries or when they are weak enough to be seen abused by flatteries they are then weak enough to be used with checks there is a play of the words used and abused to abuse is in our author very frequently the same as to deceive this construction is harsh and ungrammatical shakespeare perhaps thought it vicious and chose to throw away the lines rather than correct them nor would now thank the officiousness of his editors who restore what they do not understand iiv would i had two coxcombs and two daughters two fools caps intended as it seems to mark double folly in the man that gives all to his daughters iiv lend less than thou owest that is do not lend all that thou hast to owe in old english is to possess if owe be taken for to be in debt the more prudent precept would be lend more than thou owest iiv this dialogue from no lad teach me down to give me an egg was restored from the first edition by mr theobald it is omitted in the folio perhaps for political reasons as it seemed to censure monopolies iiv fools neer had less grace in a year there never was a time when fools were less in favour and the reason is that they were never so little wanted for wise men now supply their place such i think is the meaning the old edition has wit for grace iiv thats a sheald peascod ie now a mere husk which contains nothing the outside of a king remains but all the intrinsic parts of royalty are gone he has nothing to give iiv whoop jug there are in the fools speeches several passages which seem to be proverbial allusions perhaps not now to be understood iiv fool which they will make an obedient father this line i have restored from the quarto steevens this note tyrwhitts quoted by steevens is written with confidence disproportionate to the conviction which it can bring lear might as well know by the marks and tokens arising from sovereignty knowledge and reason that he had or had not daughters as he could know by any thing else but says he if i judge by these tokens i find the persuasion false by which i long thought myself the father of daughters iiv from her derogate body derogate for unnatural warb rather i think degraded blasted iiv that these hot tears which break from me perforce should make thee worth them blasts and fogs upon thee the untented woundings of a fathers curse pierce every sense about thee old fond eyes beweep this cause again i will transcribe this passage from the first edition that it may appear to those who are unacquainted with old books what is the difficulty of revision and what indulgence is due to those that endeavour to restore corrupted passages that these hot tears that breake from me perforce should make the worst blasts and fogs upon the untender woundings of a fathers curse peruse every sense about the old fond eyes beweep this cause again c iiv compact it more unite one circumstance with another so as to make a consistent account iiv you are much more at task for want of wisdom it is a common phrase now with parents and governesses ill take you to task ie i will reprehend and correct you to be at task therefore is to be liable to reprehension and correction iv i shall be there afore you he seems to intend to go to his daughter but it appears afterwards that he is going to the house of gloster iv i did her wrong he is musing on cordelia iv to take it again perforce he is meditating on the resumption of his royalty iii earkissing arguments subjects of discourse topics iii queazy question something of a suspicious questionable and uncertain nature this is i think the meaning iii have you nothing saidupon his party gainst the duke of albany i cannot but think the line corrupted and would read against his party for the duke of albany iii gasted frighted iii not in this land shall he remain uncaughtand found dispatch not in this land shall he remain uncaught and found dispatch the noble duke c w found dispatchd i do not see how this change mends the sense i think it may be better regulated as in the page above the sense is interrupted he shall be caught and found he shall be punished dispatch iii and found him pight to do it with curst speech pight is pitched fixed settled curst is severe harsh vehemently angry iii occasions noble gloster of some prize w poize prize or price for value iii from our home not at home but at some other place iiii lipsbury pinfold the allusion which seems to be contained in this line i do not understand in the violent eruption of reproaches which bursts from kent in this dialogue there are some epithets which the commentators have left unexpounded and which i am not very able to make clear of a threesuited knave i know not the meaning unless it be that he has different dresses for different occupations lillyliverd is cowardly whiteblooded and whiteliverd are still in vulgar use an onetrunkinheriting slave i take to be a wearer of old castoff cloaths an inheritor of torn breeches iiii barbermonger of this word i do not clearly see the force iiii vanity the puppets alluding to the mysteries or allegorical shews in which vanity iniquity and other vices were personified iiii neat slave you mere slave you very slave iiii thou whoreson zed thou unnecessary letter i do not well understand how a man is reproached by being called zed nor how z is an unnecessary letter scarron compares his deformity to the shape of z and it may be a proper word of insult to a crookbacked man but why should gonerills steward be crooked unless the allusion be to his bending or cringing posture in the presence of his superiors perhaps it was written thou whoreson c for cuckold thou unnecessary letter c is a letter unnecessary in our alphabet one of its two sounds being represented by s and one by k but all the copies concur in the common reading iiii epileptic visage the frighted countenance of a man ready to fall in a fit iiii constrains the garbquite from his nature forces his outside or his appearance to something totally different from his natural disposition iiii than twenty silly ducking observants w silky the alteration is more ingenious than the arguments by which it is supported iiii though i should win your displeasure to intreat me tot though i should win you displeased as you now are to like me so well as to intreat me to be a knave iiii good king that must approve the common saw thou out of heavens benediction comat to the warm sun that art now to exemplify the common proverb that out of c that changest better for worse hanmer observes that it is a proverbial saying applied to those who are turned out of house and home to the open weather it was perhaps first used of men dismissed from an hospital or house of charity such as was erected formerly in many places for travellers those houses had names properly enough alluded to by heavens benediction iiii i know tis from cordelia who hath most fortunately been informd of my obscurd coarse and shall find time from this enormous state seeking to give losses their remedies this passage which some of the editors have degraded as spurious to the margin and others have silently altered i have faithfully printed according to the quarto from which the folio differs only in punctuation the passage is very obscure if not corrupt perhaps it may be read thus cordelia has been informed of my obscurd course and shall find time from this enormous stateseeking to give losses their remedies cordelia is informed of our affairs and when the enormous care of seeking her fortune will allow her time she will employ it in remedying losses this is harsh perhaps something better may be found i have at least supplied the genuine reading of the old copies enormous is unwonted out of rule out of the ordinary course of things iiiii poor pelting villages pelting is i believe only an accidental depravation of petty shakespeare uses it in the midsummernights dream of small brooks iiiii poor turlygood poor tom w turlupin hanmer reads poor turlurd it is probable the word turlygood was the common corrupt pronunciation iiiii edgar i nothing am as edgar i am outlawed dead in law i have no longer any political existence iiiv changes again to the earl of glosters castle it is not very clearly discovered why lear comes hither in the foregoing part he sent a letter to gloster but no hint is given of its contents he seems to have gone to visit gloster while cornwall and regan might prepare to entertain him iiiv to do upon respect such violent outrage to violate the public and venerable character of a messenger from the king iiiv winters not gone yet if the wild geese fly that way if this be their behaviour the kings troubles are not yet at an end iiiv all that follow their noses are led by their eyes but blind men and theres not a nose among twenty but can smell him thats stinking there is in this sentence no clear series of thought if he that follows his nose is led or guided by his eyes he wants no information from his nose i persuade myself but know not whether i can persuade others that our author wrote thus all men are led by their eyes but blind men and they follow their noses and theres not a nose among twenty but can smell him thats stinking here is a succession of reasoning you ask why the king has no more in his train why because men who are led by their eyes see that he is ruined and if there were any blind among them who for want of eyes followed their noses they might by their noses discover that it was no longer fit to follow the king iiiv but i will tarry the fool will stay and let the wise man fly the knave turns fool that runs away the fool no knave perdy i think this passage erroneous though both the copies concur the sense mill be mended if we read but i will tarry the fool will stay and let the wise man fly the fool turns knave that runs away the knave no fool that i stay with the king is a proof that i am a fool the wise men are deserting him there is knavery in this desertion but there is no folly iiiv is practice only practice is in shakespeare and other old writers used commonly in an ill sense for unlawful artifice iiiv cry to it nuncle as the cockney did to the eels when she put them i the paste alive hinting that the eel and lear are in the same danger iiiv than she to scant her duty the word scant is directly contrary to the sense intended the quarto reads slack her duty which is no better may we not change it thus you less know bow to value her desert than she to scan her duty to scan may be to measure or proportion yet our author uses his negatives with such licentiousness that it is hardly safe to make any alteration scant may mean to adapt to fit to proportion which sense seems still to be retained in the mechanical term scantling see vi iiiv do you but mark how this becomes the house t the use warburton called becomes the house a most expressive phrase with this most expressive phrase i believe no reader is satisfied i suspect that it has been written originally ask her forgiveness do you but mark how this becometh thus dear daughter i confess c becomes the house and becometh thus might be easily confounded by readers so unskilful as the original printers iiiv age is unnecessary ie old age has few wants iiiv lookd black upon me to look black may easily be explained to look cloudy or gloomy see milton so frownd the mighty combatants that hell grew darker at their frown iiiv to fall and blast her pride thus the quarto the folio reads not so well to fall and blister i think there is still a fault which may be easily mended by changing a letter infect her beauty ye fensuckd fogs drawn by the powerful sun do fall and blast her pride iiiv thy tenderhested nature shall not givethee oer to harshness this word though its general meaning be plain i do not critically understand iiiv to scant my sizes to contract my allowances or proportions settled iiiv much less advancement the word advancement is ironically used here for conspicuousness of punishment as we now say a man is advanced to the pillory we should read but his own disorders deservd much more advancement iiiv i pray you father being weak seem so w deemt so the meaning is since you are weak be content to think yourself weak no change is needed iiiv base life ie in a servile state iiiv embossed carbuncle embossed is swelling protuberant iiiv those wicked creatures yet do look wellfavourd when others are more wicked dr warburton would exchange the repeated epithet wicked into wrinkled in both places the commentators only objection to the lines as they now stand is the discrepancy of the metaphor the want of opposition between wicked and wellfavoured but he might have remembered what he says in his own preface concerning mixed modes shakespeare whose mind was more intent upon notions than words had in his thoughts the pulchritude of virtue and the deformity of wickedness and though he had mentioned wickedness made the correlative answer to deformity iiii that things might change or cease tears his white hair the first folio ends the speech at change or cease and begins again with kents question but who is with him the whole speech is forcible but too long for the occasion and properly retrenched iiii my note my observation of your character iiii are but furnishings furnishings are what we now call colours external pretences iiii there is division although as yet the face of it is coverd with mutual cunning twixt albany and cornwall who have as who have not whom their great stars throne and set high servants who seem no less which are to france the spies and speculations intelligent of our state what hath been seen either in snuffs and packings of the dukes or the hard rein which both of them have borne against the old kind king or something deeper whereof perchance these are but furnishings but true it is from france there comes a power into this scatterd kingdom who already wise in our negligence have secret fee in some of our best ports and are at point to shew their open banner now to you the true state of this speech cannot from all these notes be discovered as it now stands it is collected from two editions the lines which i have distinguished by italics are found in the folio not in the quarto the following lines inclosed in crotchets are in the quarto not in the folio so that if the speech be read with omissions of the italics it will stand according to the first edition and if the italics are read and the lines that follow them omitted it will then stand according to the second the speech is now tedious because it is formed by a coalition of both the second edition is generally best and was probably nearest to shakespeares last copy but in this passage the first is preferable for in the folio the messenger is sent he knows not why he knows not whither i suppose shakespeare thought his plot opened rather too early and made the alteration to veil the event from the audience but trusting too much to himself and full of a single purpose he did not accommodate his new lines to the rest of the scene the learned critics warburton emendations are now to be examined scattered he has changed to scathed for scattered he says gives the idea of an anarchy which was not the case it may be replied that scathed gives the idea of ruin waste and desolation which was not the case it is unworthy a lover of truth in questions of great or little moment to exaggerate or extenuate for mere convenience or for vanity yet less than convenience scattered naturally means divided unsettled disunited next is offered with great pomp a change of sea to seize but in the first edition the word is fee for hire in the sense of having any one in fee that is at devotion for money fee is in the second quarto changed to see from which one made sea and another seize iiiii thoughtexecuting doing execution with rapidity equal to thought iiiii here i stand your slave w brave the meaning is plain enough he was not their slave by right or compact but by necessity and compulsion why should a passage be darkened for the sake of changing it besides of brave in that sense i remember no example iiiii tis foul shameful dishonourable iiiii so beggars marry many ie a beggar marries a wife and lice iiiii mans nature cannot carrythe affliction nor the fear so the folio the later editions read with the quarto force for fear less elegantly iiiii that under covert and convenient seeming convenient needs not be understood in any other than its usual and proper sense accommodate to the present purpose suitable to a design convenient seeming is appearance such as may promote his purpose to destroy iiiii concealing continents continent stands for that which contains or incloses iiiii poor fool and knave i have one part in my heart thats sorry yet for thee some editions read thing in my heart from which hanmer and dr warburton after him have made string very unnecessarily both the copies have part iiiii he that has a little tiny wit with heigh ho the wind and the rain must make content with his fortunes fit though the rain it raineth every day i fancy that the second line of this stanza had once a termination that rhymed with the fourth but i can only fancy it for both the copies agree it was once perhaps written with heigh ho the wind and the rain in his way the meaning seems likewise to require this insertion he that has wit however small and finds wind and rain in his way must content himself by thinking that somewhere or other it raineth every day and others are therefore suffering like himself yet i am afraid that all this is chimerical for the burthen appears again in the song at the end of twelfth night and seems to have been an arbitrary supplement without any reference to the sense of the song see vi iiiii ill speak a prophecy ere i go w or two ere the sagacity and acuteness of dr warburton are very conspicuous in this note he has disentangled the confusion of the passage and i have inserted his emendation in the text or eer is proved by mr upton to be good english but the controversy was not necessary for or is not in the old copies steevens retained ere iiiii no heretics burnt but wenches suitors the disease to which wenches suitors are particularly exposed was called in shakespeares time the brenning or burning iiiiv in boy go first to the fool you houseless poverty nay get thee in ill pray and then ill sleep these two lines were added in the authors revision and are only in the folio they are very judiciously intended to represent that humility or tenderness or neglect of forms which affliction forces on the mind iiiiv led through fire and through flame alluding to the ignis fatuus supposed to be lights kindled by mischievous beings to lead travellers into destruction iiiiv laid knives under his pillow he recounts the temptations by which he was prompted to suicide the opportunities of destroying himself which often occurred to him in his melancholy moods iiiiv bless thee from whirlwinds starblasting and taking to take is to blast or strike with malignant influence strike her young limbs ye taking airs with lameness iiiiv pelican daughters the young pelican is fabled to suck the mothers blood iiiiv light of ear ie credulous warburton not merely credulous but credulous of evil ready to receive malicious reports iiiiv says suum mun ha no nonny dolphin my boy boy sessy let him trot by of this passage i can make nothing i believe it corrupt for wildness not nonsense is the effect of a disordered imagination the quarto reads hay no on ny dolphins my boy cease let him trot by of interpreting this there is not much hope or much need but any thing may be tried the madman now counterfeiting a proud fit supposes himself met on the road by some one that disputes the way and cries hey no but altering his mind condescends to let him pass and calls to his boy dolphin rodolph not to contend with him on dolphin my boy cease let him trot by iiiiv web and the pin diseases of the eye iiiiv saint withold footed thrice the void he met the nightmare and her ninefold bid her alight and her troth plight and aroynt thee witch aroynt thee in the old quarto the corruption is such as may deserve to be noted swithold footed thrice the old another night moore and her nine fold bid her o light and her troth plight and arint thee with arint thee iiiiv small deer sir thomas hanmer reads geer and is followed by dr warburton but deer in old language is a general word for wild animals iiiiv child rowland this word is in some of our ballads there is a song of child walter and a lady iiiv if i find him comforting the king he uses the word in the juridical sense for supporting helping according to its derivation salvia comfortat ne vos schol sal rev ix iiivi a horses health w heels shakespeare is here speaking not of things maliciously treacherous but of things uncertain and not durable a horse is above all other animals subject to diseases iiivi wantest thou eyes at trial madam it may be observed that edgar being supposed to be found by chance and therefore to have no knowledge of the rest connects not his ideas with those of lear but pursues his own train of delirious or fantastic thought to these words at trial madam i think therefore that the name of lear should be put the process of the dialogue will support this conjecture iiivi come oeer the broom bessy to me as there is no relation between broom and a boat we may better read come oer the brook bessy to me iiivi sleepest or wakest thou jolly shepherd thy sheep be in the corn and for one blast of thy minikin mouth thy sheep shall take no harm this seems to be a stanza of some pastoral song a shepherd is desired to pipe and the request is enforced by a promise that though his sheep be in the corn ie committing a trespass by his negligence implied in the question sleepest thou or wakest yet a single tune upon his pipe shall secure them from the pound iiivi sessy come here is sessey again which i take to be the french word cessez pronounced cessey which was i suppose like some others in common use among us it is an interjection enforcing cessation of any action like be quiet have done it seems to have been gradually corrupted into so so iiivi thy horn is dry men that begged under pretence of lunacy used formerly to carry a horn and blow it through the streets iiivi kent opprest nature sleeps the lines inserted from the quarto are in crotchets the omission of them in the folio is certainly faulty yet i believe the folio is printed from shakespearea last revision carelessly and hastily performed with more thought of shortening the scenes than of continuing the action iiivi free things states clear from distress iiivi mark the high noises and thyself bewray when false opinion whose wrong thought defiles thee in thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee attend to the great events that are approaching and make thyself known then that false opinion now prevailing against thee shall in consequence of just proof of thy integrity revoke its erroneous sentence and recall thee to honour and reconciliation iiivii ray lord of gloster meaning edmund newly invested with his fathers titles the steward speaking immediately after mentions the old duke by the same title iiivii though well we may not pass upon his life without the form of justice yet our power shall do a courtesy to our wrath to do a courtesy is to gratify to comply with to pass is to pass a judicial sentence iiivii corky arms dry witherd husky arms iiivii i am tyd to the stake and i must stand the course the running of the dogs upon me iiivii all cruels else subscribd yielded submitted to the necessity of the occasion iiivii ill never care what wickedness i do this short dialogue i have inserted from the old quarto because i think it full of nature servants could hardly see such a barbarity committed on their master without pity and the vengeance that they presume canst overtake the actors of it is a sentiment and doctrine well worthy of the stage theobald it is not necessary to suppose them the servants of gloster for cornwall was opposed to extremity by his own servant ivi yet better thus and known to be contemnd the meaning is tis better to be thus contemned and known to yourself to be contemned or perhaps there is an error which may be rectified thus yet better thus unknown to be contemnd when a man divests himself of his real character he feels no pain from contempt because he supposes it incurred only by a voluntary disguise which he can throw off at pleasure i do not think any correction necessary ivi our mean secures us ie moderate mediocre condition warburton banner writes by an easy change meanness secures us the two original editions have our meanes secures us i do not remember that mean is ever used aa a substantive for low fortune which is the sense here required nor for mediocrity except in the phrase the golden mean i suspect the passage of corruption and would either read our means seduce us our powers of body or fortune draw us into evils or our maims secure us that hurt or deprivation which makes us defenceless proves our safeguard this is very proper in gloster newly maimed by the evulsion of his eyes ivi five fiends have been in poor tom at once of lust as obidicut hobbididance prince of dumbness mahu of stealing modo of murder and flibbertigibbet of mopping and mowing who since possesses chambermaids and waitingwomen so bless thee master the passage in crotchets is omitted in the folio because i suppose as the story was forgotten the jest was lost ivi let the superfluous and lustdieted man lear has before uttered the same sentiment which indeed cannot be too strongly impressed tho it may be too often repeated ivi that slaves your ordinance w braves the emendation is plausible yet i doubt whether it be right the language of shakespeare is very licentious and his words have often meanings remote from the proper and original use to slave or beslave another is to treat him with terms of indignity in a kindred sense to slave the ordinance may be to slight or ridicule it ivii our mild husband it must be remembered that albany the husband of gonerill disliked in the end of the first act the scheme of oppression and ingratitude ivii i have been worth the whistle this expression is a reproach to albany for having neglected her though you disregard me thus i have been worth the whistle i have found one that thinks me worth calling ivii from her maternal sap w material i suppose no reader doubts but the word should be maternal dr warburton has taken great pains without much success and indeed without much exactness of attention to prove that material has a more proper sense than maternal and yet seemed glad at last to infer from an apparent error of another press that material and maternal meant the same ivii a man a prince by him so benefited after this line i suspect a line or two to be wanting which upbraids her for her sisters cruelty to gloster warburton here is a pompous note to support a conjecture apparently erroneous and confuted by the next scene in which the account is given for the first time to albany of glosters sufferings ivii like monsters of the deep fishes are the only animals that are known to prey upon their own species ivii thou changed and selfcoverd thing of these lines there is but one copy and the editors are forced open conjecture they have published this line thus thou changd and selfconverted thing but i cannot but think that by selfcoverd the author meant thou that hast disguised nature by wickedness thou that hast hid the woman under the fiend ivii one way i like this well gonerill is well pleased that cornwall is destroyed who was preparing war against her and her husband but is afraid of losing edmund to the widow iviii the french camp near dover enter kent and a gentleman this scene seems to have been left out only to shorten the play and is necessary to continue the action it is extant only in the quarto being omitted in the first folio i have therefore put it between crotchets iviii a gentleman the gentleman whom he sent in the foregoing act with letters to cordelia iviii made she no verbal question i do not see the impropriety of verbal question such pleonasms are common so we say my ears have heard my eyes have beheld besides where is the word quest warburtons emendation to be found iviii and clamourmoistend clamour moistend her that is her outcries were accompanied with tears iviii one selfmate and mate the same husband and the same wife iviii tis so they are afoot dr warburton thinks it necessary to read tis said but the sense is plain so it is that they are on foot iviv with burdocks hemlock i do not remember any such plant as a hardock but one of the most common weeds is a burdock which i believe should be read here and so hanmer reads iviv the means to lead it the reason which should

me unseal the letterstew madam i had rather i know not well why shakespeare gives the steward who is a mere factor of wickedness so much fidelity he now refuses the letter and afterwards when he is dying thinks only how it may be safely delivered ivv i do advise you take this note note means in this place not a letter but a remark therefore observe what i am saying ivv you may gather more you

borrowed from sidneys arcadia ivvi thy voice is alterd edgar alters his voice in order to pass afterwards for a malignant spirit ivvi how fearfuland dizzy tis to cast ones eyes so low this description has been much admired since the time of addison who has remarked with a poor attempt at pleasantry that he who can read it without being giddy has a very good head or a very bad one the description is certainly not mean but i am far from thinking it wrought to the utmost excellence of poetry he that looks from a precipice finds himself assailed by one great and dreadful image of irresistible destruction but this overwhelming idea is dissipated and enfeebled from the instant that the mind can restore itself to the observation of particulars and diffuse its attention to distinct objects the enumeration of the choughs and crows the samphireman and the fishers counteracts the great effect of the prospect as it peoples the desert of intermediate vacuity and stops the mind in the rapidity of its descent through emptiness and horror ivvi her cock her cockboat ivvi when life itselfyields to the theft when life is willing to be destroyed ivvi thus might he pass indeed thus he might die in reality we still use the word passing bell ivvi ten masts at each make not the altitude pope attacht mr popes conjecture may stand if the word which he uses were known in our authors time but i think it is of later introduction he may say ten masts on end ivvi chalky bourn bourn seems here to signify a hill its common signification is a brook milton in comus uses bosky bourn in the same sense perhaps with shakespeare but in both authors it may mean only a boundary ivvi the clearest gods the purest the most free from evil ivvi bear free and patient thoughts to be melancholy is to have the mind chained down to one painful idea there is therefore great propriety in exhorting gloster to free thoughts to an emancipation of his soul from grief and despair ivvi the safer sense will neer

either with his foregoing or following train of thoughts madmen think not wholly at random i would read thus a good flock flocks are wool moulded together the sentence then follows properly it were a delicate stratagem to shoe a troop of horse with felt ie with flocks kneaded to a mass a practice i believe sometimes used in former ages for it is mentioned in ariosto fece nel cader strepito quanto avesse avuto sotto i piedi il feltro it is very common for madmen to catch an accidental hint and strain it to the purpose predominant in their minds lear picks up a flock and immediately thinks to surprize his enemies by a troop of horse shod with flocks or felt yet block may stand if we suppose that the sight of a block put him in mind of mounting his horse ivvi why this would make a man a man

exclamations are given to edgar and albany in the folio to animate the dialogue and employ all the persons on the stage but they are very obscure viii with boot with advantage with increase general observation the tragedy of lear is deservedly celebrated among the dramas of shakespeare there is perhaps no play which keeps the attention so strongly fixed which so much agitates our passions and interests our curiosity the artful involutions of distinct interests the striking opposition of contrary characters the sudden changes of fortune and the quick succession of events fill the mind with a perpetual tumult of indignation pity and hope there is no scene which does not contribute to the aggravation of the distress or conduct of the action and scarce a line which does not conduce to the progress of the scene so powerful is the current of the poets imagination that the mind which once ventures within it is hurried irresistibly along on the seeming improbability of lears conduct it may be observed that he is represented according to histories at that time vulgarly received as true and perhaps if we turn our thoughts upon the barbarity and ignorance of the age to which this story is referred it will appear not so unlikely as while we estimate lears manners by our own such preference of one daughter to another or resignation of dominion on such conditions would be yet credible if told of a petty prince of guinea or madagascar shakespeare indeed by the mention of his earls and dukes has given us the idea of times more civilized and of life regulated by softer manners and the truth is that though he so nicely discriminates and so minutely describes the characters of men he commonly neglects and confounds the characters of ages by mingling customs ancient and modern english and foreign my learned friend mr warton who has in the adventurer very minutely criticised this play remarks that the instances of cruelty are too savage and shocking and that the intervention of edmund destroys the simplicity of the story these objections may i think be answered by repeating that the cruelty of the daughters is an historical fact to which the poet has added little having only drawn it into a series by dialogue and action but i am not able to apologize with equal plausibility for the extrusion of glosters eyes which seems an act too horrid to be endured in dramatic exhibition and such as must always compel the mind to relieve its distress by incredulity yet let it be remembered that our author well knew what would please the audience for which he wrote the injury done by edmund to the simplicity of the action is abundantly recompensed by the addition of variety by the art with which he is made to cooperate with the chief design and the opportunity which he gives the poet of combining perfidy with perfidy and connecting the wicked son with the wicked daughters to impress this important moral that villainy is never at a stop that crimes lead to crimes and at last terminate in ruin but though this moral be incidentally enforced shakespeare has suffered the virtue of cordelia to perish in a just cause contrary to the natural ideas of justice to the hope of the reader and what is yet more strange to the faith of chronicles yet this conduct is justified by the spectator who blames tate for giving cordelia success and happiness in his alteration and declares that in his opinion the tragedy has lost half its beauty dennis has remarked whether justly or not that to secure the favourable reception of cato the town was poisoned with much false and abominable criticism and that endeavours had been used to discredit and decry poetical justice a play in which the wicked prosper and the virtuous miscarry may doubtless be good because it is a just representation of the common events of human life but since all reasonable beings naturally love justice i cannot easily be persuaded that the observation of justice makes a play worse or that if other excellencies are equal the audience will not always rise better pleased from the final triumph of persecuted virtue in the present case the public has decided cordelia from the time of tate has always retired with victory and felicity and if my sensations could add any thing to the general suffrage i night relate i was many years ago so shocked by cordelias death that i know not whether i ever endured to read again the last scenes of the play till i undertook to revise them as an editor there is another controversy among the critics concerning this play it is disputed whether the predominant image in lears disordered mind be the loss of his kingdom or the cruelty of his daughters mr murphy a very judicious critic has evinced by induction of particular passages that the cruelty of his daughters is the primary source of his distress and that the loss of royalty affects him only as a secondary and subordinate evil he observes with great justness that lear would move our compassion but little did we not rather consider the injured father than the degraded king the story of this play except the episode of edmund which is derived i think from sidney is taken originally from geoffry of monmouth whom hollinshed generally copied but perhaps immediately from an old historical ballad my reason for believing that the play was posterior to the ballad rather than the ballad to the play is that the ballad has nothing of shakespeares nocturnal tempest which is too striking to have been omitted and that it follows the chronicle it has the rudiments of the play but none of its amplifications it first hinted lears madness but did not array it in circumstances the writer of the ballad added something to the history which is a proof that he would have added more if more had occurred to his mind and more must have occurred if he had seen shakespeare johnson appends a lamentable song of the death of king leir and his three daughters vol i romeo and juliet ii give me my long sword the long sword was the sword used in war which was sometimes wielded with both hands ii as is the bud bit with an envious worm ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air or dedicate his

warburton read to his ill the present reading has some obscurity the meaning may be that love finds out means to pursue his desire that the blind should find paths to ill is no great wonder ii o brawling love o loving hate of these lines neither the sense nor occasion is very evident he is not yet in love with an eneny and to love one and hate another is no such uncommon state as can deserve all this toil of antithesis ii why such is loves transgression such is the consequence of unskilful and mistaken kindness see viii being purgd a fire sparkling in lovers eyes the author may mean being purged of smoke but it is perhaps a meaning never given to the word in any other place i would rather read being urged a fire sparkling being excited and inforced to urge the fire is the technical term ii being vexd a sea nourishd with lovers tears as this line stands single it is likely that the foregoing or following line that rhymd to it is lost ii tell me in sadness that is tell me gravely tell me in seriousness ii in strong proof in chastity of proof as we say in armour of proof ii o she is rich in beauty only poor that when she dies with beauty dies her store mr theobald reads with her dies beauties store and is followed by the two succeeding editors i have replaced the old reading because i think it at least as plausible as the correction she is rich says he in beauty and only poor in being subject to the lot of humanity that her store or riches can be destroyed by death who shall by the same blow put an end to beauty iii she is the hopeful lady of my earth the lady of his earth is an expression not very intelligible unless he means that she is heir to his estate and i suppose no man ever called his lands his earth i will venture to propose a bold change she is the hope

pope the thought and the word sol through white curtains shot a timrous ray and sped those eyes that must eclipse the day both the old and the new reading are philosophical nonsense but they are both and both equally poetical sense iii such comfort as do lusty young men feel to say and to say in pompous words that a young man shall feel as much in an assembly of beauties as young men feel in the month of april is surely to waste sound upon a very poor sentiment i read such comfort as do lusty yeomen feel you shall feel from the sight and conversation of these ladies such hopes of happiness and such pleasure as the farmer receives from the spring when the plenty of the year begins and the prospect of the harvest fills him with delight iii such amongst view of many mine being one may

this which startles in our ears originally your ears read what fear is this which startles in our ears viii fri i will be brief it is much to be lamented that the poet did not conclude the dialogue with the action and avoid a narrative of events which the audience already knew general observation this play is one of the most pleasing of our authors performances the scenes are busy and various the incidents numerous and important the catastrophe irresistibly affecting and the process of the action carried on with such probability at least with such congruity to popular opinions as tragedy requires here is one of the few attempts of shakespeare to exhibit the conversation of gentlemen to represent the airy sprightliness of juvenile elegance mr dryden mentions a tradition which might easily reach his time of a declaration made by shakespeare that he was obliged to kill mercutio in the third act lest he should have been killed by him yet he thinks him no such formidable person but that he might have lived through the play and died in his bed without danger to a poet dryden well knew had he been in quest of truth that in a pointed sentence more regard is commonly had to the words than the thought and that it is very seldom to be rigorously understood mercutios wit gaiety and courage will always procure him friends that wish him a longer life but his death is not precipitated he has lived out the time allotted him in the construction of the play nor do i doubt the ability of shakespeare to have continued his existence though some of his sallies are perhaps out of the reach of dryden whose genius was not very fertile of merriment nor ductile to humour but acute argumentative comprehensive and sublime the nurse is one of the characters in which the author delighted he has with great subtilty of distinction drawn her at once loquacious and secret obsequious and insolent trusty and dishonest his comic scenes are happily wrought but his pathetic strains are always polluted with some unexpected depravations his persons however distressed have a conceit left them in their misery a miserable conceit hamlet this play is printed both in the folio of and

is proper iiv as infinite as man may undergo as large as can be accumulated upon man iiv angels and ministers of grace defend us hamlets speech to the apparition of his father seems to me to consist of three parts when first he sees the spectre he fortifies himself with an invocation angel and ministers of grace defend us as the spectre approaches he deliberates with himself and determines that whatever it be he will venture to address it be thou a spirit of health or goblin damnd bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell be thy intents wicked or charitable thou comst in such a questionable shape that i will speak to thee ill call thee c this he says while his father is advancing he then as he had determined speaks to him and calls him hamlet king father royal dane oh answer me iiv questionable shape by questionable is meant provoking question hanmer so in macbeth live you or are you aught that man may question iiv tellwhy thy canonizd bones hearsed in death have burst their cearments w in earth it were too long to examine this note period by period though almost every period seems to me to contain something reprehensible the critic in his zeal for change writes with so little consideration as to say that hamlet cannot call his father canonized because we are told he was murdered with all his sins fresh upon him he was not then told it and had so little the power of knowing it that he was to be told it by an apparition the long succession of reasons upon reasons prove nothing but what every reader discovers that the king had been buried which is implied by so many adjuncts of burial that the direct mention of earth is not necessary hamlet amazed at an apparition which though in all ages credited has in all ages been considered as the most wonderful and most dreadful operation of supernatural agency enquires of the spectre in the most emphatic terms why he breaks the order of nature by returning from the dead this he asks in a very confused circumlocution confounding in his fright the soul and body why says he have thy bones which with due ceremonies have been intombed in death in the common state of departed mortals burst the folds in which they were embalmed why has the tomb in which we saw thee quietly laid opened his mouth that mouth which by its weight and stability seemed closed for ever the whole sentence is this why dost thou appear whom we know to be dead had the change of the word removed any obscurity or added any beauty it might have been worth a struggle but either reading leaves the sense the same if there be any asperity in this controversial note it must be imputed to the contagion of peevishneas or some resentment of the incivility shewn to the oxford editor who is represented as supposing the ground canonized by a funeral when he only meant to say that the body has deposited in holy ground in ground consecrated according to the canon iiv i do not set my life at a pins fee the value of a pin iiv deprive your sovereignty i believe deprive in this place signifies simply to take away iiv confind to fast in fires i am rather inclined to read confind to lasting fires to fires unremitted and unconsumed the change is slight iv as meditation or the thoughts of love the comment warburtons on the word meditation is so ingenious that i hope it is just iv unhonseld disappointed unaneald this is a very difficult line i think theobalds objection to the sense of unaneald for notified by the bell must be owned to be very strong i have not yet by my enquiry satisfied myself hanmers explication of unaneald by unprepard because to anneal metals is to prepare them in manufacture is too general and vague there is no resemblance between any funeral ceremony and the practice of annealing metals disappointed is the same as unappointed and may be properly explained unprepared a man well furnished with things necessary for any enterprize was said to be well appointed iv oh horrible oh horrible most horrible it was ingeniously hinted to me by a very learned lady that this line seems to belong to hamlet in whose mouth it is a proper and natural exclamation and who according to the practice of the stage may be supposed to interrupt so long a speech iv swear by my sword here the poet has preserved the manners of the ancient danes with whom it was religion to swear upon their swords warburton i was once inclinable to this opinion which is likewise well defended by mr upton but mr garrick produced me a passage i think in brantoms from which it appeared that it was common to swear upon the sword that is upon the cross which the old swords always had upon the hilt iii drinking fencing swearing i suppose by fencing is meant a too diligent frequentation of the fencingschool a resort of violent and lawless young men iii good sir or so or friend or gentleman w sire i know not that sire was ever a general word of compliment as distinct from sir nor do i conceive why any alteration should be made it is a common mode of colloquial language to use or so as a slight intimation of more of the same or a like kind that might be mentioned we might read but we need not good sir forsooth or friend or gentleman forsooth a term of which i do not well know the original meaning was used to men as well as to women iii observe his inclination in yourself hanmer reads een yourself and is followed by dr warburton but perhaps in yourself means in your own person not by spies iii i had not quoted him to quote is i believe to reckon to take an account of to take the quotient or result of a computation iii it as proper to our age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion this is not the remark of a weak man the vice of age is too much suspicion men long accustomed to the wiles of life cast commonly beyond themselves let their cunning go further than reason can attend it this is always the fault of a little mind made artful by long commerce with the world iiii for the supply and profit of our hope your visitation shall receive such thanks that the hope which your arrival has raised may be completed by the desired effect iiii the trail of policy the trail is the course of an animal pursued by the scent ilii my news shall be the fruit of that great feast the desert after the meat iiii at night well feast the kings intemperance is never suffered to be forgotten iiii my liege and madam to expostulate this account of the character of polonius though it sufficiently reconciles the seeming inconsistency of so much wisdom with so much folly does not perhaps correspond exactly to the ideas of our author the commentator warburton makes the character of polonius a character only of manners discriminated by properties superficial accidental and acquired the poet intended a nobler delineation of a mixed character of manners and of nature polonius is a man bred in courts exercised in business stored with observations confident of his knowledge proud of his eloquence and declining into dotage his mode of oratory is truly represented as designed to ridicule the practice of those times of prefaces that made no introduction and of method that embarrassed rather than explained this part of his character is accidental the rest is natural such a man is positive and confident because he knows that his mind was once strong and knows not that it is become weak such a man excels in general principles but fails in the particular application he is knowing in retrospect and ignorant in foresight while he depends upon his memory and can draw from his repositories of knowledge he utters weighty sentences and gives useful counsel but as the mind in its enfeebled state cannot be kept long busy and intent the old man is subject to sudden dereliction of his faculties he loses the order of his ideas and entangles himself in his own thoughts till he recovers the leading principle and falls again into his former train this idea of dotage encroaching upon wisdom will solve all the phaenomena of the character of polonius iiii to the celestial and my souls idol the most beautified ophelia t beatified both sir thomas hanmer and dr warburton have followed theobald but i am in doubt whether beautified though as polonius calls it a vile phrase be not the proper word beautified seems to be a vile phrase for the ambiguity of its meaning rev x iiii more above is moreover besides iiii she took the fruits of my advice she took the fruits of advice when she obeyed advice the advice was then made fruitful iiii for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dogbeing a god kissing carrion this is warburtons emendation for a good kissing this is a noble emendation which almost sets the critic on a level with the author iiii the shadow of a dream shakespeare has accidentally inverted an expression of pindar that the state of humanity is the dream of a shadow iiii then are our beggars bodies shakespeare seems here to design a ridicule of these declamations against wealth and greatness that seem to make happiness consist in poverty iiii shall end his part in peace after these words the folio adds the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickled o th sere warburton this passage i have omitted for the same reason i suppose as the other editors i do not understand it iiii the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt fort the lady shall have no obstruction unless from the lameness of the verse iiii i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation i fancy this is transposed hamlet enquires not about an inhibition but an innovation the answer therefore probably was i think their innovation that is their new practice of strolling comes by the means of the late inhibition iiii ham how comes it do they grow rusty the lines marked with commas are in the folio of but not in the quarto of nor i suppose in any of the quartos iiii cry out on the top of question the meaning seems to be they ask a common question in the highest notes of the voice iiii escoted paid iiii will they pursue quality no longer than they can sing will they follow the profession of players no longer than they keep the voices of boys so afterwards he says to the player come give us a taste of your quality come a passionate speech iiii to tarre them on to controversy to provoke any animal to rage is to tarre him the word is said to come from the greek iiii it is not very strange for mine uncle is king of denmark i do not wonder that the new players have so suddenly risen to reputation my uncle supplies another example of the facility with which honour is conferred upon new claimants iiii buz buz mere idle talk the buz of the vulgar iiii then came each actor on his ass this seems to be a line of a ballad iiii for the law of writ and the liberty these are the only men all the modern editions have the law of wit and the liberty but both my old copies have the law of writ i believe rightly writ for writing composition wit was not in our authors time taken either for imagination or acuteness or both together but for understanding for the faculty by which we apprehend and judge those who wrote of the human mind distinguished its primary powers into wit and will ascham distinguishes boys of tardy and of active faculties into quick wits and slow wits iiii the first row of the pious chanson it is pons chansons in the first folio edition pope it is pons chansons in the quarto too i know not whence the rubric has been brought yet it has not the appearance of an arbitrary addition the titles of old ballads were never printed red but perhaps rubric may stand for marginal explanation iiii for look where my abridgment comes he calls the players afterwards the brief chronicles of the time but i think he now means only those who will shorten my talk iiii be not crackd within the ring that is crackd too much for use this is said to a young player who acted the parts of women iiii like french faulconers hanmer who has much illustrated the allusions to falconry reads like french falconers french falconers is not a correction by hanmer but the reading of the first folio steevens see viii iiii as i received it and others whose judgment in such matters cried in the top of mine ie whose judgment i had the highest opinion of warburton i think it means only that were higher than mine iiii but called it an honest method hamlet is telling how much his judgment differed from that of others one said there was no salt in the lines c but

experience iiii more ugly to the thing that helps it that is compared with the thing that helps it iiii to be or not to be of this celebrated soliloquy which bursting from a man distracted with contrariety of desires and overwhelmed with the magnitude of his own purposes is connected rather in the speakers mind than on his tongue i shall endeavour to discover the train and to shew how one sentiment produces another hamlet knowing himself injured in the most enormous and atrocious degree and seeing no means of redress but such as must expose him to the extremity of hazard meditates on his situation in this manner before i can form any rational scheme of action under this pressure of distress it is necessary to decide whether after our present state we are to be or not to be that is the question which as it shall be answered will determine whether tis nobler and more suitable to the dignity of reason to suffer the outrages of fortune patiently or to take arms against them and by opposing end them though perhaps with the loss of life if to die were to sleep no more and by a sleep to end the miseries of our nature such a sleep were devoutly to be wished but if to sleep in death be to dream to retain our powers of sensibility we must pause to consider in that sleep of death what dreams may come this consideration makes calamity so long endured for who would bear the vexations of life which might be ended by a bare bodkin but that he is afraid of something in unknown futurity this fear it is that gives efficacy to conscience which by turning the mind upon this regard chills the ardour of resolution checks the vigour of enterprize and makes the current of desire stagnate in inactivity we may suppose that he would have applied these general observations to his own case but that he discovered ophelia iiii or to take arms against a sea of troubles w against assail mr pope proposed siege i know not why there should be so much solicitude about this metaphor shakespeare breaks his metaphors often and in this desultory speech there was less need of preserving them iiii the whips and scorns of time w of th time i doubt whether the corruption of this passage is not more than the editor has suspected whips and scorns have no great connexion with one another or with time whips and scorns are evils of very different magnitude and though at all times scorn may be endured yet the times that put men ordinarily in danger of whips are rery rare falstaff has said that the courtiers would whip him with their quick wits but i know not that whip can be used for a scoff or insult unless its meaning be fixed by the whole expression i am afraid lest i should venture too far in correcting this passage if whips be retained we may read for who would bear the whips and scorns of tyrant but i think that quip a sneer a sarcasm a contemptuous jest is the proper word as suiting very exactly with scorn what then must be done with time it suits no better with the new reading than with the old and tyrant is an image too bulky and serious i read but not confidently for who would bear the quips and scorns of title it say be remarked that hamlet in his enumeration of miseries forgets whether properly or not that he is a prince and mentions many evils to which inferior stations only are exposed iiii to groan and sweat all the old copies have to grunt and sweat it is undoubtedly the true reading but can scarcely be borne by modern ears iiii nymph in thy orisons this is a touch of nature hamlet at the sight of ophelia does not immediately recollect that he is to personate madness but makes her an address grave and solemn such as the foregoing meditation excited in his thoughts iiii that if you be honest and fair you should admit no discourse to your beauty this is the reading of all the modern editions and is copied from the quarto the folio reads your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty the true reading seems to be this if you be honest and fair you should admit your honesty to no discourse with your beauty this is the sense evidently required by the process of the conversation iiii i have thoughts to put them in to put a thing into thought is to think on it iiii i have heard of your paintings too well enough this is according to the quarto the folio for painting has prattlings and for face has pace which agrees with what follows you jig you amble probably the author wrote both i think the common reading best iiii make your wantonness your ignorance you mistake by wanton affectation and pretend to mistake by ignorance iiii the mould of form the model by whom all endeavoured to form themselves iiiii the groundlings the meaner people then seem to have sat below as they now sit in the upper gallery who not well understanding poetical language were sometimes gratified by a mimical and mute representation of the drama previous to the dialogue iiiii inexplicable dumb shews i believe the meaning is shews without words to explain them iiiii the very age and body of the time his form and pressure the age of the time can hardly pass may we not read the face and body or did the author write the page the page suits well with form and pressure but ill with body iiiii pressure resemblance as in a print iiiii not to speak it profanely profanely seems to relate not to the praise which he has mentioned but to the censure

read do you think i meant country manners do you imagine that i meant to sit in your lap with such rough gallantry as clowns use to their lasses iiiii nay then let the devil wear black for ill have a suit of sables i know not why our editors should with such implacable anger persecute our predecessors the dead it is true can make no resistance they may be attacked with great security but since they can neither feel nor mend the safety of mauling them seems greater than the pleasure nor perhaps would it much misbeseem us to remember amidst our triumphs over the nonsensical and the senseless that we likewise are men that debemur morti and as swift observed to burnet shall soon be among the dead ourselves i cannot find how the common reading is nonsense nor why hamlet when he laid aside his dress of mourning in a country where it was bitter cold and the air was nipping and eager should not have a suit of sables i suppose it is well enough known that the fur of sables is not black iiiii marry this is miching maliche it means mischief w malhechor i think hanmers exposition most likely to be right dr warburton to justify his interpretation must write miching for malechor and even then it will be harsh iiiii sheen splendor lustre iiiii for women fear too much even as they love here seems to be a line lost which should have rhymed to love iiiii the instances that second marriage move the motives iiiii most necessary tis that we forget to pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt the performance of a resolution in which only the resolver is interested is a debt only to himself which he may therefore remit at pleasure iiiii the violence of either grief or joy their own enactures with themselves destroy what grief or joy enact or determine in their violence is revealed in their abatement enactures is the word in the quarto all the modern editions have enactors iiiii an anchors cheer in prison be my scope may my whole liberty and enjoyment be to live on hermits fare in a prison anchor is for anchoret iiiii baptista baptista is i think in italian the name always of a man iiiii so you must take your husbands read so you must take your husbands in place of mistake that is for better for worse iiiii with two provencial roses on my rayed shoes when shoestrings were worn they were covered where they met in the middle by a ribband gathered into the form of a rose so in an old song gilderoy was a bonny boy had roses tull his shoen rayed shoes are shoes braided in lines iiiii for if the king like not the comedywhy then belike hamlet was going on to draw the

lunes the old quartos read out of his brows this was from the ignorance of the first editors as is this unnecessary alexandrine which we owe to the players the poet i am persuaded wrote us doth hourly grow out of his lunes ie his madness frenzy theobald lunacies is the reading of the folio i take brows to be properly read frows which i think is a provincial word for perverse humours which being i suppose not understood was changed to lunacies but of this i an not confident steevens adopted theobalds emendation iiiiii of vantage by some opportunity of secret observation iiiiii may one be pardond and retain the offence he that does not amend what can be amended retains his offence the king kept the crown from the right heir iiiiii yet what can it when one cannot repent what can repentance do for a man that cannot be penitent for a man who has only part of penitence distress of conscience without the other part resolution of amendment iiiiii i his sole son do this same villain send the folio reads foule son a reading apparently corrupted from the quarto the meaning is plain i his only son who am bound to punish his murderer iiiiii up sword and know thou a more horrid hent t bent this reading is followed by sir t hanmer and dr warburton but hent is probably the right vord to hent is used by shakespeare for to seize to catch to lay hold on hent is therefore hold or seizure lay hold on him sword at a more horrid time iiiiii his soul may be as damnd and blackas hell whereto it goes this speech in which hamlet represented as a virtuous character is not content vith taking blood for blood but contrives damnation for the man that he would punish is too horrible to be read or to be uttered iiiiv ill silence me een herepray you be round vith him sir t hanmer who is folloved by dr warburton reads ill sconce me here retire to a place of security they forget that the contrivance of polonius to overhear the conference was no more told to the queen than to hamlet ill silence me even here is ill use no more words iiiiv heavens face doth glow yea this solidity and compound mass with tristful visage as against the doom it thoughtsick at the act w oer this visage and as gainst the word heated from the old quarto though it agrees well enough with glow is i think not so striking as tristful which was i suppose chosen at the revisal i believe the whole passage now stands as the author gave it dr warburtons reading restores two improprieties which shakespeare by his alteration had removed in the first and in the new reading heavens face glows with tristful visage and heavens face is thoughtsick to the common reading there is no just objection iiiiv what actthat roars so loud and thunders in the index the meaning is what is this act of which the discovery or mention cannot be made but with this violence of clamour iiiiv rebellious hellif thou canst mutiny in a matrons bones i think the present reading right but cannot admit that hanmers emendation rebellious heat produces nonsense may not what is said of heat be said of hell that it will mutiny wherever it is quartered though the emendation be elegant it is not necessary iiiiv reason panders will so the folio i think rightly but the reading of the quarto is defensible reason pardons will iiiiv grained dyed in grain iiiiv incestuous bed the folio has enseamed that is

disabled their fangs ivi l a royal apartment enter king queen rosencrantz and guildenstern this play is printed in the old editions without any separation of the acts the division is modern and arbitrary and is here not very happy for the pause is made at a time when there is more continuity of action than in almost any other of the scenes ivi out of haunt i would rather read out of harm ivi his very madness like some ore among a mineral of metals base shews itself pure shakespeare seems to think ore to be or that is gold base metals have ore no less than precious ivii he keeps them like an ape in the corner of his jaw the quarto has apple which is generally followed the folio has ape which hanmer has received and illustrated with the following note it is the way of monkeys in eating to throw that part of their food which they take up first into a pouch they are provided with on the side of their jaw and then they keep it till they have done with the rest ivii the body is with the king this answer i do not comprehend perhaps it should be the body is not with the king for the king is not with the body ivii of nothing should it not be read or nothing when the courtiers remark that hamlet has contemptuously called the king a thing hamlet defends himself by observing that the king must be a thing or nothing ivii the wind at help i suppose it should be read the bark is ready

reviewing the past and anticipating the future iviv rightly to be greatis not to stir without great argument this passage i have printed according to the copy mr theobald had regulated it thus tis not to be great never to stir without great argument but greatly c the sentiment of shakespeare is partly just and partly romantic rightly to be great is not to stir without great argument is exactly philosophical but greatly to find quarrel in a straw when honour is at stake is the idea of a modern hero but then says he honour is an argument or subject of debate sufficiently great and when honour is at stake we must find cause of quarrel in a straw iviv excitements of my reason and my blood provocations which excite both my reason and my passions to vengeance ivv larded all with sweet flowers

the history of every language will be lost we shall no longer have the words of any author and as these alterations will be often unskilfully made we shall in time have very little of his meaning ivv feeds on his wonder the folio reads keeps on his wonder the quarto feeds on this wonder thus the true reading is picked out from between them hanmer reads unnecessarily feeds on his anger ivv wherein

loves and where tis fine it sends some precious instance of itself after the thing it loves these lines are not in the quarto and might hare been omitted in the folio without great loss for they are obscure and affected but i think they require no emendation love says laertes is the passion by which nature is most exalted and refined and as substances refined and subtilised easily obey any impulse or follow any attraction some part of nature so purified and refined flies off after the attracting object after the thing it loves as into air the purer spirits fow and separate from their

drawn against a hero whose virtues the archer holds in veneration here may be applied what voltaire writes to the empress le genereux francois te combat tadmire yet this emendation however specious is mistaken the original reading is not a spendthrifts sigh but a spendthrift sigh a sigh that makes an unnecessary waste of the vital flame it is a notion very prevalent that sighs impair the strength and wear out the animal powers ivvii he being remiss he being not vigilant or cautious ivvii a pass of practice practice is often by shakespeare and other writers taken for an insidious stratagem or privy treason a sense not incongruous to this passage where yet i rather believe that nothing more is meant than a thrust for exercise ivvii may fit us to our shape may enable us to assume proper

straight make her grave from east to west in a direct line parallel to the church not from north to south athwart the regular line this i think is meant vi which this ass now oerreaches in the quarto for overoffices is overreaches which agrees better with the sentence it is a strong exaggeration to remark that an ass can overreach him who would once have tried to circumvent i believe both the words were shakespeares an author in revising his work when his original ideas have faded from his mind and new observations have produced new sentiments easily introduces images which have been more newly impressed upon him without observing their want of congruity to the general texture of his original design vi and now my lady worms the scull that was my lord such a ones is now my lady worms vi

suppose it was retained by us from the saxons to carry garlands before the bier of a maiden and to hang them over her grave is still the practice in rural parishes crants therefore was the original word which the author discovering it to be provincial and perhaps not understood changed to a term more intelligible but less proper maiden rites give no certain or definite image he might have put

bilboes the ships prison vii rashlyand praisd be rashness for it let us know both my copies read rashly and praisd be rashness for it let us know hamlet delivering an account of his escape begins with saying that he rashly and then is carried into a reflection upon the weakness of human wisdom i rashly praised be rashness for it let us not think these events casual but let us know that is take notice and remember that we sometimes succeed by indiscretion when we fail by deep plots and infer the perpetual superintendance and agency of the divinity the observation is just and will be allowed by every human being who shall reflect on the course of his own life vii with ho such bugs and goblins in my life with such causes of terror arising from my character and designs vii being thus benetted round with villainies ere i could make a prologue to my brains w mark the prologue bane in my opinion no alteration is necessary hamlet is telling how luckily every thing fell out he groped out their commission in the dark without waking them he found himself doomed to immediate destruction something was to be done for his preservation an expedient occurred not produced by the comparison of one method with another or by a regular deduction of consequences but before he could make a prologue to his brains they had begun the play before he could summon his faculties and propose to himself what should be done a complete scheme of action presented itself to him his mind operated before he had excited it this appears to me to be the meaning vii as peace should still her wheaten garland wear and stand a comma tween their amities hanmer reads and stand a cement i am again inclined to vindicate the old reading the expression of our author is like many of his phrases sufficiently constrained and affected but it is not incapable of explanation the comma is the note of connection and continuity of sentences the period is the note of abruption and disjunction shakespeare had it perhaps in his mind to write that unless england complied with the mandate war should put a period to their amity he altered his mode of diction and thought that in an opposite sense he might put that peace should stand a comma between their amities this is not an easy stile but is it not the stile of shakespeare vii ass of great charge asses heavily loaded a quibble is intended between as the conditional particle and ass the beast of burthen that chargd anciently signified leaded may be proved from the following passage in the widows tears by chapman thou must be the ass chargd with crowns to make way see viii vii the changeling never known a changeling is a child which the fairies are supposed to leave in the room of that which they steal vii to quit him to

a gentleman would see you shall find him containing and comprising every quality which a gentleman would desire to contemplate for imitation i know not but it should be read you shall find him the continent vii and yet but raw neither in respect of his quick sail w but slow i believe raw to be the right word it is a word of great latitude raw signifies unripe immature thence unformed imperfect unskilful the best account of him would be imperfect in respect of his quick sail the phrase quick sail was i suppose a proverbial term for activity of mind vii a soul of great article this is obscure i once thought it might have been a soul of great altitude but i suppose a soul of great article means a soul of large comprehension of many contents the particulars of an inventory are called articles vii his infusion of such dearth and rareness dearth is dearness value price and his internal qualities of such value and rarity vii ist not possible to understand in another tongue you will dot sir really of this interrogatory remark the sense ie very obscure the question may mean might not all this be understood in plainer language but then you will do it sir really seems to have no use for who could doubt but plain language would be intelligible i would therefore read ist possible not to be understood in a mother tongue you will do it sir really vii if you did it would not much

affectation of uttering english words with french pronunciation vii more germane moreakin vii the king sir hath laid that in a dozen passes between yourself and him he shall not exceed you three hits he hath laid on twelve for nine this wager i do not understand in a dozen passes one must exceed the other more or less than three hits nor can i comprehend how in a dozen there can be twelve to nine the passage is of no importance it is sufficient that there was a wager the quarto has the passage as it stands the folio he hath one twelve for mine vii this lapwing runs away with the shell on his head i see no particular propriety in the image of the lapwing osrick did not run till he had done his business we may read this lapwing ran away that is this fellow was full of unimportant bustle from his birth vii a kind of yesty collection which carries them through and through the most fond and winnowed opinions w most fannd this is a very happy emendation but i know not why the critic should suppose that fond was printed for fannd in consequence of any reason or reflection such errors to which there is no temptation but idleness and of which there was no cause but ignorance are in every page of the old editions this passage in the quarto stands thus they have got out of the habit of encounter a kind of misty collection which carries them through and through the most profane and renowned opinions if this printer preserved any traces of the original our author wrote the most fane and renowned opinions which is better than fannd and winnowd the meaning is these men have got the cant of the day a superficial readiness of slight and cursory conversation a kind of frothy collection of fashionable prattle which yet carried them through the most select and approved judgment this airy facility of talk sometimes imposes upon wise men who has not seen this observation verified vii and do but blow them to their trials the bubbles are out these men of show without solidity are like bubbles raised from soap and water which dance and glitter and please the eye but if you extend them by blowing hard separate into a mist so if you oblige these specious talkers to extend their compass of conversation they at once discover the tenuity of their intellects vii gentle entertainment mild and temperate conversation vii since no man knows aught of what he leaves what ist to leave betimes the reading of the quarto was right but in some other copy the harshness of the transposition was softened and the passage stood thus since no man knows aught of what he leaves for knows was printed in the later copies has by a slight blunder in such typographers i do not think dr warburtons interpretation of the passage the best that it will admit the meaning may be this since no man knows aught of the state of life which he leaves since he cannot judge what others years may produce why should he be afraid of leaving life betimes why should he dread an early death of which he cannot tell whether it is an exclusion of happiness or an interception of calamity i despise the superstition of augury and omens which has no ground in reason or piety my comfort is that i cannot fall but by the direction of providence hanmer has since no man owes aught a conjecture not very reprehensible since no man can call any possession certain what is it to leave vii give me your pardon sir i wish hamlet had made some other defence it is unsuitable to the character of a good or a brave man to shelter himself in falsehood vii your grace hath laid upon the weaker side thus hanmer all the others read your grace hath laid the odds o the weaker side when the odds were on the side of laertes who was to hit hamlet twelve times to nine it was perhaps the authors slip vii you make a wanton of me a wanton was a man feeble and effeminate in cymbeline imogen says i am not so citizen a wanton to die ere i be sick vii that are but mutes or audience to this act that are either mere auditors of this catastrophe or at most only mute performers that fill the stage without any part in the action vii this quarry cries on havock hanmer reads cries out havock to cry on was to exclaim against i suppose when unfair sportsmen destroyed more quarry or game than was reasonable the censure was to cry havock general observation if the dramas of shakespeare were to be characterised each by the particular excellence which distinguishes it from the rest we must allow to the tragedy of hamlet the praise of variety the incidents are so numerous that the argument of the play would make a long tale the scenes are interchangeably diversified with merriment and solemnity with merriment that includes judicious and instructive observations and solemnity not strained by poetical violence above the natural sentiments of man new characters appear from time to time in continual succession exhibiting various forms of life and particular modes of conversation the pretended madness of hamlet causes much mirth the mournful distraction of ophelia fills the heart with tenderness and every personage produces the effect intended from the apparition that in the first act chills the blood with horror to the fop in the last that exposes affectation to just contempt the conduct is perhaps not wholly secure against objections the action is indeed for the most part in continual progression but there are some scenes which neither forward nor retard it of the feigned madness of hamlet there appears no adequate cause for he does nothing which he might not have done with the reputation of sanity he plays the madman most when he treats ophelia with so much rudeness which seems to be useless and wanton cruelty hamlet is through the whole play rather an instrument than an agent after he has by the stratagem of the play convicted the king he makes no attempt to punish him and his death is at last effected by an incident which hamlet had no part in producing the catastrophe is not very happily produced the exchange of weapons is rather an expedient of necessity than a stroke of art a scheme might easily have been formed to kill hamlet with the dagger and laertes with the bowl the poet is accused of having shewn little regard to poetical justice and may be charged with equal neglect of poetical probability the apparition left the regions of the dead to little purpose the revenge which he demands is not obtained but by the death of him that was required to take it and the gratification which would arise from the destruction of an usurper and a murderer is abated by the untimely death of ophelia the young the beautiful the harmless and the pious othello ii one michael cassio a florentine a fellow almost damnd in a fair wife this is one of the passages which must for the present be resigned to corruption and obscurity i have nothing that i can with any approach to confidence propose i cannot think it very plain from act scene that cassio was or was not a florentine ii must be beleed and calmd must be led and calmd so the old quarto the first folio reads beleed but that spoils the measure i read let hindered warburton beleed suits to calmd and the measure is not less perfect than in many other places ii preferment goes by letter by recommendation from powerful friends ii and not by old gradation w not as of old old gradation is gradation established byancient practice where is the difficulty ii if i in any just term am affind affine is the reading of the third quarto and the first folio the second quarto and all the modern editions

expression to common readers appears harsh stuff of the conscience is substance or essence of the conscience stuff is a word of great force in the teutonic languages the elements are called in dutch hoefd stoffen or head stuffs iii and hath in his effect a voice potentialas double as the dukes warburton had given a source in dioscorides and theocritus for double this note has been much censured by mr upton who denies that the quotation is in dioscorides and disputes not without reason the interpretation of theocritus all this learning if it had even been what it endeavours to be thought is in this place superfluous there is no ground of supposing that our author copied or knew the greek phrase nor does it follow that because a word has two senses in one language the word which in another answers to one sense should answer to both manus in latin signifies both a hand and troop of soldiers but we cannot say that the captain marched at the head of his hand or that he laid his troop upon his sword it is not always in books that the meaning is to be sought of this writer who was much more acquainted with naked reason and with living manners double has here its natural sense the president of every deliberative assembly has a double voice in our courts the chief justice and one of the inferior judges prevail over the other two because the chief justice has a double voice brabantio had in his effect though not by law yet by weight and influence a voice not actual and formal but potential and operative as double that is a voice that when a question was suspended would turn the balance as effectually as the dukes potential is used in the sense of science a caustic is called potential fire iii speak unbonnetted pope unbonnetting i do not see the propriety of mr popes emendation though adopted by dr warburton unbonnetting may as well be not putting on as not putting off the bonnet hamner reads een bonnetted iii unhoused free from domestic cares a thought natural to

lincolns inn read the passage thus and prays you to relieve him but the present reading may stand he intreats you not to doubt the truth of this intelligence iiii hath raisd me from my bed nor doth the general care the word care which encumbers the verse was probably added by the players shakespeare uses the general as a substantive though i think not in this sense iiii though our proper

travels history rymer in his criticism on this play has changed it to portents instead of portance pope mr pope has restored a line to which there is little objection but which has no force i believe portance was the authors word in some revised copy i read thus of beingsold to slavery of my redemption thence and portance int my travels history my redemption from slavery and behaviour in it iiii wherein of antres vast and desarts idle whoever ridicules this account of the progress of love shows his ignorance not only of history but of nature and manners it is no wonder that in any age or in any nation a lady recluse timorous and delicate should desire to hear of events and scenes which she could never see and should admire the man who had endured dangers and performed actions which however great were yet magnified by her timidity pope deserts wild every mind is liable to absence and inadvertency else pope could never have rejected a word so poetically beautiful idle is an epithet used to express the infertility of the chaotic state in the saxon translation of the pentateuch iiii antres french grottos pope rather caves and dens iiii it was my hint to speak w hent hent

interpolated travels of mondeville a book of that time iiii let me speak like yourself w our self hanmer reads let me now speak more like your self dr warburtons emendation is specious but i do not see how hanmers makes any alteration the duke seems to mean when he says he will speak like brabantio that he will speak sententiously iiii but the free comfort which from thence he hears but the moral precepts of consolation which are liberally bestowed on occasion of the sentence iiii thricedriven bed of down a driven bed is a bed for which the feathers are selected by driving with a fan which separates the light from the heavy iiii i crave fit disposition for my wife due reverence of place and exhibition i desire that a proper disposition be made for my wife that she may have precedency and revenue accommodation and company suitable to her rank for reference of place the old quartos have reverence which hanmer has received i should read due preference of place iiii and let me find a charter in your voice let your favour privilege me iiii my downright violence and storm of fortunes w to forms my fortunes there is no need of this emendation violence is not violence suffered but violence acted breach of common rules and obligations the old quarto has scorn of fortune which is perhaps the true reading iiii i saw othellos visage in his mind it must raise no wonder that i loved a man of an appearance so little engaging i saw his face only in his mind the greatness of his character reconciled me to his form iiii nor to comply with heat the young affects in me defunct and proper satisfaction t me distinct ie with that heat and new affections which the indulgence of my appetite has raised and created this is the meaning of defunct which has made all the difficulty of the passage warburton i do not think that mr theobalds emendation clears the text from embarrassment though it is with a little imaginary improvement received by hanmer who reads thus nor to comply with heat affects the young in my distinct and proper satisfaction dr warburtons explanation is not more satisfactory what made the difficulty will continue to make it i read i beg it not to please the palate of my appetite nor to comply with heat the young affects in me defunct and proper satisfaction but to be free and bounteous to her mind affects stands here not for love but for passions for that by which any thing is affected i ask it not says he to please appetite or satisfy loose desires the passions of youth which i have now outlived or for any particular gratification of myself but merely that i may indulge the wishes of my wife mr upton had before me changed my to me but he has printed young effects not seeming to know that affects could be a noun iiii if virtue no delighted beauty lack w belighted hanmer reads more plausibly delighting i do not know that belighted has any authority i should rather read if virtue no delight or beauty lack delight for delectation or power of pleasing as it is frequently used iiii best advantage fairest opportunity iiii a guineahen a showy bird with fine feathers iiii defeat thy favour with an usurped beard w disseat it is more english to defeat than disseat to defeat is to undo to change iiii it was a violent commencement in her and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration there seems to be an opposition of terms here intended which has been lost in transcription we may read it was a violent conjunction and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration or what seems to me preferable it was a violent commencement and thou shalt see an answerable sequel iiii betwixt an erring barbarian w errant hanmer reads errant erring is as well as either iii and quench the guards of the everfixed pole

these lines i know not how hope can be surfeited to death that is can be encreased till it is destroyed nor what it is to stand in bold cure or why hope should be considered as a disease in the copies there is no variation shall we read therefore my fears not surfeited to death stand in bold cure this is better but it is not well shall we strike a bolder stroke and read thus therefore my hopes not forfeited to death stand bold not sure iii of very expert and approvd allowance i read very expert and of approvd allowance iii and in the essential vesture of creationdoes bear all excellency we in terrestrial i do not think the present reading inexplicable the author seems to use essential for existent real she excels the praises of invention says he and in real qualities with which creation has invested her bears all excellency does bear all excellency such is the reading of the quartos for which the folio has this and in the essential vesture of creation dos tyre the ingeniuer which i explain thus does tire the ingenious verse this is the best reading and that which the author substituted in his revisal iii saints in your injuries when you have a mind to do injuries you put on an air of sanctity iii i am nothing if not critical that is censorious iii she never yet was foolish we may read she neer was yet so foolish that was fair but even her folly helpd her to an heir yet i believe the common reading to be right the lay makes the power of cohabitation a proof that a man is not a natural therefore since the foolishest woman if pretty may have a child no pretty woman is

things all planned with the same art and promoted with the same diligence some must succeed sooner than others by the order of nature every thing cannot be done at once we must proceed by the necessary gradation we are not to despair of slow events any more than of tardy fruits while the causes are in regular progress and the fruits grow fair against the sun hanmer has not i think rightly conceived the sentiment for he reads those fruits which blossom first are not first ripe i have therefore drawn it out at length for there are few to whom that will be easy which was difficult to hanmer iiii why masters have your instruments been in naples that they speak i the nose thus the venereal disease first appeared at the siege of naples iiiiii that policy may either last so long or feed upon such nice and waterish diet or breed itself so out of circumstance that i being absent and my place supplied my general will forget my love and service he may either of himself think it

the best men of the army when their punishment nay afford a wholesome example iiiiii excellent wretch perdition catch my soulbut i do love thee the meaning of the word wretch is not generally understood it is now in some parts of england a term of the softest and fondest tenderness it expresses the utmost degree of amiableness joined with an idea which perhaps all tenderness includes of feebleness softness and want of protection othello considering desdemona as excelling in beauty and virtue soft and timorous by her sex and by her situation absolutely in his power calls her excellent wretch it may be expressed dear harmless helpless excellence iiiiii when i love thee notchaos is come again when my love is for a moment suspended by suspicion i have nothing in my mind but discord tumult perturbation and confusion iiiiii they are close delations working from the heart that passion cannot rule they are cold dilations working from the heartthat passion cannot rule i know not why the modern editors are satisfied with this reading which no explanation can clear they might easily have found that it is introduced without authority the old copies uniformly give close dilations except that the earlier quarto has close denotements which was the authors first expression afterwards changed by him not to cold dilations for cold is read in no ancient copy nor i believe to close dilations but to close delations to occult and secret accusations working involuntarily from the heart which though resolved to conceal the fault cannot rule its passion of resentment iiiiii or those that be not would they might seem none w seem knaves i believe the meaning is would they might no longer seem or bear the shape of men iiiiii keep leets and lawdays ie govern warburton rather visit than govern but visit with authoritative intrusion iiiiii from one that so improbably conceits imperfectly conceits in the old quarto it is improbably conceits which i think preferable iiiiii the greeneyd monster which doth makethe meat it feeds on which doth mock the meat it feeds on i have received hanmers emendation make because to mock does not signify to loath and because when iago bids othello beware of jealousy the greeneyed monster it is natural to tell why he should beware and for caution he gives him two reasons that jealousy often creates its own cause and that when the causes are real jealousy is misery iiiiii but riches fineless unbounded endless unnumbered treasures iiiiii exchange me for a goat when i shall turn the business of my soul to such exsuffolate and blown surmises matching thy inference this odd and farfetched word was made yet more uncouth in all the editions before hanmers by being printed exsufflicate the allusion is to a bubble do not think says the moor that i shall change the noble designs that now employ my thoughts to suspicions which like bubbles blown into a wide extent have only an empty shew without solidity or that in consequence of such empty fears i will close with thy inference against the virtue of my wife iiiiii where virtue is those are most virtuous an action in itself indifferent grows virtuous by its end and application iiiiii i know our country disposition well in venice they do let heaven see the pranks here iago seems to be a venetian iiiiii and when she seemd to shake and fear your looksshe lovd them most this and the following argument of iago ought to be deeply impressed on every reader deceit and falsehood whatever conveniencies they may for a time promise or produce are in the sum of life obstacles to happiness those who profit by the cheat distruat the deceiver and the act by which kindness was sought puts an end to confidence the same objection may be made with a lower degree of strength against the imprudent generosity of disproportionate marriages when the first heat of passion is over it is easily succeeded by suspicion that the same violence of inclination which caused one irregularity may stimulate to another and those who have shown that their passions are too powerful for their prudence will with very alight appearances againat them be censured as not very likely to restrain them

if she flies with the wind behind her she seldom returns if therefore a hawk was for any reason to be dismissed she was let down the wind and from that time shifted far herself and preyed at fortune

was changed unnecessarily by the editors to hadst to the sane meaning more intelligibly expressed iiiiii farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump the spiritstirring drum the earpiercing fife dr warburton has offered fearspersing for feardispersing but earpiercing is an epithet so eminently adapted to the fife and so distinct from the shrillness of the trumpet that it certainly ought not

warburton i rather think it is let go all scruples throw aside all restraints iiiiii oth tis a shrewd doubt the old quarto gives this line with the two following to iago and rightly warb i think it

throne has no meaning iiiiii let him command and to obey shall be in me remorse what bloody business ever pope not to obey t nor to obey w me remord of these two emendations i believe theobalds will have the greater number of suffrages it has at least mine the objection against the propriety of the declaration in iago is a cavil he does not say that he has no principle of remorse but that it shall not operate against othellos commands to obey shall be in me for i will obey you is a mode of expression not worth the pains here taken to introduce it and the word remords has not in the quotation the meaning of withhold or make reluctant but of reprove or censure nor do i know that it is used by any of the contemporaries of shakespeare i will offer an interpretation which if it be received will make alteration unnecessary but it is very harsh and violent iago devotes himself to wronged othello and says let him command whatever bloody business and in me it shall be an act not of cruelty but of tenderness to obey him not of malice to other but of tenderness for him if this sense be thought too violent i see nothing better than to follow popes reading as it is improved by theobald iiiiv cruzadoes a portugueze coin in value three shillings sterling dr grey so called from the cross stamped upon it iiiiv the hearts of old gave hands warburton explains this is an allusion to james the firsts practice of creating baronets for money and emends to the hands of old gave hearts the historical observation is very judicious and acute but of the emendation there is no need she says that her hand gave away her heart he goes on with his suspicion and the hand which he had before called frank he now terms liberal then proceeds to remark that the hand was formerly given by the heart but now it neither gives it nor is given by it iiiiv salt and sullen rheum salt and sorry rheum the old quarto has salt and sullen rheum that is a rheum obstinately troublesome i think this better iiiiv a sybil that had numbred in the world the sun to course two hundred compasses the expression is not very infrequent we say i counted the clock to strike four so she numberd the sun to course to run two hundred compasses two hundred annual circuits iiiiv why do you speak so startingly and rash is vehement violent iiiiv tis not a year or two shews us a man from this line it may be conjectured that the author intended the action of the play to be considered as longer than is marked by any note of time since their arrival at cyprus to which they were hurried on their weddingnight the fable seems to have been in one continual progress nor can i see any vacuity into which a year or two or even a month or two could be put on the night of othellos arrival a feast was proclaimed at that feast cassio was degraded and immediately applies to desdemona to get him restored iago indeed advises othello to hold him off a while but there is no reason to think that he has been held off long a little longer interval would increase the probability of the story though it might violate the rules of the drama see act sc see viii iiiiv the duty of my heart the office of my heart the elder quarto reads the duty of my heart the author used the more proper word and then changed it i suppose for fashionable diction but as fashion is a very weak protectress the old word is now ready to resume its place iiiiv but to know so must be my benefit si nequeo placidas affari caesaris aures saltem aliquis veniat qui mihi dicat abi iiiiv in favour in look in countenance iiiiv within the blank of his displeasure within the shot of his anger iiiiv some unhatchd practice some treason that has not taken effect iiiiv for let our finger ach and it endues our other healthful members even to that sense of pain endue with a sense of pain is an expression which though it might be endured if it were genuine cannot deserve to be introduced by artifice the copies both quarto and folio read endue our other healthful members even to a sense of pain i believe it should be rather subdue our other healthful members to a sense of pain iiiiv unhandsome warrior as i am w wrangler unhandsome warrior is evidently unfair assailant iiiiv a more continuate time more convenient time the folio has more continuate time time less interrupted time which i can call more my own it gives a more distinct image than convenient iiiiv take me this work out the meaning is not pick out the work and leave the ground plain but copy this work in another handkerchief ivi naked in bed iago and not mean harm it is hypocrisy against the devil hypocrisy against the devil means hypocrisy to cheat the devil as common hypocrites cheat men by seeming good and yet living wickedly these men would cheat the devil by giving him flattering hopes and at last avoiding the crime which he thinks them ready to commit ivi boding to all thus all the old copies the moderns less grammatically boding to ill ivi without sone instruction w induction this is a noble conjecture and whether right or wrong does honour to its author yet i am in doubt whether there is any necessity of emendation there has always prevailed in the world an opinion that when any great calamity happens at a distance notice is given of it to the sufferer by some dejection or perturbation of mind of which he discovers no external cause this is ascribed to that general communication of one part of the universe with another which is called sympathy and antipathy or to the secret monition instruction and influence of a superior being which superintends the order of nature and of life othello says nature could not invest herself in such shadowing passion without instruction it is not words that shake me thus this passion which spreads its clouds over me is the effect of some agency more than the operation of words it is one of those notices which men have of unseen calamities ivi confine yourself but in a patient list for attention act of listening ivi encave yourself hide yourself in a private place ivi or i shall say you are all in all in spleenand nothing of a man i read or shall i say youre all in all a spleen i think our author uses this expression elsewhere ivi do you triumph roman do you triumph othello calls him roman ironically triumph which was a roman ceremony brought roman into his thoughts what says he you are now triumphing as great as a roman ivi a customer a common woman one that invites custom ivi have you scard me have you made my reckoning have you settled the term of my life the old quarto reads stored me have you disposed of me have you laid me up ivi tis such another fitchew marry a perfumd one shakespeare has in another place mentioned the lust of this animal he tells iago that she is as lewd as the polecat but of better scent the polecat being a very stinking animal ivi atone them make them one reconcile them ivi if that the earth could teem with womans tears each drop she falls would prove a crocodile if womens tears could impregnate the earth by the doctrine of equivocal generation new animals were supposed producible by new combinations of matter see bacon ivi whose solid virtue the shot of accident nor dart of chance could neither graze nor pierce t of change to graze is not merely to touch superficially but to strike not directly not so as to bury the body of the thing striking in the matter struck theobald trifles as is usual accident and chance may admit a subtle distinction accident may be considered as the act and chance as the power or agency of fortune as it was by chance that this accident befel me at least if we suppose all corrupt that is inaccurate there will be no end of emendation ivii garnerd up my heart that is treasured up the garner and the fountain are improperly conjoined ivii turn thy complexion there patience thou young and roselippd cherubim ay there look grim as hell at such an object do thou patience thyself change colour at this do thou even thou rosy cherub as thou art look grim as hell the old editions and the new have it i here look grim as hell i was written for ay and not since corrected ivii the smallst opinion on my greatst abuse the old quarto reads for least misuse the smallst opinion on my greatst abuse which i think is better ivii some base notorious knave for gross not in its proper meaning for known ivii speak within door do not clamour so as to be heard beyond the house ivii the seamy side without that is inside out iviii and he she lovd provd madand did forsake her i believe that mad only signifies wild frantick uncertain iviii i have much to dobut to go hang my head i have much ado to do any thing but hang my head we might read not to go hang my head this is perhaps the only insertion made in the latter editions which has improved the play the rest seem to have been added for the sake of amplification or of ornament when the imagination had subsided and the mind was no longer agitated by the horror of the action it became at leisure to look round for specious additians this addition is natural desdemona can at first hardly forbear to sing the song she endeavours to change her train of thoughts but her imagination at last prevails and she sings it iviii des the poor soul sat singing by a sycamoretree sing all a green willow this song in two parts is printed in a late collection of old ballads the lines preserved here differ somewhat from the copy discovered by the ingenious collector iviii des i calld my love false love but what said he then sing willow c this couplet is not in the ballad which is the complaint not of a woman forsaken but of a man rejected these lines were probably added when it was accommodated to a woman iviii our former having our former allowance of experience iviii heaven me such usage send heaven me such uses send such is the reading of the folio and of the subsequent editions but the old quarto has such usage send usage is an old word for custom and i think better than uses vi i have rubbd this young quat almost to the sense in some editions ive rubbd this young gnat almost to the sense and he grows angry this is a passage much controverted among the editors sir t hanner reads quab a gudgeon not that a gudgeon can be rubbed to much sense but that a man grossly deceived is often called a gudgeon mr upton reads quail which he proves by much learning to be a very choleric bird dr warburton retains gnat which is found in the early quarto theobald would introduce knot a small bird of that name i have followed the text of the folio and third and fourth quartos a quat in the midland counties is a pimple which by rubbing is made to smart or is rubbed to sense roderigo is called a quat by the same mode of speech as a low fellow is now termed in lay language a scab to rub to the sense is to rub to the quick vi no passage no passengers no body going by vi a heary night a thick cloudy night in which an ambush may be commodiously laid vii it is the cause it is the cause my soul let me not name it the abruptness of this soliloquy makes it obscure the meaning i think is this i am here says othello in his mind overwhelmed with horror what is the reason of this perturbation is it want of resolution to do justice is it the dread of shedding blood no it is not the action that shocks me but it is the cause it is the cause my soul let me not name it to you ye chaste stars it is the cause vii i must weep but they are cruel tears this sorrels heavenly it strikes where it doth love she wakes this tenderness with which i lament the punishment which justice compels me to inflict is a holy passion i wish these two lines could be honestly ejected it is the fate of shakespeare to counteract his own pathos vii a murder which i thought a sacrifice this line is difficult thou hast hardened my heart and makest me kill thee with the rage of a murderer when i thought to have sacrificed thee to justice with the calmness of a priest striking a victim it must not be omitted that one of the elder quartos reads thou dost stone thy heart which i suspect to be genuine the meaning then will be thou forcest me to dismiss thee from the world in the state of the murdered without preparation for death when i intended that thy punishment should have been a sacrifice atoning for thy crime i am glad that i have ended my revisal of this dreadful scene it is not to be endured vii false as water as water that will support no weight nor keep any impression vii villainy has made mocks with love villainy has taken advantage to play upon the weakness of a violent passion vii thou hast not half that power to do me harm as i have to be hurt hamner to bear hurt the oxford editor saw well the meaning of his author but weakened his expression she means to say i have in this cause power to endure more than thou hast power to inflict vii charm your tongue i know not whether i have read or whether my own thoughts hare suggested an alteration of this passage it seems to me not improbable that shakespeare wrote clam your tongue to clam a bell is to cover the clapper with felt which drowns the blow and hinders the sound vii she with cassio had the act of shamea thousand times committed this is another passage which seems to suppose a longer space comprised in the action of this play than the scenes include vii it was a sword of spain the icebrooks temper in the first edition it is isebrokes temper thence corrupted to icebrooks ebros temper the waters of that river of spain are particularly famous for tempering of steel pope i believe the old reading changed to icebrook is right steel is hardened by being put red hot into very cold water vii i look down towards his feet but thats a fable if that thou best a devil i cannot kill thee to see if according to the common opinion his feet be cloven vii falln in the practice of a cursed slave in the snare by the stratagem vii in the interim the first copy has in the nick it was i suppose thought upon revisal that nick was too familiar vii speak of me as i am the early copies read speak of them as they are the present reading has more force rev x general observation the beauties of this play impress themselves so strongly upon the attention of the reader that they can draw no aid from critical illustration the fiery openness of othello magnanimous artless and credulous boundless in his confidence ardent in his affection inflexible in his resolution and obdurate in his revenge the cool malignity of iago silent in his resentment subtle in his designs and studious at once of his interest and his vengeance the soft simplicity of desdemona confident of merit and conscious of innocence her artless perseverance in her suit and her slowness to suspect that she can be suspected are such proofs of shakespeares skill in human nature as i suppose it is vain to seek in any modern writer the gradual progress which iago makes in the moors conviction and the circumstances which he employs to inflame him are so artfully natural that though it will perhaps not be said of him as he says of himself that he is a man not easily jealous yet we cannot but pity him when at last we find him perplexed in the extreme there is always danger lest wickedness conjoined with abilities should steal upon esteem though it misses of approbation but the character of iago is so conducted that he is from the first scene to the last hated and despised even the inferior characters of this play would be very conspicuous in any other piece not only for their justness but their strength cassio is brave benevolent and honest ruined only by his want of stubbornness to resist an insidious invitation roderigos suspicious credulity and impatient submission to the cheats which he sees practised upon him and which by persuasion he suffers to be repeated exhibit a strong picture of a weak mind betrayed by unlawful desires to a false friend and the virtue of aemilia is such as we often find worn loosely but not cast off easy to commit small crimes but quickened and alarmed at atrocious villainies the scenes from the beginning to the end are busy varied by happy interchanges and regularly promoting the progression of the story and the narrative in the end though it tells but what is known already yet is necessary to produce the death of othello had the scene opened in cyprus and the preceding incidents been occasionally related there had been little wanting to a drama of the most exact and scrupulous regularity li appendix some apology perhaps is necessary for the inconvenience of an appendix which however we can justify by the strongest of all pleas the plea of necessity the notes which it contains whether communicated by correspondents or collected from published volumes were not within our reach when the plays were printed to which they relate of that which chance has supplied we could have no previous knowledge and he that waited till the river should run dry did not act with less reason than the editor would do who should suspend his publication for possibilities of intelligence or promises of improvement had we foreseen the oxford edition the assistance we expected from it might have persuaded us to pause but our volumes were completely finished before its publication there are no notes by johnson in this appendix several are by steevens
