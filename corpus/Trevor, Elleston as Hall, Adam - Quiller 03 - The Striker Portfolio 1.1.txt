a quiller story a new british fighter jet bought by the luftwaffe keeps crashing in germany quiller is sent to find out why adam hall the striker portfolio chapter one the fly haben sie sich verlaufen ja ich mochte nach villendorf es gibt keinen solchen ort hier vielleicht ist es wohlendorf die leute die mir davon erzahlten batten keine sehr gate aussprache wohlendorf ah ja das ist etwas ganz anderes aber es ist zlemlich weit von hier vielleicht konnten sie so freundlich sein und es mir auf der karte zu zeigen ich kann nicht einmal karten lesen aber sie mussen zuerst nach westheim fahren he pointed up the road ich glaube ich bin dort durchgefahren sie mussen durchgefahren sein fahren sie dorthin zuruck und fragen sie dam in westheim i folded the map ja haben sie vielen dank he was old a weatherstained man he watched me turn the car then in the mirror he was blotted out by the dust in two kilometres i took a small road south and turned again to come back parallel and stay in the area it was routine procedure to tell him i had lost my way later it could prove to have been bad security to be seen in this area standing by a car doing nothing he would remember a man losing his way but it was better than remembering a man standing by a car doing nothing but i didnt know if security was important in this area those bloody people in london never tell you anything dust drifted across the roadside grass when i pulled up and cut the engine the silence took over again the white dust blew like steam across the grass the roads here ran through chalk and there was a quarry gouged out of the hillside the sun was past its zenith but i was still hoping i hadnt got here too late the only real worry was that i didnt know what i was here for at all even in the sun it was cold i needed to move and the hill looked useful so i went up the road on foot taking the binoculars from the top edge of the quarry all i could see were fields and farm buildings and the spire of the church in westheim some way off below the quarry was an abandoned plough rusting among brambles there were no traffic and no one was working in the fields there was nothing interesting to look at and i began feeling fed up all they had said was please station yourself in the area westheimpfelbergnohlmundt and observe only london could be so bloody vague now i was stuck on top of a chalk quarry obediently observing an abandoned plough in some brambles at times magnification it would do london good if i trudged down there and took it to bits and did a onetenthscale sectional drawing and sent it in as sighted hours mapref blakes contour a have no intention of reassembling the fields were quiet except for the whisper nothing moved anywhere the farm buildings looked like cardboard cutouts in the distance any traffic in this area would send up dust and there was no dust nothing moved on the land the whisper was in the air i looked upwards there was no vapourtrail and i had to do a squaresearch with the binoculars before i caught it small as a fly i looked down again dust was rising along the westheimpfelberg road a couple of miles away near the spot where id talked to the farmer no one could see me from there even on top of the quarry it probably wouldnt matter if anyone did this had the smell of parkis about it move x into square and let him sweat it out you never know your luck after a dozen blind swipes parkis would score a hit and people would call it a flair they forgot the times he missed the trail of dust was fading among the fields towards pfelberg nothing else moved on the land the whisper was still audible so i lay on my back and propped the binoculars up with my hands on my cheekbones and adjusted the focus the fly was very high now and vapour was forming it was climbing to full ceiling in slow spirals and the sun flashed on it every time round it was too small to identify but its performance was military and the only plane in the west german airarm with this much ceiling was the striker sk the vapour made a corkscrew in the sky most of my awareness was now shut in by the binoculars and i forgot the fields and the farm buildings and concentrated on the bright fly trapped in the lens it spiralled hypnotically the whisper was only just audible now i put it at close on sixty thousand feet the strikers operational ceiling a new sound came in and i rolled on to one elbow and searched for it it was a heavy throb something red had started moving half a mile off a farm tractor with a cloud of diesel gas forming above the vertical pipe i watched it for a while and then lay back on the cold earth with the binoculars and located the plane again the vapourtrail had levelled off and there was a break in it i saw or thought i saw that the machines attitude was now horizontal there was a lot of glare and i couldnt be certain i started thinking about parkis again the area westheimpfelbergnohlmundt was big something like a hundred square miles and inside the towns that marked it there was only agricultural land even one of parkiss blind swipes wouldnt be aimed at information on red tractors or abandoned ploughs on the other hand any information about an aeroplane observed at sixty thousand feet would be a bit thin and you didnt have to come here to see a striker sk the luftwaffe had five hundred of them in service and you could see a squadron airborne over various sections of the map on any given day the binoculars in my hands were vertical and the plane was deadcentre in the lens immediately over the area parkis had briefed for me there was a military aircraft performing but parkis couldnt have known the throb of the tractor went on and i wished it would stop because i wanted to listen to the sky and its silence the whisper had gone now the plane was still there clinging to its ceiling with the jet throttled back ten tons of potent machinery moving about directly above my head the pilot was isolated eleven miles from the nearest human being myself his isolation and his contradictory closeness to me in the lens appealed to me in an odd way even with the peripheral light shut off by the binoculars the glare was strong because he was near the sun so i leaned on my elbow again and rested my eyes on the green fields for a bit the tractor was dragging something heavy with a bright curved blade and the earth came up in a wave birds had drifted in and were foraging in the furrows farther away a truck was sending up dust along the pfelbergnohlmundt road the air was dead calm the dust settled where it had risen the truck was audible now and i could hear the tailboard chains jumping above the sounds of the truck and the tractor another one was beginning it was continuous and fine when i lay back and put the binoculars up the plane flicked at once into the lens because it was bigger now the vapour had stopped and the corkscrew motion was much tighter the configuration was dartlike the striker sk was a swingwing and at that altitude the mainplanes would normally be in furled position twenty degrees from the foreaft line of the fuselage and not showing much the sound was pitching higher and i could see the dark blobs of the airintakes the whole image was getting progressively bigger and now i could see the exact attitude the plane was pointing downwards at a rotating angle near the vertical i used the sunflash to measure the rotation counting aloud one revolution per three seconds the plane was in a rpm constant vertical spin the noise of the truck along the road had faded the throb of the tractor was being gradually overlaid by the shrilling of the plane from the height where the dive had started it would have taken roughly sixty seconds for the sound to reach the ground by that amount i was listening to the past but as the dive went on the distance closed and sound was catching up on vision it was now uncomfortable on the eardrums i couldnt estimate speed because the plane was almost headon to the binoculars in a vertical dive there wouldnt be any power on but the striker was built to stand knots and it could reach that speed by gravity all i knew was that this scream was the sound of something going very fast time started telescoping now and i was worrying the plane was big enough at this stage to see without the binoculars and i dropped them and cupped my hands to block out the glare and watch the thing coming on at the ground without any sign of pulling out or any sign of being able to pull out the shrilling was so bad now that it was difficult to go on thinking rationally because the primitive brain was telling me to get up and run somewhere safe while the modern brain was working out a few figures the plane was now below half its attainable ceiling and coming on at something like its peak attainable airspeed which put it at a mile for every four seconds and that gave me fifteen seconds to get out and there was nowhere to go then the whole sky went dark as the planes shadow passed over me and the noise was so loud that i was on my feet and running by the time it hit the ground a hundred yards away the impact was explosive and comparable to a mediumcharge conventional bomb detonating just below ground level in soft conditions earth began falling on me soon after the shockwave had passed and there was a spherical cloud of chalk billowing round the crater the plane had made i was running into it and through it until the forebrain took over and stopped me there was no need to run any more then i began moving through the weird white light lurching against my own shadow that the sun was throwing against the chalk i could have believed i wasnt alone it took a minute to reach the edge of the cloud and i was choking a bit mixed with the dampcellar smell of the chalk was the sharpness of molten metal and kerosene the flamewave followed me and i had to start running again until i was clear the wailing sound got on my nerves and i had to stop and identify it the birds following the tractor had flown to a group of elms and were still calling in fright at the explosion the man had left his tractor and was lumbering towards the cloud of burning kerosene as if there were something he could do i found the binoculars and went back to the car turning it towards westheim on the way there i realized something parkis had known most of the post office staff were still outside and people were telling them what had made the noise but one man was behind the counter and i gave him the number and hung about for ten minutes until the connection was made london would get it by the overt intelligence sources in a few hours but they wanted it quicker than that or they wouldnt have sent me here as an observer they hadnt warned me to use speechcode when reporting so i compromised and just said the fly fell down chapter two briefing people with pekingese grow to look like pekingese the bureau doesnt officially exist so everyone there has grown to look anonymous they are flesh and blood but you never quite know whose flesh or whose blood they consist of today you get the odd feeling that during the night there was enacted an unspeakable rite involving flesheating and bloodletting by some refined form of extrasensory transference and that the apositive you were talking to yesterday is now rhesusnegative the permanent staff at the bureau have another thing in common whenever i show up there they look as if someone has left a dead rat on their desk they looked like that when i flew in from west germany and asked to see parkis it took nearly an hour to get into his room he is very high in the whitehall echelon and his room is behind what amounts to a series of distorting mirrors constructed on the principle of the chinese box the idea being that halfway through the system you give up and ask for the street but i wanted to see parkis about the fly so i kicked up a bit of fuss and they finally got the message and sent me into his room this is the room with the smell of polish and the lowry its a good picture but it has associations for me i was standing under this picture the day parkis invited swanner to resign swanner had mucked up a mission and three of us were present when parkis stood there with his hands clasped in front of him and his small feet together and broke the man up while we listened we didnt like it parkis should have told us to get out first i was standing under this picture the day when lazlo put a pill in his mouth before we could get to him that was all right he was finished and knew it and did the sensible thing and at least he died in civilized surroundings instead of where they would have put him if wed thrown him back over the frontier but he was on the floor and already turning green when parkis told us to take it away and get it buried we didnt like that either it was said for effect the worst thing about parkis is that he is the most anonymouslooking of all at the bureau his face is so ordinary that it could only be a mask and his eyes are like holes in it because they are colourless he stands so still that you feel you could walk up to him and go on walking right through him and not notice anything but a slight chill on the skin but youd come out rhesusnegative i was standing under the picture now its the only place to stand because of the disposition of the desk and the filing cabinets and the briefing table it may be arranged like that because when parkis talks to you he looks at the picture most of the time just above your head to remind you that you dont exist any more than he does any more than the bureau does he had got up when i came in he stood in front of me with his hands clasped together looking at the lowry how was munich all right theyd pulled me out of munich to watch the fly did anything happen there munich yes i sent in my report ah it sounded as if he hadnt seen it but i knew he had they would have pulled me out before long anyway for lack of positive leadin data by which they mean the smell of anything fishy i expect youll be going to paris will you no one mentioned leave i said waring is due back he looked at me instead of the picture there was nothing doing in munich that was as good as leave not quite paris is it this aeroplane i said it isnt for you why not youre a shadow executive he turned away why was i sent there to observe well i did but you didnt observe anything it just fell down so you said we wanted to know why he was staring out of the window at the winter sky the portfolio on his desk had a word on the cover thats all i saw you read my report it just came down like a ton of bricks the word on the cover was striker quite look is it because i mucked up the bangkok thing i dont think you mucked it up did you he turned round again and i could watch his face the mask with the colourless holes were giving this one to waring why him he doesnt know anything about aeroplanes he doesnt know which end the flint goes in parkis stood very still its not really about aeroplanes i was getting fed up you send me out to a precise map reference just in time to fetch a striker sk on top of my head and now you say its nothing to do with aeroplanes the thing that nettled me was that i wanted to know something and i couldnt ask him hed sent me to observe a striker crash that hed known was going to happen even to the time and the place i wanted to ask him how hed known not really he said i tried an oblique level you wanted confirmation we have to put someone on it waring yes why him nobody likes waring because he cant work without a closedcircuit transmitting system and a bulletproof jockstrap hes got a low threshold of psychological stress which is bureau terminology for being shitscared because hes due back from leave and sufficiently refreshed ive never been fitter he looked down from the lowry why are you so upset quiller i want the mission yes i can see that why i was there ah he waited and i knew id have to give him more than that but it was personal the fly in the lens his loneliness up there eleven miles away from the nearest human being myself the silence in the sky and then the long scream and the crater and the shadow id lurched against in the weird white light of the chalkcloud personal and im interested i said in aeroplanes ah i wanted to hit him everyone does look is it something i could be good at something the mission is it my cup of tea he turned slightly and stared at the wallclock it isnt really a question of that its a question of time ive already assigned a director that doesnt affect me i can start getting my clearance straight away then he can brief me we might have to change him why you might not want to work with him who is it ferris ill work with ferris he looked at the clock again its an overseas area you can jump me in he smiled it was the fixed smile of a ventriloquists doll you really want this one dont you i knew then that id sold it to him it hadnt been difficult later i knew why it hadnt been difficult there was a flap on when i went through the departments for clearance and it took longer than usual because everyone was under pressure i went through accounts codes and ciphers credentials firearms fieldbriefing and travel accounts made me go through the motions of examining my last will and testament did i want to make any changes there was nothing to change the wording had stood like this for years nothing of value no dependents nextofkin unknown when i left the building there was one of the federal republic embassy cars outside but it might not have been anything to do with the flap they drove me to the airport alone and i didnt see ferris until i was weighing in we didnt say anything before we got on to the plan ferris was a thin man with hollow cheeks and hornrimmed glasses and the remains of some strawcoloured hair that blew about when he walked he looked like a clever young electronics engineer on the verge of a nervous breakdown except for his steady eyes how much did parkis tell you the power was easing off and we slipped our belts nothing much someone tipped them off that another sk was due to hit the deck and i was sent there to confirm i watched the lamps of london dimming away below have you had anything to eat no eat while i talk the girl was wedging the trays in and we helped her the seats behind and in front of us were empty a woman with two small children was across the aisle i knew ferris had checked this he was good on security when i began on the mutton he said youll know some of this because its in the papers west germanys got five hundred devon aviation striker sk swingwing aircraft in service with the luftwaffe as part of natos nuclear and conventional air force its a good machine adaptable versatile got a flexible performance although its sophisticated and it can cope with reconnaissance interception ground support and bombing the german defence ministrys cost estimates were too optimistic and the development outlay escalated the production bill to six hundred million pounds sterling but its a firstclass strike plane and everyone was happy with it until it started falling out of the sky in the last twelve months theyve lost thirtysix of them in highimpact crashes and the pilots cant tell them what happened because theyre dead the patterns always the same as the one you saw i wondered where ferris had been when i was on top of the chalk quarry when were you called in they had to brief me before i could brief you that was all id get as an answer id worked with him before and he only told you what he thought you needed to know i had to persuade parkis i said did you it wasnt difficult hows the chop so i shut up and he said nobodys at all happy now devon aviation are bothered and theyve sent out some of their people to work with the accident investigation branch of the ministry theyve had a permanent aib team of wreckageanalysts over there since the tenth pattern crash theyve got bits at farnborough and theyve rebuilt most of one striker from a few thousand fragments the aviation physiologists are trying to be busy but they havent got much to work on you saw that crash so you can imagine what the pilot looks like afterwards so far no ones turned anything up everyones miserable west germanys worried because its their plane and the uks worried because we built it and natos worried because the luftwaffe squadrons are part of their strikingforce you want some more of that he edged his dish of french beans on to my tray hed let the girl give him a tray in case i needed seconds when do i eat next it depends how busy you get whats a pattern crash the ones that go straight in like the one you saw theyve been getting normal accidents as well controllocking powerfailure birdstrikes but theyve only lost four planes and one pilot from those without the pattern crashes the sk would have a comfortably low accident rate of course theyve had a few cases of the pilot baling out in a mucksweat from sheer panic the strikers a rogue aircraft and theyve only got to notice the clocks a minute slow and theyre hitting the ejection tit are these things crashing anywhere else not on that scale the uk and french accident rates are normallow its particular to germany thats why they say someone must be getting at the planes it was peach melba again i took his as well why are we interested were not he was trying to be cagey again so i said then what the bloody hell are we doing in this aeroplane were not interested in helping devon aviation or the luftwaffe or nato it only happens to be strikers crashing it could be cruisers sinking or reactors blowing up this agreed with what parkis had told me its not really about aeroplanes i said were interested in why somebodys trying systematically to knock out a coldwar weapon why ferris said and who thats not all all for the moment i sulked for a bit and he didnt break the silence i dont like being used as a hooded falcon i couldnt do anything about it of course youre cleared briefed and sent in and if you ask any questions outside the prescribed limits of the briefing they think youre nosey or windy and theyre usually right the man in the field isnt given the overall picture because there are always background factors that might worry him if he knew what they were it works all right but on the other hand we always go into a mission knowing theres an awful lot going on in the background on any level from the foreign office to the hotline and we tend to worry about it because we dont know what it is when the girl came for the trays i pulled out the stuff theyd given me in credentials my name was martin and i was an aviation psychologist attached to the aib team operating at the luftwaffe base at linsdorf where two of the pattern crashes had happened i assumed theyd picked on martin because it could be either english or german according to which i wanted to be at any given time there was nothing special in this lot and it looked a bit thin on the face of it but that might be because id pushed them into dropping waring at the last minute ferris saw me looking at the papers hows your german west hartlepool accent i said to show him i was still narked at not being told anything you shouldnt need much cover perhaps that was why it looked a bit thin where do i start the thing is there are two ways of going at the striker problem you can analyse the bodies and the wrecks to find how the planes or the pilots are being got at thats what everyones already doing at linsdorf and other places and theyve not turned anything up or you can jump the queue and try to find whos getting at them and why youve said that now i know you were listening in half an hour the pressure came off our haunches and we began the run in to amsterdam it was blowing a halfgale and as we came broadside on i could feel the mainplane lifting on the starboard side dust from the freight area stung our faces and a hat took off and a man ran after it we had to hang about for an hour before they called us for the hanover flight and ferris wasnt hungry and id just had a meal and neither of us talked because he wasnt going to and i wasnt going to try to make him he wandered round and round the souvenir stall peering through the glass at the varnished clogs and packets of clan his thin strawcoloured hair blowing to and fro as he moved id stopped sulking now ferris was all right id done two missions with him and he hadnt let me down now we were at it again he was here to guide me show me the way in and set me running like a ferret down a hole later hed support me feed me information and get my reports to london through the protected communications net hed pull me out of trouble if i was worth it or hed abandon me and throw me to the dogs if i got in too deep and couldnt get out and looked like being a danger to them then hed call in a replacement and thered be someone else eating his peach melbas for him while he told them as much as he thought they needed to know it wouldnt be waring if i stopped anything nasty theyd never get waring into the same area why do they have to varnish the bloody things to make them shiny but they dont look nice shiny they dont know that it was after midnight when we touched down in hanover the normal routine would be to take separate taxis to different hotels and he still didnt say anything until we were through customs and i thought he was leaving it very late this time start by seeing lovett where the carlsberg all right outside at the taxirank he said did you pick anything up in firearms only the pox chapter three selbstmord there was no wind in hanover it was cold from the outside the hotel looked like a cinema organ designed by steinberg inside it was an ornate cave full of lamps and shadows it was quiet even for one in the morning though people were about but of course it isnt your fault there were some piles of baggage near the main doors and more people were coming out of the lift hardly any of them talking i said i didnt want to see the room number lovett was in the register its just that my wife is sensitive about things like that the american was consoling the manager and then consoling his wife looking around secretively as if for a bar where he could console himself if you will follow the page herr martin the other people were coming silently across from the lift we dont have to stay honey but that doesnt mean its their fault now does it we have to be fair when my bag was in room and the page had gone i went up two floors and walked along the passage it didnt seem worth waking lovett if hed already gone to bed there was a light from under his door but there were voices from inside so i went down again because we would have to talk alone a piece of grit had got lodged under my top lid when we were crossing from the plane at amsterdam and i spent some time poking about with the corner of my handkerchief and thinking about lovett it was a name from the past and i hadnt seen him for more than a year he used to be with the liaison group and id worked three times under his direction then they sent him to rome on the carosio thing and one of the adverse party found him alone and left him for dead it finished him for operations and the bureau put him into their political section to sit in on summits and report any rot he could still move about without crutches or things like that but he was full of platinum tubing and bonerivets and his face was attractively lopsided so he never went short of a bed there was a nato conference going on in hanover this month and i suppose the bureau had sent him to sit in on it it was a bit of metal which explained why it had got lodged in so efficiently the room looked watery now that sort of job must be irksome for a man like lovett because hed been very active before and spent most of his leaves in the box of squibs showing people how to break a door down without any noise and things like that the box is the house in norfolk where were sent at intervals for refresher training but lovett was good in subtler ways and perhaps he now passed the time trying to get two frames of micro under one fullstop without any tweezers i had to blank my mind consciously before i could get to sleep because i was still narked with ferris for not telling me anything lovett would have to make up for that in the morning he cant be she laughed at first like some people do but her eyes were beginning to go bright and she went on staring at me with the laugh still on her face it seemed genuine i said he threw himself out of a window on the fourth floor last night about eleven oclock it was genuine all right i got to her before she could hit her head on anything she didnt go right under when i helped her into the chair she stayed there without moving like a dress thrown across it but her eyes opened and she began staring again and i said have you got any brandy after a minute she asked me how do you know they told me at the hotel i was going to talk to him this morning and thats what they said happened there wasnt anything but beer and a dreg or two of vodka in the bottom of a bottle so i gave her that but she didnt drink it her colour was coming back and she sounded almost normal when she spoke again so that was bill she wasnt dismissing him she just didnt feel like consoling herself with the usual deceptions but there must be a mistake i was only talking to him yesterday so forth she was the kind of woman who would appeal to lovett his wife would have approved its the official version i said anyway so you know him well he wasnt the type no whats this drink it what do you think i am it was a small room with a bunk bed and there were two dressinggowns behind the door i didnt know who the other girl was theyd given me this ones name at the hotel she was on the translating staff for the conference id asked them who came to see him most at the carlsberg and shed been the only woman on the list and i thought shed probably know him better than the others ferris hadnt actually told me to start enquiring it was the only thing to do hed sounded upset well they were on to it bloody early did they see us coming through no they dont know us i listened to his breathing on the line he was trying to think what to do now hed have to tell me a bit more because lovett couldnt they must have got on to him a few days ago you cant rig that kind of thing at short notice i could hear him sweating it out that striker you saw yes it was lovett who told us it would happen you were sent out there to confirm they must have caught his signal something like that suddenly i got a glimpse of the background behind the mission just a glimpse lovett hadnt been active since rome hed been passing on information and it had been correct the thing had come down almost on my head someone had told lovett that the next striker would crash at noon on the th in the westheimpfelbergnohlmundt area whoever could tell lovett a thing like that must be someone who knew the whole works id been sent here to find him and lovett was meant to tell me where to look but they didnt want him to they pushed him out of the window so that he couldnt is this thing off then i asked ferris theyve blocked our run that wasnt the same thing at all what do you want me to do there was another pause while we listened for bugs it seemed all right get in their way the room seemed to go cold around me you always have that feeling a sort of gooseflesh that doesnt show on the skin but i liked him for handing it to me without a tray underneath someone else like loman or bryant would have said well i dont really like to ask you and of course you know you can refuse so forth ferris had just said go and bloody well do it get in their way nobody likes it you can be told theyre holed up in that arsenal over there and youll have to go through the barbed wire and round the machinegun post and across the minefield and past the armed guard with the alsatians after that its easy and most of us will go in its not pleasant but we know what the odds are however bad we know what they are were frightened but its a different kind of fear a more supportable one from the fear of what we call getting in their way because then we dont know anything we dont know who they are or how many or where they are or what theyre doing or why we have to find them by letting them find us first and they can be anywhere in a street or a lift or a car or a shadow and when we get close to them we might not even know it might have our back to them we always find them in the end always but quite often the only thing we know about them is that they were the people who fired the shot and didnt miss all right i told ferris before he rang off he said you didnt actually see him no they said hed gone through a glass roof first and woken everyone up you might put his stuff together and check it for anything useful there wasnt anything useful a picture of sheila some notes on the conference two tickets for the operhaus dated tomorrow night money cigaretteskeys the litter we leave behind but i stayed a good hour in his room pretending to go through it and then asked the manager and the staff a lot of questions and then went back to his room and moved past the window quite a lot then i put his personal stuff together and posted it the only attention i attracted was from the police who wanted to know who i was someone in the hotel had obviously rung them up they were perfectly satisfied that it was a case of selbstmord because my unfortunate friend had left a note i didnt advise them to compare the handwriting perhaps it had been done on lovetts portable and anyway theyd have used his own pen for the signature then i went to see sheila the girl in the photograph because that was what theyd expect me to do call on his friends and contacts no one tagged me when i left the carlsberg i suppose you cant give me anything to go on she got up and tried to pour the vodka back into the bottle but her hand was shaking too much what like she asked tonelessly did you see him with anyone was he alone when you left him last night did he talk to you about anything she came up to me with dulled eyes and her voice on the edge of the breakdown she was going to have as soon as i left i cant help you i dont know who you are bills dead thats all i know it doesnt matter to me how it happened it might later but it doesnt now ive got enough to be going on with it hadnt been nice telling her the way i did but id wanted to know if she was involved pretty girls on the translation staffs at international conferences get a lot of attention from recruiting officers and some of them do things just for the kick i went to the door where the two dressinggowns hung when will you be seeing your friend my friend the girl you share with i dont need anyone it began the moment i shut the door after me and i didnt envy whoever it was that the bureau would send along to see his wife because that was going to be even worse we ought not to marry or if we marry we ought not to do the things we do no one tagged me from the block where she had her flat during the afternoon i showed up a few times at the carlsberg where the manager was looking more cheerful apparently the exodus of guests had stopped he gave me the names of a couple of people known to be friends of herr lovett and i went to see them but it was no go instead of telling me anything useful they just kept asking me why poor old bill should ever have done such a thing one of them was at the conference hall and i hired a car to get there because its easier tagging a car than a man on foot and i wanted to make it easy for them it was a se and i chose the new grey because most of them were that colour and i didnt want them to think i was actually advertising or theyd wonder why i was still drawing blank by nightfall either they werent interested or they thought that with lovett neutralized the rot had been stopped all i could do was hang about at the hotel normal routine in the case of a bump is to stay clear but sometimes were told to go in and find out what happened and quite often the people who did it will keep in the area hoping for more trade this time they didnt seem ambitious finally i got fed up and drove down to wernerstrasse and had a meal at the bavarian place on the corner and when i came out they were sitting in a darkcoloured opel parked twenty yards or so behind the se it was the one that had been outside the carlsberg when id started off from there the thing to do now was to make them lose me without my losing them its not an easy operation but its always worth trying because if youre lucky you can find out where they go and thats halfway to finding out who they are ferris wanted to know that and it would be nice to ring him up and tell him i got in and had a look in the mirror there were some traffic lights a hundred yards behind where the opel was parked and that was almost the ideal distance they were red at the moment one or two cars were going past turning out from a street not far up from the restaurant but it was better to wait for the main bunch of traffic that was held up at the lights when they flicked to green i started the engine and sat watching for a bit to judge the conditions the bunch of cars were coming up from behind me two abreast and stringing out i decided to call this one a dry run and wait for the next sequence of lights it would give the oil more time to get round the engine before i used it as hard as i was going to the se had a shouldertype seatbelt so i put it on watching the mirror the lights were at red again and the tailend of the bunch came past and left the street empty on this side it would be useful to edge the revs up a couple of hundred while i was waiting but they might notice the gashaze and it wasnt worth risking the engine was at fair working temperature and there shouldnt be any flatspot even under full gun there was nothing coming up from in front of me on the other side in the mirror the lights were green and i touched the gearshift into low and kept the clutch down the only thing that worried me now was that it was beginning to look too easy they must have got their own engine running by now but that wouldnt help them what they would need was a tank in the mirror the two leading cars were halfway down the empty stretch and closing on me fast from behind and it looked about right so i brought the revs up and the wheel hard round and put the broadside on to the bunched traffic in a turn so tight that i felt the nearside front stubaxle hit the buffer even though the weight was shifting aft under the acceleration the initial wheelspin cost a little traction but the curve was under control and i cleared the two leading cars with enough to spare although of course they didnt like finding me broadside on across their bows without any warning and they were braking hard and hitting their horns as i straightened out of the uturn and dragged at the gearshift and headed for the lights with the power still piling on there was some noise behind me on the left as the bunch began shunting and breaking their rearlights but it wasnt my fault because continental drivers never leave enough room for their brakes and theyre always leaving red glass on the roadway even when there isnt a across their bows but the noise wasnt serious so i knew that the opel hadnt even tried in any case they wouldnt have stood a chance of making the same uturn after me because the first two cars had already passed them when id pulled out and they could only have rammed into the rest of the bunch and they didnt have a tank the start i had on them now wasnt much more than sixty seconds but it was the most these particular conditions could allow the whole operation was controlled by the traffic lights and their time sequence and when they went red again the hundredyard stretch would become empty and the opel would have room to manoeuvre the lights would have stopped my run and brought the sixty seconds start to a grinding halt if it werent for the sidestreet halfway between the lights and the restaurant the one where a few cars had been turning out while i was waiting for the off i went into it just as the opel got under way with a lot of tyresqueal and came up the street in my direction i didnt lift my foot to give them time to see me because it wasnt necessary they knew i wouldnt head straight on for the lights which were now red again and there was nowhere else to go except into the sidestreet it took seven or eight minutes to lose them it would have taken less than that to lose them entirely but i wasnt trying to do that i had to stay near enough to find them again there was a dodgy bit where someone had doubleparked a yolkyellow volkswagen and i thought for a minute i was going to clip it but it was all right the only risk was a oneway street which i had to take in the wrong direction but the single car i met there tucked in so fast to let me through that they must have thought they were going in the wrong direction instead of me the engine was smelling a shade hot by now because the acceleration needs had kept me in second gear all the time but the oracle had been worked quite nicely and i put her into third and slowed down for cruising as soon as we were back in the wernerstrasse they were the third car ahead and i stayed where i was for the moment they seemed to have lost a lot of their excitement but they wouldnt be giving up until theyd combed the area in the hope that id pulled into a good place to play possum they were doing that now one of the cars between us peeled off into the bahnhof and i slowed to let a bus go past there was more traffic about because people were coming away from the restaurants and the early shows and this was a help the bus was a hazard though and when it drew in at the next stop there was nothing to do but overtake and expose the image of the se the opel wasnt ahead any more it was nearly alongside and we were in a group at some lights i didnt turn my head to look at them but i knew they were looking at me they must have spotted me some way back and theyd known id have to overtake the bus before long so theyd slowed under its cover and waited till i had to come past i decided to call the whole thing off for the night they knew what id been trying to do flush and follow they wouldnt let me do it again so i wasnt going to find where their boss was and ring up ferris and tell him all i could do now was to get clear and hole up in a different hotel if i went back to the carlsberg the people at the bureau would have to get out the form and deal with it the one that said nextofkin unknown the lights went green and i found a gap and took it and fouled into the wrong lane and got away with it and started a series of feints through the streets at the back of the bahnhof but this time they were breaking all the rules too and the opel left the mirror only twice before it came back again and sat there weaving about on its springs then i lost them in a full turn at a roundabout and gunned up and found a rightangle and went in fast with the mirror still clear but there was only one lamp in the street and when i nicked the heads on there was just time to hit the brakes it was a culdesac and the finished up slewed sideways within a foot of a notice that said if i parked my wagen there the polizei would be informed immediately i hoped they would hurry by the sound of things the opel was overshooting and braking hard and backing up my lights were out by now but the culdesac grew bright suddenly and i turned my head and saw the passengerside door of the opel swing open as it pulled up they turned off their engine and it was very quiet except for their footsteps chapter four the dump there was a blank wall at the end of the culdesac and theyd left their headlights on to see with so that their shadows were very big on the wall they came side by side they didnt rush they thought i might have a gun on me they came slowly and once or twice halted ready to drop fiat and fire from the ground it looked a bit silly i sat where i was one idea would be to drop the gear into reverse and scatter them and try reaching the main street with the head well down and the fingers crossed it was chancy because you cant dodge about when youre driving a car you can only dodge the car about they know where you are stuck with the controls and they only have to stand there and pump the stuff into you no go the other ideas were worse so i sat there and worked up some anger about what theyd done to lovett anger is a prerequisite for action it turns on the adrenalin i left my hands on the wheel for two reasons i didnt want the indignity of having to put them there by order and i wanted them there anyway so that they were free to do things quickly one of the men had fanteeth which you normally associate with honest people of cheerful disposition but i didnt think this one was very honest and he didnt look cheerful the other one smelt vaguely of almonds they were both about my weight and i left my hands on the wheel while they frisked me and then one of them stood back a bit to keep me covered while his friend looked in the glovepocket and under the seats and the dashboard they spoke with a luneburger accent where is your gun please where is your gun more slow of talking please i do not you speak better german than that he said and his friend laughed everyone has their off days i said the laugh came again and i didnt like it perhaps it was the walls making an echo that distorted it or something but this mans laugh was a kind of wet guttural spasm as if someone was being carefully strangled he was the one who smelt of almonds dont you have a gun no why not the bang frightens me their faces were pale in the headlights they both had hats on to look respectable one of them wasnt happy about it and went diving about in the back of the car and i thought he must be taking the stuffing out of the seats he was the kind who couldnt understand anyone not carrying a gun which meant he depended on his own quite a lot so he was the one id go for if a chance came there isnt a gun anywhere he said it doesnt matter his friend said they both climbed into the back of the car and shut the doors what are you doing in hanover having a look round who are you a badtempered ferret dont mover it was jabbed into my neck i was going to show you my papers were not interested in false papers then ill leave them where they are yes there was a rustling noise would you like some marzipan i angled my head round politely he was holding a packet to me with the silver paper half peeled off not just now thank you dont you like it he was the one who couldnt understand anyone not carrying a gun either not very much its got prussic acid in it its got what bitter almonds not very much of course what you might call a homeopathic dose but somehow the idea puts me off they wanted me alive or they could have done it by now and left the body here it was an excellent place and no one would come up here until the morning they wanted me to tell them things first they couldnt make me do that here because theres no really useful technique available when the subject isnt tethered hurt him too hard and hell get violent and its no good waving a gun at him when he realizes hes got a value youre not going to kill him with it because then he cant talk and he knows that i like it anyway he said he began smelling of almonds again his friend with the fanteeth said were not going to kill you thats good but after weve finished with you i must warn you to leave germany you mustnt think about it any more he did himself in like a lot of people do so why do you have to worry about it do you know how many people in germany commit suicide a lot of people you said they were enjoying themselves and it worried me it meant theyd enjoy finishing with me too and sometimes that kind of situation can get out of hand they go od for the pleasure and then its suddenly too late the sigmoid colon becomes too bruised or the bloodloss increases to the point where the heart starts trying to pump a vacuum yes he said approximately ten thousand every year thats almost one every hour so you mustnt think any more about him start your engine and drive back into the main road they were very cautious not wanting to do it here it was an excellent place but they obviously knew of a better one i said youve left your car in the way i looked round and through the rear window cant you get past i dont think so but ill try no ill go and move it ive got to switch off the lights anyhow he got out and his friend sat very still with the walther p lined up with the bridge of my nose the catch was off and his hand was dead steady hed stopped munching on the marzipan so that he could concentrate his face was plump and the stare had a slight smile in it as if he wanted me to know that for him it was a special thing to kill a man a special pleasure a substitute for orgasm and that he wanted badly to do it and he would in fact do it if i made him and that he hoped i would make him i wondered who his controllers were switch your headlights on he said just as a little while ago the time sequence of the traffic lights had governed that situation unseen people his controllers now governed this one their orders through the media of his memory and his motornerves were operating the fixator muscles of his finger so that it remained still three millimetres from the end of the primary springs travel two millimetres from the end of the secondary springs travel and the percussion i would have liked to know who his controllers were he had respect for them but i couldnt rely on that all i had to do was make too sudden a move and the flexor muscles would contract in nervous sympathy you want to do it i said dont you yes the smile was going out of his stare switch your headlights on i thought id better do that target attraction is a fairly common phenomenon in most physical disciplines and if i let him go on staring at the bridge of my nose long enough he might easily lose his control it happens to military pilots on exercise especially with divebombers they home in on the target with such concentration that sometimes they become hypnotized and cant pull out i wondered if the strikers were always on dummygunning trips when they went straight in but someone would have thought of that already his friend moved the opel and doused the lights and we were sitting in reflected glare from the wall now that my own were on we listened to his footsteps coming back if there had been a chance it was over now the advantage had been that they didnt expect me to try anything while he was busy with the opel they both had faith in the gun even though there was only one of them with me the main disadvantage had been the springs of the drivingseat it would have needed an inflexible base for the body so that sudden movement wouldnt be shockabsorbed giving the equivalent of a pulled punch good the man behind me said i knew hed been watching me in the mirror but i didnt know he was so skilled he understood that however pokerfaced i was the decision to move fast and suddenly would have shown in my eyes a tenthsecond before the muscles were given the order and in that tenthsecond he would have tightened his finger youre jumpy i said you need more sugar i do what i can he said and bit off another piece of marzipan his friend climbed in and said drive carefully i put off the headlights and backed into the main street ernstaugustplatz wheres that go left just here halfway along georgstrasse the one with fanteeth said switch off your headlights i did yes but then you switched them on again that was silly of me yes theyd seen people flashing me id been hoping a patrolcar would decide to pull me up about it and ask to see my papers make for sudstadt now the only other chance before we got there was when we were held up at some lights at the stadtbibliothek a policeman was hanging around the exercise was easy enough clip the wing of the car alongside and cause a jam and bring him across to deal with me but i didnt trust them they were pure german and therefore lawrespecting but they or their group had finished lovett and they might finish me with one in the spine and get out and run clear before a policeman could reach his holster they might even chance a running duel in the street the police sometimes open fire on running men and the papers usually call them gangsters but now and then theyre not gangsters at all theyre men caught in a bad spot somewhere between a highlevel attempt to sabotage a summit meeting and the mechanics of the opposition linedup against the idea men like these turn right in the square we began heading for one of the main industrial sections there were some lights on in the sprengel chocolate factory and the threequarter moon silvered the parapets and sparked on the glass one of them spoke quietly and the wet guttural laugh came again through the gates just here i had to put the heads on there were no lamps anywhere and the shadows flickered across the piled wreckage as we turned they were stacked sixhigh volkswagen mercedes opel taunus patches of rustred and smokeblack smashed glass and twisted axles and burst panelling theyd been craned into orderly blocks with alleys between them stop i put out the lights as if by habit because if there was anything to be done i wanted to start accommodating visually as soon as i could stay where you are they got out and i sat waiting i hadnt been brought here to talk to be made to talk it wasnt a rendezvous with anyone else they must have meant what they said i was to be beaten up and left incapacitated in the flat light of the moon the wreckage looked like blocks of sculpting monuments to the dead and the injured the glass of a headlamp caught the light an everburning flame did they assume i didnt know anything worth talking about worth being made to talk about they were right the mission was in its first stage and all i knew so far was that it was a long drop from the fourth floor of the carlsberg and that there was a girl in hanover with too much pride to drink any vodka the alleys between the blocks of wreckage were quite wide the width of a mobile crane and a running man would have to zigzag like a forest hare it wasnt much better than open ground whereas lovett had known a lot hed even known there was one due to come down in the westheimpfelbergnohlmundt area and theyd had to make him forget the shadow of a hat was across the windscreen a respectable trilby they were standing still and listening to make sure no one would hear anything when they did it the shadow moved sliding across the glass you can get out of the car now a little ball of silver paper flashed away and bounced he had a black rubber cosh in his hand which i was expecting because it is the perfect instrument for paralysing the main joints with very little effort the other one was standing back with the walther p trained on the drivingdoor it was a cold night and wed been travelling with the windows shut and the smell of almonds inside the car was sickly come along now get out apart from the special tactics they show you at the box of squibs in norfolk there are the routine exercises that most people know the handbook is written in basic civilservice and this chapter is headed taking leave of a stationary vehicle while under menace of firearms but the actual idea is sensible and can work if youre very quick so i leaned over and hit the handles of both doors at the same time and jackknifed with my feet against the drivingdoor and kicked so hard that the doors inertia helped to send me backwards and out through the other side before it swung against them explosively and put them off their guard for several fractions of a second some people say you should leave the door shut while you go pitching out of the other one so that it makes a bulletshield and theres a lot of point in that but for one thing they can shoo i through the window and for another thing the norfolk instructions are based on psychological rather than physical factors and the chief of these is the use of surprise theyd expected me to emerge past a slowly opened door and in fact i was moving hard in the opposite direction and the door was bursting open against the hingestop with a lot of noise and up to a point it worked because the first two shots went into the seats and the third rang somewhere among the wreckage in front of me as i hunched over and started the zigzag with my hands hitting out at the stuff on each side of the alley to help the momentum while the fourth hooked at my coat and the fifth smashed some glass near my head he was playing it the best way keeping still and taking steady aim instead of coming after me and firing wild another thing that worried me was that they had a gun each and it was no good counting on the basic limitations of the p its a mm luger with eight shots and so far hed only used five but there was a nearsynchronized double report now as the other one started up they were anxious by this time because i could hear them following but the moonlight was a help to me and a hazard to them i wasnt doing anything that called for precision all theyd done so far was to put one into the flesh upper forearm my left hand was sticky but only through hitting at the wreckage which had a lot of torn metal among it i saw a blob on the ground and scooped it backwards and heard it smash against metal it was a headlamp from one of the wrecks and it hadnt caught anyone in the face but it might have and youve got to try everything because people who get into a mortal situation and dont try everything are selling themselves short and thats what a lot of them die of one was closer to me than the other it would be the one with fanteeth he was thinner he was running faster barbed wire a sweep of headlights somewhere on the other side a lamp as high as the moon they were all i knew and his pelting footsteps behind i span at rightangles along the edge of the dump along the barbed wire trapped in the haretrack of the dump and the wire my shadow flickering beside me thrown by the tall lamp beside me and slightly ahead of me across the sculpted facade of the wrecks then he fired again and the bullet struck and droned on deflected and struck again and rattled among the black metal carcasseswhere i ran an irrelevant consideration was trying to get my attention make me stop and swing round and go at them but it was dangerous and the instincts knew it and went on pushing me forward you dont need norfolk instructions to tell you never run into a gun only one of them now the thin one his friend had stopped he would be waiting somewhere at the other side of the dump to pick me off with a close calculated shot as soon as i came into range it was no good going down there the tall lamp swung as i turned again then the instincts took over completely their reasoning was sound it was a geometrical certainty that if i stayed in the maze of the wrecks i would catch a bullet in the spine or the face sooner or later a second from now or a minute from now the thin one wasnt firing as often as he should be he had become a beater and he was trying to flush me straight into the other ones gun he would do that would be bound to do it as long as i went on running headlights swept the wire again and i saw that it was closerigged four or five strands with sixinch gaps the posts were angleiron cut sharp at the top so i put one hand on the wire itself as near as i could to a post and went over the top with a shoe fouling and the wire dipping till i let go and dropped and tried to run and couldnt my coat was caught by more than one barb and wrenching was no good and somewhere on the edge of the visionfield i noticed the flash as he fired again and came running on but you can get a coat off quickly if a lot depends on it and i was running again running hard my feet on the flat surface of tarmac the headlights were blinding but not too close it was a vacuum horn the kind that big trucks have the tyres began dragging perhaps the thin one followed because he had only two shots left in the magazine or because my coat across the wire made it easy for him but he must have been frightened to take no heed at all the orders were to beat me up to kill me only if i gave trouble there would be nothing in the orders to countenance my getting free so he must have been frightened of them the controllers to do so desperate a thing or it was simple misjudgement i knew there was time and i was clear across the road and lurching among frosted molehills when the big horn boomed again then there was the other sound of something soft being hit and i slowed my run relaxing chapter five the widowmaker it looked ugly on the ground ferris had called it adaptable versatile flexible sophisticated on the ground it looked humped bowlegged sinister obscene sexual down here at linsdorf they called it the widowmaker i had telephoned ferris the sun was directly behind it a flat orange disc two diameters high in the mist it squatted there black why sexual i had to think about it ferris had ordered me down here to linsdorf herr w martin aviation psychologist attached to the ministrys accidents investigation branch walter another name that could be english or german whichever was the more convenient at any given time because the wings drooped they were held spread open and drooped like the wings of a crow in the act of copulation that was why they were running the engine up the kerosene haze darkened the sun dirtied it the pilot was walking across from the crews quarters clumsy in his boots and antig suit his oxygen helmet dangling ferris had ordered me to linsdorf for his own reasons i didnt ask what they were he was my director in the field i told you you should have picked something up in firearms i didnt need anything what happened we finished up playing last across and he cut it too fine you could have avoided a situation like that if youd had a oh for gods sake what do i want to shoot at them for we want to send them to parkis alive dont we so he can watch them do what lazlo did after hed bled them dont we the black haze smothered the suns disc fouling it there wasnt much sound the acoustic irradiation was spreading away from where i stood only halfvisible only halfaudible the plane existed and didnt exist you could believe you imagined it that it was something out of a hangover a black tumour on the sun you dont have to be upset ferris bad said thats good id started out on a routine flushandfollow exercise objective find where they were based or who their contacts were and then signal ferris like a good boy id finished up without an overcoat and out of breath like a bloody fool of course there was no need to be upset he wasnt too jolly himself if id stopped one in the lung all he could have done was signal london and try to wipe up the mess youd better get down to linsdorf i asked him to tell the carhire people to keep their shirt on till the police found an abandoned se that was what he was for that kind of thing the pilot stood watching the plane then suddenly turned round and trotted back to the crews quarters and i thought surely hes not got the wind up already after id talked to ferris i went round to avis and picked up another one for the drive down to linsdorf a goodlooking nsu ro the one with the rotary engine i couldnt resist it because it was an engine id never tried london accounts would put up a bleat the type of motorvehicle selected for routine transport in hanover west germany november appears excessively expensive in view of the fact that no specialuses form was filed in retrospect the halfnoise of the halfthing that stood there against the sun was dying away and i saw the silhouetted head of the flight mechanic prodding out of the cockpit looking for the pilot signal to london accounts reference your observation concerning the hire of i nsu roso in hanover i would respectfully suggest you go and stuff your cucumber up the old kent road then the pilot came trotting across from the crews quarters again calling something to one of the ground staff the flight mechanic climbed down from the plane and the pilot checked his report sheet and nodded and swung up and the mechanic passed him his helmet the sun was clear now and beginning to dazzle of course you can pick up a kph lamborghini and file a specialuses application in retrospect on the grounds that youd had to chase someone in a concorde before it got airborne theyll believe anything all they understand are the mechanics of parsimony the chocks were away and the thing was turning it looked even worse broadside on with the wings flexing to every bump in the ground id only seen them in the air before once through the binoculars over westheim and once at farnborough air show eleven months ago thered been three of them and theyd looked pretty enough with the raf roundels and polishedmetal finish and everyone cheering like mad that was before theyd started dropping out of the sky all over germany the nsu wasnt the only thing i couldnt go back for my stuff at the carlsberg or theyd have made sure of me with a distanceshot so id bought the bare necessities at a supermarket on the edge of am kropcke toothbrush shavinggear so forth but id gone to town on the overcoat it was a sheepskin job and a perfect fit except where the bandage was right upper forearm high collar and full lapels and extra length right down over the bum and beautifully warm it was a pleasure to stand here inside it watching that bloody aeroplane the type of overcoat selected for winter wear in hanover west germany cucumbers he was rolling faster and turning towards the end of the runway with the wings rising and falling and the recognition lamps winking easier to see now because the sun wasnt behind him any more then he was gunning up on tower permission and rolling again with the wings lifting and holding and the power piling on and the wake of dark gas streaming behind and then he was airborne so fast that the legs were folding before he came abreast of where i stood on the perimeter road already craning my neck the sound hit me with a kind of protracted slam and indicated better than anything else that a mass of ten tons was being pulled upwards at fortyfive degrees through an element that wouldnt support a feather he made one circuit and was lost within nine seconds the airbase couldnt have been in his track because there was no sonic boom as i walked round the perimeter to the main buildings the sky was totally silent they were stowing the chocks in the bay why did the pilot run back who are you martin british aib group have you shown your papers to security i couldnt be here if i hadnt you must ask the herrdirektor of operations i went on towards the hangars there was a pilot pumping up his bicycle outside the crews quarters it was a nice takeoff what i was watching his takeoff very neat i didnt know their slang it wouldnt be in any dictionary the correct use of slang is like an accepted accent and can open doors that are shut to printed credentials he laughed briefly undoing the pump and stowing the extension oh they go up all right he was older than a boy and younger than a man notably handsome careful in his movements and speech the strain marking this face would show on all of them it was part of their identity did he forget something who the chap whos just taken off he clipped the pump back and looked at me uncertainly what like im sorry i dont seem to be quite with you the pilot ran back for something i was worried he laughed again were all worried no hed only forgotten his seahorse he often does that the striker was in the circuit again much higher much wider we heard it faintly i suppose he wont fly without it never he was wondering who i was i asked him what do you use yourself women the laugh was the same partnervous partcynical i dont take them up with me but theyre quite a tranquillizer what would they dig out of the mess of alloy and blood and fibreglass and bone in the crater at westheim st christopher a rabbits foot my names martin rohmhild his feet came together are you english yes aviation psychologist another one he corrected himself quickly maybe youre the one weve been waiting for it looked as if a ton of grey lumpsugar had been tipped across the hangar floor in the chance shape of an aeroplane there were only six people working on it the place was enormous a tin cathedral and cold the heaters were on and it was less cold than outside by a few degrees the cost of the heaters would probably have kept the whole squadron airborne for a week the winter sun was up but it was brighter inside the hangar lamps hung in focussed clusters from the gantries their glare emphasizing the silence despite the movement of six men there was a mortuary stillness here you know anything about orchids one of the small doors at the side of the hangar came open and i looked across to see who it was the survivor the one with the wet guttural laugh might be sent down here to look for me id come to hanover to see lovett and lovett had known when the next one would crash so they might think it natural for me to move out to linsdorf and take it from there so i wanted to know who people were when they came towards me not much i said this was philpott leading the aib group id been here for an hour and all he liked talking about was orchids the man who had come into the hangar was carrying a transverse coupling and he dropped it on to the thicktopped butchers bench it set up a pure vibration that echoed from the roof sound as a bell none of the others came near pure vibration wasnt news they were waiting for something that made a sulky clunk when you dropped it im working on a tropical epiphyte called orchis ledulum at the moment grafting you know he was a short hesitantmoving man in a white dustcoat he looked gloomily across the planeshaped litter of metal and saw nothing to interest him there but his reputation was big even at farnborough and i supposed he was like a conductor at rehearsal dozing off until a false note came then he would hit the roof the man who had come in was tying a mauve label to the transverse coupling what did you do to your hand then philpott asked me tinopener ah a man with devon aviation on his dustcoat came over from the engine area the engine was a slugshaped lump encrusted with white ash and there was nothing they could do with it the kinetic energy created by a gasturbine running at full pitch on impact will melt most of its alloys did andy check this mr philpott it was some kind of controltoggle have a look at the list then give it a flametest hell be back tomorrow is the other one like that ive not freed it yet go careful then andys got hopes there i followed him past the nose section it was just a melted lump but he seemed pleased with it titanium they know how to take it on the nose dont they he gave a wintry smile would you expect to turn up manufacturing faults at this stage normally not with the striker they introduced zero defects programming at devon before these things were built he gazed at me pensively these strikers are perfect when you roll them out it wasnt like that a few years ago youd find anything left about inside you could furnish a house with some of the stuff rivets bulldog clips handrags a whole tablecloth once you know what we found inside a flexible tank a couple of years ago threelegged stool milk a cow on it went down off the azores with a crew of seven zero defects is going to put a stop to all that american idea rollsroyce brought it into britain why i just wanted to know design faults are different we can turn anything up he looked broodingly across the sea of fragments by the time weve rebuilt this lot we can tell you how many kids the chief riveters got and whether theyre boys or girls of course its getting more difficult for us these days look at that turbine now what can you do with that the higher they go up the harder they come down you imagine the noise this one made when it hit like a bomb i can imagine the testflame coughed into life across at the butchers bench we can turn up anything anything have you given much thought to sabotage quite a bit he was looking away from me watching the colour of the flame when the component was passed through it youve got to flags frontiers its like a circus when the flame went out i said this isnt exactly in your department but if the pilot loses control and hasnt switched to automatic what attitude does the striker assume nosedown at four or five degrees we went across to the bench its negative mr philpott tell andy the man took a green label from the box then we could say could we that if they didnt want to leave any evidence theyd go for the engine who there was a drip on his nose and he blew it squinting at me above his handkerchief oh i see yes thats what theyd probably go for hed been drinking but he wasnt drunk psychologize me a quick forced laugh im off duty i said they held each other both halfturned towards me still moving to the music the whole of her body was in her eyes as she looked at me and i knew she would look at anyone like that any man martin he said wasnt it thats right he said to her herr martin he spoke to me without looking away from her this is my wife frau rohmhild nitri she said the flash of her mouth took away some of the animal brought back some of the child walter franz franz nitri and walter as if we had made some eternal pact we will see you again yes she said and looked back over her bare shoulder as i knew she always did at anyone they drifted away shes charming yes his name was eagner and he had a doctorate in psychology we had met earlier and he was back in the corner again where i was holed up to watch people especially the pilots even for a peacetime officers mess it was lush and the band had been brought in from hanover it was invitation night and the room was crowded pilots and their wives and girls admin officers and attached civilian staff the aib group and the devon aviation team id seen even philpott here brooding solitarily at the bar over his tropical epiphytes i looked at the door every time it opened if they came at all they would come before morning the moment their controllers knew where i was theyd send them in very fast so that i couldnt do them any more damage i was more than ready for them because i hadnt cooled down much a bandaged hand and a bandaged arm were all id got to show for last nights work and i badly wanted to signal ferris with something good something he could use as a change from mucking it up and at the back of my mind i was trying to tell myself it wasnt true that parkis had put it across me so smoothly that you could have spread it on toast because that was what he had done id been through the situation twice and it stood up someone had told lovett where and when the next striker sk was going to crash lovett had signalled london parkis had wanted it confirmed and hed wanted it confirmed by the man in the field who was going to be given the mission so hed sent me in from munich to observe and report i was already hooked when id gone to see him he knew i was interested in aeroplanes and he knew if he could bring one down on my head id be more interested still but he was thorough this one wasnt for me they were giving it to waring there wasnt time to change the director in the field if i didnt want to work with him id have worked with pontius pilate and the seven dwarfs and hed known that i was a shadow executive and hed made me sit up and beg for a sabotage investigation job and now i was doing it i would have refused hed known that too id tried to refuse the berlin thing and after that bangkok and he wasnt going to let me refuse this one the sole consolation was selfcancelling parkis wanted me on the striker pitch because it might break me into something bigger before i was through and the odds against that were the same as the odds against any of his blind swipes twelve to one there was one chance one of breaking into something bigger somewhere along the line i could turn up the missing link as well as id like to he waved to someone going past i see the link the man who had told lovett its because my duties are rotational i cover a dozen bases on a strict schedule and that doesnt give me too much time to meet with them i mean as individuals the man who had told lovett could be in moscow or east berlin or hanover or here in this room tonight but most probably he was dead because hed been the primary leak and lovett was only a contact and lovett had gone through a glass roof and woken everyone up you seem very popular i said but there was a chance i fill a need they need a father figure he was speaking in english with an american accent most people in the federal republic who speak english do it with an american accent and sometimes you forget theyre german and not american in appearance he could have been anything austrian swiss scandinavian he had light eyes and a strong nose and a habit of lifting his head when he looked at people as if he were fixing a sight on them especially people in middle distance he wasnt much taller than philpott but he was more energetic jerking his hands as he talked swinging his head suddenly to note my reaction he was doing that now i said thats not surprising but what can i do i send them for mud baths and psychoanalysis up at garmischpartenkirchen i talk to them before they take off and after they land i give them sedatives and tranquillizsrs quite often its a sugarpill and statistically theyre almost thirty per cent as effective and that satisfies me because the speed of the nervous impulse is in the region of three hundred kilometres an hour and i dont like to slow it down even by a fraction his long thin hands were jerking again you have to find a working balance between calming their minds and slowing their reactions do you understand me it is becoming very difficult here at linsdorf because there hasnt been an accident for quite some while and theyre waiting for it everyone is affected ground staff administration their own families yesterday a request was sent out to the wives of all pilots asking them to refrain from telephoning for news whenever the squadron has just landed everyone is affected and i have my own private name for it striker psychosis they had changed partners franz and nitri is it better or worse at the other bases it is as you would expect i have drawn graphs of the pattern when i arrive at my next base i can tell at once if there has been an accident and how many days ago it took place after two days the shock is absorbed and the anxiety dissipates quite automatically the worst has happened do you understand me and everyone feels better here at linsdorf it is different now look at them they are so gay but that is forced it is frenetic the floor was small and they came past often they didnt look across at each other it was as if theyd changed partners for life i watched franz rohmhild because i would need one of them one pilot for study and it might as well be him he is not a difficult one which one rohmhild the one you are watching his outlet is in shall i say human company his wifes others that is very good but some are difficult they come to me with spurious complaints headaches vision chestpains of course i send them to the herr doktor reitermann he is a physician and i am not but they dont keep the appointment they come to me in the hope that i shall suspend them from flying duties and finally that is what i do because their stress has reached its threshold and if i let them go up they will only bale out and report an engine failure that has happened it will happen again i would be delighted what do we lose one plane six million dollars who cares the pilot is safe but i am not delighted because he is no better he is worse he now has guilt feelings added to his anxiety he knows he is a sham and a coward then he is finished we do not let him fly again his head had swung towards me and he was sighting along his nose i think that comes in your own field herr martin one of them was getting drunk it was the one whod run back for his seahorse he was doing aerobatics with his hands and there were people round him laughing loudly my job is to save money for my government i said doc nitri wants to dance with you franz was going past with a new girl i couldnt tell if he wanted to break it up between nitri and her partner it just looked like a pleasantry i am a responsible married man i cannot dance with girls like nitri you realize that it was noisier in here now and there was a lot of laughter and you could hear the undertone the fear of tomorrow i think you are attached to the engineers said wagner with polite interest but i cannot see how a psychologist can help them how is that when a pilot sends in a false report to the wreckage analysis team they can spend months looking in the wrong places my job is to question the pilot and find out if hes lying especially if hes reported engine trouble i kept my voice low so that hed get bored with missing the odd word or two and let it go but he was listening hard engine trouble why its the only bit of the plane we cant examine its just a lump of burntout alloys and the pilots know that yes i understand he was still watching me and i had a choice i was on thin ice and i could either keep as clear as possible of wagner or try to work with him if i could work with him id learn more but he had a doctorate and there was the risk of blowing my cover i chose the risk because it could pay off if i used great care thats where you could help me you know these boys better than i do his head swung away i would be delighted you say you are trying to save your governments money is that modesty or cynisicm what you are really trying to do is to discover the cause of the accidents and to prevent them that will save many lives it is my own ambition he was facing me again and saying forcefully herr martin i am averse to the waste of men like these they are the youth and the future of germany i shall willingly sit in with you at a pilots examination and shall invite you to attend my own cooperation can only the one at the bar the one who was drunk had finished some aerobatics with his hand and now his hand drove downwards vertically and the stiffened fingers hit the teak surface of the bar and sent a glass crashing the only sound after that was his laughter and when it stopped there was a hush in the room people turned away from him a murmur came from wagner he should not have done that lets hope he never will halfway into hanover along the autobahn the rain came and i switched on the wipers either with her or someone else he has a wide choice is that the phrase a wide choice she was curled up on the seat with her shoes off not very animal now nearly all child and hurt it doesnt mean anything to him i said only at the time its the time i think of she stretched and pushed her fingers through her hair but i have my times i think of those too its wild isnt it grotesque her speech wasnt slurred she might have been cold sober it was hard to tell a lot of them had drunk steadily the whole evening more than they normally did more than they would be drinking now at some of the other bases spalt oldenburg where the anxiety was dissipating automatically after the accident i said to make her talk its rough on everyone its not like i suppose a war is like when everyones in it theyre on a sort of list a waitinglist only just the few of them sometimes i think of him as already dead and theres only the waiting for it to be official thats when i forgive him most have you a cigarette i checked the glovepocket to see if there were a packet left behind it doesnt matter i dont want to smoke its cosy in here what car is this the reflection of her hair was a cloud of silver on the windscreen and sometimes her nails flashed through it as she brushed it back its an nsu i dont drive i lost my licence i didnt even hurt anyone only myself but they took it away its grotesque we listened to the rain and the wipers for a long time the lights of hanover made a sudden haze on the horizon to the north and then vanished as we dropped again below hills he wants to have as many as he can while theres time all right we cant live together any more but im his wife and were in love i think but how much of what i feel is because i might not know him for long i checked the mirror regularly and slowed a little when lights came they all went by he seems very confident i said thats an important safety factor hes enormously brave fantastic record almost as good as ottos hes come out of three crashes i mean ordinary ones not the special ones what ferris called pattern crashes were any of them due to pilot error she swung her head and made a laughing sound though it wasnt quite laughter you dont know franz he can bring in a plane backwards she was still watching me he says youre a psychologist it must be like undressing people its much more difficult youve got to get through a dozen overcoats before you can reach anyones mind he says youre english im wild about the english you dont talk its just that you cant hear because of the overcoats theres the city she said where are you staying at linsdorf but i thought you were going to hanover she shifted sideways on the seat to face me her legs still drawn up one arm along the top of the facia she was no closer to me than before and her scent was no different but suddenly she made herself explicit her proximity her scent her body you came specially i said anyone would have given you a lift a lot of the cars id slowed for had been coming from the airbase after the party broke up i know but i didnt think you were coming specially what would you have done if youd known nothing we drove through hanovermesse and up hildesheimerstrasse let me know will you im in listerplatz she looked for her shoes will you come infer a drink i dont think so did you want to ask me about franz and the others to get information no then well have a drink the apartment was small and overheated and untidy with her clothes around and nothing to show whether it was from indifference or despair she sat curled up on the floor just as she had been in the car in the attitude of a child the blatant carnality she had shown in the crowded room was quite gone because the necessity had gone but her reasons remained and she spoke with her head turned away its late and i dont want to have to go out again if it cant be you itll only have to be someone else chapter six nitri he looked dead there was no traffic about it was late gone am i had left the nsu in the hohenzollernstrasse and wed walked round the corner into listerplatz i had walked back along to the car and there was condensation inside the windows otherwise i would have seen him from farther away he was only just recognizable through the condensation some thin strawcoloured hair on a lolling head blackframed glasses on a waxy face the eyes shut i looked along the street both ways both sides in the doorways in the shadows it could be a boobytrap you can never tell they hadnt got on to me since the truck had hit the thin one but they were looking for me i knew that the street seemed all right i wasnt expecting a shot it would be a rush of feet they were controlled by someone circumspect even when they did a bump there was a suicide note to smooth things over i knew now why theyd taken me to the car dump they knew that if i gave trouble theyd have to shoot and they didnt want to do any shooting in the culdesac with a lot of buildings around i walked once round the car none of the doors had been forced it looked all right so i got in and he woke up i must have dozed off dont let me disturb you i was a bit annoyed not with him but with her shed thrown a few hysterics when i told her it wasnt on and hysterics can be wearing he was completely awake within seconds ive been in signals with london a j day it goes roughly like this parkis didnt know a thing except that another striker was going to crash but he thought something much bigger was in the background hes got a flair that way thats why he wanted you for the mission but there was nothing he could give you except what looked like a oneandninepenny sabotageinvestigation pitch so he had to hook you in i began wiping some of the condensation off the glass because if anyone came by i wanted to see who they were london got a letter today from lovett posted two days ago with a microdot inside he turned to look at me for the first time they badly want to know who told lovett about that striker they think its someone trying hard to get across he made contact with lovett who played it cool and asked for a sight of his wares they werent bad were they the exact prediction of the next patterncrash so lovett was ready to pass him on but his signal about the striker got intercepted that was bad luck he was silent for a bit and i didnt ask any questions even in an organization that doesnt exist and where everyone is anonymous there are some people whose names begin to mean something over the years wed all liked lovett and i knew ferris had worked close to him until theyd carved him up in rome we still want to know why the strikers are going down its not the stormcentre but its the way in or one of the ways in and we want to know fully urgent who made contact with lovett he must have actually been on one of the protected communications networks persontoperson with parkis stormcentre was a typical parkis phrase straight out of the comics i said what makes you think hes still alive theyd neutralized lovett just because hed seen a fraction of the picture his contact must be in possession of the whole we think hes still in hanover and the bureaus monitoring the news of every death in the area so far they believe hes not among them find him as soon as you can help him across london wants him badly oh come on ferris you can do better than that i was suddenly fed up parkis didnt run all the missions but he was running this one and he was running it in his usual way sparking off random activity in the field without a sign of coordination they want me to find out why the strikers are going down so my searchareas linsdorf and they want me to find lovetts contact so my searchareas hanover tell parkis to make up his bloody mind nobody loves parkis do they he was running his long fingers across the faciaboard transferring his reactions he spoke mildly for maximum effect but youll have to bear with him this time because hes on to a rather big show and you are in it if you let your dislike of parkis affect your judgement youll come unstuck and i dont want that to happen because im in it too and im responsible for you so brighten up a little and we can do some good business together he ran his fingers round the chronometer and then took his hand away your judgements a degree cloudy at the moment our contact tipped off lovett about a striker crash and the nearest striker base from hanover is linsdorf so he might be there someone on the admin staff or on the technical side even one of the engineers and your enquiries have brought you back to hanover tonight correct so you can commute between the two parkis doesnt realize that but i do and im not going to tell him hes got his wires crossed just because youre in a tantrum wouldnt she let you or something this was why ferris was such a good director he knew how to set you up when you were slipping you really are a bastard i said thats right he resettled his glasses another thing is parkis wants to send in a shield i didnt say anything right away because i was feeling better now and in any case this was confirmation that the mission was expanding they only send someone to look after you when things hot up and you become valuable to them a shield is a bodyguard close or remote and his job is to stop people messing you about people like the man with the marzipan to keep you alive and leave you in peace while youre working some of us accept the idea because it can be useful when miller burst open the warsaw thing last year it was almost wholly due to the shield who kept him alive while he was busy penetrating no go i said thats what i told him i work best alone you know that thats what i told him hed been enjoying himself telling parkis the answers before id been given the questions all i havent told him he said carefully is whether youve dug up any leadin data at linsdorf ive beendown there for twelve hours remember thats all right i just asked because he will hows the hand top condition and what else was it the arm wasnt it i still dont want a shield fair enough but youll have to be careful independence is one thing but as your director im not standing for any flights of bravado is there anything else before i go i asked him for a statistics breakdown on the complete series of patterncrashes to date chronological geographical and with background information on the dead pilots he said he could do it for me can i drop you off ill walk its a fine night i watched him away while the engine was warming he had a loping stride and his thin hair blew around his head as he passed below the last lamp before the corner the hanoverkassel autobahn runs almost due northsouth and i could see the few lamps of hildesheim to the right the rain had stopped and the threequarter moon sent a trickle of light along the chrome edge of the screen after hildesheim i pushed the nsu to its optimum cruisingspeed on the autoconverter close on kph full pelt was but there was no need for that the mirror was clear except when i overtook a nightrunning truck it had come oddly from someone like ferris youll have to be careful yesterday morning hed told me to get in their way without hesitation and now he was talking in terms of a shield hed known i wouldnt agree but if id changed my mind an hour ago he would have signalled london by now and theyd have flown one in the thought was luxurious once they decide youve got a value theyll do your buttons for you if you cant be bothered give you that kph lamborghini without a special uses chit i missed her nyloned legs curled up in the glow from the facia her scent was still in the car id stopped being annoyed with her because the stuff ferris had given me was important and i was interested in it it had been nothing more than frustration in any case because thered been arousal and i hadnt bargained for that when i told her itwasnt on she slipped out of her dress stretched stooped and was naked before i had time to say that i meant it she was pleased watching my expression standing there with a little halfproud smile im different arent i anders was the word the lamp had a rose shade and she moved so that its light could play on her then i looked up at her eyes and she was sure of me and came towards me so i turned away and that was when the hysterics began i let them come i couldnt leave her until id heard enough to know she wouldnt do anything dumb as soon as she was alone they were all living on their nerves the wives of linsdorf and if there were any dangerous instability in her a small shock to the ego like this could push her over the edge between sobs she said the expected she hated me i was impotent so forth throwing herself face down across the bed where the lamplight fell so that it was necessary to look somewhere else because for a lot of reasons it wasnt on and it was no good the libidos trying to struggle then of course she was suddenly asking is it because im different and i went over and played with the hair at the nape of her neck because she was serious now and needed comfort youre not that different nitri her hair was like warm cream through my fingers the english dont talk remember and there are other things they dont do when they dont want to however much they want to you only want to hurt yourself and id make it worse itd be a kind of rape wouldnt it when she was quiet and i moved away and she watched me open the door she said you dont understand ill tell him we did thats all you want for him to think so the hara peaks on the left moonlight along their snows hed stayed in the mirror for more than five kilometres now so i came down to and he still didnt pass and i began thinking things but he pulled out after a while and i kept my speed down until he became a shrinking blob of light far ahead of me some nightdrivers like company through the long dark autobahns and he was just one of them the lamps of nordheim poor little bitch not long out of school and into marriage with a man who used variety for a tranquillizer because his nerve was going and now she was only at peace when his plane took off because it was the one place where he couldnt take a woman the one place where she didnt want him to be alone with the widowmaker but i would have to see her again there was more that she could tell me ferris had asked if id dug up any leadin data at linsdorf well yes but not entirely at linsdorf it linked with something shed said in the car on the drive north and she knew them better than anyone the pilots those who knew that she was anders there were a few lights in the motel and i swung the nsu into the park and had a thought and turned out again without stopping driving on for three kilometres and then taking the minor road past the airbase it ran within a hundred yards of the hangars and they were on to me right away red lights mobile barriers the full treatment halt one on each side with submachineguns hire papiere bitte their breath clouded in the lamplight von wo kommen sie hannover wo wollen ste htn nach linsdorfins motel was machen sie aufdieser strasse ich muss wohl aufder verkehrten strasse sein lassen sie den wagen hier und begleiten sie uns i got out and they took up escort positions the post was on the far side of the hangars and the guard commander kept me fifteen minutes and used the telephone twice before he was satisfied sie konnengeben das nachste malbleiben sie aufdem rtchtigen weg jawohl then they walked me all the way back and i still wouldnt fall into step and it got on their nerves when i backed up and turned in the narrow road the headlights swung across the hangars and the statuary of armed figures i had needed to know if anyone were getting at the strikers it was from the inside you can use a book face down or a penknife on edge but i prefer keys and i always carry three on a ring and leave them in a top drawer because theyll go for the top one first and if someone interrupts they dont have time to open the lower ones i never vary the pattern the rim of no just touching the e of yale and the rim of no superimposed on the bordermoulding of no theyre no use to anyone except to me the only things theyll open are a chewy in mexico a flat in putney and a jemmied strongbox somewhere at the bottom of the nile a book isnt so certain they might not take it out and if they do they wont necessarily put it back face up the snag with a penknife is that it wont necessarily fall over and if it does theyll smell a rat if theyre any good at all but theyre certain to pick up keys any keys theyll try them on anything in the room and if they have the time and the equipment theyll make a wax impression my room at the motel was like most others you couldnt move the bed out of sight of the windows in this case there was a balcony the wardrobe was built in but i wouldnt have moved it to shield the bed anyway because they dont search your room and shoot afterwards it isnt consistent it was soon after five oclock when i turned in two cars left the park in the few minutes before i slept their lights fanning across the ceiling the motel was on a route used a lot by commercial travellers it might have been a couple of commercial travellers driving away last waking thought so theyd got on to me but there must have been a policyswitch and for the moment the orders were to leave me alive chapter seven collapse it happened at precisely hours i checked my watch from habit she is beautiful the manager nodded most of them had gone much earlier i had slept until someone had called out across the park below my room the human voice probes deeper into the sleeplevels than other sounds in the normal range i drank coffee at the bar she stood on the lid of the black padded box the traveller turned her to catch the light the work was delicate the mouth earwhorls fingers original the manager said of course copies are a waste of time a good copy can be valuable these days but people wont offer you a decent price just because its a copy the paper was upside down from where i sat there was still hope for the seventeen miners maria fedrovna said she had not asked for asylum but that both she and her choreographer were considering such a step the manager lifted the shepherdess to look at the markings on the base his big hands gentle because he knew that if he dropped her the price would be double dresden herr benedikt of course feldmarschall stockener was killed late last night on the outskirts of hamburg he was alone in the car things are different there now the bombing made a difference my wife is there my family he turned to me do you know dresden there was hope in his soft hooded eyes its some time since i was there the wall and its extensions had gone up in everything has changed now except my wife my family he took the shepherdess and fitted her into the case among the others i watched his face in the mirror behind the bar he wasnt wearing a hat it was on the table behind us with his gloves and this weeks stern he had been wearing a hat before crossing from the lift in the carlsberg with the other people three nights ago when the american had said his wife was sensitive about things like that i wasnt certain hats can make a critical difference i would need to see him walk people can turn their faces inside out but they never think to alter their walk his face was sad perhaps about dresden or lovett how much is that one the manager asked do you want to buy it no i just want to know how much a thing like that costs it would depend i take them to a man in kassel not a dealer a private collector he doesnt buy all of them ill be coming back this way if youre still interested im not i just wanted to know i would make a price for you of course you talk to a lot of people here that would help my business the sound was dull heavy and distant i looked at my watch benedikt hadnt heard or didnt think it meant anything perhaps he thought it was another sonic boom they were a part of life in linsdorf the manager had heard and was looking at the windows he had lived here long enough to tell the difference i went outside and he followed me and we stood looking at the sky and listening you cant hear a sonic boom without hearing the plane afterwards the sky was silent what was it he asked me i dont know i got the nsu and drove straight there when i reached the main gates there was some traffic coming through three or four official luftwaffe cars and an ambulance and crashparty tender they knew thered be nothing for the ambulance to do but it had to be sent out for the look of the thing people were at the windows of the admin buildings and groups stood outside just talking quietly there was nothing to see but theyd come out because this was where the noise had been outside and it was the noise they were talking about it had been like this in the streets of westheim when id gone into the post office the aib team was standing in a group in front of the wreckageanalysis hangar and i talked to philpott the rest kicked at pebbles their arms folded some of them looking at the sky one of them said theyre gaining on us weve not put this one together yet did your friend find you philpott asked yes ferris would have telephoned the aib chief and philpott had probably passed him on to the barman at the officers mess good barmen knew everything and this one had seen me leaving with nitri and he knew her address she was an officers wife ferris had gone there to hang about and when hed seen me go into her flat with her hed decided to wait the most comfortable place was the nsu and any director can open a car without any keys its in the norfolk instructions or it was one of several permutations ferris would have found me wherever id been it was part of his job i wondered if the noise had registered as far as hanover it was north of here and quite distant there was nothing he could tell me to do about it that i wasnt here doing some of the pilots were standing outside the crews quarters and i walked slowly into the pocket of atmosphere that dr wagner had mentioned i would have known thered been a striker down even if i hadnt heard it go in it was the kind of atmosphere you can almost feel on your skin franz rohmhild was there with artur boldt and some others boldt was the geschwaderkommodore and id talked to him last night a lean slowmoving rhinelander with no philosophy in his eyes most of the pilots accepted the situation the striker was a rogue aircraft and their orders were to fly it and as far as they were concerned it was a game of russian roulette id heard that phrase more than once at linsdorf but their geschwaderkommodore had to lead them into the air and hope to bring them all back again and it affected his nerves differently his natural fear was turned directly into anger against the top brass of the luftwaffe who wouldnt ground the striker until someone had found out what was bringing it down they werent talking much they stood looking at the sky because it was where they lived and where one of them had just died a young oberleutnant was trying to laugh it off were all right for another hundred days whos complaining the patterncrash average was one in ten days and there were ten main striker bases operational it was the russian roulette attitude again an sk straddled one of the dispersal bays not far off in full daylight it looked as ugly as it had looked at dawn yesterday i asked rohmhild who it was paul dissen you mat him last night the one with the seahorse the one whod been doing aerobatics with his hands at the bar dr wagner came up and the atmosphere changed in a subtle way that i only just caught under the surface it seemed he was their god not quite redeemer no shepherd saviour i had the impression that if wagner were actually to fly with them on exercise they would believe they were totally safe it should be the last one he addressed boldt perhaps because he was their geschwaderkommodore id wondered what exact line hed take he hadnt come across to the flyingcrew quarters to pass the time of day their nerves showed in ther eyes and their bands and their silence and his job was to do what he could about it this isnt a technical problem you understand the answer is available and the authorities may be obstinate but they are not blind his head was lifting and he looked at the others sighting along his strong jutting nose the generals blame the defence ministry and the ministry has its face to save because it was responsible for ordering an aircraft that has proved itself dangerous but there are pressures even at political level the americans inside nato are urging bonn to abandon the strikers nuclear role and of course someone must eventually realize the absolute sense in that each time theres an accident these pressures are increased dramatically that much is obvious do you understand his light eyes surveyed them he needed their reaction so that he could turn his argument and lead their attention into whatever channel would console them so this could be the last one to happen before these planes are grounded there has to be a last one and it will be soon boldt said quietly its not the plane he was looking across at the brutish shape on the tarmac its the pilot franz gave one of his short bittenoff laughs and the sound of it the coldness in it didnt help the others he watched boldt with his eyes flickering boldt said im not talking about pilot efficiency his anger had been sparked off you know that franz you know it perfectly well i mean pilot condition wagner was watching them both he said to boldt you have a theory i know youve mentioned it to me several a telephone was ringing somewhere i happened to be looking at franz and his shock was physical the others turned their heads and turned away again i knew that wagner would have tried making boldt open up about his theories in case they were dangerous to morale boldt was their leader and his opinions counted but no one would be able to speak until someone inside the crew quarters answered that telephone even little wagner couldnt do anything the silence was total of the kind in which background noises made no difference a trafficcontrol vehicle was droning round the perimeter road but they didnt hear it vision was the only sense with any significance and so they looked at the ground the sky the humped shape of the widowmaker the telephone had stopped ringing and after a minute a door was jerked open and someone called to us paul dissen was sitting in a corner of the readingroom like a trapped animal he watched us as we cams in dr wagner had given me the picture on our way here the mo wanted him hospitalized at first but theres nothing wrong with him physically except for slight traumatic lesions in the face and corneae i believe he would brood too much in a hospital bed because he is overburdened with guiltfeelings and nursing attention sympathy of any sort would of course aggravate them it is better he should be free to roam where he likes for today and talk to anyone who will listen his psychological need is to be hurt a little and we should bear that in mind during the interrogation of course you know all this herr martin but i am just pointing out that his experience seen in the light of his personal background provides a typical case which makes it easier for us and for him dissen got up as we reached him and wagner motioned him down his eyes were bloodshot and some of the cheekarea capillaries had burst leaving red patches like those on a painted dolls face according to his report he had baled out at forty thousand feet which would have exposed him to something like two hundred knots in freefall before the chute slowed him to thirty through the upper layers we drew up a couple of chairs and wagner said cheerfully youve hadan expensive day paul my good friend six million dollars never mind were delighted to see you back i suppose you decided to panic did you well youre not the first one had to get used to oppositethinking dissen was a man in need but it wasnt the need for comfort i remembered the faces of the pilots outside the crew quarters this morning when the door was jerked open news of paul hes all right he baled out there had been no spontaneous relief one or two of them had looked deceived the hundred days grace had been denied them and it could happen tomorrow a real one a patterncrash no herr doktor i didnt panic he said it very deliberately wagner had triggered the reaction he was after dissen must be reminded that he had access to selfdefence you know herr martin dont you yes hes interested in what happened wagner had invited me to run the interrogation with himself sitting in dissen said to me she began breaking up thats all it was said with hostility do you know much about planes by breakingup do you mean structurally structural failure that was what it sounded like vibration fluttering not quite id call it resonance nothing visual no resonance has that happened before with the striker no not with your plane i mean have you heard about it happening sometimes so when it happened in your own plane did you remember having heard about it i didnt have time i was too busy checking the display it wasnt exactly a lie he would have automatically checked his display as soon as the sound had come in he would certainly have remembered hearing about resonance but fear would have driven the memory straight into his subconscious so that he could rationalize shes breaking up and im getting out was the display in order the booster looked a bit unsteady he glanced with his suffused eyes from me to wagner and back you dont necessarily see anything wrong with the instruments when the whole planes breaking up surely you know that three pointers looked a bit didnt mean was and his glance to wagner had been an appeal and his defence had turned to attack was i such a damned fool as not to know that i didnt like doing this but i had to because wagner was here and i could blow my cover if i dodged it that could go a long way wagner had official influence and would get ms thrown out of linsdorf and it was part of the mission to stay here and ferret out all i could i tried him on limited channel capacity have you ever felt overloaded in the striker failure to assimilate sometimes we all feel it sometimes that would be true the input signals and output demands of a sophisticated aircraft put a strain on the pilot and they were working on the problem everywhere we talked about environmental stress and he said he was happily married and didnt give a damn about money he spoke faster as we went on because he wasnt being made to talk about the plane he hated the plane because it had exposed his weakness wagner cut in to say dissens wife was quite charming quite charming and that she would be so relieved to have more of his company from now on wagner had told me on our way here hes finished of course as a pilot i tried him on isolation stress when the resonance began did you get any sudden feeling of loneliness did you feel cut off lost in the sky out of touch with help i had my radio i reported what was happening his tone was hostile again we were talking about the plane wagner took over for ten minutes keeping his approach cheerful his hands moving energetically as he blamed the striker all the strikers going along with dissen in his hate of them then i harked back to the technical aspect because it was meant to be my job and wagner knew it you must have been certain that the resonance would turn to actual vibration fluttering or juddering before long why i mean if it was loud enough to start you thinking of baling out it must have sounded progressive critical you dont know what it was like he was standing up suddenly his red eyes looking at neither of us his hands jumping to his pockets and jumping out again to make defensive gestures all right i panicked you expect me to stay in a plane thats breaking up under me wagner pushed his chair back no thats why we give you an ejection seat you are expected to use it and you did i walked back with wagner to his office he will be okay now he had switched to american again but i dont know about your resonance all i can do is pass it on otherwise it was satisfactory we induced him to admit he panicked so now its going to be easier for him we had one of them shoot themselves do you understand up at bederkesa the son of an upright prussian family he did what they expected of him of course but paul wont do that we didnt save the machine but we can save the man i ask for no more they should all do that he supervised our table personally perhaps hoping to bring down the price of the shepherdess you wouldnt have any luftwaffe left i told him who wants the luftwaffe theres no war he spread his big hands let them take all the strikers up nice and high and come down by parachute then they wouldnt get killed any more the noise this morning had upset him benedikt had been here when i came in from the airbase soon after dark and i asked him to eat with me because i wanted to know why hed searched my room he sat with his hands folded on the edge of the table his soft hooded eyes sometimes looking at the other people neither of us faced the door from the parking area but we could both see it without turning round too far he had dropped the kasselerzeitung on to an empty chair it was the evening edition they are toppling he said in high places it had been decided that feldmarschall stockener must have got into a skid because there had been rain his name was lower down the page taking secondbest to hermann von eckern minister of the interior last night relieved of his post following an incident in a hamburg nightclub details of which were not yet revealed i wondered whether these two items were anything to do with the rather big show that ferris had talked about or whether stockener had just skidded and von eckern had just taken a boy into the cloakroom but benedikt seemed to think they were connected so i said theyll be pushing them out of windows next i ordered liver and carrots because they both have something like four thousand international units of vitamina and i like seeing as much as possible in the dark that poor fellow he said what was his name i dont remember he couldnt know i wasnt certain it would be risky for him not to admit at once that hed been at the carlsberg a lot of guests were upset i left the same night myself i thought if hed arranged to have lovett pushed out of that window i would do something about it very soon we dont often have a reason for doing a bump its usually just because the pressures on i said dont you think he skidded stockener a man and a woman came in and we looked round idly i question why the chief of the bundeswehr should be travelling alone in his car surely he would have a military driver he was eating very little he wasnt a man for an appetite sadfaced withdrawn cautious or perhaps he wasnt always like that perhaps it was his nerves he might have told them hes down here at linsdorf and tonight would be a good opportunity because he wouldnt do it himself he hadnt the build and it would have to be done quietly without too much fuss which meant at least two operators what about von eckern i said it might be his nerves not letting him eat because of the waiting i also question why a bundesmtnlster should allow himself to become party to an incident of the kind that could lead to his dismissal doesnt seem very discreet is everything to your satisfaction the manager was back adjusting things on the table entirely benedikt said watching some people come in the night was cold they had pinched faces and rubbed their hands did you sell all of them in kassel no i have some in my room are you still interested no i just wondered he went away i supposed there was a chance that it didnt connect just as there was a chance that stockener had simply got into a skid but it would have to be tested out so i said they dont fit anything really im sorry the keys i just leave them there so as to know if anyones been poking about what were you looking for the pale lids rose and for the first time i saw his eyes fully and saw that he was frightened i hadnt expected that and it threw me and then i understood he said in a moment we must be careful hed folded his hands again on the edge of the table to keep them still you werent very careful before you got him killed yes his voice broke on that one word he could have said indirectly it would have been true lovett had known what he was doing and he should have taken more care but it was this man who had put him in hazard now he was doing it again to someone else to me i said wed better not waste any time there is no time his face was grey and he looked tired suddenly and i knew that collapse was taking place inside benedikt a whole edifice was coming down all the things that had gone to the making of him as a child and a boy and a man all the experience of half a lifetime that had brought him at last to a motel in a weserbergland village to sit here with a stranger all that had ever meant anything to him was coming down and soon it would be rubble i didnt know why i only knew that it was happening because in our trade we see a lot of it and we know the signs when they come into a mans face they see quite suddenly that its no go theyve come too far and cant find their way back or theyve taken too much on and havent the strength to see it through or theyve started hurting too many people and they realize that their highflying ideologies dont give them immunity to conscience when it comes to the crunch in a savage whisper he was saying get out of here perhaps he hoped to save something of himself by saving me i asked him whos doing it sending the strikers down theres no time you must leave here he wouldnt even bloody well listen i leaned over the table who is doing it i was getting fed up because while he was busy collapsing i wanted to snatch the odd brick out of the rubble before it was too late did you tell him lovett he was slowly shaking his head but i didnt think it was meant as an answer he was shaking his head at the whole of life or at least the life he knew well youre going to tell me whats their name die zelle wheres their base no answer whos the top kick he stared at me you have to get away im busy he hadnt got the guts to give it to me straight couldnt admit it face the responsibility once they start collapsing the whole lot goes and theyre irresponsible treacherous and the most you can do is try to shore them up and get some last desperate sense out of them before its lost in the roaring of bricks i said through my teeth who runs it his face rocked and his eyes closed as if id physically hooked one on him and i knew how important it was that he should save my skin but i wasnt interested because it was his conscience he was trying to save and so far as it suited my book he could stew in it a man came in with a briefcase and benedikt heard the door and opened his eyes and stared at me again because he darent look round he was using my face for a mirror he was pretty far gone so i said whatve you got on paper memos documents anything useful any micro stuff we can decode it dont worry about that come on benedikt the manager was at the far end of the foodbar staring at him and then staring at me benedikt looked ill and he was wondering why i wasnt doing anything about it he started towards us and then thought better of it benedikt was still watching my face who just came in one man only one of course i would have got him away before now and handed him over to ferris but id made a mistake and i didnt want to do it again id been so aware that they would come for me again that id fallen for an assumption anyone searching my room must be an adverse party it wasnt until id seen the collapse setting in that id known who he was that had been a mistake the next mistake i could make would be another assumption that he was totally allied to me youve got to mind your fingers when you give a dog a bone look i said well accept you you can be in london by tomorrow but ive got to have something more definite first die zelle the cell he could have invented it offhand he wasnt listening the restaurant was halffull now and getting noisy there were no curtains the headlights of cars coming in made a kaleidoscope of the opaque sculpted glass of the windows the espresso machine shrilled i looked at benedikt he sat like a sack you can still make it i told him i had to lean half across the table because of the noise but i could see id lost him now its something almost unnatural to witness they just slip away as if they were drugged and you could time the process suddenly between one minute and the next they abandon interest in doing what they were recently desperate to do final throw well go now we might as well we can talk later some kind of consciousness came back he said if it were as easy as that headlights froze across the glass and dimmed away itll get easier as we go along i told him this is the roughest bit thats all then they came in and i knew he was right and that it was too late chapter eight the pallbearers is he all right what did you say it was very noisy he looked ill is he all right yes but bad news the beer was making them raucous a lot of laughter what sort headlights his wife teh he talks always about his wife leaving not arriving but no one had come through here are they lawyers who the people who came to see him friends just a couple of friends benedikt had got up and gone across to talk to them and they had stood there for a few minutes and there was no point in sitting somewhere else with my back to them because they knew i was here now they had gone up the stairs thats bad then if its his wife yes he talks a lot about her i know the staircase came halfway into the room and was very modern with glass at the sides the same thick opaque glass that the windows were made of hed made an effort before getting up and some of his colour had come back he had just given me the name r of a place the clockmakers in neueburg and then hed gone across to talk to them i hadnt expected them to go up the staircase all three of them like that i picked up the kasselerzeitung hed dropped on to the chair and looked through it because they were making it so obvious all i had to do was walk out and get into the car and drive away the manager had gone back to the foodbar lyon had beaten hamburg the farther away i got from them the less id like it i preferred to keep in close because they wouldnt expect that i waited another fifteen minutes and then went across to the staircase a group of travellers stood at the bottom with tankards waving about as they talked theyd had a good day and were pleased with it and wanted me to join them but i said i couldnt just now the corridor was all right there were no recesses but his room was towards the far end and that was unnerving it meant full exposure in confined quarters for something in the region of fifteen seconds and there was sweat inside my hands when i reached the door the light was on in the room but there were no voices i gave it a minute and tried the handle and pushed the door open and gave it another minute before i went in a gust of laughter came up the staircase and i shut the door so that i could think better the curtains were drawn and i left them like that there was almost no point in looking around because i couldnt see any signs of hurry and unless theyd been in a hurry they would have done a thorough search but you never know your luck and i saw to the furniture first it didnt take long most of it was built in and i wasnt checking for hollows or magnets because he didnt live here permanently there was only one valise and most of the stuff was dispersed in the room and i checked the shavercase and squeezed all the toothpaste into the washbasin the black box he kept the figurines in gave nothing it had come open for some reason and the only two pieces that had been inside a faun and a shepherdess were smashed on the floor near one of his outstretched hands it looked as if hed been taking them out of the box when they did it there were hollow sections among the bits and i checked them the head of the shepherdess and one half of the log she was sitting on the hind quarters of the faun but they were empty finally i searched the body pockets linings heels inside the watch inside the lighter and the three pens going through the full routine while the hooded eyes went on looking at the fragments as i stood up i wondered whether he might not have been happier more fulfilled really selling these things between hanover and kassel instead of trying to slip the skids under people who travelled in violence i believed even at that stage that benedikt had never been firstclass agent material ideology isnt enough it seems enough its blinding and belongs to the heart but it wont save you from being found one fine day on the floor with a cheesewire mark on the throat it had occurred to me to telephone ferris the night wasnt much above freezing and i was glad of the sheepskin coat my breath was grey in the sharp air as i stood looking about everything seemed all right if in point of fact it were not all right i wouldnt get more than a few yards it was fairly bright in the parking area and when i walked across to the nsu i would present a slowly moving target with good forelighting and a clear outline against the motel windows the more deserted a place appears the more it is peopled by the nerves and this could be discounted further the headlights had been those of a car leaving not arriving and the two men had not gone out through the restaurant the inference was that they had used a sidedoor perhaps the one i had used and finally if they had wanted to deal with me they wouldnt both have gone up with benedikt so i walked across to the nsu and discounted another possibility as i went there could be a third man waiting outside for me that was just nerves again stomachthink brainthink benedikt had run it too close they had come here to deal with him not with me he may have realized that when we had sat talking at the table being not only a potential defector but a double he had broken down in cases like his there is a defeat mechanism the psychic system suddenly cant take any more because its overloaded coming across to the other side presents a hazard comparable to jumping a chasm it may be only a short jump but when youre in the middle of it you feel the onset of doubts you distrust all the arguments that have driven you to the act and you cant turn back this had been in benedikts face the outward physical sign of psychic collapse the nsu seemed all right there would have been time for them to rig it blow me up when i touched it but that wasnt logical even so i held my overnight case in front of me when i opened the door as a gesture of mans need to survive i hadnt checked out at the desk they would find enough for the bill on the dressing table it would make no difference to the motel manager the fact of my not checking out conventionally he would still have reported it as unusual if i had gone through the correct motions because id given no prior indication of leaving tonight either way i would be suspect number one as soon as the police were told about herr benedikt apart from my sudden departure there were prints all over the room that tallied with those in my own but the german police were thorough and would busy themselves also with suspects two and three the one real problem was the nsu its hanover matriculation was duly noted in the reception book but i couldnt telephone ferris from the motel the best idea was to use one of the emergency phones along the autobahn then i could peel off eastwards and head for neueburg where benedikt said there was the clockmaker lights swung across from the road just as i started the engine and it was unsettling for an instant because it didnt have to be a rocking detonator they could have connected it with the ignition any kind of disturbance sudden moving light can be unsettling when youre not certain its just the ignition youre switching on when youre ready to believe you can be switching on kingdom come but i didnt like it you shouldnt have to justify being unsettled if you think theres a bomb linked with the ignition key then dont touch the bloody thing some people got out of the car that had swung off the road and i watched them cross to the motel then i moved off heeling her over a bit on the springs to displace anything if it were there and have it done with but everything was all right so i went on worrying because everything shouldnt be when you get in their way they dont just leave you alone between the motel and the filling station on the autobahn looproad there was too much traffic to make observation worth while the mirror was never clear of lights and i didnt do anything about it because it was only a twolane strip and nobody would have wanted to overtake even if id invited them with so much stuff coming the other way i wasnt sure how i was going to put it to ferris over a telephone there was a lot i still didnt know about the benedikt situation and all i could give him were the facts without throwing in any assumptions then he would have to tell london and theyd have an immediate baby ferris had said london wanted him badly the contact the man whod told lovett when the next striker was going down and now they couldnt have him they would say i should have got him for them kept him alive and sent him through and they would be absolutely right i might even have done that if the material had held up but the simple fact was that it hadnt benedikt had been dead before they took him upstairs and he would have been no use to the bureau even if they hadnt put the cheesewire on him its happened before with people like benedikt they collapse internally and go on running like a headless chicken until someone switches them off or they do it for themselves as lazlo did parkis wouldnt have got any sense out of lazlo even if he hadnt swallowed the thing and hit the floor and parkis had known it that was why he was so annoyed it was an esso station there was enough on board for the run to neueburg but i might have to go on from there and places in deeper country would be closed anyway it was for ferris to tell them one of his functions was to keep london off my back vierzig his hands were raw in the cold the stars were very clear and the moon was above the harz mountains its outline sharp even on the eastern curve the pump droned a boy ran out from the building and sprayed the screen and began wiping it did it go well with the rotary engine they both asked the same thing at the same time and laughed i said it went well there werent many ros on the road yet and people were interested the screen began shining twenty litres had gone in by the time the mercedes pulled in behind it could have come up on the other side of the pumps but apparently it didnt need petrol the boy went to see to him if it rained later tonight the man said the road would freeze i said i didnt think it would rain the moon was too clear the driver of the mercedes had got out i couldnt see his face because the overhead floods threw shadow from his hatbrim he wanted his screen cleaned he told the boy sound carried easily on the cold air was that all he wanted that was all stop at twentyfive i said didnt you ask for forty litres yes but stop at twentyfive we worked a lot of instinct sometimes its all we have the pump stopped droning there was a second man in the mercedes he was just a vague shape behind the screen at the moment because the boy had sprayed it and hadnt wiped it yet the engine was still running how about the oil i said he could check it instinct was wholly in charge now but confirmation was available it would take longer for the man to check the oil than for the boy to finish the screen of the mercedes and once it was finished they would tip him and drive away but i didnt think they would do that the oil was all right the man said i gave him a note and he went into the building for the change they dont carry a cashbag at night as they do in the daytime the boy was thanking the driver of the mercedes and going towards the building the mercedes was black an uncommon colour these days rather oldfashioned funereal the man wore a black overcoat he was getting into the car not hurrying what i really wanted to do was to go a short distance along the autobahn and use an emergency phone to tell ferris what had happened so that he could pass it on to london it was only reasonable theyd knocked another hole in the fabric first lovett and now benedikt and london would expect a report on that however brief then i wanted to peel off and take a minor road southeast and then make east for neueburg now things had changed and i could do a uturn and go back the way id come but they would certainly cling on and wait for an opportunity and then use it the dark winding road would give them an advantage in any case it wasnt what i really wanted to do they hadnt got on to me by luck they must have driven out of the parking area and waited by the side of the road in case i were going to scarper if id stayed at the motel they would probably have arranged it that the end came for me peacefully in my sleep though it seemed less likely there were several pointers to a single supposition their orders were to make it look like an accident otherwise they could have dropped me with one careful shot as i crossed from the motel to the car the man came out of the building vierzigfunfzigsechzig i put the change away theyd gone in quickly for lovett it had been an emergency a leak had been exposed the best they could do was to fancy it up as a suicide theyd worked as fast with benedikt the moment theyd seen the light he had been the leak itself but with me they could take their time and make it look like an accident benedikt might have told me the lot or nothing they werent to know but whatever i now possessed they were going to arrange that it would shortly amount to no more than a pattern of memorytraces fading on the surface of a dead cortex i looked once towards the mercedes its shape was a black glitter under the glare of the floods and behind the screen their faces were white in contrast with their dark overcoats the car was very clean and they were dressed with the correctness of pallbearers they sat without moving upright on the seats and with the patience of those who await a ritual i looked the other way along the perspective of the autobahn a tapering ribbon of frostgrey under the moon they would have more speed than i and they were heavier but i got in and started up because this was the only road to where i had to go chapter nine autobahn ferris im somewhere along the autobahn he wouldnt say anything i made contact but it was no go why not they broke the shepherdess but i suppose london ought to know ought to be told let me have the facts well they went in quick for him and shes one thousand two hundred and ten kilos dryweight lighter than the not critically but its no use comforting yourself they did it with some wire where are they now i dont know you can work the whole thing out to a formula and thats what i did i dont mean when they went in for him i mean when they came for me and heavy it was the heaviness that i didnt like give me some more are you listening ferris i subscribe to coue maltz and the frenchman who said si tu veux tu peux they all make the same point but coue put it quite well in any contest between the imagination and the will the imagination always wins weve tested this out in training sessions using alcohol electric shock techniques artificially induced fatigue states and varying degrees of autohypnosis an example would be if the ships been sunk under you and its a tenmile swim to the shore youll stand more chance of getting there by using imagination instead of willpower you can grit your teeth and will yourself to do it but the command is conscious and your subconscious is on board for the trip and it can be a lead weight if its left to its own little games once it starts brooding about the black silent fiftyfathom void below your body the willpower is going to lose a lot of steam but if you bring in the subconscious to work for you it means the imagination will be programmed in and in the place of a lead weight youve got yourself a propeller feed it the keyimage shore and youre there already prone as a log and coughing up water but safe and alive maltz confirms that the nervous system cant tell the difference between a real and an imagined experience if this werent true they could never produce a burnmark on the back of the leg with an icecube by convincing the subject that its a redhot poker and they do it every day at st georges as a change from making tea the trick isnt foolproof because so many other factors are in play your personality patterns state of mind so forth it only works with some people some of the time it didnt work with me when i took the nsu away from the esso station my shore was a telephone call to ferris somewhere along the autobahn because if i ever made that call it would mean id ditched the bastards first the one factor against my using the scheme was the situationitself youve got time to spare in a steady crawlstroke but with the ro pitching it up through the gears and the arithmetic to work out it didnt give the imagination a onetrack focus imagination was needed to help size up the mechanics of the thing and that was why technical considerations kept merging in my mind with the telephone call to ferris i let it go the nervous system was going to have to do it the hard way instead of just homing in on a ferrissensitive target by preconditioned reflex it was going to have to do what it was bloody well told to do i could feel actually feel in my stomach and on my hands and the back of my neck what the imagination was doing or that part of it that i didnt need for mechanics it was being frightened and in an odd way i was less afraid of the chance of imminent death or hideous injury than of abstract things blackness heaviness the surrealistic identities of the people behind me in the night i was being hunted not by two men in a motorcar but by the darkcoming hounds of hell perhaps it was because they had looked so inhuman sitting there correctly on their seats faceless in funeral clothes nameless but for a numberplate to put it more finely this was not quite fear it was dread they should have picked him up sat him against the wall or something not left him sprawled out staring at the bits of broken china it had been indecent their headlights came on suddenly in the mirror and i knew what was happening because id worked out the formula the formula for survival the basic data for the nsu ro included weight and speed figures kilograms with a dry tank kilometres per hour the gears were automatic and the front wheels did the driving the timelag was about the same with the automatic as with a manual shift and so it didnt make any difference the superior traction of frontwheel drive wasnt likely to affect things even on the fast curves north of the mountains because there would have to be a curve that had to be driven round if the nsus cornering advantages were to be brought into play the mercedes weighed kilos and the top speed was kph gear control was optional and i didnt know which this one had the rear wheels did the driving first findings all factors being equal the mercedes could overhaul me by kph and give ms a kilo nudge into the treetrunks when it was ready unknown data the precise weight of the two men and the amount of fuel they had on board there was nothing to be done about this give a man eighty kilos with shoes and overcoat they had an extra assume their tank was close on full it took them past but it would need a sliderule to decide the balance how much their extra weight was going to cost them in acceleration and maximum speed how much it was going to help them nudge me off the road id done what i could at the esso station telling the man to shut off at twentyfive litres that amount would get me to hanover if necessary and left the nsu lighter workable findings assume the best figures both men were heavy and their tank was full and it would cost them kph in maximum speed add kph in one hour there would be a kilometres distance between us and with that kind of margin i could peel off at whatever looproad i liked braunschweig hildesheim hanover itself and they wouldnt see me go assume the worst figures both men were average weight and they had a quarter tankful and they had the edge on me in terms of maximum speed the extra weight of one man would bring down the speed fractionally but not the full kph conclusion the mercedes had to be faster than the nsu by kph if they were going to stay with me and send me into the trees i believed on the figures alone that it was kph faster and that they could do that there was only the one area in which i could hope to work hope to avoid a mathematical certainty the nsu had a rotary engine and was lighter by kilos and that gave me the edge on them in acceleration i was already establishing a lead that was why theyd just put their headlights on they were worried their idea would be to stay with me almost bumpertobumper with their lights out so that i couldnt see enough in the mirror to judge how close they were couldnt see which side they were creeping up on to shape for the final nudge the nsus superior acceleration and the mercedes higher top speed would vary the distance between us as we went north it would be like a chriscraft towing a waterskier on a long piece of elastic the nsu would draw ahead and then the tension would be taken up and the mercedes would close the gap until it hit the only outside factor that could come into play was the presence of other cars making north but we were both going to take it right up to the ceiling and there wasnt likely to be anyone driving in the region at night the lights were good on the nsu and the visionfield was flat wide and clear of reflectorfault the speed was moving through when i took a look and the dipped lamps of the mercedes were rising slowly to the top of the mirror as the gap widened then they switched to full beam and caught me across the eyes and i tilted the glass and drew into the middle area to wait for reaccommodation the autobahn ran dead straight in this section and the moons glow defined it as far as the horizon there was nothing to do yet except let the engine take her up to the maximum and hold her there the one trick i could hope to pull off must be kept for emergencies and there werent any emergencies for the moment the first thing to do was test out the figures id been working on if they were both heavy men and their tank was nearly full then i was going to consolidate the lead i already had on them and peel off as soon as i was out of sight then i would put a call through to ferris while the engine cooled down half a minute later the nsu reached her maximum the pointer just went up to the kph mark and stayed there with this engine there were no valves so there was no indication of bounce it was purely a matter of starvation the combustionchambers were being swept at the speed above which the mixture didnt have time to go in the steering was still dead positive and when i moved the wheel a degree she came back correctly without any yawing i couldnt test for brakefade because i wanted to know if the could close the gap the cockpit was full of light but i couldnt tell if it were getting brighter the reference was too vague the dread had passed perhaps it had been automatically set up by the organism in its own defence the situation was dangerous and could be mortal but the necessity of working out the mechanics hadnt allowed the onset of normal fear and a situation becomes more dangerous if there is no fear present to alert the nerves and prepare the body blood should be drawn to the internal organs draining from the digestive and secretory glands and skin by contraction of the arterioles so that the heart brain and muscles can be fed breathing should quicken so that the muscles can be given an oxygen reserve the eyes should dilate admitting more light the human body is no fool but these days its a little oldfashioned the defence mechanism set up to dodge the swing of a dinosaurs tail is less effective when life or death depends on the position of a needle on speedometer but i may well have been by some small degree better prepared for action now that the fit of dread was over it had been the most the organism could do within the next kilometre the first results came inthe light was stronger inside the cockpit and when i tilted the mirror the backglare was painful they were closing the gap it wasnt going to be so easy ringing ferris we passed a truck and i felt the slight airbuffeting as the slipstreams merged and just for an instant i took my foot off but it was already too late i couldnt slow hard enough to take up a position in front of the truck and use it as a shield the mercedes would slot into the gap and the truck itself would become part of the pattern and i didnt want that because they wouldnt have any scruples even a twentyton twelvewheeler could be sent off the road if the driver was baulked and i didnt know how hard the mercedes was going to try when it came to the infighting they had to make it look like an accident and an overturned truck wouldnt detract from appearances the inside of the nsu went dark theyd been overhauling me progressively at or kph and when id taken my foot off for an instant it had closed the gap and brought them right up and theyd cut their lights the mirror showed a vague dark shape with the glint of chrome in the moonlight above the windrush i could hear their engine the needle was steady on and i drew to the crown so that i would have room to manoeuvre when they started there was the temptation to hit the brakes and make contact just to surprise them but at this speed it could be immediately lethal we were covering a hundred yards in two seconds and if the huge weight of the mercedes didnt make a direct strike on the foreaft axis of the nsu it would send it offcentre and no amount of steering would bring it back perhaps they were expecting me to do something like that they didnt mind how it happened whether it was the result of action on their part or retaliation on mine providing i jumped the crashbarrier in a series of barrelrolls and finished up ablaze in the trees down there it wouldnt matter to them how it was done it looked very wide in the mirror very black a dark wave surging behind me i was waiting for the nudge and i had to guess which side theyd go for so long as it wasnt dead central it would work well enough the smallest impact to one side would send me out of control sweat began again but this was normal i was in a trap and couldnt get out couldnt go faster or slower or steer my way clear a curve came and the crashbarrier uprights sent a flickering echo against the windows and then they made their first strike and the shock went through the bodyshell into my seat and as soon as the line was corrected i felt for the safetybelt and clipped it home andset the drivingdoor to locked far ahead in the moonlight a blob showed on the ashwhite strip of the road and i hit the horns and kept them blaring because he was too near the crown and i couldnt slow the next strike or the one after that would throw the whole thing wild and i didnt want to take anyone with me it was an opel rekord and he pulled over to let me through and then flicked his lights in protest they made a feeble semaphore in the mirror with the reflection glancing off the mass of black cellulose behind me then they tried again and the sweat broke out because the nsu was into a series of oblique lunges before i could correct the headlamp beams swept the road with the slow regularity of windscreenwipers and a shrill came from the tyres as traction tried to damp out centrifugal force something pattered on the body and hit the left side of the screen with the sound of sudden hail the nearside front wheel was running off the edge of the concrete and fragments of gravel were shooting up clear of the wing curving and falling into the slipstream most of the control was reestablished but i still needed the whole width of the road before i could get the steering back to straightpath conditions and even when id managed it thered be no useful future because theyd only line up another strike as soon as i was steady so i pulled the only trick in the bag the one id saved for emergencies the odds were one in three along this stretch the road was three cars wide the strip in the middle of the two lanes was rough grass with floodwater gullies each side at the moment i was doing the expected trying to kill out the oblique lunges and bring her straight again the dark shape was still in the mirror but less distinct possibly they were holding back in case one of my tyres burst under the strain of the yawing action they wanted me off the road they didnt want me to start breaking up in front of them their great weight moving at great speed could ram an obstacle effectively but if the nsu were wheelsup or sliding on its side the decelerationfigures could force them against the screen if i had been running straight i could have deliberately set up this swinging action but that would be unexpected and they would have been warned there wouldnt be another chance like this with the nsu swinging expectedly from one side to the other unless they made a new strike and again failed with it i didnt want to rely on that because they were getting their hand in now and the coup de grace wouldnt be long in coming the whole operation depended on the mirror and on timing it was more difficult to do than i had thought the little animal brain inside the back of my skull was snivelling about the risk it would have liked the odds to be better than one in three through the rhythmic series of swings the mirror went dark light dark light as the nsu crossed and recrossed the bows of the mercedes and during the third or fourth light period i hit the brakes and felt the pull on the safetyharness as the speed came down and the tyres set up a long howling and i watched the mirror although there was no point in watching it because if it ever went dark again thered be nothing else to do but it was all right the had been so close that it ripped metal off the side of the nsu as its black shape came sliding past but the swing was already under control when the brakes had begun dragging and there was no more than a slight rolling on the springs there was also one guaranteed factor in play despite larger discs and tyres the mercedes didnt have the stoppingpower of the nsu because of the difference in mass and this was so cheerful to think about that i threw in an added risk and cut the lights and hoped that the nearblackout would worry them more than it worried me the balance of life or death could depend in the final analysis on liver and carrots the howling noise went on and i freed the discs a couple of times to break down the friction as the needle swung through the nineties and below their lights came on and i saw the big silhouette still drawing away although it was under the brakes by now and slowing rubbersmoke began curling past my windscreen in little clouds and then i stopped thinking about the and concentrated on what had to be done next the sidelamps had been left burning so that the facia was lit and i could read the speed because after five kilometres at kph my normal visual judgement would be affected and true speed through the lower register would seem slower than it was and i didnt want to roll her when i turned there was a strong smell of rubber and asbestos by now but the braking effect had damped out the last of the swings and we were on a perfectly straight course a metre from the grass centre strip and when the needle dipped below kph i released the brakes and made a threequarterlock turn across the soft ground and into the faint light flooding from a car that was coming south on this track i was already accelerating through the sixties and tucked well in but the driver had been worried to see me broadside on across the road even in the distance and he went by fast with a lot of noise from the horn because in any case it was strictly verboten to drive across the centre strip like that by the time the nsu was over the ton and still climbing i began trying to assess the chances but the basic data was so vague that i gave it up it would mean havingto work out how long it would take the mercedes to slow up and how long it would take it to make the turn and close the gap again behind me on the northsouth track there had never been any question of foxing them they would have got the rough idea the moment i braked and the man who wasnt driving would have hung himself over the seat to see what i was doing it was a question of using the only two advantages the nsu had over the mercedes on a straight run acceleration and braking and hoping to find some sort of peeloff point on this side before they closed up again i gave them something like three minutes there wasnt anywhere to turn off within that period and the obvious thing to go for was the loopsection where id taken on fuel they would be big in the mirror before i could reach it but they might not succeed in knocking me off in tune the idea had only one advantage there werent any alternatives the nsu would be faster along winding roads but there would be other traffic and there was the risk of smashing up an innocent family because the big was in business now and no one was safe the only hope was to stay on the autobahn and use the elbowroom light began filling the nsu they had been quick there wouldnt be another chance of pulling the same trick again if i let them come right up on me so if there were anything to do it had to be done now and i thought of something and did it and the tyres shrilled again as the brakes came on at full grip i judged the gap to be still big enough to make the operation worth trying the speed was down to kph when i turned on to the grass centre strip and felt the rear end break away and corrected it and brought her back in the opposite direction with my undipped heads catching the mercedes full across the screen i could see them clearly their hands going up to shield their eyes the big car veering a degree in the glare and the brakes hissing on then it came at me i was ready for it but the grass was soft and i was late getting away because of the wheelspin and the glancing blow slung the nsu full circle and for a while i was just sitting there looking along the headlight beams watching them start an initial slide along the centre strip that carried them sideways for fifty metres with turf ploughing up in a wave over the roof before the momentum died and their wheels began spinning again for grip i was back on the concrete before they were but the gap was only medium and they were closing as hard as they could and i knew that somewhere inside the correct black overcoats and stiff white collars the semblance of an emotion had been provoked anger from my limited information i assumed that their controllers had given orders that i should be killed and that my death should appear accidental but they were finding it more difficult than it had seemed and now they were angry because their pride i i was hurt they were no longer implementing an arrangement they were conducting a duel they wanted to kill me now it hadnt mattered to them before this could make a difference emotion at very high speed could lead to misjudgement but it was my sole consolation the light was already a glare inside the car before the last of the mud was centrifuged from the tyres and we settled down on the toplimit mark with the windrush blotting out most of the engine sound then they cut their lamps so that i couldnt see which side they were going for the mirror was only a frame for vague movement now dark and shifting and inconsistent a bump came and i corrected the line but it wasnt too bad because theyd hit too close to the centre then they had another go and the impact was well to one side and very heavy and i did what i could but this time the strain dragged a tyre off and i watched the headlamp beam go spilling across the edge of the road and flooding down into woodland the nsu was airborne for a few seconds floating strangely among light and shadows then it struck rubble and began pitching and i saw the trees coming and turned the engine off before the night went wild chapter ten fugue the moon gleamed set in shadows shapes but not of trees or smashed metal i expected shapes of trees the moon was glassbright translucid shimmering sometimes going dark and emerging again among the shadows wait a minute the whole of the organism was prepared to arrange its survival if it could run fight beat out flames bind blood in with a tourniquet free itself from wreckage the components were immediately available nerve sinew gasinterchange process adrenalin supply intelligence alone was absent the organism had to be told what to do and nothing knew the moon alive with light held a globe of colour in its centre blue and in the centre of blue was another globe totally black the shapes were fainter touches of light on cloud the cloud silver curling hanging near the moon a line dividing its softness a feather lying curved above the moon who are you the moon darkened again and shone again and watched me it was an eye watching me bitter there was pain in the organism but not enough to limit movement i was on one elbow looking across at her face recognizing it but not recalling it knowing i had seen it before but not knowing where or when information came flooding in so fast that the receptor areas couldnt cope with it but i saw now that there was light coming from behind her from the street and that something reflected it so that her eye shone then there was an implosion of random images and within a millisecond the whole scene was formed and took on significance she was sitting hunched in a chair near the bed where i lay and tears had dried on her face who are you i said it in german this time she told me her name but paramnesia is odd recognition is present but recall cant just be switched on like that the name meant nothing when she said it a young face with amethyst eyes swollen from crying a bewildered mouth all her attention was on me there were no trees or shattered glass no flames to beat out sweat began trickling from my temples and i stopped making an effort suddenly aware that the effort i had been making was enormous and very desperate because i was scared sick of seeing the lot go the whole lot the only hope was in taking the pressure off letting the neural traces show up under the hypo in their own good time i didnt use english any more the one word she had spoken had been in german is there any kind of head injury my hands were moving about the fingers hunting for blood quite a lot of the organism was coping well enough doing its best to look after itself she said something but i wasnt interested there was so much data coming in that i wanted to sort it out before anything new was presented a window and the unlit lamp and of course her face and various colours and the tear stains oh yes i said and sat still for a bit traces were showing up i had seen tears on her face before when shed said she hated me and that i was impotent so thats who you are memory returning cant present every detail because there are too many putting your clothes on you dont observe the pattern of the tweed or the style of the shoes you simply know that these are your clothes its not a matter of striker shepherdess wagner cheesewire benedikt ignition switch plus several million other images and their significance its a matter of finding yourself back in a place composed of all the things you have ever known identity wait a minute i was sitting on the edge of her bed head in my hands it would need a minute to settle in if you dont take it easy the whole thing can go blank again nitri she said again frightened yes i know yes her scent it had been inside the car the nsu there was still an area of darkness and i was aware of it but it would have to be left alone some kind of inhibitory block repression of unpleasant events what time is it nitri four night yes but you when did i get here in the night hours ago this night come on some hours ago you said you were coming blank it didnt fit anywhere she had sounded frightened perhaps id spoken too loudly that was because i was frustrated there might be a need for hurry and i couldnt dont worry i told her i sat blanking my mind for as long as a minute and it worked and i got a completely lucid sequence the telephone cold in my hand the sweep of light as a car went by the smell of the exhaustgas im coming to see you pain across the shoulders and chest what happened a loose feeling in one shoe ill be there in an hour a car slowing or seemingly slowing so that i dropped back into the shelter of the woodland i was phoning from the autobahn i just wanted to know if youd be alone im always alone she meant always without franz her body was milky under the nightgown and the light from the street shadowed her eyes she asked me why i had come i couldnt tell her they might already have found him on the floor and the number of the nsu was in the receptionbook and there was an nsu with that number lying smashed in the trees near the autobahn so i couldnt have gone back to the motel or checked in at any hotel in linsdorf or hanover or anywhere at all looking like this there was no safehouse because i was working with prescribed cover walter martin attached to accidents investigation branch temporary overseas location weserbergland federal republic germany the aib was an official organization in the pursuit of lawful business in cooperation with a foreign government and if anything irregular happened to walter martin the aib must be protected from any consequences the bureau would want to take care of this situation before it could get out of hand so i had to tell ferris as soon as i could the trouble was that id blown my own cover and couldnt go near the linsdorf base or the aib unit or ferris himself id had to find a bolthole and go to ground and this was the only place but i couldnt tell her that i needed you i said people dont need me she meant franz didnt i had an accident she let herself laugh suddenly did you the special uses sheepskin coat was ripped and one shoe was loose split right across i didnt know what my face looked like but the wound in my hand had been opened up and they were both caked with earth another clear sequence began and i sat with it as if i watched a film the trees coming up in a wave at great speed as the car lurched into a slow roll still airborne and then hit rubble and plunged with the headlights turning the scene into an abstract kaleidoscope pattern of black and white the trees winterbare and resembling a gigantic stack of driftwood bursting and hurled against the windscreen the percussion of wood on metal and glass and the white hail as the screen went the scene revolving slowly at first until it was upside down and then jerking as the saplings bent under the onslaught and sent the car sideways and straight and sideways againand pitching lower into the undergrowth while the momentum was broken against stripped white bark and i kept my knees jackknifed and my feet on the crashcushion the reek of fuel from a torn pipe and sometimes the glow of the moon spinning through black branches and always the bite of the straps holding my body back while my heads own weight dragged at the neck and tried to break it everything suddenly still dont worry i said again i was scared i know you didnt recognize me i mean i do now she slid off the chair and knelt in front of me and i made to touch her face to reassure her but my hand was scabbed with dried blood and she was clean and young and fragile in the aureole of the streets light and i took my hand away do you need a doctor no why were you crying i was thinking about paul and i suppose i went to sleep it was late when you phoned paul dissen you know it was his plane today he yes he got mixed up in my dream half himself and half franz it was grotesque dead of course she got up and looked helpless for a moment floating in the light from the window aimless hes always dead when i dream about him ill fetch some water i decided to recognize the fact that retrograde amnesia was blocking off part of the past i didnt want to telephone ferris until i could give him the whole thing i remembered most of the postcrash sequence leaving the nsu and finding an emergency phone and later going down through the trees again and reaching the secondary road and stopping a truck waving a handful of deutschmarks in the glare of his lights but i didnt know why i had crashed the nsu because the retrograde kick covers a period of anything up to fifteen minutes prior to concussion and the last thing i could remember was a man at an esso station saying if it rained later tonight the roads would freeze i said i didnt think it would rain because the moon was too clear it happens with a lot of people drivers airline pilots and theres nothing they can do about it when theres an enquiry they just dont remember what happened it is why stirling moss couldnt explain what made him crash the memory traces need time to consolidate and store experience and if the head gets a blow its like tapping a bowl of sand just after someone has drawn figures on it with a stick it smooths over she was bathing my hands i could have done it for myself in the bathroom but shed got it all set up with towels on the carpet and hot water in the bowl and i didnt stop her because playing dolls would help her to deal with the fright and bewilderment shed been dreaming about paulfranz being dead and then id come through the doorway and fallen flat on my face with delayed shock and it must have been hard for her to take i never see him in a plane or in a wreck or anything youd think i would yes she had a whole plastic bag of cotton wool and tore bits off it the wrong way tugging at it and not getting anywhere i see the funeral men in black with pale faces i cant recognize its always a civilian funeral i suppose because thats the only kind ive ever seen my mothers with big black cars and flowers and all the time im thinking about the plane its made another widow and this time its me there had been a boy washing the windscreen of the nsu hed asked about the engine if it ran well the edge of the blank area was somewhere there at the esso station youll mess yourself up nitri the water was redbrown in the bowl she nodded and went to change it i got up and followed her because this needed an entire bathroom and anyway i wanted to see if anything had happened to my face but there must have been some kind of memory trace in the subconscious the moment the nsu had come to rest with the front lodged at an angle between two trees id snatched at the buckle and thrown the straps clear kicking at the drivers door and finding it was jammed solid dragging myself through the white fragmented windscreen and slitting a shoe on the frame there was a branch in the way and my coat was catching but i forced myself through the gap with my scalp shrinking and gooseflesh everywhere there was some kind of fear driving me on pushing me through a gap that would have been impossibly small if the fear hadnt given me the strength not quite fear a kind of dread ill make you a tourniquet from something the water span red in the basin full consciousness hadnt come back until id felt the telephone cold in my hand the concussion would have left me trapped inside the wreck i t was the dread that had taken over i had known that unless i could get away from the wreck something would come for me there even when id finished talking to her on the emergency phone there was no letup a car was slowing along the autobahn and i dropped down the earth bank and clawed my way through bramble and gone on across a knoll of trees at one time headlights had swung through the higher branches as if a car were being turned and the frost glittered on the dead leaves underfoot then there was the truck much later on the minor road and my hand full of deutschmarks waving the data was limited enough but it would have to do she was watching me in the mirror my face wasnt too bad now that id rinsed off the earth id obviously fallen somewhere or gone down the bank from the autobahn face first theres a doctor in this block she was impatient annoyed at r her own sense of helplessness theres nothing i can do for you i said i need a phone codeintro for the mission was sapphire needle and we cleared on it and didnt bother with anything else because it was foolproof if one of us were under duress wed slip in the alarmphrase and take it from there the only danger was from bugging but he was very good on security and no one could have known id show up here ive blown my cover all right there was sleep still in his voice but hed said it straight away and i knew thered been no need for any kind of codeintro because only ferris would say all right without hesitation when you phoned him three hours before dawn to tell him a thing like that it wasnt the work involved that would upset him all i wanted were some new papers and something to drive in but the background inference you dont blow your own cover unless youve got into a very dodgy position how soon can you fix me up it depends where youre going nowhere special she had gone into the bedroom and shut the door but she could listen through it if she wanted to and i thought she probably would because the normal thing to do when youve had an accident is to call round at the nearest hospital for bandages and id shown up here and fallen all over the floor what happened he asked the sleep had gone from his voice i didnt answer right away and he said were all clear the throbbing across the shoulders and chest had set in again because i was standing up the internationalstandard belt is designed to take gs and the one in the nsu must have absorbed nearly that amount of load and it was a wonder the slack hadnt whiplashed the buckle free the only thing it hadnt done was to keep my head off the bodyshell above the windscreen and the only reason there wasnt any blood was because the visor was padded they got at the contact i see i felt vaguely sorry for him hed told me that london wanted to know fully urgent who made contact with lovett for a moment i expected him to order a rendezvous hed have to do an awful lot of chasing about in the next few hours trying to help london deal with the blown cover thing and hed probably go down to linsdorf himself to stop any flap inside the aib but when half a mission hangs on a stable cover and the other half on getting a contact across and the covers blown and the contacts dead its reasonable for the director to ask for a meeting persontoperson if only so that he can tread on his agents face i waited till he said something else five minutes ago hed been asleep and now he was having to do a lot of thinking and there was the third thing i had to tell him and i didnt want to do it until hed had a chance to stop reeling where are you where i was last night on the other hand there is always a risk in meetings the agent is usually infectious there are tags at his back or trying to trace him or set up a trap and if hes seen making a contact it exposes the director they are not two members of a team they are strictly departmentalized the agent is a bit of clockwork on the floor and when it hits something or turns over the directors hand comes down and sets it going again on a straight course unless its broken in which case he throws it away and sends for another one an agent can go through a mission and be set running again through another one and if hes lucky they can use him half a dozen times before they have to plug him with platinum tubing and bonerivets or reach for the nextofkin form bu t the director is a career man a whitecollar manipulator who keeps his nails clean stacking up mission after mission till they pension him off to prune roses how much can you say the door was shut and her english was schoollevel and we had our own terms for things and if i spoke fast there wouldnt be any risk i knew two things about nitri she was at this moment completely safe and if anyone ever told her that she could possess franz exclusively by selling her soul to the devil she would become totally dangerous its all right this end its just a question of bugs he was silent for a bit and i knew he was considering a rendezvous and the trouble was that we didnt have a safehouse in hanover there was no need for one because i was still too mobile and the mission had been running for only three days and every time we picked up some kind of direction the bastards blocked it lovett benedikt he said at last what happened his codename was benedikt hed started doubling so as to get across and he didnt have the stamina you know how it goes theres the odd patch of info missing but i can guarantee that a few hours before he found out who i was he had to save himself i he must have shown his hand and they didnt like him tagging me down to linsdorf so he told them to come and get me then he broke up and went religious and tried to save me instead maybe he just confessed it looked like that they wiped him out he knew they would was it effective or did you have to break your way out it could have been effective he drew them off me but i was too interested they did it in his room at the motel he didnt say anything for a minute because he was partly thinking and partly listening for bugs i supposed he would have been hysterical if hed known the girl was so close because he was a fanatic about security theres a story at the bureau very shopworn by now i saw old ferris having a cup of tea with his mother in lyons today he had her screened first of course and they had a go at me afterwards he had enough on his plate already without my telling him id lost my memory and anyway it must have happened i dont just drive clean off the bloody road ive passed my test and everything there was probably some mm material stuck in the tyres if anyone wanted to look for it what happened to the cover i had to make a search in his room to see if theyd missed anything therell be prints then i had to get out as soon as they find him ill be first suspect oh shit because that had been the third thing id had to tell him tomorrow thered be a fullscale manhunt for walter martin throughout west germany and although there was nothing to connect him with a nonexistent government department in the uk it wasnt going to be easy for ferris to fix me up with a new cover when the identikit version of my face was plastered all over the papers but it wasnt my fault even if theres been time to do the search according to the book i couldnt have gone into my own room to fetch gloves because id been pretty sure they were waiting for me there and i couldnt have stayed in the motel because everyones got a right to go on living look i said forget the cover rather stiffly he said if you want one you can have one he really was very upset just get me some papers and if im stopped ill play it by ear some papers and transport where do i pick up the old one you dont have to i wrote it off along the autobahn hurt yourself r theres a bit of a twinge in one tooth dont mess me about what sort of condition are you in look if i werent capable of looking after myself id bloody well say so and if you get london to send in a shield ill pull his balls off but i wasnt pleased about it and he knew that i was protesting too much it was a simple fact that if anyone broke in here at this moment my chances would be some degrees worse than fully normal because the right upper forearm was still in the healing stage and the left hand wanted stitches and the ribcage and shoulders were bruised but i had to be practical if i had to start relying on a shield id take less care and that would be dangerous because even if they sent the best man in the bureau he wouldnt be a hundred per cent reliable no one is it was no go when do you want it by he meant the papers and transport and i relaxed again he wasnt going to press the shield thing i said soon after a bit he said ill put the keys in the mailbox and the papers will be in the car dont do that leave it halfway along the marienwerderstrasse my left arm was aching because i was having to keep it raised i thought of asking him to do something about shoes but it might hold things up and i was working on the premise that the kriminalpolizei would be putting out a general alert from first light onwards i watched the keyhole of the bedroom door all the time but there was never movement against it all right ferris said its a darkblue ford m hanoverregistered youll find everything inside but dont forget if youre stopped youve borrowed it as long as its lefthand drive whatve you broken i just like that kind they dont attract attention there might have been an edge of annoyance in his voice but i couldnt be sure the right ear is unused to telephones can you give me any kind of location they hate not knowing where you are and its understandable because if you stop reporting they start getting the wind up and theres nothing they can do you could be making progress somewhere inside an adverse area with no available communications or you could be at the bottom of the mittellandkanal wrapped in a chain and london is pettish about sending a replacement unless the director in the field can practically produce a certificate and this is reasonable too because a mission can get very sensitive in the final stages and theres a risk of rocking the boat theyd thought houseman was inside a burntout helicopter on mont blanc when the lausanne thing was running and when they sent in a replacement the vibration was felt as far away as london and it nearly brought the lowry off the wall im going to have a try at reaching x all right he said he didnt ask for a repeat and he didnt question the need for speechcode because there can always be bugs the second thing i knew about nitri made it advisable and in any case the idea of putting your next location into so many words on a telephone brings out a rash the last thing he said was did you leave anything in the wreck the odd bit of skin what the hell do you think i am we were both a bit touchy hed got a weeks work to do in half a day and i had to drive a hundred and fifty kilometres through a manhunt in daylight i dropped the receiver with a bit of noise but the keyhole didnt change and there was no sound from the extension unit in the bedroom this was no more than routine like an actor checking his flies in the wings when i went in she was wrapped in the sheepskin coat and gazing into the glass the room smelt of peardrops ive done some invisible mending it was a perfect fit the milky glow of her body was hidden by the scarecrow folds and she was shapeless but the metamorphosis had meaning it was the gesture that fitted so precisely she had wrapped the coat around herself without thinking not for comfort or warmth but to invest herself with the magic powers of its owner just as the fledgling warrior girds himself in the lionskin of a warlord in the ritual of his initiation drawing into his sinews the strength of the mighty nitri halfdisguised had become nitri naked lost afraid vulnerable to the threat of a bells ringing and to the far explosion she would hear a hundred times before she heard it once it looks new again i said did you talk to paul dissen yesterday yes it was a peachtinted glass and her amethyst eyes were darker indigo did you find out anything quite a lot hell never do that she meant franz would never bale out hell never have to she let the coat fall away youre finding things out all the time we all are the crashanalysis engineers the aviation psychologists the people with the magic power to stop franz getting killed i didnt think much of my chances the mission had only been running three days and wed been blocked twice and all id managed to snatch out of the limbo was a name on a map neueburg she helped get my left hand through the sleeve and made me a tourniquet out of a scarf the top of the nailvarnish bottle had fallen and i picked it up and she stuck it back although the bottle was empty thered been five or six gashes in the sheepskin i want to see you again she said youll see me again chapter eleven the hare it was one of those buildings without a soul a sortinghouse for displaced persons its design so modern that it set a trend that would never be followed there is something already oldfashioned about blackandteak matt mouldings and mushroom chairs glass is a precious material that can make a palace of a cave playing with light and casting it into shadowed places but there is no real point in constructing an entire building of it to prove that here we have open minds and hold no secrets the purpose is defeated by overexposure and the result is that here we must shut our faces since we cannot shut our doors people moved through the place as if through the crosssection of a termitarium under glass but they were very efficient the frau doktor i c nighthours casualties was a bigboned lesbian with flat expressionless eyes and hands like a mechanical grab she put in seven sutures and ordered antitetanus but that was as far as i would go with her the capsules were lividhued and presumably antibacterial and coagulation agents and i slipped them into my pocket when her head was turned and just drank the water which was refreshing she obviously hadnt heard about indiscriminate sensitization and i didnt bother to tell her that i could produce enough antibodies to stop a mad horse given a fair chance they wanted me to fill in forms before discharging me because i still looked like an accident case and the polizeidirektion would expect details so i asked if i could sit down while i filled them in and then edged out to the street when they were busy rubbing antennae with some remote inmate via the automatic switchboard it had cost me fortyfive minutes but my hand would have been useless with the wound still open and the delay had to be written off as an investment first light was an hour and a half away and even if theyd found benedikt by now they probably wouldnt notice the remains of the nsu until morning i had told ferris to leave his m in the marienwerdestrasse because it was just round the block from the hospital and it saved me having to walk back to the listerplatz i slipped the match from under the wiper and got in the keys were in the ignition and the tank was full and it only took half a minute to find the envelope under the back carpet it was a big one quarto karl ernst rodl hamburg herrenhauserstrasse geboren hamburg automechaniker i hadnt had to tell ferris i needed germannational papers he knew theyd be looking for an englishman the rubber stamping bore faint segments and the photograph was sufficiently unlike my face to be natural but the automechaniker bit was off key because my nails werent normally split or ingrained they slipped up sometimes in credentials and ferris would be on to that a blast would already be working its way through his particular pipeline there was also a folder inside the envelope chronological and geographical statistics breakdown on patterncrashes and background information on dead pilots all neatly typed and typical ferris hed never use stats or info it was what id asked him for last night and i put it straight into a pocket because if i ever had to leave the m as fast as id left the nsu there wouldnt be time to clean up inside for inspection and the kriminalpolizei wouldnt expect karl ernst rodl to interest himself in strikercrash statistics in english a pencilled note was at the foot of the folder did you see what happened to field marshal stockener and minister of interior von eckern watch this space i got out and reached under the back of the car and scraped the nails of my right hand over the finaldrive casing and got back in and wiped the worst off the fingertips on the underside of the carpet then i started the engine so the feldmarschall hadnt just skidded and the bundesminister hadnt just taken a boy into the cloakroom benedikt had known they are toppling in high places and ferris had known this time its a rather big show and of course parkis had known the only one who hadnt known was the ferret down the hole and now he was being told i wondered why it wasnt just a giggle behind the hand ferris would only tell you what he thought you needed to know but he was running true to form and giving it to me in homeopathic doses and i wasnt going to think about it now there were more pressing considerations and while the engine was warming i looked them over findings it must have been the two men at the motel the hot operatives who had gone into neutralize benedikt they must have tagged me from there as far as the autobahn and then had a go on the long dark sectors where no one would hear any shots they would certainly have stopped when they saw the nsu smashing up and they would have tried to go down among the trees to finish me off if i were still breathing but id got away from the wreck so fast that they couldnt find me it may well have been a matter of seconds a passing motorist might have seen me crash and stopped to see if he could help in which case he would have kept the adverse party away if they hadnt been able to look inside the wreck they would now believe i was dead or so badly creased that i was out of the running but this assumption had so little value as to be dangerous a passing motorist would have telephoned the autobahn police patrols and theyd be called in anyway as soon as it was light enough for someone to notice the mess in the trees the bonn telex would be putting out mysterydrivervanishesfromcrashedcar signals before noon today nationwide it was safer to assume the adverse party believed i was alive or would be informed at any time they would continue to look for me and the police hunt would be thrown in as extra the ferret was still in fair shape but the hole was now virtually a culdesac i was blocked off from hanover linsdorf and all communications with people who had accepted me up to now as persona grata philpott of aib dr wagner rohmhild boldt dissen and the rest of the striker pilots the engine was warm and i checked my few belongings at the hospital theyd given me back the silk scarf that had been round my arm as a tourniquet it was a vaguely freudian design and very nitri it was already in my pocket and it could stay there because i didnt want the police to find anything that could lead them to her if i had to abandon the car the good frau doktor had fixed my arm in a sling so that my stitched hand couldnt fidget about and i took the thing off and stowed it in the sheepskin coat because during an interrogation you can conceivably keep a bandaged hand out of sight and when theyd tallied the number of the nsu with the number in the motel register theyd be looking for someone in poor condition and a sling would be a positive advertisement at eightyodd minutes before dawn in a wintry street i should have been prey to depression mentally i was sound except for a patch of retrograde amnesia that couldnt be critical to the mission but physically i would have less chance than normal if anyone came for me close in and i didnt like that ferris had set me running and after three days id had to report that id blown my cover and lost the contact and become first suspect in a murder hunt and i didnt like that either the opposition had twice tried to smear me out and parkis was so scared at the size of this show that he wanted to stick a shield on to me so if they tried a third time one of two things would happen either it would be successful and too late for a shield or parkis would panic and insist on my having one in which case id tell ferris that if i couldnt work alone he could signal london for a replacement and pull me out then some snivelling bitch at the bureau would slide her scummy teacup off the progress report and scrawl mission unconcluded against my name and i liked that least of all but as i closed the driving window and shut myself in with the smell of ether and nail varnish and turned the car to face southwards i was elated instead of depressed i had changed my cover and my nationality and i was on my own now with every mans hand against me throughout the whole country from this time on i would follow the ways unknown to other men digging my own dark tunnels as i went there was more stuff along the autobahn mostly trucks but i was south of gottingen before dawn i went fast and the mirror was clear for a hundred kilometres except once when i thought there was a dark shape drifting in it but it must have been a trick of the light and i never saw it again some rain had fallen this side of the mountains and the trees stood wet with it their branches interlaced with silver in the headlights once a hare ran obliquely across my path its coat already winterwhite and its shadow bounding ahead until it found a gap and leapt beautifully ears flat and feet together vanishing it was the only time i slowed except when a rash of rearlights spread through the dark towards the munden looproad and i saw the police lamp swinging it was well organized they expected fast motoring along this stretch and though the m was piling on through the s i didnt fetch any squeal from the treads pulling up there were two longhaulers and a private vw standing in a queue with some police cars drawn in on the margin of course there had always been this consideration the choice when id left hanover had been to make a really fast run and reach neueburg with as little daylight driving as possible or take it slowly and allow a chance of dodging a police block by trying to see them before they saw me it would have been practicable at a slower speed to pull up quietly with the lights doused and do a softshoe turn and get the hell out give or take a few degrees of luck i had opted for the fast run on the assumption that nobody would find benedikt before daylight at the earliest and that when they did find him thered be a decent timelag before the kriminalpolizei were notified and the motel manager gave them the name and description of the englander who had joined the deceased for his last meal and had since left without checking out at the desk id made the wrong decision even in that moment of elation when my faith in myself had burned brightly in the surrounding gloom the one on signalling duty just pointed a gloved hand at the queue and i closed up on the rearmost truck leaving the engine running if he told me to switch it off i would switch it off but on principle i left it the way it was because if theres a chance in a thousand you might as well be ready to take it probability the manager had gone up to see if he could do anything for benedikt soon after id left hed been worried about him during dinner he looked ill is he all right that would have brought the kp into the picture long before id reached nitris apartment but they wouldnt have decided on roadblocks until a bit later coming south from hanover i had passed linsdorf five kilometres to the west and was now heading away from it that was why there hadnt been a police trap until now they expected martin to be moving away from the scene of the killing there was probably another trap north of the linsdorf looproad along that side of the autobahn and i had passed it but not seen it because of the antidazzle screens along some sections of the centre strip it was a coldstorage truck standing in front of me frankfurtregistered vollmond gesellschaft twelve delineation lights and the companys trademark a full moon framing a laughing pig so happy to be knifed in the abattoir and minced into sausages for the friendly bipeds to eat your papers please local by his accent a cloud of diesel gas spread out from the longhauler at the head of the line as it lumbered away the uniformed figures stood halfobliterated i gave him my papers if the probability were correct and the manager had in fact gone up to see if he could do anything for benedikt he might have decided to knock on my door it was only the third along for the sake of immediate human company because he would have been white and shaking by that time or hed thought i might have some sort of clue about what had happened since id been dining with benedikt only half an hour ago it could have started from there herr benedikt dead and herr martin missing polizei when were you born february he was young and very military keeping his head up and holding my identity card straight in front of him only his eyes going down to read it where hamburg glare began bouncing off the back of the truck and the laughing pig was slowly lost in it the shadow of the patrolman appeared there like a gaunt secretarybird black and beakless his colleague with the lamp hurried past and the sound of nearing thunder came from behind me and the light grew strong in the mirror switch off your engine please i switched off my engine his torch clicked on and the beam caught me full in the face what with that and the glare off the truck and the mirror i felt we were about ready for camera the thunder rolled loudly and there was a crash of gears it sounded like a fifteentonner with trailer to match and i began wondering if hed manage to pull up in time because if he chose this moment to leak some hydraulics fd be no better off than the laughing pig crashed minced and canned in one laboursaving operation the torchbeam flickered back to my papers and then on to my face again and i grasped at a small hope he was less efficient than he looked because if you shine a torch full into someones face his eyes are going to screw up and they wont be screwed up in the photograph he might make other mistakes a monstrous hiss came from the longhauler and then the brakes dragged again and there was the shunt of heavy couplings hed dipped now and i could see better what i could see most was the shine on the patrolmans holster just about eyelevel from where i sat he turned as another one walked up an older man in hauptmanns uniform very smartlooking and big in the body his head like a sculpted rock they stood looking at my papers and suddenly i was unnerved and it had nothing to do with them i had missed a trick and that wouldnt do it wouldnt do at all the subconscious had been working busily during the crisis and now it presented its findings cancel all probabilities it hadnt been the motel manager or anything to do with him it had been the adverse party and this was their third try theyd stopped my run at this section of the autobahn as surely as if theyd set up an ambush the front of the longhauler filled the mirror and the lights went out voices the diesel clattered to silence ahead of me the group of police stood back and the volkswagen pulled away they had managed to go down into the trees and look inside the wreck of the nsu and when they saw it was empty theyd beaten around a bit and then gone up and used the nearest emergency phone and told the kriminalpolizei to check on an englander named martin who had been staying at the motel in linsdorf where a man named benedikt was now lying dead in his room they should also check up on his car which they would find alongside the autobahn the informants name was schmidt and he was telephoning in the interests of justice it had begun then i didnt know how much sleep id had in nitris apartment after id passed out it wouldnt have been more than four or five hours and it had been recuperative and not restorative but that was no excuse for missing a trick on this scale instead of being so perversely content that every mans hand would soon be against me i should have assumed it was against me already should have assumed the people who had finished benedikt would automatically try to pull off a double by sounding the alarm before i got too far i should have come south from hanover like a mouse with a cat in the room this wasnt very good and i sat in my sweat and watched them checking the papers situation they stood about five yards from the car and they werent looking at me and there was a flush of light rising from behind the longhauler as someone else came homing in on the trap and in ten seconds or so theyd be dazzled by it if they looked in my direction so it wasnt a question of yards but of seconds and increasing candlepower the main police group was vetting the vollmond truck in front of me one of them climbing into the cab to have a look round the theory they would be working on was that martin might have thumbed a lift somewhere in the linsdorf area after crashing the nsu and might have offered the driver a fistful of deutschmarks to shove him under the seat if anyone turned nosey the patrol with the lamp would be back there signalling the new arrival to halt i could see his shadow stretching across the roadsurface as the light brightened both trucks and the m had their engines switched off the newcomer was already producing a bit of background noise that would get louder until he stopped no one would hear me open the door and i didnt have to slam it shut after me i turned my head and saw a couple of yards of empty roadmargin and a line of thick brush it was naked thorn but then they wouldnt like it either and its main value was visual it would be like shooting through a smokescreen a faint shrilling began and the shadow on the road was waving the lamp more insistently and i now had very little time to make the decision and my right hand was already reaching across to the other door because that was the way id be going out if i went out at all but the chances were about fiftyfifty i knew i could get through the first of the thorn and break across open ground before they could draw and fire and the initial surprise phase would give me time to go a fair distance towards the next cover but a loose shoe is more laming than a legwound and it would take up to three seconds to wrench both shoes off and a barefoot run across rough terrain would slow me critically and i would be committed the new arrival had stopped behind the longhauler and the scene went dark the last clear image on the retina was of the two uniformed men moving towards me the senior holding my papers i took my hand away from the door it had been mostly stomachthink not brainthink the instinctive need of a trapped animal to free itself the temptation to go as the hare had gone ears flat and feet together brainthink had warned me there had been a fiftyfifty chance of getting clear but my very freedom would have comprised another trap i would have been committed exposed as the man they were looking for martin there was still a fiftyfifty chance of getting clear by sitting here with my nerves and sweating it out and if they finally let me drive away i would be uncommitted rodl goodmorning a punctilious salute the big hand swinging to touch the rocklike head a hand that would come down with hammerforce if it sensed a wrong move goodmorning i said where have you come from the robot tone of a speakyourweight machine hanover where are you going munden why are you on the road at this hour to avoid the traffic i played it dead straight not making a joke anyone trying to avoid the traffic and fetching up jammed between thirty tons worth of truckage might think it rated a laugh but he wouldnt see it that way making a joke is fatal unless the worst thing on your mind is a duff rearlight because if they think youre not taking them seriously theyll have your shoes off and check them for hollow heels just to show how serious they can get it had gone very quiet now last man in had been told to switch off his engine the hauptmann was tapping my papers on the joint of his thumb he said what is the advantage of a hemispherical head i looked a bit thrown as if i hadnt quite caught on because being too quick on the uptake can be as suspect as making a joke well it cuts down turbulence and if youve got twin overhead camshafts youll want to incline the valves anyway so a hemispherical heads almost obligatory have you any opinions on watervapour in the carburation id say its a help in most conventional engines in fact schneider make a limited suctionfeed system that anyone can fit when my friends try to argue about this i always ask them why their car seems to run smoother on a wet day the sweat was on my face now and i hoped he wouldnt notice if he were going to keep me waiting five seconds before he spoke again it was going to be five seconds of purgatory like waiting for the exam results he wasnt only trying to find out if karl rodl mechaniker knew his stuff on engines he also wanted to test my german for mistakes in technical terms because any good linguist can come unstuck on words like camshaft and the ice had been waferthin the striker wasnt internalcombustion and i hadnt needed this kind of terminology since the nurburgring mission and the memory had had to pull it out of some very cold storage visual accommodation was improving now and in the light of their torches i could see the group by the truck talking to the driver and his mate one of them was still in the cab the driver was shaking his head all the time nein nein the trouble with police traps is that even though they might be set up to intercept a man on the run theyll do what business is offered from an outofdate licence to a crate of cocaine stowed under the seat and that means delay for everyone in the queue i didnt look up at the officer id said my bit and now i was taking an interest in how the truckdriver was making out because he was being very emphatic about something and there was nothing else here to interest me very well he handed my papers back i turned my head after a second as if id just remembered them thank you it wasnt the allclear yet but the sweat began drying up there were only two things left to worry about they might ask for the car papers and they might ask me to get out if they saw the car papers theyd want to know why id had to borrow the m in case it was because id had the bad luck to wreck an nsu last night and if i got out of the car id have to keep my bandaged hand and my split shoe out of sight and that wouldnt be too easy it wasnt a blackandwhite question of was i or was i not an englishman named martin it was a question of watchful suspicion on their part a trained eye open for minor irregularities small inconsistencies something not quite as it should be a thread however fine that they could get between finger and thumb and pull and go on pulling till it thickened to a rope my chances were those of any candidate in an exam they could ask the right questions or the wrong ones light was spreading again someone else was closing on us from along the autobahn i hardly noticed i hardly noticed because the whole situation was presenting itself logically in my mind perhaps as an antidote to fright it went like this ferris would already be in signals with london and as long as the bureau thought i was still of use they would move all available mountains to help get the kriminalpolizei off my back they had set me running and they wanted me to go on running in case by luck or acumen i found my way finally into what parkis called the stormcentre of course the bureau could do nothing officially it didnt exist but no network on a world scale is ever isolated theres always a fringe overlap especially when something big is on the programme and any given agency will bump elbows with most organizations from the national civil police authorities up through the cid special branch mi mi and the various select departments whose chiefs are known only to the pm and the home secretary on an overseas mission you wont get far before you cross lines with the sid the cia or the deuxieme bureau according to the area being worked interpol will often come into the picture because it has ninetyeight membercountries and that doesnt leave many places where they dont operate unofficially the bureau would tap the odd grapevine here and there until they got a response from some organization they happened to have assisted at some time or other and if they could ease the right word through to kriminalpolizei bundesrepublik deutschland a few telephones would ring and the heat would come off martin even if he were being grilled in a cell on a murder charge but there was a limit to what action the bureau could take and that limit was the line beyond which the bureau would risk selfexposure of the sacred and unwritten laws that governed its constitution the most holy was that no one however high must in any circumstances however grave ever by word or deed or implication jeopardize the prime virtue by grace of which the bureau was enabled to operate in areas and with resources outside the reach of other factions the virtue of nonexistence among the lower echelons where the ferrets ran we called it the rule of the dtm otherwise dont tell mum so the bureau had a limit and so had i and it was the same one the same precisely defined invisible line because if these people asked to see the car papers or asked me to get out and open j the luggageboot and it led to a cell and a charge and a trial i would have to deal with it alone from the moment of an official charge the bureau would drop me like a dead rat that was all right it was in the contract but my defence would already be spiked to prove i hadnt killed benedikt i would have to answer every question put by the prosecution and thered be some i couldnt answer because it would mean crossing the line exposing the bureau when did you join the accidents investigation branch of the air ministry herr martin what were you doing before then where did you train as an aviation psychologist you cant answer but surely you can tell us about your past your background youll be telling us next herr martin that you dont exist correct theyd have it made acquaintance with the deceased absence of alibi fingerprints on the deceaseds watch lighter pens hasty departure from the motel failure to complete accident report at hospital acquisition of false papers attempt to pass through police block under assumed identity and finally therefusal to answer questions in court they dont hang you in west germany these days it would be a life sentence but that wasnt the worst appeal tell them to look for the two men the ones the manager saw with the deceased if that was no use then i could stick it out till a chance came and i had a hacksaw blade and if the chance didnt come i could try to make a break from a workingparty and if i couldnt make a break i could use a dinnerknife on the wrists and cut the rest of the sentence away but all the time i was waiting for chances in there like a tethered goat id have to live with the thought that the bureau was still running and the missions were still going out and there was one i hadnt finished this one that was the worst the flood of light grew brighter from behind and the shadow of the man with the signallamp moved sharply across the road i tucked my papers away and looked up at the officer to see if that was all he said please open your luggage compartment he stood away from the door to give me room to get out chapter twelve to ground the body of homo is provided with various compensatory mechanisms one is the carotid sinus located in the neck zu gross sind sie sicker when a man becomes angry the released adrenalin raises his bloodpressure throughout the system putting incidental pressure on the carotid sinus this triggers off a flow of nerve impulses to the brain which produce a calming effect in compensation that is why the most heated anger cools the most quickly probieren sie diese an i put them on and walked round they were unpolished stagskin high at the sides the serration on the soles was only halfworn and they were dead quiet on the floor that was important ja die passeri the place was stuffed to the rafters with masculine accessories shotguns fishingrods fieldglasses skis windbreakers boots and shoes high in the gloom there was a divers helmet on his desk was a quarrymans detonator it was a pity that i needed only shoes you can do a lot with a quarrymans detonator tragen sie die gleich ja they had buckles instead of laces and i took them up a notch i was pleased with them certainly not angry but the carotid sinus works also in reverse low barometric pressure outside has the same effect as high bloodpressure inside since it cant tell the difference it sends the same nerve impulses to the brain calming it down some people say im sleepy it must be the weather he looked at my split shoe with a shrug fertig fertig i nodded he dropped them both into an upturned fencingmask and i gave him dm for the shoes and for the pair of x zeiss i had found on a shelf he counted the deutschmarks in the light from the doorway over the harz range the sky was a purple bruise it was going to be a spectacular storm when it came and this was why i felt sleepy or it was the aftereffects of the crash or the inadequate sleep at nitris or the nervous tension of the police trap or i was getting old auf wiedersehen i went back to the car walking normally for the first time since id left the motel the left shoe felt too tight but it had two notches on each buckle the same as the other one the foot had already tried to adapt itself to a split upper and now it would have to relearn certainly i had said but it had been a nasty five minutes the air was cold so i made a show of feeling the contrast blowing out my cheeks as i left the car one hand in my pocket for warmth the other finding the right key as though it didnt have to think about it but it had to think about it bloody hard because it wasnt far from the drivingdoor to the boot and i was doing it onehanded and they were watching me and i knew that the latest arrival had doused his lights but it was still awkward having to keep one foot arched so that it sounded normal it was trying to drag like a slipper they both came with me the young one holding the torch and aiming the beam at the bootlock for me it was the right key because there were three on the ring and the ignition and the door were the same pattern one was a spare but it didnt turn easily because the bootlid was springtensioned by the rubber moulding and you normally had to press down a fraction with the left hand so the choice was to do it with the elbow and show i was injured or go on forcing the key till it snapped if either happened it would finish me because they were looking for an injured man and if the key snapped theyd think id done it on purpose so that they couldnt look in the boot and see walter martin curled up there but theres a law of averages and my run of bad luck was stretching the odds a bit and the key turned and i raised the lid and they looked inside and that was that did you give anyone a lift at any time during the night no did you see anyone thumbing you for a lift no very well you can proceed still very careful though testing the lid to make sure it was properly locked taking my time there was no hurry because thats when they go on watching you in case you fall prone and give thanks to allah for getting you off the hook it still wasnt easy even then the other group didnt like the way the truckdriver kept on saying nein nein with so much emphasis and now they were helping him open the big double doors and the pig was laughing on both sides of its face this meant i had to do a series of shunts between the two trucks before i could turn out and i had to do it onehanded keeping the wheel locked over with my knee while i shifted the gears the young one swung his torch to guide me away and the officer saluted the nerves began their reactionphase and for the next kilometre i felt as if id drunk too much coffee none of the other shops were open yet munden is a small town and it was nearly full winter id seen the old man swinging back his shutters and stopped on the off chance it was probably his only life in there among the skis and divers helmets they were his toys the shoes were excellent and the leftfoot clutchwork was normal again and i drove five kilometres without stopping while i worked out the situation and when id worked it out i turned into a minor road and found the right kind of spot and ran the m as deep as i could into a copse where raindrops still fell from the trees situation there might be just the two traps one on each side of the hanoverkassel autobahn or there might be a dozen a quickly thrown net around linsdorf one of them was certain to be farther south towards neueburg and i would hit in full daylight no go it would be safer to reach neueburg by dark in any case the guide book gave the population as under so it was a place where a stranger would be suspect i set each window to an inch gap at the top and tilted the seat back and let sleep come ferris had done a full coverage but there was nothing that he or philpott or dr wagner or nitri hadnt either told me or led me to consider list of witnesses nb these were sifted from several hundred and are believed to be the most reliable there were sixtytwo names and full addresses farmers postmen birdwatchers coastguard observers mostly farmers like the one with the red tractor at westheim my own name wasnt among them ferris never joked on duty i just heard a whining noise and looked up there werent any flames as far as i could see but the sun was partly in my eyes and shining on the wings so i wont commit myself on that it was almost vertical and so close that i began to run i remember thinking poor devil the most common factor was the attitude straight down vertical or nearly vertical i would say he came down like a stone chronologically there was no pattern thirtysix strikers had crashed within three hundred and fortytwo days average one per days longest interval between two crashes days shortest geographically there was no pattern out of ten main striker bases each had experienced a crash ie no squadron had been immune lowest incidence highest in the background of dead pilots section there were several common factors but none were unexpected each had a history with indications of what dr wagner called striker psychosis with attendant periods of anxiety states and hypertension all had been sent once or more than once to garmischpartenkirchen for two weeks mudbaths and psychiatrical sessions confidential information on their private lives so far as it could be obtained showing nothing significant marital disturbance slight financial worries normal professional qualities well above average for frontline tactical squadrons nb these pilots were picked from among all operational branches of the luftwaffe in view of the technical sophistication and high cost of the striker sk they thus represent the elite of the german air arm i went through the folder twice and used a pencil in the margins and filled the back cover with averages common factors consistencies anomalies blank some time during the afternoon i heard movement and kept perfectly still i had slept from early morning till one oclock and was ninetyeight per cent alert and two per cent under the continuing influence of the barometric pressure the storm still sagged across the mountains slow to break the movement went on and sometimes the low leaves trembled within yards of the car i saw him only once crossing a clear patch a wild boar black compact full in tusk and high at the shoulder he swung his head and then stood rockstill catching the unfamiliar smell of rubber and petrol then vanished as if the leaves had drawn over him he would have slept through the height of the day as i had and would soon move through the night as i would and i wished him well l the identification figures were prefaced with a letter for each air base linsdorf mich spalt i went through the whole picture again and came up with nothing and put the folder away and took it out again on the spur of frustration bederkesa quakenbruck jolich bruchsal north northwest west southwest it was consistent but this thing was full of consistencies and i was looking for anomalies trying to see if the pattern broke anywhere that might be a mistake laubach linsdorf hankensbuttel oldenburg east northeast northeast north it was consistent again and the pencil had made a ring on the map from north round the clock to north i must have been overconcentrating because it was a minute before i got it the names of the striker bases made a geographical ring but id begun with a timefactor not a spacefactor ferris had called them patterncrashes but he couldnt have known about this in terms of sequence the strikers had been crashing in a geographical ring round the map northwestsoutheastnorth it practically spelled a name but i couldnt go back to linsdorf i was cut off from there and all i could do was file it i put the folder away chapter thirteen the frontier neueburg was gnomegothic a frontispiece for grimm the population must have been mostly pastoral because there werent more than a hundred or so houses to the village pointed roofs latticed windows the glint of cats eyes in doorways even the weathervane over the pharmacy was a witch on a broomstick perhaps it was to mark her birthplace the early hunger of the day had passed off during the afternoon it would return before midnight and i was tempted to pick up something to conserve but i didnt want to show my face anywhere it would have to wait in any case a light stomach would be an advantage if things got rough at the clockmakers i didnt know benedikt hadnt told me whether the place were a safehouse for die zelle a contact point of his own or a zelle address where he was still accepted as loyal it was near the end of the main street i assumed there was only one clockmakers in neueburg otherwise benedikt would have been more precise it backed on to a chapel so there wouldnt be a door at the rear it made a corner of a tsection and if there were a second entrance it would be the door at the side the first one along i took the m past at normal speed and turned at the end of the village and came back coasting to a stop just within observationview of the front entrance and the door at the side it was only ten minutes to five but the winter dark had already come down the streetlamps were all right and i spent some time with the x zeiss after wiping the grime off the lenses in the next half an hour two people went in and came out there was nothing about them to suggest they werent fetching their alarmclocks i was in no hurry there are a few simple rules about visiting an indicated address and they add up to the one general idea of vetting the place carefully before going in that was why id thought the zeiss would be useful after the first half an hour i had some data collected mostly about the best way of getting out of the building if i found myself on the second or third floors and didnt want to use the front entrance there were at least two people there because a light had gone on upstairs about fifteen seconds after someone had entered there wasnt a lot of time to reach the third floor and the clockmaker would probably be talking to him in the shop itself apart from general rules there were specific considerations i might be recognised the instant i went in either because they were in close touch with the zelle unit in hanover or because my face was probably now in the papers there could be a dozen people in there contacts couriers operators radiosignallers and i could walk straight into a springtrap especially if benedikt had talked before he died if they knew hed given me this address theyd expect me here general rules specific considerations instinct the precise formula for doing the right thing in a given situation but mostly instinct the antennae weaving sensitively around and touching on hairfine contacts correcting and recorrecting the plan of approach the conscious and subconscious gathering and relating of random data computing presenting counselling telling me whether to cross over there and walk in now or wait another ten minutes or another sixty whether to give the clockmaker benedikts name and assess his reaction or try one of a dozen other gambits that would leave us both with a way out if there were people there and it was dangerous because i had to start with an assumption a likelihood as a blueprint and i assumed that he was aware that benedikt had tried to defect and that i knew it normal data was coming in all the time and it could be vital or useless seven cars driven through the village in half an hour four of them hanoverregistered two frankfurt and one stuttgart a lightcoloured porsche had pulled up fifty yards ahead of the m and a man had gone into the shop and driven off again after five minutes thirteen people had passed me on foot and ten had gone by the clockmakers four of them looking in one of them giving a wave of his hand two had gone in and come out again an opel kapitan stopped a short way down the sidestreet and a man got out and went into the first doorway along id had the zeiss on him and so i was certain i supposed he had come south as i had perhaps going to ground as i had and for the same reason to wait for the police traps to be withdrawn the manager of the motel would have described him to the kriminalpolizei and he would know that in the ordinary way it might not worry him a verbal description isnt much to go on so i assumed it had been important for him to reach neueburg and the doorway over there in complete security the death of benedikt could have sent the entire network quivering and its controllers would be jumpy he had left the kapitan a few yards from the door and had walked along to it lightly on the balls of his feet his shoulders forward i didnt need to go across and put my head inside the car to confirm what i already knew would be there a faint smell of almonds he was in the house for an hour and during that time i twice decided to make a move and follow him through the side door and take it from there on an ad hoc basis and twice revoked the decision and tried to sell myself the idea that it wasnt because my left hand didnt want to get hurt any more there were in fact practical reasons why i should avoid immediate risks up to an hour ago id had only one fine thread to follow the name of a village where there was a clockmaker if that information had turned out to be duff or if id made a mistake at the autobahn police trap my personal part in the mission would have been totally written off without this one fine thread there would have been no future i was isolated now cut off from linsdorf and the ability to root around there under the aib cover and there was nowhere else to go it would have been the first time i had ever failed to report back to the bureau without at least some bits and pieces for them to look at but now i had something for ferris the location of a zelle safehouse confirmed if i went in there the chances of learning a lot more were high but the chances of bringing the information away with me were not if i stayed where i was id be sitting pretty and i didnt want to jog the barbers arm one factor made the final decision it was a factor that often influences an operation at any given critical stage and it is surprising because it is banal it is the weather tonight over neueburg the sky was still clear with the stormclouds piled and concentrated in the harz range to the north a haze was spreading eastwards from the centre but the thirdphase moon was still at ninetenths luminosity and its light would last until the storm broke without it i would have had to go in there and do what i could because there would have been no alternative he came out alone and went straight to the kapitan without checking the street and if ferris ever saw one of us do a thing like that hed have us underneath the lowry for filthy rotten security perhaps thats why the bureau had lasted so long i gave him fifty seconds and started up and tagged him out of the village at long range settling down at something like a hundred yards through the hedgerows south i didnt expect it to be easy but it was worse than id let myself believe across flatter terrain the going would have been comfortable because his rearlamps and the light thrown by his heads would have provided a continuous beacon for me but in this area the rise and fall of the road blotted him out at intervals and i had to use the moon alone after the first few kilometres i could feel the ciliary muscles contracting and relaxing as my eyes adjusted to the changing lightconditions that was all right they could go on doing it and the exercise was good for them but the roads were narrow and there was often a temptation to flick the heads on for half a second to make sure i wasnt going to hit anything even the sidelamps would have been a help but from the moment i switched them on hed pick me up in the mirror and start watching me and wait for me to turn them off somewhere and i wasnt going to do that nervous hallucinations set in after thirty minutes or so they were bound to when he topped a brow and vanished beyond it his image remained on the retinae and when he reappeared before it had time to fade out i could see two of him because he never showed up exactly in the same place on the visionfield he wasnt going fast but it was too fast to take an accurate line through the bends and i clouted a bank before long and had to fight off the subsequent yawingaction that was set up by the springs trees were the biggest hazard they hid him suddenly if the road dipped or turned at that point and as soon as my eyes adjusted to the moonlight i was running into the trees myself and the whole lot went dark because they hid the sky as well and i was driving blind for fivesecond periods at sixty kph and at that speed i was covering more than eighty metres blacked out the only tune for thinking was along the stretches of straight road where i slowed a fraction to increase the gap and make it more difficult for him to pick up reflected light in his mirror there were no facts to go on except that since hed turned south from neueburg he wasnt heading for hanover where he was probably based and this gave me a chance to get some more information provided i could stay with him to the end of the line there were a few assumptions one of them reasonable the clockmakers must be a safehouse or a radiopoint or both but nothing more an organization capable of half crippling the luftwaffes frontline strikeforce and removing the army chiefofstaff and the minister of the interior from office wouldnt make its headquarters in neueburg another assumption possibly more wishful than reasoned was that the man ahead of me was making direct for those headquarters either in the routine duty of courier or to report on benedikt one thing was certain i had to go with him we were thirtyone kilometres south of neueburg on the speedotrip when his lights vanished and i drove by the moon until some trees came and the offside of the m ploughed clay from the bank and struck roots and began creasing the weight was shifting and the front tyre howled like a buzzsaw as the wing folded against it and i tried to ease over without correcting too sharply and hitting the opposite bank thorn and the boughs of saplings whiplashed along the bodywork and there was a deadweight feeling to the wheel so i gunned up and dragged her clear and hit the lights on because there was the chance he wouldnt see them whereas there was no chance of dodging a headon impact if the whole thing ran wild without his lights and without the moon i was driving into a waste of darkness and the margin of error was the width of the car subtracted from the width of the road and it wasnt enough to get me through the whole scene jumped into focus as the lights came on roadsurface and grass and earth banks and a gateway and a group of elms rearing with the interplay of light and shadow swinging through their columns it began from there a series of rocking lunges that took the car through a zigzag from bank to bank with the nearside rear skinning bark from an elm and the springs pitching so hard that the steering was half under control and half abandoned as the front wheels slid and struck earth and bounced away and found a grip and lost it again given some calculated bursts of acceleration the trim would have steadied but i was having to slow having to brake because it was the only chance there were three more impacts at acute angles before i could pull up with all four wheels in a slide as soon as movement stopped i cut the lights and hit the door open i was in a hurry now and the wing came clear of the front tyre because it had to because i made it the left hand hooking to help the bandage catching on the torn edge of the metal some of it tearing then i stood and listened seeing a patch of light flickering a kilometre away south and eastwards hed taken a branch road and that was why hed been hidden for so long he couldnt have seen my lights or heard the wing on the tyre because he would have stopped and doused his own lights and lain low so there was still a chance it took time to come up on him again the land was flatter eastwards but twice i had to light up for other traffic and once i lost him for minutes through a region of brush petrol fumes were filling the interior and backdraught bringing them in through gaps in the torn bodywork the tank had been split at some time when the rear had struck obstacles it was a new worry but there was nothing i could do about it except coast when there was a chance conserving fuel the moon was the only reference for any kind of bearing and i estimated that we were only some forty kilometres east of our northsouth leg from neueburg to the point where hed turned off i didnt know the area but i had looked at the map ferris had put into the statistics folder and when the kapitan slowed and turned across rough ground and doused its light i knew that this could only be the east german frontier zone it was a winter silence the moons light blanched colour away and left a bonewhite landscape there was no frost but the air was cold and very still far north the first murmuring came from the cloudmass but here the land was quiet he had run the car into a huddle of black oblongs the hulk of a military depot left here to rot a quarter of a century ago when he had turned off the road i had started coasting with the engine dead letting the last of the momentum thrust the m into thick bush i pushed the statistics folder under the carpet and got out ill for a minute the black outline was unbroken then he detached himself and began walking i drew my left hand along one of the wheelruts where the earth was soft at the edges darkening the bandage then took up the tag i think he looked round but no more than casually and i was motionless before his eyes could have focussed a light flickered as he checked his watch and i knew there was a rendezvous we walked fiftyodd metres apart i was ready at every pace to freeze if he looked back he didnt look back between the north sea and czechoslovakia runs the jagged scar of the frontier nine hundred miles of barbed wire trenches watchtowers concrete bunkers and minefields for west germany it doesnt exist east germany doesnt exist therefore it can possess no frontier but it is there manned by fourteen thousand troops of the deutsche demokratische republik with machineguns searchlights and dogpatrols in the sensitive areas where attempts at exfiltration are insistent the vigilance is sharp and every day someone somewhere along the nine hundred miles of the frontier dies a worn coat puckered by a ballet and a hand going out to break the fall of the living body that is dead before it meets the ground and there is special leave for the man who shot him down the hanover section is the responsibility of the federal customs and is patrolled by the bundesgrenzschutz and the british frontier service it is a less sensitive area and reliance is placed on the barbed wire and mines it is not the only section where vigilance on the part of the east german volkspolizei has become cursory since the frontier was fortified in more than two thousand of their own border troops have themselves crossed it from east to west in some places the wife has rusted and the loose boards of the watchtowers rattle in the wind the warning signs lean from rotten posts and the patrols keep to the warmth of their huts unless a sound reaches them through the winter night but the mines are there sown invisibly across the thirtymetre strip of desolate land some people still get across there is a matchseller who sits outside the hauptbahnhof in the city of hanover legless south and east from neueburg are pine forests the haunt of wild boar but a lot of timber has been cut and the land ploughed in many places the horizon is low and distant across a waste of beetfields the wind has an edge when it blows from the north and there is not much shelter it was here that he led me the man who liked marzipan a notice leaned in the moonlight propped on the barbed wire haiti heir zonengrenze achtung lebensgefahr wirkungsbereich sowjetzonaler minen haiti following him i had looked back a dozen times sighting on the ruin of the military depot and keeping in line with it so that if he turned his head i would be seen against its shape and thus perhaps not seen at all also i noted landmarks a hump of withered bush the skeleton form of a watchtower to my left the ashgrey shape of what looked like a concrete bunker on the other side he went straight through the wire and i stood watching him keeping quite still because as he stooped to pass between the strands the pallor of his face showed up but he didnt expect to be followed his head was turning to left and right and i saw a new shape smaller than the bunker and farther away and with a vertical blade of light cutting its mass it would be a guardhut the light showing through the join of a door he checked it and then went on but more slowly because the sign had said danger of death i waited he had stopped and stood motionless but i heard no sound anywhere then he began going forward again at an angle and i walked to the wire and went through it as he had the barbs had been turned inwards with pliers along a metre of its length and as i straightened up i took another bearing and committed it to memory he had stopped again and his head was turning and i stood waiting the white of his face was showing now and he had swung his body in my direction and for half a minute he made no movement at all i wasnt sure that he had seen me it was an eerie place a landscape with dead figures the posts leaning like gibbets and the web of the wire breaking the flat twodimensional background into sections as if the whole scene were cardboard a badly lighted stage perhaps it was difficult for him to believe in the unlikely that a man was standing not far from him thrown up from the waste of earth where armies had once passed leaving their dead perhaps he was afraid of his own imaginings and even hoped it was in fact a man of flesh and blood that stood here a creature he could deal with natural mortal neither of us could move easily move quickly here they were lying quietly the brasscapped detonators an inch below the surface of the earth protected by their pitchmouldings against the rain he knew where they were but it was only another way of saying that he knew he mustnt move too quickly here then i was sure that he had seen me recognized me at least for something that shouldnt be here something that was neither a post nor a shadow thrown by the moon his outline was changing slowly on one side and now the pale light flickered on metal in his hand softly who is there chapter fourteen stormcentre i went up to him slowly following the angle he had taken the earth was crusty with frost you cant use that i said itd make too much noise he held it cocked up to aim at my face it was his usual the p and he remembered what hed been taught at close quarters it has to be the heart or the brain because anywhere else is too slow and even two or three in the stomach wont stop you from trying to take a man with you barehanded if your bloods up and you might have anything under a thick sheepskin coat wallet holster so forth sweat was on his face a grey dew in the moonlight his breathing was shaky and it confirmed what id felt about him two nights ago when hed sat behind me in the se with this thing lined up with the bridge of my nose he was gundependent dont move he breathed go on then get it over i was suddenly fed up because we were wasting time then see how far youll get before theyre out of that hut theyve got the real thing rapidfire dont speak so loudsoft panic on his breath hed crossed here before but he didnt like it thats what i mean id been getting it ready over a period of several seconds working out the exact way it would have to go and the gun smashed upwards into his face and didnt go off because the blow was directly on the wristnerve to paralyse the fingers before the index could contract but there was risk attached and i had to sweat it out until the gun hit the ground with a negative thud and didnt blow our legs off he was worse then id thought even though i knew what they were like the gundependents take their toy away and they break down blubbing he just rocked stupidly with a hand up to his face and didnt do anything about me at all so i cancelled the second half of the trick the kneetogroin number and picked up the p and threw it well across the wire where it would be all right you go first i said reaction was setting in and i wasnt feeling much better than he was it had been a rough run from neueburg in the dark and it had looked so many times as if the best i could hope to do was climb out of a smashed m just as id climbed out of a smashed nsu and at every one of those times the whole mission had depended on which way a oneton mass would swing when it left my hands now i could relax there are mines here he said his mouth had begun bleeding i can read youll have to go back it was just because he didnt know what to do a lot of them are like that they work to strict orders and when there arent any orders they beat the air but i knew it would be all right i had known since hed looked at his watch just after hed left the car he had a rendezvous you go first i told him and start now theyre not going to wait for ever he was staring into my face intent on everything i said hoping it might give him some kind of direction and finally it did he had needed telling almost in so many words that all he had to do was take me with him to the rendezvous where they were waiting then he could ask one of them for a gun and he would be six feet tall again and i would be dead it is heavily mined he said slowly you will have to take care a new thought had been worming its way through the sludge he was worried in case i trod on the wrong thing and brought the guards out firing from the hip he only liked shooting people he didnt like people shooting him well both be very careful yes both of us he nodded and turned away and went forward for three or four metres at a time stopping to check bearings there was something disgusting about the way i had to put my feet precisely where he put his turning my head exactly as he did it was just deep in my nature to resent being dependent on people even people as good as ferris and now i was dependent on this gross creature my life linked intimately with his he moved again and stopped again and i checked the new reference the third wirestanchion from the nearest warningsign was lined up with the edge of the ruin i assumed we were halfway across the thirtymetre strip because he began checking ahead for bearings instead of behind it was easier in that direction pines stood sparsely at the fringe of a darker mass and the intervals between their trunks were irregular so that each had identity the lightning flashed and everything leapt sharply in it trees wire posts the rutted earth he caught his breath and stumbled the pathology of the gundependent is odd once armed he loses his fear even of things against which a gun is of no use spiders heights the elements he carries a magic talisman conversely deprived his fears are exaggerated the lightning struck twice again and flickered out and for a moment it was difficult to see we had both stopped the harz range stood fifty or sixty kilometres to the north but the storm had been drifting southeast and the thunder reached us in less than one minute i looked up and saw that the moon was now ten or twelve degrees of arc from the edge of the cloudmass i said we havent got long he moved again counting seven paces and checking the post was lined up with the fourth pine from the end but i used one of the wirestanchions as the closer reference because it was thinner and therefore more accurate he was taking his time and i began thinking it had been a mistake to throw the bloody thing away his confidence had gone with it look weve got about nine minutes visibility left so for gods sake get off the pot through his teeth you want me to blow myself up if itll get you off the pot halfway to the eastern wire my weight broke the crusty earth and one shoe slipped on the shoulder of something hard i said wait i made sure he stopped then bent down and felt the thing because i needed to know how good his bearings were the soil came away under my fingers and i went on clearing it until they could define the shape it was a curved shoulder and pitchsmooth and the detonator would be three or four inches to the right in the centre it would be at least a fourteenounce actuator otherwise the odd crow or some heavy rainfall would trip it so i finished the job and left the whole thing exposed it would be a help if i ever came back this way and if i didnt it would help someone else youre not very good i said are you it was just possible that hed deliberately taken me too close but i didnt think so even in his demoralized condition he must realize that hed catch some of the blast you shouldnt have done that his whisper was reedy with fright you shouldnt have taken me so bloody close there were two more changes of angle before we reached the wire and i took a final sighting with the military depot as a reference it looked closer than i would have believed the nerves had come farther than thirty metres he climbed through the wire more confidence in his movements now that we were clear of the mines and he could lead me to his friends and borrow a gun when hed gone five paces i said sharply what was that he turned his head and i did it and when he was down i looked for his papers all he had were an identity card and a crossword puzzle and i held my watchglass at an angle against the name to increase the lightfactor guhl recheck guhl i kicked a hole in the earth and buried the card and put the crossword puzzle into my coat as a flash came there were three more over a tensecond period and i kept still until they were over he lay in much the same position as benedikt but there were no bits of porcelain around just the scuffed earth i had waited until he had taken his last five paces so as to know the direction of the rendezvous it lay towards the group of pines and i started off the sound of the preliminary flash was already crackling and the rest of the series followed and sent a ricochet of echoes from the thuringerwald range to the southeast so that for longer than half a minute the sky and earth reverberated the dark came down soon afterwards sweeping from west to east across the land as the clouds reached and drew beneath the moon i should have made him push on faster through the mines instead of wetnursing him the rendezvous could be a kilometre from here and if i missed it the one fine thread would break or i should have let him take me further than those five paces but the trouble was that i couldnt stand his company a long flash broke a chaindischarge that went rippling across the dark mass of the trees and dusted them with greygreen light i froze and waited uneasy now because this was a patch of open ground where there was nothing higher than a clod of earth and anyone could pick me off with the other hand behind their back the thunder arrived within a few seconds at ground level the air was calm but a high windlayer was shifting the stormclouds at increasing speed then light flashed once and i wasnt ready for it because it didnt come from the sky it could have been the nerves i was stumbling blind across furrows and the spine was taking some of the shocks the trunk of the first pine loomed and i began crossing the gap to the next one i had overshot quite a bit and had to turn back and to the left before i saw it there was still ploughed earth underfoot so they must have brought it right to the deadend of the track i got in and said youd better get away quite fast because i kicked up some noise coming across the dashlamp threw a weird greenish glow on the drivers face he had his neck screwed round to look at me and i stared back at him what the hell did you have to flash your light for i said did you think i couldnt find you or something he didnt move but his eyes switched twelve inches to my left she asked from beside me where is he guhl crossing tomorrow night youll have to meet him her one question had been clipped and authoritative so i said just tell him to shove off will you theres two of them out there looking for the noise i made she told him wait for the next thunder kamerad oberst he faced the front what happened to guhl lightning flared and i was looking into bronze eyes their brilliance heightened by the flash then it was over but i had seen her face hard proud altered by the storm and my strangeness i was ordered across first the thunder shook the night and the engine started up and we were on the move before the echoes died away you want an intelligent report dont you you think he knows what the hells going on hes a clod you know that the track gave on to a metalled road within a hundred metres and we stopped bumping around how did you injure yourself she didnt miss much he hadnt switched the heads on yet and there was no backglare shed taken me all in just in the one flash the nailfile slipped we got into higher gear and now he switched them on so i hunched myself round a bit more to face her nightblack hair closecropped but not masculine pale lipstick if any a lean hard jawline the nose by michelangelo what do you imagine things are like in hanover with the benedikt thing just blown up i was lucky to get off with a stray one in the hand it was the sort of face youd expect to see at a nightrendezvous in the east german frontier zone if you expected to see a woman there at all anyway isaid wearily weve stopped the leak thats the main thing she kept her hands inside her battered flyingjacket perhaps she had a gun but i didnt think so one sharp word to the prussianheaded type at the wheel and hed swing one on me without even swerving hed called her oberst colonel she asked how far had it gone what the leak christ dont you know anything didnt neueburg keep you informed she didnt answer but i wasnt worried you dont set up a contact point thirty kilometres from a frontier without putting radio in i let the silence go on for a bit and then said ill tell you how far it had gone hed made contact twice we got the one in hanover and he went and did it again he knew how to try ill give him that much the scene was lit up around us and i had to shout against the din it was guhl who was sent in to fix him the second time at linsdorf i thought they were your orders through hanover if they werent yours then whose were they for gods sake she might have answered me given me a name a handhold but there was a flash so bright that it looked as if the whole sky had fused the headlights seemed to go out and the entire landscape went lichengreen and the thunder rolled between the hills with one longdrawnout bowlingalley clatter it was appropriate enough i was on my way to what london called the stormcentre and bloody parkis was right again the last lot had been tough on the eardrums because when it was quiet again i could barely hear the engine it was a threecylinder wartburg a homeproduct they described as a limousine along the unter den linden though along oxford street itd be a clappedout minicab where did they call you from she had a low and rather husky voice the kind people wish they could keep once their cold has gone it would have been attractive if every time she spoke i didnt expect her to tell the prussian to pull up and get in the back with us and bring his garotting tools berlin when too late as usual no bloody coordination i said in sudden frustration you know the trouble with die zelle its over organized its left hands so busy trying to find out what its right hands doing that it cant even feel the way along the wall i looked for reaction but she just watched me chin resting on the fleece collar of the jacket saying nothing either with her eyes or her mouth look at the hanover cell they didnt get on to benedikt till it was damned nearly too late and who did the job on stockener they werent too clever getting him alone in his car before they shoved it off the road made it twice as difficult and in the end it stank of foul play whats one west german military driver among friends who went soft i looked away from her and left it at that a lot of it didnt add up but that was all right id been called in late so i wouldnt be expected to know some of the answers i just wanted to show i at least knew some of the questions it was a long time before she spoke we passed one of the soviet garrison barracks a litter of twostorey hutments behind a picket fence with machinegun towers this side of the frontier there were twenty russian divisions and theyd been here twenty years did you talk to benedikt of course i talked to him poor bastard he was too good for this world you know that lightning came again but this time there was quite an interval before the thunder followed when the greenish glow brightened again on the faciaboard i took another sighting on the speedotrip wed gone twentyseven kilometres from the frontier due east most of the time and it couldnt be far now because the fuel was below a quarter and there wouldnt be a fillingstation open at night wed seen only two cars since wed got on to the wider roads south of mulhausen and there wasnt even an oilstreak along the nearside lane in the deutsche demokratische republik if you werent militaryor political you walked who was your controller in hanover i never even saw him they shot me straight in to locate benedikt and stop the rot id rehearsed it so many times that it seemed to make sense there were half a dozen other direct questions id rehearsed the answer to but now she threw one in that i couldnt hope to stop who was your controller in berlin because you might get away with not knowing the people youve been sent in to assist but if you dont know the name of your own controller at your own base theres something just a fraction odd in the picture i hitched myself round and looked at her and waited until she turned her head and then i said look i think youre old enough to know i havent been in east germany since the night in when i was holed up for six hours in the undercarriage of a converted bomber that was due out of leipzig with a cargo of antityphoid serum for berlin maybe you know how long ive been working for die zelle on the other side of the frontier and if you dont it doesnt matter but ill tell you this you may be one of the hierarchy at hq and i could trust you with my last wristwatch but the dreary fact of the matter is that until tonight i didnt know your face and i still dont know your name kamerad oberst so if its all the same to you im going to play it a bit coy when you throw questions like that one because if you dont know who my controller is in berlin i might be a fool to tell you there were gold flecks deep in the bronze but that was all just the play of light on living colour no offence of course when the eyes of two people meet and hold their gaze a silent conversation begins and when they are strangers there is a great deal to be said because their lives are a blank to each other but sometimes there is even more to be withheld and nothing of it must show and for some people it is difficult for the woman sitting close to me in the wartburg her face sometimes shadowed and sometimes lit by the storm it was easy she had spent her life withholding things which spoken even by the eyes could betray her she was a professional the kind you occasionally meet in the bitter and grinding course of a mission and wish you could perhaps have met in some better place and at some better time when life held more promise of being longer so that there was nothing in these honeyed tigers eyes at all and nothing as i knew in my own we shall be there soon she said and looked away the moon was behind cloud and the land dark from the distance the building made a honeycomb pattern of light as if a liner were moored there on still black water three men at the gates checked us in one carried a repeater rifle but wore no uniform i knew his type the blank face the attitude halfslack halfmilitary the air of unlimited power subordinate only to higherranking members of the same regime the secret police kamerad oberst the click of heels all i could see of the building was that it was modern a slab of raw concrete with the silhouette of ship lamps jutting on the skyline most of the windows were barred and i heard dogs somewhere the certainty was satisfying the thread had held and now i had come all the way this was the stormcentre the kommandantur of die zelle two plainclothes guards fell in as we climbed the steps but she dismissed them with a word and we went into the building alone two others met us and she sent for someone by name and we stood in a silent group until he appeared a complex of hooded spotlights casting our shadows across the floor she didnt look at me her head was turned away standing she was a slight figure even in the flyingjacket though taller than i had imagined she stood easily erect gloved hands behind her kamerad oberst a big man quiet on his feet his eyes dulled by the long absence of any need to think her neat head turned to look at him this man crossed tonight his name is martin take him to reception and search him strip him and search his body search the bandage particularly make certain there is no deathpill anywhere on him let him dress and then restrict his movements if he should kill himself before the heir direkior can interrogate him i shall hold you responsible she left us without looking back chapter fifteen kohn the passages were as wide as in any modern building in east germany and there were no other guards within sight but the place had the atmosphere of a penitentiary is this a school when they have dull eyes dont ask them what something is they wont tell you give them a bone the pleasure of correcting you this is the aschau asylum for the criminally insane the room where they took me seemed appropriate the big man went in first and the other followed me iron bed metal handbasin spotlights in a low ceiling there were a lot of these lights about the place all the better to see you with one window adequately barred a quarterinchsteel door with a continental doubleaction lock and a sliding grillepanel where they could look in to see what you were doing the escort stayed in the doorway and the big man became a mechanical valet she had said do this do that and now he did this did that the instructions had gone into his skull and the actions came out through his hands he searched me and stripped me and searched my body and searched the bandage particularly and made sure there was no deathpill on me then he let me dress and restricted my movements with a pair of military handcuffs arms behind because you can get through a vein with your nails if you work at it and shed warned him that he was responsible for me the other man stood near the door bouncing gently on his arches like a boxer fresh into the ring the nightstick looped to his wrist with a leather thong the bandage was difficult because some of the stitches had pulled probably when id tugged the edge of the wing clear of the tyre and the blood had congealed but we managed it in the end the other one right forearm was perfectly clean his dull eyes wandered over me and he kept turning me round and lifting my arms a simian frown of puzzlement forming slowly across his brow it would take time for someone like this to catch up with progress and i assumed he was wondering why there werent any bits of elastoplast here and there because in the old days it used to be all the rage you could pack a x microfilm and a flatmould cyanide dose under quite a small strip and still leave room for the handbook they went away they took the obvious things with them sheepskin coat papers for waiter martin papers for karl rodl striker statistics folder crossword puzzle i was worried about that even in the moonlight it had looked very like a plan of the minefield layout guhl had kept on him in case he wanted to check his bearings they had taken the coat because it was so thick you could secrete photostat copies in triplicate of the entire early warning system from mexico to nova scotia in a coat like that and because nitri had patched it so neatly and they wanted to know why they had taken the armsling id been given at the hospital because it would be possible for me to hang myself with it but they had left nitris scarf because it wouldnt i had only just finished checking the doorlock and the windowbars when they fetched me out and took me along to a small surgical ward where a doctor redressed my hand he was a civilized man and asked if there were anything i wanted so i said food they took me back to reception and after fifteen minutes a heavybreasted girl in brogues brought a tray and left it with me the big man unlocked the handcuffs and took them away with him it must have been on orders he would never have worked it out for himself that no one can eat with his hands behind his back no knife no fork nothing for surprise attack or selfinfliction i hadnt expected to be given them i hadnt expected to be given caviar either but there was a fairsized paper picnic plate full of the stuff spread for me on strips of buttered toast as neatly as youd spread ratpoison beer in a soft plastic cup it had to be a brainthink all the way because my last meal had been with benedikt the night before and i was already salivating if they wanted to kill me they could do it more cheaply than this way if they wanted me unconscious the same applied i hadnt been interrogated yet and they wouldnt learn much if i had to be carried to the grillingroom insensible or dead there was no effective drug in the oraladministration group that would force me to reveal what i didnt want to reveal provided the foregoing were acceptable the fifth consideration was decisive this stuff was high in protein fats and carbohydrates no value in the salt content but enough sugar in the beer to feed the muscles for a limited period i ate slowly they had taken away my watch to have it probed but by estimation it was an hour later when they came for me again that would make it approximately midnight i had been keeping a conscious check on the passage of time since the watch was taken it wouldnt be important for a while but i didnt know how things would go here and it might later be useful even vital to judge the coming of daylight they were the same two and they took me down to the main hall it seemed busy so late but some of the spotlights were out and people talked quietly three men were passing through the hall darksuited and preoccupied the members of a consultant body convening to discuss a recent autopsy it was what they looked like but they might have been anyone anyone important my escort stopped them and spoke to the one with the rebuilt face and he glanced at me and nodded and went on with his colleagues we will wait the big man said he looked as if hed waited all his life at some busstop where the road was closed other people went through some of them women with patient faces that looked at nobody else vidauban is very good at this with his interiors greytoned and peopled with dream figures that however crowded appear uninvolved with each other from somewhere higher in the building a sound reached us and i didnt want to think it was a human voice because a human voice ought not to sound like that quick footsteps and an interchange of words the big man said tonelessly we will go to the office of the herr direktor now it was a long room with a low acoustic ceiling and an internalcommunications complex on a desk black chairs with the east german equivalent of pvc upholstery and chrome legs an ebonite console on one wall with some of the panels illuminated from here they could probably diagnose a schizophrenic crisis in patient cell south block and prescribe shocktreatment they were the same three men but two of them said nothing and did nothing all the time i was there the one who spoke to me was the one with the rebuilt face sit down herr martin there was a spare chair but no one else came he sat behind the desk above him on the wall was the expected portrait of walter adolphovich ulbricht first secretary of the sozialistische einheitspartei deutschlands i will call you martin because that is the name we have known you by he put the two identity cards together and pushed them aside since you arrived in hanover from london i had never seen him before tonight but i recognized him now with only the face to go on it would gave been difficult the left eye was artificial but a perfect match and i wouldnt have suspected it if the original injury had been less massive the face on that side couldnt have been damaged to that extent without the eye going too the rebuilding had been beautifully done the surgeon was a portrait artist and it was the very excellence of his technique that showed the change one side of this mans face had continued to age and the new side was still young dorian gray and his portrait all in one do you know where you are ive got a rough idea you dont have secret police guarding the gates of an asylum for the criminally insane and you dont send a secret police colonel to pick up couriers at the frontier and bring them here if your sole business is to look after manic depressives this is aschau he wasnt interested in my rough ideas have you heard of it yes whererather quickly the big slob mentioned it one of the committee moved his head and i got the feeling that people werent meant to talk like that to the herr direktor he didnt seem to mind when youve caught a winged pigeon you must expect the odd drop of lime on your hand while you examine it aschau is in part a political reeducation centre i am its director my name is kohn have you heard of me no at aschau we receive people who stray from the marxistleninist line and we persuade them to rethink he watched me the whole time they all did what made you come here of your own volition i got the feeling i was straying a bit from the wilsonpowell line so i thought you could fix me up his eyes were stoneblue and expressionless the kind of eyes that looked through the glass at guineapigs dying of clinically induced cancer i will ask you that question once more he was sitting absolutely still but even so i knew i was right it wasnt of course kohn himself that i had recognized but someone else with these mannerisms and this tone of voice this way of sitting so absolutely still with the head a fraction on one side and a fraction forward the walk had been the same passing through the hall and if ever he uttered a laugh i knew what sort it would be but i didnt think kohn would ever laugh again even cynically you neednt have asked me at all i said i might as well play it straight and volunteer the information he already had i was sent out from london on a sabotageinvestigation job find out why the strikers are making holes all over the place he went on watching me and i left it at that because i didnt know how much the kamerad oberst had told him and even if theyve got a fistful of aces theres no point in playing your two of spades how much do you know of the political situation concerning the two germanies is there one i thought ulbricht had walled it up he never moved ever they might as well have stuck a computer in front of me except that i would have expected this degree of inhuman indifference in a computer in a live man it struck chill and i decided not to remember the sound id heard while wed been hanging around in the hall i assume you are close to whitehall more towards clapham really you decline to admit the extent of your political knowledge and connections no theyre nil thats all i mean but he wouldnt just accept that he was an east german and in east germany they scratched at their ideology till it bled if you told them there was a place called hyde park where you could stand on an orangebox and shout to hell with the government theyd send you to an asylum for the criminally insane perhaps that was why theyd brought me here he said fifteen months ago in his closing address to the eighth german party congress in berlin first secretary ulbricht took the preliminary steps towards the eventual reunification of germany since that time there have been overtures made in secret between the two republics bonn is expected shortly to withdraw its claim of being the capital of the only legal german state and this will be the signal for overt negotiations to reestablish germany under a central government whose leaders will be drawn from both sides he paused long enough to let me comment but i didnt say anything because either thered been a lot going on in both berlins while everyone else was busy with czechoslovakia or kohn was betting on sudden money you wouldnt find anyone in whitehall or clapham for that matter whod agree that overt negotiations would be the order of the day until the red flag was hoisted at the white house which didnt seem likely this century probably he was just trying to do what id done with the big slob make me correct him he put on the other side it is vital that those leaders of the new germanic state should be neither eastern lackeys of the soviet union nor western idolaters of the usa for some time there has been a growing need for the creation of a nucleus of potential government a consortium capable of assuming control of the new germany such a nucleus now exists die zelle and bloody parkis was right again he didnt know the details but hed made a blind swipe and come up with the general idea die zelle was not only existing it was in gear and on its way knocking out the opposition on the other side of the wire feldmarschall stockener and bundesminister von eckern et alia and crippling the military structure so that west germany would have to get out of nato and surrender any claim to a nuclear role by virtue of an effective air strikeforce otherwise the usa would want a lot of say in the election of the new german government kohn watched me i still didnt say anything hed told me just enough to pitch me into an argument if id had any political connections he knew very well that id grab at the chance he was giving me there were undercover factions in london whod ally themselves with die zelle if they knew what hed just told me and all id have to give him were their names it was no use making them up hed check them first id have to get out of aschau under my own steam or do the other thing you understand my motives in revealing as much as i have herr martin i was going to say yes but one of the lights on the wallconsole was winking and he flicked a switch on the internalcommunications complex the voice was very faint in the room it was one of those whorleddiaphragm speakers that focussed the output and beamed it towards a single listener when did he arrive its up to the listener to frame his own speech according to whether he wants anyone else in the room to understand kohn was indifferent if i ever left aschau it would be on his terms is schaffer with him it could be the schaffer theyd thrown out of east berlins humboldt university a month ago his paper had said that mans thought was the one thing beyond any form of applied philosophy for applied read enforced professor schaffer would be just the man for a bit of reeducation at aschau offer him caviar the faint voice went on for a bit and kohn said not unless it is essential then he cut the switch and looked at me i asked if you understood my motives heir martin the whole thing was genuine a man like this didnt have to frighten me with tricks theyd really brought someone in and he was going to have to fight for his sanity just as i was so i was getting worried and an idea was forming at the edge of consciousness the people up there who made inhuman sounds hadnt been brought to aschau because they were insane it was the other way round i said you want international support for die zelle you want me to ferret around the political sewers in london and recruit whatever rats i can find who are willing to work for an outfit thats trying to set up the kind of germany we had to cut into two so that it couldnt do any more damage but the kind of new germany that we all want its own people included isnt going to be set up on the dead bodies ot men like stockener and von eckern and the thirtysix pilots that die zelle has murdered so far and it isnt going to be run by people especially qualified to direct a political reeducation centre using an asylum for the criminally insane as a front if youd like me to elaborate on that ill do it but i think you get the point one of the other two men moved again uncomfortably they reminded me of guhl the man who had liked marzipan he had been gundependent these two were kohndependent your thinking is wrong herr martin but we may decide at a later date to correct it for you at aschau we hold the view that every man is valuable and that it requires only a little adaptation to put his values to good use meanwhile i will ask you to give me full information on the character functions and personnel of the organization controlling you oh come on be your age i was getting fed up you must remember that this is a reeducation centre we are giving you the opportunity of telling us what we require to know without first undergoing reeducation it would save time im in no hurry perhaps you underestimate our persuasive abilities no i should say theyre pretty good then why decline to do something voluntarily that you will eventually do under duress surely that is a little unrealistic i got out of the chair hed given me a lot of info and i wanted to think about it undisturbed and if i stayed here arguing the toss i might forget some of the details that i would need to fit into the pattern before i handed it to ferris one fine day it never does any good to consider that the only fine day youll ever get is this one its no go i said they all watched me i took a look at the other two but they werent interesting kohn said perhaps i can be of help to you by repeating i dont need help in your position any man would be glad of it but not every man not this one i was trying to make him specify if i could get some idea of the actual method it would give me a chance to prepare myself and start combatting it before it began in london theyd put the suffix against my codename because id twice proved reliable under torture and although id stuck it out on those two occasions by the doubtful virtue of sheer bloody pigheadedness it had been norfolk training that had saved me in the end and a lot of the norfolk training deals with the efficacy of psychological preparation if you can find out what kind of thing youre going into youve got a chance of containing the natural fear while youre still fit and in full possession so that when the breath speeds up and the skin goes cold the mind can be released from the worst fear of them all of the unknown i must accept your decision he said still wouldnt name it thank you now tell them to heat up the irons he pressed a switch but i couldnt hear anything it was probably a lightsignal outside the room he said indifferently our methods here at aschau are not those of the spanish inquisition you will not be molested in any way of course nevertheless you will shortly give us the information required that is quite certain the big man came in and kohn stood up when we left which was civil of him it was now well after midnight by mental reckoning and most of the building was quiet but sometimes i heard voices and a crack of light showed under some of the doors as i was taken along the passages it might have been cambridge a few people still talking in their rooms but it was aschau and i didnt like it because you cant correct a mans thinking unless you molest him and kohn said you could and he ought to know hed done it before and was doing it now to the man whod made that sound up there and you can only keep the suffix until you meet someone who knows how to take it away from you and i believed that kohn knew how he was already applying the worst fear of them all of the unknown they had doublelocked the steel door and i was alone they didnt like you to have access to sharp things here and the beaker above the handbasin was made of soft plastic i turned on a tap but it didnt work so i tried the other one but that didnt work either like everything else in east germany the plumbing was shoddy then i realized this was wrong thinking just as kohn had said it was mere prejudice the plumbing was perfectly all right and i knew why he was so certain that i was going to tell him all he wanted to know chapter sixteen ordeal the scorpion trapped will sting itself to death estimation it would be five days before they dragged me out of here with my tongue rattling then kohn would put his questions and i wouldnt say anything and they would bring me back and leave me alone for another twelve hours and then drag me out again and i wouldnt say anything and they would go on doing it until it became humiliating i would avoid that humiliation there were various ways the window was glazed on the outside of its recess and the bars were inside and level with the wall but i could just reach far enough to smash the glass and get hold of a splinter and use it the actual flow would take time because of the dehydration and they might be quick getting to me but the chance was good if i went for both wrists and the groin the two blankets on the bed were made of processed cellulose pulp stitched inside loosespun fibre that didnt have any weave to it and even if i could make strips the knots wouldnt hold enough to bear my weight the bed its self was fixed to the wall with masons ragbolts and the handbasin was metal but they hadnt thought of everything because the electric light worked and when i was ready i could just about bridge the distance between the lamp and the basin a thumb pressed into the bayonet and a bare foot on the waterpipe the other ways might work but i didnt spend too much time thinking about them because they werent certain the hand will do what its told to do and bloodletting and electrocution depend on voluntary manipulation but in a deliberate backward fall with the neck angled the body itself will try to survive we only have to trip and the hand goes out at once five days before they thought i looked ready seven or eight before i had to pull the chickenswitch that was a long time and there might be something i could do as an alternative from going slowly mad with thirst but i didnt think so theyd got it all worked out and i wasnt the first one to look round this room and see in everyday things the potential instruments of death the air was cold and i checked the radiator it had lost most of its heat and the tap was open so it looked as if they turned off the main system about midnight the unit held something like twelve litres of water but the octagonal unions and blankingplugs were encrusted with paint and it would need a cm spanner to loosen them so i would have to forget it i stripped off most of my clothes and dumped them on to the bed for a pillow the thing was to work out a compromise between staying too warm and getting too cold normal bodyheat produced invisible sweat and i had to hold on to all the fluid i could excess cold would drive the blood from the surface and stimulate the kidneys into producing urine muscular effort would have to be cut to a minimum but that called for another compromise there was just a chance that when they came in here again they might make a silly mistake and leave me an opening and i wouldnt be able to take it if the muscles were slack from disuse the physical setup was all right except that the shockdose of saline in the caviar and beer was already drying the mouth they had cut down the timefactor by a couple of days but the problem wasnt only physical denied fluid the body will slowly shrivel to a point where it can no longer support life but between the onset of thirst and final desiccation there is the effect on the mind the resolves i was capable of making now could be maintained only so long as i stayed sane they were relying on two things one that i would be brought to the stage where i would sell the bureau for a glass of water no go we are prepared at any time to do what the scorpion does two that i would lose my reason and become a gibbering traitor and of this i was afraid the bureau and all of those men whose safety depended on the law that secrecy was sacrosanct would remain safe in my keeping until the moment came when sanity was threatened before then and in good time i would have to blot it all out but i was afraid because no man knows when his reason goes once it has gone he can no longer reason the north light came grey from the winter sky through the glass that would soon be smashed my one task for the day was to find out if the room were miked because i didnt want them to hear my movements i found it behind a section of wallpaper just below the ceiling and i tore a wad of pulp from one of the blankets and stuffed it into the gap never destroy a mike it can sometimes be used to carry false information the thirst was a worry now and at some time before noon i found myself at the basin making sure the taps were turned on someone might be stupid enough to open the main cock outside the room i hadnt planned to check on this but it seemed all right a natural thing to do there was some activity in the afternoon some cars arrived and once i heard a shout as if someone were trying to run free there was no shooting but the dogs barked a lot just afterwards their sound was faint and it reached me through the building not through the window so i assumed they were in kennels somewhere at the rear the big man came when the light began fading i was prone on the bunk when he looked through the grille he opened the door and stood there while the heavybreasted girl in brogues came in with a waxed picnicplate she didnt look at me but just put it carefully across the corner of the basin and went out there was something about her attitude that gave me the impression that she was afflicted perhaps deafmute they were saltbeef sandwiches so it wasnt any good trying to press the moisture out i didnt even hide them under the bed unlike thirst hunger is containable in the late evening i got up to make sure the taps were on but didnt actually do it this time the willpower was coming into its own at this stage the body had at last recognized that things were serious theyd no more let someone stupid turn on the water from outside than theyd let him unlock the door i would have to stop thinking wrongly i rechecked before putting the light out possibility of forcing the metal basin away from the wall and using the brackets or the basin itself to lever the bars apart possibility of straining the ragbolts of the bunk and climbing on it to reach the ceiling and break through the lathes and plaster this was the third floor and there was no supportscaffolding outside the window so the bars werent too important there would be nothing higher than the raised width of the bunk to swing up on so a hole in the ceiling wouldnt do any good the microphone however muffled would bring them here to see what i was doing before midnight by mental reckoning they came and woke me from fitful sleep one stood near me with the blackjack the other stayed in the doorway and poured water slowly from a jug into a glass and slowly drank it i turned away as soon as i saw the idea but the sound brought sweat on me wasting my reserves impotence expressed itself in anger surprisingly fast and i had to relax consciously so that i couldnt swing round on them and attack any effort of that sort would use up moisture and that was what they wanted but when they had gone i couldnt sleep again for a long time because of the sound of the water hallucinations began towards the end f the second day most of them aural sometimes they came to the door and opened the grille and poured water for me to hear but sometimes i knew they werent there only the noise because the grille was shut my tongue was shrinking now the mouth a husk one difficulty was in trying not to review the bodily processes that i knew were going on movement could be controlled and i spent most of the day prone under the window where it was coldest but breathing had to go on and i knew that every breath was passing moisture from the lungs to waste it on the air inactivity and the visual monotony of the walls and ceiling were inducing sleep and i forced wakefulness and concentrated on keeping tidal respiration to a minimum they came again at midnight one filled the glass and offered it to me and i took it at once the body was avid and the mind careless then i smelt petrol and threw it against his face but he was expecting it and ducked and the glass smashed on the wall of the passage outside later i knew they had devised the stratagem so that i should be made to see the glass being offered it i wouldnt turn away as i had before i had been made to see the cool liquidity of what i believed was water and the fact that it was petrol made no difference because i saw it still as they knew i would shimmering in the dark against my eyes and it had no smell and it was drinkable infinitely desirable by the evening of the third day i was ready the initial shockdose of saline had advanced the physical process critically and even though inactive even though for most of the time inert i had passed more than a gallon of moisture through the skin and lost an added amount from the lungs the mental process had been advanced by the sight and sound of liquid and by the presence of the taps over the basin today i had had to tear the picnicplate into halves and cover the taps so that they were hidden because every time i woke it was there that i looked i was ready this evening because earlier i had seen a damp patch forming on the wall below the metal basin and heard water trickling realizing that it was a leak i began gougingat the plaster but found it was dry perfectly dry memory came back from the far side of the miracle pipes that are empty cannot leak the body could go on for days before it died but the time was shorter for the mind there had been seven hallucinations during last night and today three of them visual and the stage was approaching when i would tell them look theres water on the wall his name is parkis head of whitehall and it would seem reasonable to tell them reason being gone the danger was in proportion to the stake you can gain more with less to lose the stake was the bureau in the afternoon i had pulled the wad clear of the microphone and crushed the diaphram the basin was difficult because i had lost a third of my strength but one of the brackets came away with it and it was a bracket i wanted the pipes were plastic not lead it took an hour to free the bracket from the basin flexing the bolt until it snapped it was a poor weapon but the value of any weapon is increased when its the only one you have there was of course no chance of success none they always come in pairs and were armed and there were others in the building and the building was itself under guard barbed fencing whiplamps dogs but what i had to do for prides sake before i turned to the final act of blotting it all out was draw blood by midnight they hadnt come an hour ago the grille had been opened and closed i had been standing within three feet of it close enough to conceal the wall where id wrenched the basin away but they didnt come in and for this hour i had tormented myself because i could have waited against the door and driven the bracket through the grille an eye for a withered tongue with luck a death for a death the central heating had gone off the pipes ticked as they contracted the water cooling water cool water i left the light burning so that i could see objects that were real in the dark i could see only fountains shining in an hour they came opening the door quietly without first looking through the grille the lock turned so slowly that i had to put my hand against the panel and feel the movement of the mechanism afraid that i imagined it when he came in i used my bracket from left to right and starting low to drive upwards and across in a gouging swing to the face and saw surprise and heard his breath snatching as his head jerked back but the swing travelled on and struck nothing and i was offbalance and he knew it and hooked my leg behind the knee the ceiling span somewhere the brain cool analytical computerquick wryly reminded the poor fool body that fast action following prolonged inertia was crippled at the start but we must do our best he knew his locks we were down and he worked for my throat and i knew how weak i was but he was worried and trying to speak and i wouldnt listen because they always lied salt petrol scissors now but he broke it and we rolled over and i worked for the throat again my left hand flaring the wound pulling open rage moving my hands unscientifically and the knee coming up and missing freund and trying again and missing as he brought his arm across and t felt the lock coming on freund he grunted again the light circled they always lie the lights flashed and i was under and water trickled near me and his breath was sawing and i could do nothing trickling he moved very fast and i looked up at him he stood warily watching water soaked into my hair it was chill on my scalp he was holding a flask it had fallen when we went down spilling he nodded holding the flask for me to take i got up the bracket had been lost and i swung an empty hand at the flask but he drew it back surprised i stood swaying in the tilting walls and heard warning that i should consider reassess brainthink trying to overcome the animal need to injure the enemy draw his blood carefully he held the flask towards me again and i considered there was no petrol smell this man was alone they had always come in pairs the flask was not empty because some had spilled on the floor puddling beside my head he nodded holding the flask i turned away my left hand was growing heavy the bandage filling i moved as far as the window and he followed i could hear him my breath was like blades in my throat you must drink he said and i turned and he was holding the flask i shook my head he looked surprised belief began belief in water but if it wasnt if i tried to drink and found it wasnt i didnt know what i would do i would rather not try not know he seemed to understand and raised the flask and drank holding it at a distance from his mouth so that i should see that it wasnt a trick drops ran down his chin and he wiped them away he nodded again it was an army flask feltcovered metal with a strap for hitching to the belt i took it from him and slopped the water into my mouth and tasted it and closed my eyes and drank till there was no more he seemed to have some small authority because there was a guard in the hall and he told me to wait and went down the last flight of stairs speaking to the guard who turned and went along the lower passage a door closed in the distance the building was quiet naked bulbs burned but the spotlights were dark in a whitewalled cellar he threw a highvoltage switch and led me to the top of some steps and into the chill night air is there more i asked more water i had emptied the flask but the thirst raged it had been like a raindrop on a hot coal later theres no time now there were bushes their leaves black against the sky the moon swam beyond curdled cloud hs stood close to me gripping my arm listen go through the fence do it quickly the current is off but i must switch it on again soon then go across the ploughed field to the far side go straight across and hurry he pushed me forward the earth was frosty under my feet i shook with cold the field was wide and i lurched on letting the weight of my body force me across the ruts i was free but afraid it might not be true just as i had been afraid that it might not be water but the sky was above me and i was alone it began when i was halfway across the distant clamour of alarmbells voices and the cry of dogs light swept the trees at the far border of the field surely i should have learned by now that they always lied chapter seventeen the grave the thin beams of the whiplamps pencilled across the trees the balls had stopped but the dogs voiced their excitement knowing that they would soon be released because that was what the sound of the bells had always meant perhaps kohn had altered his decision or his advisers in neueburg linsdorf hanover had counselled him that martin had been operating alone with no backup cell and was a subject for quick despatch rather than interrogation the chill of the earth seeped into me i lay face down a car and then another drove fast to the gates their sound shifting from left to right behind me they were military vehicles heavyengined and the earth flickered under the sidewash of their searchlights the policy would be circumspect a reason forwarded to the relevant authority in the sozialistische einheitspartei deutschlands a politically dangerous enemy of the state shot while attempting to escape the heavy engines raced the wheels losing grip on frostpatches men shouted boots rang on metal footplates i began crawling forward along my rut go to him and give him water and then set him running across open land then alert the guards make him trust you or he may go for cover and we dont want difficulties for three nights the moon had been bright through the window but now a nimbus layer filtered its light and at moments the land was almost dark if i got up and ran for cover they might not see me but i suspected the thought it could be the onset of panic more vehicles were on the move i need not go now in the direction he had told me but it was the nearest cover they would know i was going there to the trees on the far edge of the field but if i took another direction they would find me sooner their lights were already closing in at the flank i crawled faster men shouted to each other in the frosty night then panic came and all i knew was that my hands clawed earth away from under me and pain began spreading from their fingers into my arms as the hard clods broke away and the smell of moisture rose the sound was the worst the innermost core of reason remote from the tumult of disordered thought heard an animal burrowing there is cunning of a kind in panic earth was falling across my back across my legs my hands shovelled at it hurrying to make a grave for the living the only sounds now were the grunt of my own breath and the scrabbling of my own hands no one was near and this was my world here in the middle of ploughed land and there was work to be done the quarry to be buried so that the hunters should be deceived as they swung their lights and looked for a running man and gave no thought for worm or mole or this lowly beast whose only shelter was the earth pain swamped my senses and i was lying still drowning in an ebb and flow of light and dark while the bellows of my lungs reminded me that something was yet alive here its breath rasping in the hollow of night then brilliance swept overhead and lit the ridge of clods my hands had churned it swept again and i shut my eyes and the panic that had moved me to frenzy now held me paralysed clear thought began the situation was reviewed there was nothing more to do the final decision would now be made by circumstance by the direction of their lights and the ability of their eyes and the line of their reasoning they had hunted me before and knew how best to go about it but their very confidence could count against them the earth went bright went dark the engines throbbed they turned and backed sweeping the ploughed area with light turning and driving on again to probe the trees then they sounded to be more distant and the field was dark and i moved now because the threat in the air had become active and this danger was the worst the barking had changed in tone and was more widespread they would have given them my coat to scent the ruts ran in the direction i had first taken away from the asylum and towards the thickest of the trees i knew a road was there the whole of the ploughed area was ringed but there was no light showing ahead of me and i scattered earth as i rose and moved at a lurching trot pitching twice the horizon spinning moving on and once halting in an attempt to steady my legs control them it was the uneven ground that was all the uneven ground youre far from gone get on the baying was behind me now and closer light arced across the land to my left and fixed on the low scrub there the beam appeared to be bouncing but it was my own movement the ground was bad for running the frost had crusted the surface and my feet broke through and were caught by the soft earth beneath i went down again and lay where i fell listening to the dogs awareness of their danger blunted by the bodys reluctance to get up and go on it wanted to lie here with its pain and hunger and thirst to sleep so as not to feel them the dogs must be under the leash still their handlers making sure it was a true scent before they slipped them certain of a kill they were close now i was moving again in a drunken run for the dark for the trees brilliance flooded the fields edge and i saw figures grouped mens voices mingled with the crying of the dogs somewhere near the trees i fell again one shoulder hitting the metalled surface of a road it was very dark here but the shape of the car was visible massive above me i had nearly run into it it had been waiting here with its lights off so that i wouldnt see it one of its doors swung open she said get in chapter eighteen helda my head was against the floor we crawled in the dark and then stopped backing and waiting the sound of the dogs was muffled by the bodywork we turned and there was faint light i heard the snatch of the universals under the floor voices called then we accelerated and turned at speed pulling up suddenly the dogs were far away we started off and settled down to cruising on our way back to the asylum this was a definite move a decision writing off all the uncertainties and my brain was satisfied and let oblivion come how long have i been out half an hour i hadnt moved my head was still on the floor i moved and lightning struck through me i waited before trying again i asked where are we near mulhausen youre lying you always lie i moved again my teeth clenched faint light was inside the car pulsing she got out and opened the door at the back and i felt her hand supporting the side of my head she knew her stuff the head is the heaviest bit when youre trying to get off the floor its as bad as a ball and chain i dont want your bloody help she went on helping me so i put a lot of effort into it because i wanted to do it for myself millhausen was nowhere near the asylum it was towards the frontier the lying bitch i was sitting on the seat head lolling about she was trying to keep my head still so that i could drink she had a flask they always brought you a flask before they put you through the mincer after three days they were suddenly lousy with the things but i drank its empty she said when id finished as if i didnt know but i suppose she said that because i was still hanging on to it where are we near mulhausen she said carefully towards the west german frontier leave that alone she was trying to find the end of the bandage among all the mess it was humiliating i pulled my hand away clench it she said keep it clenched youve been losing blood what the hellve you brought me here for give the dogs a longer run the light from the dashboard had stopped pulsing she was watching my face how long can you hold out a long time i was thirsty thats all who are you my name is helda i mean who are you but one or two pointers were presenting themselves for my inspection when i had got into the car shed crawled in the dark at first so by the time shed put her lights on shed have been some distance from where the dogs were milling about at the end of the scenttrack then shed backed and waited floodlighting the field keeping up the search like the rest of them then shed driven off hard for the next searcharea the water was cold in my stomach my whole body was drinking there i said youll be missed by now better shove on she was watching me attentively when did you last eat she knew when id last eaten three days ago maybe she didnt nothing since then you think i fancy saltbeef sandwiches im used to caviar the bronze eyes lit and softened and suddenly she looked as she had when id thought about her as a change from thinking about blotting it all out it was relief that was all i was a mess but it sounded as if the inside of my head was still operating and obviously there were things we had to do drink this plastic bottle what is it glucose and milk i took it and she unscrewed the top compared with the water the milk was warm shed had it in the pocket of her flyingcoat while i drank slowly she left me and got behind the wheel i climbed out and dumped myself in the front beside her partly to see if i could do it and partly so we wouldnt have to shout but she didnt say anything until we were through mulhausen and into the minor roads im taking you to the frontier out on a limb arent you its my affair shivering had set in and she noticed it i couldnt bring your coat no the doghandlers had it i still heard the baying and would hear it for a long time delayed shock was trying to start but it wouldnt have much luck because i was too interested in what was going on after a while i said we havent got long it wasnt just bad organization she said my duty was to pick up guhl they were waiting for his report on the benedikt situation i couldnt do anything except hand you over i couldnt even talk in the car because of the driver i could only plan to get you away as soon as i could do it that should have been much sooner but the sky was clear until tonight and they would have got you before youd gone a yard im sorry youre taking a chance even now but its at least a chance she drove deftly her nerves showed only in the way she spoke a few brief phrases broken by short intervals of silence i said who are you with no one you would know we had a cell established in zagreb i waited but that was all i couldnt ask anything else because it wouldnt be ethical and anyway she wasnt going to tell me anything more than we would both need to share for the sake of security but i thought i had it thered been someone in zagreb recently whod had to do a bunk and it had stirred things up a lot two people had shown up in london soon afterwards and wed vetted them in case they had any value for the bureau all wed learned was that the zagreb base was blown and that three of their regional cells were cut off it happens a lot its bound to it cant happen to the established networks the american cia has a hundred thousand personnel and you could drop a multimegaton buster down their chimney and no one would get cut off anywhere because their outfit is fully diversified but there are thousands of pintsized privateenterprise groups working the clock round from leningrad to lisbon and they havent resources wide enough to cushion the crunch if it comes you did pretty well i said no we i mean its not everyone who can fix up a secretpolice cover and live too long i didnt want her to explain how pretty well she hadnt done it can happen to the best of them theyve nowhere to go once their base is blown and the best of them just go on operating in the hope that somehow they can bring it off alone but they cant do that if they come down to the broken reeds among their number people like benedikt we were cut off she said and there was a sag in her voice because she was only now recognizing the defeat that shed refused to face before it can happen to anyone but why send a man like him to a place like hanover when you had at least two other people right inside london she looked at me and away again i was knowing too much that wasnt awkward it was just embarrassing she said in a moment i couldnt trust them that fitted benedikt had broken but he hadnt sold out hed left them safe but you didnt drop the idea i mean of calling on london it wasnt the first time a group had signalled for help a lot of them were the nuclei of resistance cells and refugee organizations and even though times had changed and the hot war had gone cold they were still of the generation that once had nothing to sustain them in the twilight of the attics and the cellars and the boardedup cupboards but the voice among the static prefaced by the four notes of the vsign this is london but it was the first time my own bureau had mounted a mission and sent out an agent within hours of a contact we get a lot of contacts and most of them are duff but just as soon as lovett tipped us off about an imminent striker crash i was lying on my back on top of a chalk quarry with that very aeroplane performing overhead and thered been nothing to go on lovett himself hadnt known who the contact was i suppose people loathe parkis because hes always so bloody right she said if london couldnt do anything youd tell me now wouldnt you yes we were running through flat country a few hedgerows and then nothing but the far horizon the car slewed sometimes across frost but she held it well enough it wasnt bad organization she said and i knew she was worried about it they must have gone to have another look at you soon after youd left i was counting on at least one hour before that happened we couldnt look im here and im not thirsty any more well for gods sake all right did you send benedikt across on a specific mission or was he just meant to check on the hanover cell he was to take over the striker operation of course so hed known when the next one would crash and had told lovett i said can you fill me in on kohn the roads were narrower here and the tarmac was broken in places the terrain was taking on the wasteland look of the frontier zone distinguished flying record the iron cross as a lieutenant he was cut off after a crashlanding near poznan a year later and taken prisoner by the soviet troops in that area he never saw his family again and he didnt know at the tune that his wife was killed in the bombing of cologne when they released him he began working for privileges as a procommunist why didnt he go back before he could have there was a child wasnt there she said reflectively i think it may have been his pride or oh i see yes at that time his face would have been still in the healing stages and frightening to a small boy we began slowing and she switched to lowbeam the dark mass of pines loomed on our left and at its fringe were the trees i had memorized as markers on our way across time was so short i said youre going straight back as soon as i know youre through safely she slowed to a crawl and drove on sidelights between hedges of thorn theyll have widened the search by now and ill join them i didnt ask what the risk was she would have been absent for two hours i said who are the people we have to deal with the ones at the top with kohn there are others gross langmann and schott langmann is based in east berlin the others are at aschau langmann whats his cover secretary of trade agreements in the sed theyre the allhighest those four if they were brought down she said the whole of die zelle would collapse she turned off the sidelights before the thorn gave way to scrubland and we went forward at a walkingpace through the faint light from the sky she said kohn gross and schott go by road to berlin once every month for conference with the political reeducation secretariat they are normally escorted by one military vehicle oh really i tried she said of course there are only three of us and theres so little we can do aschau is a network of microphones and every second man is an informer youve done well enough to survive aschau was a chinese box within an asylum for the criminally insane was the legitimate but undercover political reeducation complex within that die zelle within that heldas group a potential detonator survival isnt enough its kept open the way in you know that she cut the engines and we coasted bumping over rough ground where the track ended then we stopped i said if my people decide to have a go theyll want to look over aschau i mean as well as fix the convoy on the berlin run there might be some confusion when it all hots up so well have to arrange a codeintro we couldnt see much of each other now because the facia lamp was out we spoke more quietly might you be there she asked no its not in my field in a moment she said what is your name quiller slowly she said quiller tell them we shall use that all right we shall use the english pronunciation yes there were a few german words that would sound similar if the u were spoken as v we were accommodating visually to the dim light and i could see the dark shape of her mouth and the glow of her eyes i could feel her warmth i said youll have been absent for two hours how big is the risk its calculated kohn would give the orders and they would arrange it discreetly and the glow and the warmth would be gone come across with me now youd be given immediate asylum she moved her head looking through the windscreen at the distant posts where the wire ran no it would mean letting them down my friends and if your people decide to go over there i shall try to have material available documents rosters everything theyll have come for she looked at me again i tried to get your papers back and the keyplan of the mines it wasnt possible i took bearings the chill air flowed in as i opened my door go straight back i shall wait until i know sharply i said theres no point if i make a mistake therell be nothing you can do go straight back very well looking in at her i said we met late didnt we yes i shut the door and began walking i was more than halfway across before the tension got so bad that i had to rest the danger was in the need to concentrate there comes a time when the mind refuses further discipline and argues that luck will get you through marksmen at the range find that their aim deteriorates after a certain point and they put it down to fatigue but it isnt the whole answer there was no deliberate intention to rest suddenly i was lying on my back face to the curdled clouds eyes closed my nervous reserves already plundered i lay down without caution not caring whether or not my head was blown off eyelids flickering posts and stanchions a forest of them reaching to infinity charred shadows against the ashen frost lgrr i silcbt bearing nd post left of guardhut to line with right edge of ruin spaces to bearing nd stanchion from st post left of central bush to line with tree paces to bearing the earth cold against my back my spine a perfectly articulated thread of life lying at an unknown angle among perfectly ordered points of potential death a man seeking on ancient principle his own survival men seeking by remote artifact his extermination who are you quiller i mean who are you this bit of gristle cast up in no mans land where no man safely goes nursing a bandage full of blood and the high ambition of crawling through a wire where the cows come to scratch their backs and where the hemispheres of the planet earth divide the sky flickering get up get on your bloody feet rtlf slcb to bearing keep still poor sod still reference shifting second marker seventh series had t doubled there was no tree there before rcheck and make four paces youd not think it were worth it would you voices low assimilate new situation and discount alien markers and proceed prominence watch it fed it feel its edge stone it had brought the sweat out hes not the only one thats tried it must be bad over there the gleam of their guns to line with left edge of guard hut paces but i was weakening now and the second marker swayed and i couldnt get a true fix on the background reference but it was no good flaking out again because the next time id fall on top of one and i didnt want that all i wanted was sleep come on son youll do it yet i suppose so i suppose so bearing the hiss of the frost underfoot paces the wire the barbs bent under with pliers now dont fall over theres no need are you are you blokes rhine army christ hes english one of them caught me chapter nineteen final approach they put me in the back of their jeep and one of them slung his greatcoat round me they were already calling up base as we drove off the wind cut cold i shouted against it i left a car here can i pick it up you what they talked together you cant drive it because we cant authorize you see and we cant drive it because no one can authorize us get it so i should just sit tight and look happy we shant be long they were in good spirits it wasnt often they picked anyone off the wire at the baor unit a captain questioned me and went into his office next door to use the phone i could hear most of it through the pinewood partition a very odd bod indeed thorough bad shape but lucid enough h mister bates there a corporal brought me a cup of tea i dunno frankly he wants to talk to someone in hanover yes thing is do we let him i burnt my lips but went on drinking just to feel the heat the corporal was passing on the news somewhere outside hes in there now caught him on the strip eh no english honest fair enough well hold him for you boots in the passage thomson sir bring some tea for this chap soon as you can hes got some sir fair enough the door opened you can phone hanover but we have to listen in that do you he took me into his office and i gave him the number we waited for the connection tall clean pinkfaced very interested a boyish smile the last customer we had was two months ago i mean a live one that was how they must come to see the strip as a wire where birds perched some of them falling when the phone rang he used the extension watching me the whole time as i talked sapphire needle he listened for bugs all right i said company third party this end understood im in baor bucholz get me out will you this time of night he was giving himself time to think the rhine army wouldnt pick anyone up unless they were right in the zone wake people up i told him yes which way are you facing home he wanted to know if i were going across or coming back the young captain tapped my arm its getting a little obscure im afraid ill have to ask you to all righti said anything for me ferris was asking practically the lot oh yes he was very good at not sounding galvanized anything for london not yet i ought to give them at least a rough look stuff london just get me out i want one more day where linsdorf do i need smoke out no we fixed that the captain reached across and cut us off his smile was rather strained i do apologize but you see my position most of that was in verbal code and ive already stuck my neck out letting you phone at all i gave him the receiver i appreciate that the heat was off now and the need for sleep was urgent appreciate it a lot dont worry therell be no kickback up to ferris the rest of the night thats fine but the thing is you could be commander crabb or someone hes got brown eyes didnt you know they woke me just before dawn and i let them take me along to the sickbay to get the hand restitched theres not so much room left for making new holes thats the trouble what have you been doing i had to go on all fours for a bit taking pots were they the mo laughed gustily they all knew where the very odd bod had been it was a routine patrol unit and i was as good as the telly the captain took me back to his office well im not quite sure whats going on but weve had a call through and my orders are to release you and offer limited facilities he sounded frustrated he wasnt averse to letting me go but he realized that he would never know who it was who had gone perhaps youd give me some idea as to what facilities you need i didnt ask for much some biscuits a dufflecoat some petrol and a ride in the jeep as far as the ruined military depot the m was still there stuck in the bush and they filled the tank while i scraped the frost off the windscreen the tank had been split on the blind run from neueburg and i didnt want to go dry i made sure the engine would start before i let them go then while it warmed i stood looking east across the wire and the flat grey land beyond the light seeped from a cold sky and there were crows about it was morning and i had a warm coat with biscuits in a pocket and i hoped the night had gone well for her as it had gone for me the front wing rattled but the roads smoothed out when i cleared the zone and headed north towards linsdorf clive this is george listen somethings come up and wed rather like your help well apparently theres one of those chaps you know struck a spot of trouble in western germany yes names martin and hes officially attached to the accidents investigation branch working at an airbase called linsdorf now this is what seems to have cropped up you listening hard i ate the biscuits slowly a crumb at a time number three this is beacon nine will you be in bonn tonight well youll see general schmidl obviously subject an englishman walter martin has become wanted for murder since early hours this morning all we need is that the good herr general is tipped off that his kp branch is wasting its time martin was not repeat not responsible theyll thus avoid unproductive search tactics mm if it could be done officially i wouldnt be asking you would i no were relying on schmidls confidence in our integrity and that should suffice finally if the kriminalpolizei require the said martin as witness at a later date we guarantee his availability now ill give you what details i have my left hand was no more than numb beneath its fresh analgesic dressing i had slept for nearly three hours at the rhine army unit but there was a certain amount of natural dope trying to put me out again because i was still about twelve hours on the debit side i kept all the windows down liebermann i have some confidential information for you i can give you nothing of its source but i would suggest that you accept it as most reliable further i would invite you to take such action as will become clear to you when you know the facts please listen to me carefully neueburg lay to the east now and i passed the turning making directly north soon afterwards i saw a cruising police patrol and felt gratitude to ferris my journey to linsdorf and my business there would have been impossible or at best very difficult in smoke conditions but the heat had been turned off martin and i could go where i pleased it was one of the things a director in the field was expected to do for his agent but i felt good about ferris because there were those who wouldnt have kept upthe pressure on london until something was done i approached linsdorf just before am a striker sk was going into circuit after takeoff and the smell of kerosene tainted the draught from the windows he was in a bad way even before i told him his nerves in his eyes couldnt keep still the short laugh more cynical than ever we were wondering where youd gone he said in this kind of confrontation they are not always so vulnerable and it surprised me but it was too late to change tactics and i whipped it on him right away ive been at aschau we were alone in his quarters i had noted his service revolver among some gear on a chair and i was standing where i could block him if he went for it reaction wasnt total i hadnt expected it to be all he knew now was that i was a bit more than an aviation psychologist attached to the aib head tilted a degree sideways and a degree forward he knew who i was not he didnt know who i was yes i said die zelle is finished but of course he would need more than that he would want proof kohn gross langmann schott all of them finished total reaction now much earlier than id expected because he still didnt have any proof but within half a minute i hardly recognized him the shock had aged his face and sharpened its resemblance to his fathers thank god he said i had to think about that the unexpected was coming up all the time and i tried to recognize familiar facts but there was only one with relevance nitri had said in the car hes enormously brave for a man with his record of courage his nerves had needed a lot of tranquillizing a woman a night so they said then i got it pushing you too far were they he said nothing his face had lost all colour and his eyes were vacant in the way of a drowning man he was reviewing his life and if i had spoken again he wouldnt have heard or understood after a long time he said numbly yes i tried to tell him but he said a part of the new germany was in my care that was what he said in your care i was getting fed up and thirtysix pilots one after the other were they in your care too abstractedly that was wagner oh really nothing to do with you christ i wouldnt want your conscience rohmhild wagner wasnt much surprise id already checked on him coming into the airbase hed left here two days ago rotational duties hed be down at hankensbuttel now the next one round the ring i did it for him what oh for kohn youre all the same you can never do anything for yourselves theres always got to be some kind of a tin god telling you what to do then youll do anything when did they tell you the rohmhilds because it must have been like that when i was fifteen well that was a bloody silly thing to do puberty is no time to tell someone hes got a genuine father lost on the other side of a lot of barbed wire hell want to find him i wondered if kohn would ever have allowed that hed had no choice the rohmhilds had thought it was the right thing to do i said when did you first meet him on my nineteenth birthday but his answers werent coming as fast as that he spent a lot of time staring at nothing i went across the wall on a holiday pass and tried not to come back but he made me was that when it happened he stared at me trying to connect was that when he offered you the sacred task of assisting in the recreation of the beloved fatherland and all that balls something like anger came into his eyes id kicked half a temple over and there has to be a place to pray in when you worship a god distinguished flying record the iron cross as a lieutenant so forth and a face to show for it the face of the mutilated martyr theyd had young rohmhildkohn across a barrel it was later a year later what was your job recruiting wagner yes more than that for the past year hed been die zelles contact inside the luftwaffe monitoring pilotreactions listening to the aib wreckageanalysts checking on their west german counterpart team passing it all through the wire with people like guhl as a courier linsdorf was the main base where the strikercrash investigations were going on how much longer were you going to keep it up it was not in my hands after wagner had worked out a way to oh all right but you had all the information didnt you you knew who was next on the list what was it drugs hypnosis a nervegas i dont know of course you know he didnt tell me damn your eyes how was it administered his head had swung away as if id hit him from somewhere he was trying to rescue reason and rearm himself but there was no defence against what i had told him that die zelle was finished the divine orders from the god in the temple had been to engineer the death of young man like himself who flew the same plane and lived the same life and his subscription to opposing loyalties had finally cut him in two just as all germany was cut if i stopped now id never get it from him what was his method wagners method because london wouldnt go in immediately shed said the berlin run was normally scheduled for the fifteenth of every month it was a tablet where where did he in the tube of sedatives oh christ as simple as that they were out there rebuilding whole aeroplanes what was it the fifth in the tube the sixth how many sedative doses before the big kick rohmhild one every flight how many flights a day how many days he stood shivering and i turned away he didnt have to answer the answer was on the map the ring on the map wagner spent an average of five days at every main striker base his duties were rotational and death was rotational russian roulette he would alter his timepattern so that he would never be present at any given base when a crash happened pick the next man and get out just as you light a fuse and the stuff could be anything a quickacting depressant using the normal effects of highaltitude and oxygenbreathing as a catalyst that would be essential because they had to come down hard enough to make analysis impossible ferris you saw that crash so you can imagine what the pilot looks like afterwards quickacting and short duration i had asked philpott what attitude the striker would adopt if the pilot lost control and hadnt switched to automatic nose down four or five degrees from sixty thousand feet all the way into the ground he was standing looking out of the window but i knew that nothing was familiar to him any more how long have you been at linsdorf six months got a transfer here did you he said nothing more but it was six months ago when the west german analysts and the aib had set up linsdorf as the centre of their operations the eye and the ear of die zelle had requested transfer whos next rohmhild he didnt answer perhaps didnt hear his silence gave me time to think and suddenly i knew that i was missing something important i didnt know what it was but the natural thing happened and my thoughts focused on the one area still unexplained rohmhild had been so vulnerable when i had come here and i had assumed it was due to the strain of standing by and doing nothing while they came out of the sky one after another at gunzburg spalt laubach linsdorf rohmhild wagner gone rotational the taint of kerosene in the draught from the windows who is next i swung him round and his face opened to the shock of the attack hed even forgotten i was here and forgotten why artur boldt geschwaderkommodore linsdorf now airborne i dragged at the door and began running and was halfway to the control tower when i heard the shot but kept on going the odd thought flashing to mind that nitri was off the hook now the pilots heard it from the crewroom and came out to see what was happening and one of them called to me but i went on running concrete apron dry ice in the shallows a flight of steps steel banister the door they were surprised to see me green glass filtering the light i told them to get him down do it now catch him before he reached his operational ceiling said i was with aib and wed located the fault because they werent too quick but that one worked all right and they started calling him up i leaned on the edge of the console irritated at being out of breath a lot of steps fair enough but i must be getting old geschwaderkommodore geschwaderkommodore antworten sie bitte crackling static natural selection o wagners part i supposed the geschwaderkommodore was a danger wed all been standing there just after paul dissen had done his bang and boldt had said its not the plane its the pilot geschwaderkommodore horen sie antworten sie bittel and wagner had been there when boldt had said that little wagner their shepherd their saviour you have a theory i know and boldt had said several befehl sofortiger ruckflug zur staffell the sky looked empty through the green glass horen sie horen sie just airborne when id reached the gates fifteen twenty minutes with rohmhild take less than that to reach the ceiling but then he might not be climbing the whole time it depended on what exercise he befell ubermittelt signal received the controller nodded to me and i went out and down the steps there were some pilots and one or two of the ground staff in a group outside the door of rohmhilds quarters and an ambulance was nosing in i didnt recognize him at first glasses glinting and strawcoloured hair bobbing as he walked i hadnt expected him whats come up i asked he was gazing cautiously around typical of him and some other people were coming past to see what was going on so he walked me as far as the perimeter road of course i knew why hed come hed been in signals so forth he said i had to tell london straight away and they said i ought to make contact whats that ambulance for tell them what he gave me his quiet nervousbreakdown look you said you were home and dry when you phoned me from rhine army well are you the sky was still empty my eyes were getting tired staring up at it i said they think i was going to lose the whole thing down a drain or something at the last minute bloody london for you well theyre anxious you know they didnt expect you to crack it inside a week his pale head was turning like a radar whats the ambulance for bloke shot himself the classic prussian kaputt a whisper in the air very high like the one over westheim i listened to it any immediate acton he was being very good very offhand but he knew the ferret was out through the far end and he was keen to see the rabbit not really i shielded my eyes it hadnt been so high as it had sounded the shape was already forming in the winter haze drifting into the final approach i said whats the date fifth hed seen the plane now theres some local stuff the bloke over there was in it but i got what i wanted out of him theres a man called wagner youll need to bring in and theres a clockmakers in neueburg that wants cleaning out a what a clockmakers i wished hed go away i wanted to watch the plane come down because thered been nothing i could do about it at westheim people need clocks dont they so people have to make them touch and bounce then it tilted and slid very fast down the strip the brakes coming on slowing at the north end turning not pretty are they ferris said that one is it was coming in to the hangars and i turned away but the big job is an ambush over the other side couple of vehicles on the move between a place called aschau and berlin and a political reeducation centre to clean out the vehicles go up every month on the fifteenth so youve got ten days thats all right moondrop job half a dozen assault specialists how will parkis do it with internationals or what hell probably hand it to bonn its really their pigeon i turned once and had a last look humped ugly bowlegged stinking of kerosene we walked on again because i want london to send me with them its not your field just for the ride thats all he was glinting at me sideways hair all over the place quite alarmed a shadow executive mustnt ever go and play with the rough boys down the street it says so in the rules they wouldnt let you anyway youve had enough by the look of things listen ferris i was getting fed up i wanted a bit of sleep that was all i cracked this one inside a week didnt i my credits good for once so youre going to fix it for me all right i mean that behind us the jet whined away to silence ill do what i can someone over there is there thats right the end
