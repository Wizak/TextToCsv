dave timothys quest scene i number three minerva court first floor front flossy morrison learns the secret of death without ever having learned the secret of life minerva court veil thy face o goddess of wisdom for never surely was thy fair name so ill bestowed as when it was applied to this most dreary place it was a little less than street a little more than alley and its only possible claim to decency came from comparison with the busier thoroughfare out of which it opened this was so much fouler with its dirt and noise its stands of refuse fruit and vegetables its dingy shops and all the miserable traffic that the place engendered its rickety doorways blocked with lounging men its blowsabellas leaning on the windowsills that the court seemed by contrast a most desirable and retired place of residence but it was a dismal spot nevertheless with not even an air of faded gentility to recommend it it seemed to have no better days behind it nor to hold within itself the possibility of any future improvement it was narrow and extended only the length of a city block yet it was by no means wanting in many of those luxuries which mark this era of modern civilization there were groceries with commodious samplerooms attached at each corner and a small saloon called the dearest spot which it undoubtedly was in more senses than one in the basement of a house at the farther end it was necessary however for the bibulous native who dwelt in the middle of the block to waste some valuable minutes in dragging himself to one of these fountains of bliss at either end but at the time my story opens a wideawake philanthropist was fitting up a neat and attractive little barroom called the oasis at a point equally distant between the other two springs of human joy this benefactor of humanity had a vaulting ambition he desired to slake the thirst of every man in christendom but this being impossible from the very nature of things he determined to settle in some arid spot like minerva court and irrigate it so sweetly and copiously that all mens noses would blossom as the roses to supply his brothers wants and create new ones at the same time was his purpose in establishing this oasis in the desert of minerva court and it might as well be stated here that he was prospered in his undertaking as any man is sure to be who cherishes lofty ideals and attends to his business industriously the minerva courtier thus had good reason to hope that the supply of liquid refreshment would bear some relation to the demand and that the march of modern progress would continue to diminish the distance between his own mouth and that of the bottle which as he took it was the beall and endall of existence at present however as the oasis was not open to the public children carrying pitchers of beer were often to be seen hurrying to and fro on their miserable errands but there were very few children in minerva court thank god they were not popular there there were frowzy sleepylooking women hanging out of their windows gossiping with their equally unkempt and haggard neighbors apathetic men sitting on the doorsteps in their shirtsleeves smoking a dull dirty baby or two sporting itself in the gutter while the sound of a melancholy accordion the chosen instrument of poverty and misery floated from an upper chamber and added its discordant mite to the general desolation the sidewalks had apparently never known the touch of a broom and the middle of the street looked more like an elongated junkheap than anything else every smell known to the nostrils of man was abroad in the air and several were floating about waiting modestly to be classified after which they intended to come to the front and outdo the others if they could that was minerva court a little piece of your world my world gods world and the devils lying peacefully fallow awaiting the services of some inspired home missionary society in a front room of number three a dilapidated house next the corner there lay a still white shape with two women watching by it a sheet covered it candles burned at the head striving to throw a gleam of light on a dead face that for many a year had never been illuminated from within by the brightness of selfforgetting love or kindly sympathy if you had raised the sheet you would have seen no happy smile as of a halfremembered innocent childhood the smile is it of peaceful memory or serene anticipation that sometimes shines on the faces of the dead such lifesecrets as were exposed by death and written on that still countenance in characters that all might read were painful ones flossy morrison was dead the name flossy was a relic of what she termed her better days heaven save the mark for she had been called mrs morrison of late years mrs f morrison who took children to board and no questions asked nor answered she had lived fortyfive years as men reckon summers and winters but she had never learned in all that time to know her mother nature her father god nor her brothers and sisters the children of the world she had lived friendless and unfriendly keeping none of the ten commandments nor yet the eleventh which is the greatest of all and now there was no human being to slip a flower into the still hand to kiss the claycold lips at the remembrance of some sweet word that had fallen from them or drop a tear and say i loved her apparently the two watchers did not regard flossy morrison even in the light of the dear remains as they are sometimes called at country funerals they were in the best of spirits there was an abundance of beer and their gruesome task would be over in a few hours for it was nearly four oclock in the morning and the body was to be taken away at ten i tell you one thing ettie flossy hasnt left any bother for her friends remarked mrs nancy simmons settling herself back in her rockingchair as she didnt own anything but the clothes on her back there wont be any quarreling over the property and she chuckled at her delicate humor no answered her companion who whatever her sponsors in baptism had christened her called herself ethel montmorency i spose the furniture poor as it is will pay the funeral expenses and if shes got any debts why folks will have to whistle for their money thats all the only thing that worries me is the children said mrs simmons you must be hard up for something to worry about to take those young ones on your mind they aint yours nor mine and whats more nobody knows who they do belong to and nobody cares soon as breakfasts over well pack em off to some institution or other and thatll be the end of it what did flossy say about em when you spoke to her yesterday i asked her what she wanted done with the young ones and she said do what you like with em drat em it dont make no odds to me and then she turned over and died those was the last words she spoke dear soul but lor she wasnt moren half sober and hadnt been for a week she was sober enough to keep her own counsel i can tell you that said the gentle ethel i dont believe theres a living soul that knows where those children came from not that anybody cares now that there aint any money in em well as for that i only know that when flossy was seeing better days and lived in the upper part of the city she used to have money come every month for taking care of the boy where it come from i dont know but i kind of surmise it was a long distance off then she took to drinking and got lower and lower down until she came here six months ago i dont suppose the boys folks or whoever it was sent the money knew the way she was living though they couldnt have cared much for they never came to see how things were and he was in an asylum before flossy took him i found that out but anyhow the money stopped coming three months ago flossy wrote twice to the folks whoever they were but didnt get no answer to her letters and she told me that she should turn the boy out in a week or two if some cash didnt turn up in that time she wouldnt have kept him so long as this if he hadnt been so handy taking care of the baby well who does the baby belong to you ask me too much replied nancy taking another deep draught from the pitcher help yourself ettie theres plenty more where that came from flossy never liked the boy and always wanted to get rid of him but couldnt afford to hes a dreadful queer oldfashioned little kid and so smart that hes gettin to be a reglar nuisance round the house but you see he and the baby gabrielles her name but they call her lady gay or some such trash after that actress that comes here so much well they are so in love with one another that wild horses couldnt drag em apart and i think flossy had a kind of a likin for gay as much as she ever had for anything i guess she never abused either of em she was too careless for that and so what was i talkin about oh yes well i dont know who the baby is nor who paid for her keep but shes goin to be one o your highsteppers and no mistake she might be queen victorys daughter by the airs she puts on id like to keep her myself if she was a little older and i wasnt goin away from here i spose theyll make an awful row at being separated wont they asked the younger woman oh like as not but theyll have to have their row and get over it said mrs simmons easily you can take timothy to the orphan asylum first and then come back and ill carry the baby to the home of the ladies relief and protection society and if they yell they can yell and take it out in yellin they wont get the best of nancy simmons dont talk so loud nancy for mercys sake if the boy hears you hell begin to take on and we shant get a wink of sleep dont let em know what youre goin to do with em till the last minute or youll have trouble as sure as we sit here oh they are sound asleep responded mrs simmons with an uneasy look at the halfopen door i went in and dragged a pillow out from under timothys head and he never budged he was sleepin like a log and so was gay now shut up et and let me get three winks myself you take the lounge and ill stretch out in two chairs wake me up at eight oclock if i dont wake myself for im clean tired out with all this fussin and plannin and i feel stupid enough to sleep till kingdom come scene ii number three minerva court first floor back little timothy jessup assumes parental responsibilities when the snores of the two watchers fell on the stillness of the deathchamber with that cheerful regularity that betokens the sleep of the truly good a little figure crept out of the bed in the adjoining room and closed the door noiselessly but with trembling fingers stealing then to the window to look out at the dirty street and the gray sky over which the first faint streaks of dawn were beginning to creep it was little timothy jessup god alone knows whether he had any right to that special patronymic but not the very same tim jessup who had kissed the baby gay in her little crib and gone to sleep on his own hard bed in that room a few hours before as he stood shivering at the window one thin hand hard pressed upon his heart to still its beating there was a light of sudden resolve in his eyes a newborn look of anxiety on his unchildlike face i will not have gay protectioned and reliefed and i will not be taken away from her and sent to a sylum where i can never find her again and with these defiant words trembling half spoken on his lips he glanced from the unconscious form in the crib to the terrible door which might open at any moment and divide him from his hearts delight his darling his treasure his only joy his own own baby gay but what should he do run away that was the only solution of the matter and no very difficult one either the cruel women were asleep the awful thing that had been flossy would never speak again and no one else in minerva court cared enough for them to pursue them very far or very long and so thought timothy swiftly i will get things ready take gay and steal softly out of the back door and run away to the truly country where none of these bad people ever can find us and where i can get a mother for gay somebody to dopt her and love her till i grow up a man and take her to live with me the moment this thought darted into timothys mind it began to shape itself in definite action gabrielle or lady gay as flossy called her in honor of her favorite stage heroine had been tumbled into her crib half dressed the night before the only vehicle kept for her use in the family stables was a clothesbasket mounted on four wooden wheels and cushioned with a dingy shawl a yard of clothesline was tied on to one end and in this humble conveyance the princess would have to be transported from the ogres castle for she was scarcely old enough to accompany the prince on foot even if he had dared to risk detection by waking her so the clothesbasket must be her chariot and timothy her charioteer as on many a less fateful expedition after he had changed his ragged nightgown for a shabby suit of clothes he took gays one clean apron out of a rickety bureau drawer for i can never find a mother for her if shes too dirty he thought her sunday hat from the same receptacle and last of all a comb and a faded japanese parasol that stood in a corner these he deposited under the old shawl that decorated the floor of the chariot he next groped his way in the dim light toward a mantelshelf and took down a savingsbank a florid little structure with bank of england stamped over the miniature door into which the jovial gentleman who frequented the house often slipped pieces of silver for the children and into which flossy dipped only when she was in a state of temporary financial embarrassment timothy did not dare to jingle it he could only hope that as flossy had not been in her usual health of late though in more than her usual spirits she had not felt obliged to break the bank now for provisions there were plenty of funeral baked meats in the kitchen and he hastily gathered a dozen cookies into a towel and stowed them in the coach with the other sinews of war so far well and good but the worst was to come with his heart beating in his bosom like a triphammer and his eyes dilated with fear he stepped to the door between the two rooms and opened it softly two thundering snores pitched in such different keys that they must have proceeded from two separate sets of nasal organs reassured the boy he looked out into the alley not a creature was stirring not even a mouse the minerva courtiers couldnt be owls and hawks too and there was not even the ghost of a sound to be heard satisfied that all was well timothy went back to the bedroom and lifted the battered clothesbasket trucks and all in his slender arms carried it up the alley and down the street a little distance and deposited it on the pavement beside a vacant lot this done he sped back to the house how beautifully they snore he thought as he stood again on the threshold shall i leave em a letter praps i better and then they wont follow us and bring us back so he scribbled a line on a bit of torn paper bag and pinned it on the enemies door a kind lady is goin to adopt us it is a grate ways off so do not hunt good by tim now all was ready no one thing more timothy had been met in the street by a pretty young girl a few weeks before the love of god was smiling in her heart the love of children shining in her eyes and she led him a willing captive into a mission sundayschool near by and so much in earnest was the sweet little teacher and so hungry for any sort of good tidings was the starved little pupil that timothy got religion then and there as simply and naturally as a child takes its mothers milk he was probably in a state of crass ignorance regarding the thirtynine articles but it was the engrafted word of which the bible speaks that had blossomed in timothys heart the living seed had always been there waiting for some beneficent fostering influence for he was what dear charles lamb would have called a natural kingdomofheavenite thinking therefore of miss doras injunction to pray over all the extraordinary affairs of life and as many of the ordinary ones as possible he hung his tattered straw hat on the bedpost and knelt beside gays crib with this whispered prayer our father who art in heaven please help me to find a mother for gay one that she can call mamma and another one for me if theres enough but not unless please excuse me for taking away the clothesbasket which does not exactly belong to us but if i do not take it dear heavenly father how will i get gay to the railroad and if i dont take the japanese umbrella she will get freckled and nobody will adopt her no more at present as i am in a great hurry amen he put on his hat stooped over the sleeping baby and took her in his faithful arms arms that had never failed her yet she half opened her eyes and seeing that she was safe on her beloved timothys shoulder clasped her dimpled arms tight about his neck and with a long sigh drifted off again into the land of dreams bending beneath her weight he stepped for the last time across the threshold not even daring to close the door behind him up the alley and round the corner he sped as fast as his trembling legs could carry him just as he was within sight of the goal of his ambition that is the chariot aforesaid he fancied he heard the sound of hurrying feet behind him to his fevered imagination the tread was like that of an avenging army on the track of the foe he did not dare to look behind on for the clothesbasket and liberty he would relinquish the japanese umbrella the cookies the comb and the apron all the booty in fact as an inducement for the enemy to retreat but he would never give up the prisoner on the feet hurried faster and faster he stooped to put gay in the basket and turned in despair to meet his pursuers when a little grimy roughcoated lopeared splittailed thing like an animated ragbag leaped upon his knees whimpering with joy and imploring with every grace that his simple doggish heart could suggest to be one of the eloping party rags had followed them timothy was so glad to find it no worse that he wasted a moment in embracing the dog whose delirious joy at the prospect of this probably dinnerless and supperless expedition was ludicrously exaggerated then he took up the rope and trundled the chariot gently down a side street leading to the station everything worked to a charm they met only an occasional milk and water man starting on his matutinal rounds for it was now after four oclock and one or two cavaliers of uncertain gait just returning to their homes several hours too late for their own good but these gentlemen were in no condition of mind to be overinterested and the little fugitives were troubled with no questions as to their intentions and so they went out into the world together these three timothy jessup if it was jessup brave little knight nameless nobleman tracing his descent back to god the father of us all and bearing the divine likeness more than most of us the little lady gay somebody nobody anybody from nobody knows where destination equally uncertain and rags of pedigree most doubtful scutcheon quite obscured by blots but a perfect gentleman truehearted and loyal to the core in fact an angel in fur these three with the clothesbasket as personal property and the bank of england as security went out to seek their fortune and unlike lots wife without daring to look behind shook the dust of minerva court from off their feet forever and forever scene iii the railway station timothy plans a campaign and providence assists materially in carrying it out or vice versa by dint of skillful generalship timothy gathered his forces on a green bank just behind the railway depot cleared away a sufficient number of tin cans and oystershells to make a flat space for the chariot of war which had now become simply a cradle and sat down with rags curled up at his feet to plan the campaign he pushed back the ragged hat from his waving hair and clasping his knees with his hands gazed thoughtfully at the towering chimneys in the foreground and the whitewinged ships in the distant harbor there was a glimpse of something like a mans purpose in the sober eyes and as the morning sunlight fell upon his earnest face the angel in him came to the surface and crowded the boy part quite out of sight as it has a way of doing sometimes with children how some fatherheart would have throbbed with pride to own him and how gladly lifted the too heavy burden from his childish shoulders timothy jessup aged ten or eleven or thereabouts the records had not been kept with absolute exactness timothy jessup somewhat ragged all forlorn and none too clean at the present moment was a poet philosopher and lover of the beautiful the dwellers in minerva court had never discovered the fact for although he had lived in that world he had most emphatically never been of it he was a boy of strange notions and the vocabulary in which he expressed them was stranger still furthermore he had gentle manners which must have been indigenous as they had certainly never been cultivated and although he had been in the way of handling pitch for many a day it had been helpless to defile him such was the essential purity of his nature to find a home and a mother for lady gay had been timothys secret longing ever since he had heard people say that flossy might die he had once enjoyed all the comforts of a home with a capital h but it was the cosy one with the little h that he so much desired for her not that he had any ill treatment to remember in the excellent institution of which he was for several years an inmate the matron was an amiable and hardworking woman who wished to do her duty to all the children under her care but it would be an inspired human being indeed who could give a hundred and fifty motherless or fatherless children all the education and care and training they needed to say nothing of the love that they missed and craved what wonder then that an occasional hungry little soul starved for want of something not provided by the management say a morning cuddle in fathers bed or a ride on fathers knee in short the sweet daily jumble of laptrotting gentle caressing endearing words twilight stories motherly tucksinbed goodnight kisses all the dear simple everyday accompaniments of the home with the little h timothy jessup bred in such an atmosphere would have gladdened every life that touched his at any point plenty of wistful men and women would have thanked god nightly on their knees for the gift of such a son and here he was sitting on a tin can bowed down with family cares while thousands of graceless little scalawags were slapping the faces of their french nursemaids and bullying their parents in that very city ah me as for the tiny lady gay she had all the winsome virtues to recommend her no one ever feared that she would die young out of sheer goodness you would not have loved her so much for what she was as because you couldnt help yourself this feat once accomplished she blossomed into a thousand graces each one more bewitching than the last you noted where in the name of all the sacred laws of heredity did the child get her sunshiny nature born in misery and probably in sin nurtured in wretchedness and poverty she had brought her radiant morning visions with her into the world like wordsworths immortal babe with trailing clouds of glory had she come from god who was her home and the heaven that lies about us all in our infancy that garden of eden into which we are all born like the first man and the first woman that heaven lay about her still stronger than the touch of earth what if the room were desolate and bare the yellow sunbeams stole through the narrow window and in the shaft of light they threw across the dirty floor gay played oblivious of everything save the flickering golden rays that surrounded her the raindrops chasing each other down the dingy pane the snowflakes melting softly on the casement the brown leaf that the wind blew into her lap as she sat on the sidewalk the chirp of the little beggarsparrows over the cobblestones all these brought as eager a light into her baby eyes as the costliest toy with no earthly father or mother to care for her she seemed to be gods very own baby and he amused her in his own good way first by locking her happiness within her own soul the only place where it is ever safe for a single moment and then by putting her under timothys paternal ministrations timothys mind traveled back over the past as he sat among the tin cans and looked at rags and gay it was a very small story if he ever found any one who would care to hear it there was a long journey in a great ship a wearisome illness of many weeks or was it months when his curls had been cut off and all his memories with them then there was the home then there was flossy who came to take him away then oh bright bright spot oh blessed time there was baby gay then worse than all there was minerva court but he did not give many minutes to reminiscence he first broke open the bank of england and threw it away after finding to his joy that their fortune amounted to one dollar and eightyfive cents this was so much in advance of his expectations that he laughed aloud and rags wagging his tail with such vigor that he nearly broke it in two jumped into the cradle and woke the baby then there was a happy family circle you may believe me and with good reason too a trip to the country meals and lodging uncertain but that was a trifle a sight of green meadows where tim would hear real birds sing in the trees and gay would gather wild flowers and rags would chase and perhaps who knows catch toothsome squirrels and fat little fieldmice of which the country dogs visiting minerva court had told the most mouthwatering tales gays transport knew no bounds her childheart felt no regret for the past no care for the present no anxiety for the future the only world she cared for was in her sight and she had never in her brief experience gazed upon it with more radiant anticipation than on this sunny june morning when she had opened her bright eyes on a pleasant odorous bank of oystershells instead of on the accustomed surroundings of minerva court breakfast was first in order there was a pump conveniently near and the oystershells made capital cups gay had three cookies timothy two and rags one but there was no statute of limitations placed on the water every one had as much as he could drink the little matter of toilets came next timothy took the dingy rag which did duty for a handkerchief and calling the pump again into requisition scrubbed gays face and hands tenderly but firmly her clothes were then all smoothed down tidily but the clean apron was kept for the eventful moment when her future mother should first be allowed to behold the form of her adopted child the comb was then brought out and her mop of redgold hair was assisted to fall in wet spirals all over her lovely head which always wiggled too much for any more formal style of hairdressing her sunday hat being tied on as the crowning glory this lucky little princess this child of fortune so inestimably rich in her own opinion this daughter of the gods i say was returned to the basket where she endeavored to keep quiet until the next piece of delightful unexpectedness should rise from fairyland upon her excited gaze timothy and rags now went to the pump and rags was held under the spout this was a new and bitter experience and he wished for a few brief moments that he had never joined the noble army of deserters but had stayed where dirt was fashionable being released the sense of abnormal cleanliness mounted to his brain and he tore breathlessly round in a circle seventyseven times without stopping but this only dried his hair and amused gay who was beginning to find the basket confining and who clamored for timfy to take her to yide timothy attended to himself last as usual he put his own head under the pump and scrubbed his face and hands heartily wiping them on his well he wiped them and that is the main thing besides his handkerchief had been reduced to a pulp in gays service he combed his hair pulled up his stockings and tied his shoes neatly buttoned his jacket closely over his shirt and was just pinning up the rent in his hat when rags considerately brought another suggestion in the shape of an old chickenwing with which he brushed every speck of dust from his clothes this done and being no respecter of persons he took the family comb to rags who woke the echoes during the operation and hoped to the lord that the squirrels would run slowly and that the fieldmice would be very tender to pay him for this it was now nearly eight oclock and the party descended the hillside and entered the side door of the station the days work had long since begun and there was the usual din and uproar of railroad traffic trucks laden high with boxes and barrels were being driven to the wide doors and porters were thundering and thumping and lurching the freight from one set of cars into another their primary objects being to make a racket and demolish raw material thereby increasing manufacture and export but incidentally to load or unload as much freight as possible in a given time timothy entered trundling his carriage where lady gay sat enthroned like a murray hill belle on a dogcart conscious pride of sunday hat on weekday morning exuding from every feature and rags followed close behind clean but with a crushed spirit which he could stimulate only by the most seductive imaginations no one molested them for timothy was very careful not to get in any ones way finally he drew up in front of a high blackboard on which the names of various waystations were printed in gold letters chestertown sandford reedville bingham skaggstown esbury scratch corner hillside mountain view edgewood pleasant river the names get nicer and nicer as you read down the line and the furtherest one of all is the very prettiest so i guess well go there thought timothy not realizing that his choice was based on most insecure foundations and that for aught he knew the milk of human kindness might have more cream on it at scratch corner than at pleasant river though the latter name was certainly more attractive gay approved of pleasant river and so did rags and timothy moved off down the station to a place on the open platform where a train of cars stood ready for starting the engine at the head gasping and puffing and breathing as hard as if it had an acute attack of asthma how much does it cost to go to pleasant river please asked tim bravely of a kindlooking man in a blue coat and brass buttons who stood by the cars this is a freight train sonny replied the man takes four hours to get there better wait till buy your ticket up in the station tim saw visions of mrs simmons speeding down upon him in hot pursuit kindled by gays disappearance into an appreciation of her charms the tears stood in his eyes as gay clambered out of the basket and danced with impatience exclaiming gay wants to yide now yide now yide now did you want to go sooner asked the man who seemed to be entirely too much interested in humanity to succeed in the railroad business well as you seem to have considrable of a family on your hands i guess well take you along jim unlock that car and let these children in and then lock it up again its a car were taking up to the end of the road for repairs bubby so the compny ll give you and your folks a free ride timothy thanked the man in his politest manner and gay pressed a piece of moist cooky in his hand and offered him one of her swansdown kisses a favor of which she was usually as chary as if it had possessed a market value are you going to take the dog asked the man as rags darted up the steps with sniffs and barks of ecstatic delight he aint so handsome but you can get another easy enough rags held his breath in suspense and wondered if he had been put under a roaring cataract and then ploughed in deep furrows with a sharptoothed instrument of torture only to be left behind at last thats just why i take him said timothy because he isnt handsome and has nobody else to love him not a very polite reason thought rags but anything to go well jump in dog and all and theyll give you the best free ride to the country you ever had in your life tell em its all right jim and the train steamed out of the depot while the kind man waved his bandana handkerchief until the children were out of sight scene iv pleasant river jabe slocum assumes the rфle of guardian angel jabe slocum had been down to edgewood and was just returning to the white farm by way of the crossroads and hard scrabble schoolhouse he was in no hurry though he always had more work on hand than he could leave undone for a month and maria also was taking her own time as usual even stopping now and then to crop an unusually sweet tuft of grass that grew within smelling distance and which no mare with a driver like jabe could afford to pass without notice jabe was ostensibly out on an errant for miss avilda cummins but as he had been in her service for six years she had no expectations of his accomplishing anything beyond getting to a place and getting back in the same day the distance covered being no factor at all in the matter but one neednt go to miss avilda cummins for a description of jabe slocums peculiarities they were all so written upon his face and figure and speech that the wayfaring man though a fool could not err in his judgment he was a long loose knockkneed slacktwisted person and would have been longer yit if he hednt hed so much turned up for feet so aunt hitty tarbox said aunt hitty went from house to house in edgewood and pleasant river making over boys clothes and as her tongue flew as fast as her needle her sharp speeches were always in circulation in both villages mr slocum had sandy hair high cheekbones a pair of kindly light blue eyes and a most unique nose i hardly know to what order of architecture it belonged perhaps old colonial would describe it as well as anything else it was a wide flat wellventilated hospitable edifice so to speak so peculiarly constructed and applied that samantha ann ripley of whom more anon declared that the reason jabe slocum ketched cold so easy was that if he didnt hold his head jess so it kep arainin in his mouth was simply an enormous slit in his face and served all the purposes for which a mouth is presumably intended save perhaps the trivial one of decoration in short a ludicrously inappropriate word for the subject it was a capital medium for exits and entrances but no ornament to his countenance when rhapsena crabb now deceased was first engaged to jabez slocum aunt hitty tarbox said it beat her how rhapseny ever got over jabes mouth though she could a got intew it easy nough or raound it if she took plenty o time but perhaps rhapsena appreciated a mouth in a husband that never was given to jawin and which uttered only kind words during her brief span of married life and there was precious little leisure for kissing at pleasant river as jabe had passed the store a few minutes before one of the boys had called out facetiously shet yer mouth when ye go by the deepot laigs the trains comin in but he only smiled placidly though it was an ancient joke the flavor of which had just fully penetrated the rustic skull and the villagers could not resist titillating the sense of humor with it once or twice a month neither did jabez mind being called laigs the local pronunciation of the word legs in fact his good humor was too deep to be ruffled his cistern of wrathfulness was so small and the supply pipe so unready that it was next to impossible to put him out so the natives said he was a man of tolerable education the only son of his parents who had endeavored to make great things of him and might perhaps have succeeded if he hadnt always had so little time at his disposal hadnt been so drove as he expressed it he went to the village school as regularly as he couldnt help that is as many days as he couldnt contrive to stay away until he was fourteen from there he was sent to the academy three miles distant but his mother soon found that he couldnt make the two trips a day and be under cover by candlelight so the plan of a classical education was abandoned and he was allowed to speed the home plough a profession which he pursued with such moderation that his father when starting him down a furrow used to hang his dinnerpail on his arm and bidding him goodby beg him with tears in his eyes to be back before sundown at the present moment jabe was enjoying a cud of old virginia plug tobacco and taking in no more of the landscape than he could avoid when maria having wound up to the top of marm berrys hill in spite of herself walked directly out on one side of the road and stopped short to make room for the passage of an imposing procession made up of one straw phaeton one baby one strange boy and one strange dog jabe eyed the party with some placid interest for he loved children but with no undue excitement shifting his huge quid he inquired in his usual leisurely manner which way yer goin bub t the swamp or t the falls timothy thought neither sounded especially inviting but rapidly choosing the lesser evil replied to the falls sir thy way happens to be my way s rewth said to naomi so f gittin over the roads your objeck n y aint pertickler baout the gait ye travel ye can git in n ride a piece we dont blieve in hurryin mariar n me slow n easy goes fur in a day s our motto can ye git your folks aboard withaout spillin any of em no wonder he asked for gay was in such a wild state of excitement that she could hardly be held i can lift gay up if youll please take her sir said timothy and if youre quite sure the horse will stand still bless your soul shell stan all right she likes stanin a heap better n she doos goin runnin away aint no temptation to maria cummins let well enough alone s her motto jump in sissy there ye be now git yer babyshay in the back of the wagon bubby n well be s snug s a bug in a rug timothy whose creed was simple and whose beliefs were crystal clear now felt that his morning prayer had been heard and that the lord was on his side so he abandoned all idea of commanding the situation and gave himself up to the full ecstasy of the ride as they jogged peacefully along the river road gay held a piece of a rein that peeped from jabes colossal hand which was said by the villagers to cover most as much territory as the hand of providence and was convinced that she was driving maria an idea that made her speechless with joy rags wildest dreams of squirrels came true and reconciled at length to cleanliness he was capering in and out of the woods thinking what an arabian nights entertainment he would give the minerva court dogs when he returned if return he ever must to that miserable squirrelless hole the meadows on the other side of the river were gorgeous with yellow buttercups and here and there a patch of blue iris or wild sage the black cherry trees were masses of snowy bloom the water at the rivers edge held spikes of blue arrowweed in its crystal shallows while the roadside itself was gay with daisies and feathery grasses in the midst of this loveliness flowed pleasant river vexed in all its seaward course by bridges dams and mills but finding time during the busy summer months to flush its fertile banks with beauty suddenly a word that could seldom be truthfully applied to the description of jabe slocums movements the reins were ruthlessly drawn from lady gays hands and wound about the whipstock gorry ejaculated mr slocum ef i haint left the widder foss settin on aunt hittys hossblock n i promised to pick her up when i come along back that all comes o my drivin by the store so fast on account o the boys hectorin of me so t when i got to the turn i was so kind of het up i jogged right along the straight road haste makes waste s an awful good motto pile out young ones its only half a mile from here to the falls n youll have to get there on shanks mare so saying he dumped the astonished children into the middle of the road from whence he had plucked them turned the docile mare and with a git mariar went four miles back to relieve aunt hittys horseblock from the weight of the widder foss which was no joke this turn of affairs was most unexpected and gay seemed on the point of tears but timothy gathered her a handful of wild flowers wiped the dust from her face put on the clean blue gingham apron and established her in the basket where she soon fell asleep wearied by the excitements of the day timothys heart began to be a little troubled as he walked on and on through the leafy woods trundling the basket behind him nothing had gone wrong indeed everything had been much easier than he could have hoped perhaps it was the weariness that had crept into his legs and the hollowness that began to appear in his stomach but somehow although in the morning he had expected to find gays new mothers beckoning from every window so that he could scarcely choose between them he now felt as if the whole race of mothers had suddenly become extinct soon the village came in sight nestled in the laps of the green hills on both sides of the river timothy trudged bravely on scanning all the dwellings but finding none of them just the thing at last he turned deliberately off the main road where the houses seemed too near together and too near the street for his taste and trundled his family down a shady sort of avenue over which the arching elms met and clasped hands rags had by this time lowered his tail to halfmast and kept strictly to the beaten path notwithstanding manifold temptations to forsake it he passed two cats without a single insulting remark and his entire demeanor was eloquent of nostalgia oh dear sighed timothy disconsolately theres something wrong with all the places either theres no pigeonhouse like in all the pictures or no flower garden or no chickens or no lady at the window or else theres lots of babyclothes hanging on the washlines i dont believe i shall ever find at this moment a large comfortable white house that had been heretofore hidden by great trees came into view timothy drew nearer to the spotless picket fence and gazed upon the beauties of the side yard and the front garden gazed and gazed and fell desperately in love at first sight the whole thing had been made as if to order that is all there is to say about it there was an orchard and oh ecstasy what hosts of green apples there was an interesting grindstone under one tree and a bright blue chair and stool under another a thicket of currant and gooseberry bushes and a flock of young turkeys ambling awkwardly through the barn timothy stepped gently along in the thick grass past a pump and a mossy trough till a side porch came into view with a woman sitting there sewing brightcolored rags a row of shining tin pans caught the suns rays and threw them back in a thousand glittering prisms of light the grasshoppers and crickets chirped sleepily in the warm grass and a score of tiny yellow butterflies hovered over a group of odorous hollyhocks suddenly the person on the porch broke into this cheerful song which she pitched in so high a key and gave with such emphasis that the crickets and grasshoppers retired by mutual consent from any further competition and the butterflies suspended operations for several seconds ill chase the antelope over the plain the tigers cob ill bind with a chain and the wild gazelle with the silvry feet ill bring to thee for a playmate sweet timothy listened intently for some moments but could not understand the words unless the lady happened to be in the menagerie business which he thought unlikely but delightful should it prove true his eye then fell on a little marble slab under a tree in a shady corner of the orchard thats a country doorplate he thought yes its got the ladys name martha cummins printed on it now ill know what to call her he crept softly on to the front side of the house there were flower beds a lovable white cat snoozing on the doorsteps and a lady sitting at the open window knitting at this vision timothys heart beat so hard against his little jacket that he could only stagger back to the basket where rags and lady gay were snuggled together fast asleep he anxiously scanned gays face moistened his rag of a handkerchief at the only available source of supply scrubbed an atrocious dirt spot from the tip of her spirited nose and then dragging the basket along the path leading to the front gate he opened it and went in mounted the steps plied the brass knocker and waited in childlike faith for a summons to enter and make himself at home scene v the white farm afternoon timothy finds a house in which he thinks a baby is needed but the inmates do not entirely agree with him meanwhile miss avilda cummins had left her window and gone into the next room for a skein of yarn she answered the knock however and opening the door stood rooted to the threshold in speechless astonishment very much as if she had seen the shades of her ancestors drawn up in line in the dooryard off went timothys hat he hadnt seen the ladys face very clearly when she was knitting at the window or he would never have dared to knock but it was too late to retreat looking straight into her cold eyes with his own shining gray ones he said bravely but with a trembling voice do you need any babies here if you please need any babies what an inappropriate nonsensical expression to be sure as if a baby were something exquisitely indispensable like the breath of life for instance no answer miss vilda was trying to assume command of her scattered faculties and find some clue to the situation timothy concluded that she was not after all the lady of the house and remembering the marble doorplate in the orchard tried again does miss martha cummins live here if you please oh timothy what induced you in this crucial moment of your life to touch upon that sorest spot in miss vildas memory what do you want she faltered i want to get somebody to adopt my baby he said if you havent got any of your own you couldnt find one half as dear and as pretty as she is and you neednt have me too you know unless you should need me to help take care of her youre very kind miss avilda answered sarcastically preparing to shut the door upon the strange child but i dont think i care to adopt any babies this afternoon thank you youd better run right back home to your mother if youve got one and know where t is anyhow i havent cried poor timothy with a sudden and unpremeditated burst of tears at the failure of his hopes for he was half child as well as half hero at this juncture gay opened her eyes and burst into a wild howl at the unwonted sight of timothys grief and rags who was full of exquisite sensibility and quite ready to weep with those who did weep lifted up his woolly head and added his piteous wails to the concert it was a tableau vivant samanthy ann called miss vilda excitedly samanthy ann come right here and tell me what to do the person thus adjured flew in from the porch leaving a serpentine trail of red yellow and blue rags in her wake land o liberty she exclaimed as she surveyed the group whered they come from and what air they tryin to act out this boys a baby agent as near as i can make out he wants i should adopt this redheaded baby but says i aint obliged to take him too and makes out they havent got any home i told him i want adoptin any babies just now and at that he burst out cryin and the other two followed suit now have the three of em just escaped from some asylum or are they too little to be lunatics timothy dried his tears in order that gay should be comforted and appear at her best and said penitently i cried before i thought because gay hasnt had anything but cookies since last night and shell have no place to sleep unless youll let us stay here just till morning we went by all the other houses and chose this one because everything was so beautiful nothin but cookies sence land o liberty ejaculated samantha ann starting for the kitchen come back here samanthy dont you leave me alone with em and dont lets have all the neighbors runnin in you take em into the kitchen and give em somethin to eat and well see about the rest afterwards gay kindled at the first casual mention of food and trying to clamber out of the basket fell over the edge thumping her head smartly on the stone steps miss vilda covered her face with her hands and waited shudderingly for another yell as the childs carnation stocking and terracotta head mingled wildly in the air but lady gay disentangled herself and laughed the merriest burst of laughter that ever woke the echoes that was a joke her life was full of them served fresh every day for no sort of adversity could long have power over such a nature as hers come get supper she cooed putting her hand in samanthas adding that the nasty lady neednt come a remark that happily escaped detection as it was rendered in very unintelligible early english miss avilda tottered into the darkened sittingroom and sank on to a black haircloth sofa while samantha ushered the wanderers into the sunny kitchen muttering to herself wall i vow travelin over the country all alone n not kneehigh to a toad theyre send in out awful young tramps this season but they shant go away hungry if i know it accordingly she set out a plentiful supply of bread and butter gingerbread pie and milk put a tin plate of cold hash in the shed for rags and swept him out to it with a corn broom and telling the children comfortably to cram their everlastin little breadbaskets full returned to the sittingroom now whatever makes you so panicky vildy didnt you never see a tramp before for pitys sake and if youre scart for fear i cant handle em alone why jabe ll be comin along soon the prospeck of gittin to beds the only thing thatll make him n maria hurry n theyll both be callatin on that by this time samanthy ann the first question that that boy asked me was if miss martha cummins lived here now what do you make of that samantha looked as astonished as anybody could wish asked if marthy cummins lived here how under the canopy did he ever hear marthys name wall somebody told him to ask thats all there is about it and what harm was there in it anyhow oh i dont know i dont know but the minute that boy looked up at me and asked for martha cummins the old trouble that i thought was dead and buried years ago started right up in my heart and begun to ache just as if it all happened yesterday now keep stiddy vildy what could happen urged samantha why it flashed across my mind in a minute and here miss vilda lowered her voice to a whisper that perhaps marthas baby didnt die as they told her but land o liberty sposin it didnt poor marthy died herself more n twenty years ago i know but supposing her baby didnt die and supposing it grew up and died and left this little girl to roam round the world afoot and alone youre callatin dreadful close pears to me now dont go sposin any more things youre makin out one of them yellowcovered books sech as the summer boarders bring out here to read always chock full of doins that never would come to pass in this or any other christian country you jest lay down and snuff your camphire an ill go out an pump that boy drier n a sand heap now miss avilda cummins was unmarried by every implication of her being as henry james would say but samantha ann ripley was a spinster purely by accident she had seldom been exposed to the witcheries of children or she would have known long before this that so far as she was personally concerned they would always prove irresistible she marched into the kitchen like a general resolved upon the extinction of the enemy she walked out again half an hour later with the very teeth of her resolve drawn but so painlessly that she had not been aware of the operation she marched in a woman of a single purpose she came out a doublefaced diplomatist with the seeds of sedition and conspiracy lurking all unsuspected in her heart the cause nothing more than a dozen trifles as light as air timothy had sat upon a little wooden stool at her feet and resting his arms on her knees had looked up into her kind rosy face with a pair of liquid eyes like grayblue lakes eyes which seemed and were the very windows of his soul he had sat there telling his wee bit of a story just a vague shadowy plaintive uncomplaining scrap of a story without beginning plot or ending but every word in it set samantha ann ripleys heart throbbing and gay who knew a good thing when she saw it had climbed up into her capacious lap and not being denied had cuddled her head into that gracious hollow in samanthas shoulder that had somehow missed the pressure of the childish heads that should have lain there then samanthas arm had finally crept round the wheedlesome bit of soft humanity and before she knew it her chair was swaying gently to and fro to and fro to and fro and the wooden rockers creaked more sweetly than ever they had creaked before for they were singing their first cradle song then gay heaved a great sigh of unspeakable satisfaction and closed her lovely eyes she had been born with a desire to be cuddled and had had precious little experience of it at the sound of this happy sigh and the sight of the childs flower face with the upward curling lashes on the pink cheeks and the moist tendrils of hair on the white forehead and the helpless clinging touch of the baby arm about her neck i cannot tell you the why or wherefore but old memories and new desires began to stir in samantha ann ripleys heart in short she had met the enemy and she was theirs presently gay was laid upon the oldfashioned settle and samantha stationed herself where she could keep the flies off her by waving a palmleaf fan now theres one thing more i want you to tell me said she after she had possessed herself of timothys unhappy past uncertain present and still more dubious future and that is what made you ask for miss marthy cummins when you come to the door why i thought it was the ladyofthehouses name said timothy i saw it on her doorplate but we aint got any doorplate to begin with not a silver one on your door like they have in the city but isnt that white marble piece in the yard a doorplate its got martha cummins aged on it i thought may be in the country they had them in their gardens only i thought it was queer they put their ages on them because theyd have to be scratched out every little while wouldnt they my grief ejaculated samantha for pitys sake dont you know a tombstun when you see it no what is a tombstun land sakes what do you know any way didnt you never see a graveyard where folks is buried i never went to the graveyard but i know where it is and i know about peoples being buried flossy is going to be buried and so the white stone shows the places where the people are put and tells their names does it why it is a kind of a doorplate after all dont you see who is martha cummins aged she was miss vildys sister and she went to the city and then come home and died here long years ago miss vildy set great store by her and cant bear to have her name spoke so remember what i say now this flossy you tell me about of all the fool names i ever hearn tell of that beats all sounds like a wax doll with her close sewed on was she a young woman i dont know whether she was young or not said tim in a puzzled tone she had young yellow hair and very young shiny teeth white as china but her neck was crackled underneath like miss vildas it had no kissing places in it like gays well you stay here in the kitchen a spell now n dont let in that ragdog o yourn till he stops scratching if he keeps it up till the crack o doom hes got to be learned better manners now ill go in n talk to miss vildy she may keep you over night n she may not i aint noways sure you started in wrong foot foremost scene vi the white farm evening timothy lady gay and rags prove faithful to each other samantha went into the sittingroom and told the whole story to miss avilda told it simply and plainly for she was not given to arabesques in language and then waited for a response well what do you advise doin asked miss cummins nervously i dont feel comptent to advise vilda the house aint mine nor yet the beds thats in it nor the victuals in the buttry but as a professin christian and member of the orthodox church in good and reglar standin you cant turn em oudoors when its comin on dark and they aint got no place to sleep plenty of good orthodox folks turned their backs on martha when she was in trouble there may be orthodox hogs for all i know replied the blunt samantha who frequently called spades shovels in her search after absolute truth of statement but that aint no reason why we should copy after em s i know of i dont propose to take in two strange children and saddle myself with em for days or weeks perhaps said miss cummins coldly but i tell you what i will do supposing we send the boy over to squire beans its near hayin time and he may take him in to help round and do chores then well tell him before he goes that well keep the baby as long as he gets a chance to work anywheres near that will give us a chance to look round for some place for em and find out whether theyve told us the truth and if squire bean wont take him asked samantha with as much cold indifference as she could assume well i suppose theres nothing for it but he must come back here and sleep ill go out and tell him so i declare i feel as weak as if id had a spell of sickness timothy bore the news better than samantha had feared squire beans farm did not look so very far away his heart was at rest about gay and he felt that he could find a shelter for himself somewhere now howll the baby act when she wakes up and finds youre gone inquired miss vilda anxiously as timothy took his hat and bent down to kiss the sleeping child well i dont know exactly answered timothy because shes always had me you see but i guess shell be all right now that she knows you a little and if i can see her every day she never cries except once in a long while when she gets mad and if youre careful how you behave shell hardly ever get mad at you well i vow exclaimed miss vilda with a grim glance at samantha i guess shed better do the behavin so timothy was shown the way across the fields to squire beans samantha accompanied him to the back gate where she gave him three doughnuts and a sneaking kiss watching him out of sight under the pretense of taking the towels and napkins off the grass it was nearly nine oclock and quite dark when timothy stole again to the little gate of the white farm the feet that had traveled so courageously over the mile walk to squire beans had come back again slowly and wearily for it is one thing to be shod with the sandals of hope and quite another to tread upon the leaden soles of disappointment he leaned upon the white picket gate listening to the chirp of the frogs and looking at the fireflies as they hung their gleaming lamps here and there in the tall grass then he crept round to the side door to implore the kind offices of the mediator before he entered the presence of the judge whom he assumed to be sitting in awful state somewhere in the front part of the house he lifted the latch noiselessly and entered oh horror miss avilda herself was sprinkling clothes at the great table on one side of the room there was a moment of silence he wouldnt have me said timothy simply he said i wasnt big enough yet i offered him gay too but he didnt want her either and if you please i would rather sleep on the sofa so as not to be any more trouble you wont do any such thing responded miss vilda briskly youve got a royal welcome this time sure and i guess you can earn your lodging fast enough you hear that and she opened the door that led into the upper part of the house a piercing shriek floated down into the kitchen and another on the heels of that and then another every drop of blood in timothys spare body rushed to his pale grave face is she being whipped he whispered with set lips no she needs it bad enough but we aint savages shes only got the pretty temper that matches her hair just as you said i guess we havent been behavin to suit her can i go up shell stop in a minute when she sees me she never went to bed without me before and truly truly shes not a cross baby come right along and welcome just so long as she has to stay youre invited to visit with her land sakes the neighbors will think were killin pigs and miss vilda started upstairs to show timothy the way gay was sitting up in bed and the faithful samantha ann was seated beside her with a lapful of useless bribes apples seedcakes an illustrated bible a thermometer an ear of red corn and a large stuffed green bird the glory of the keeping room mantelpiece but a whole aviary of highly colored songsters would not have assuaged gays woe at that moment every effort at conciliation was met with the one plaint i want my timfy i want my timfy at the first sight of the beloved form gay flung the sacred bird into the furthest corner of the room and burst into a wild sob of delight as she threw herself into timothys loving arms fifteen minutes later peace had descended on the troubled homestead and samantha went into the sittingroom and threw herself into the depths of the highbacked rocker land o liberty perhaps i aint hetup she ejaculated as she wiped the sweat of honest toil from her brow and fanned herself vigorously with her apron i tell you what at five oclock i was dreadful sorry i hadnt took dave milliken but now im plaguey glad i didnt still and here she tried to smooth the green birds ruffled plumage and restore him to his perch under the revered glass case still children will be children some of ems considerable more like wild cats said miss avilda briefly you just go upstairs now and see if you find anything that looks like wild cats but t any rate wild cats or tame cats we would nt dass turn em oudoors this time o night for fear of flyin in the face of providence if its a stint hes set us i dont see but weve got to work it out somehow id rather have some other stint to be sure retorted samantha vigorously i never see anybody yet that didnt want to pick out her own stint but mebbe if we got just the one we wanted it wouldnt be no stint land o liberty whats that there was a crash of falling tin pans and samantha flew to investigate the cause about ten minutes later she returned more heated than ever and threw herself for the second time into the highbacked rocker that dogs been givin me a chase i can tell you he clawed and scratched so in the shed that i put him in the woodhouse and he went and clim up on that carpenters bench and pitched out that little winder at the top and fell on to the milkpan shelf and scattered every last one of em and then upsot all my cans of termatter plants but i couldnt find him high nor low all to once i see by the dirt on the floor that hed squirmed himself through the skeeternettin door int the house and then i surmised where he was sure enough i crep upstairs and there he was layin between the two children as snug as you please he was snorin like a pirate when i found him but when i stood over the bed with a candle i could see t his wicked little eyes was wide open and he was jest makin blieve sleep in hopes id leave him where he was well i yanked him out quicker n scat n locked him in the old chicken house so i guess hell stay out now for folks that claim to be no blood relation i declare him n the boy n the baby beats anything i ever come across for bein fond of one nother there were dreams at the white farm that night timothy went to sleep with a prayer on his lips a prayer that god would excuse him for speaking of marthas doorplate and a most imploring postscript to the effect that god would please make miss vilda into a mother for gay thinking as he floated off into the land of nod itll be awful hard work but i dont suppose he cares how hard t is lady gay dreamed of driving beautiful white horses beside sparkling waters and through flowery meadows and great green birds perched on all the trees and flew towards her as if to peck the cherries of her lips but when she tried to beat them off they all turned into timothys and she hugged them close to her heart rags visions were gloomy for he knew not whether the lady with the firm hand would free him from his prison in the morning or whether he was there for all time but there were intervals of bliss when his fancies took a brighter turn when hope smiled and he bit the white cats tail and chased the infant turkeys and found sweet juicy delicious bones in unexpected places and even inhaled in exquisite anticipation the fragrance of one particularly succulent bone that he had hidden under miss vildas bed sleep carried samantha so many years back into the past that she heard the blithe din of carpenters hammering and sawing on a little house that was to be hers his theirs and as she watched them with all sorts of maidenly hopes about the home that was to be some one stole up behind and caught her at it and she ran away blushing and some one followed her and they watched the carpenters together somebody else lived in the little house now and samantha never blushed any more but that part was mercifully hidden in the dream miss vildas slumber was troubled she seemed to be walking through peaceful meadows brown with autumn when all at once there rose in the path steep hills and rocky mountains she felt too tired and too old to climb but there was nothing else to be done and just as she began the toilsome ascent a little child appeared and catching her helplessly by the skirts implored to be taken with her and she refused and went on alone but miracle of miracles when she reached the crest of the first hill the child was there before her still beseeching to be carried and again she refused and again she wearily climbed the heights alone always meeting the child when she reached their summits and always enacting the same scene at last she cried in despair ask me no more for i have not even strength enough for my own needs and the child said i will help you and straightway crept into her arms and nestled there as one who would not be denied and she took up her burden and walked and as she climbed the weight grew lighter and lighter till at length the clinging arms seemed to give her peace and strength and when she neared the crest of the highest mountain she felt new life throbbing in her veins and new hopes stirring in her heart and she remembered no more the pain and weariness of her journey and all at once a bright angel appeared to her and traced the letters of a word upon her forehead and took the child from her arms and disappeared and the angel had the lovely smile and sad eyes of martha and the word she traced on miss vildas forehead was inasmuch scene vii the old homestead mistress and maid find to their amazement that a child more than all other gifts brings hope with it and forward looking thoughts it was called the white farm not because that was an unusual color in pleasant river nineteen out of every twenty houses in the village were painted white for it had not then entered the casual mind that any other course was desirable or possible occasionally a man of riotous imagination would substitute two shades of buff or make the back of his barn red but the spirit of invention stopped there and the majority of sane people went on painting white but miss avilda cummins was blessed with a larger income than most of the inhabitants of pleasant river and all her buildings the great house the sheds the carriage and dairy houses the fences and the barn were always kept in a state of dazzling purity as if the neighbors declared smanthy ann ripley went over em every morning with a dustcloth it was merely an accident that the carriage and work horses chanced to be white and that the original white cats of the family kept on having white kittens to decorate the front doorsteps it was not accident however but design that caused jabe slocum to scour the country for a good white cow and persuade miss cummins to swap off the old red one so that the critters in the barn should match miss avilda had been born at the white farm father and mother had been taken from there to the old country churchyard and martha aged poor pretty willful martha the greatest pride and greatest sorrow of the family was lying under the apple trees in the garden here also the little samantha ann ripley had come as a child years ago to be playmate nurse and companion to martha and here she had stayed ever since as friend adviser and companykeeper to the lonely miss cummins nobody in pleasant river would have dared to think of her as anybodys hired help though she did receive bed and board and a certain sum yearly for her services but she lived with miss cummins on equal terms as was the custom in the good old new england villages doing the lions share of the work and marking her sense of the situation by washing the dishes while miss avilda wiped them and by never suffering her to feed the pig or go down cellar theirs had been a dull sort of life in which little had happened to make them grow into sympathy with the outside world all the sweetness of miss avildas nature had turned to bitterness and gall after marthas disgrace sad homecoming and death there had been much to forgive and she had not had the grace nor the strength to forgive it until it was too late the mystery of death had unsealed her eyes and there had been a moment when the sad and bitter woman might have been drawn closer to the great fatherheart there to feel the throb of a divine compassion that would have sweetened the trial and made the burden lighter but the minister of the parish proved a sorry comforter and adviser in these hours of trial the reverend joshua beckwith whose view of gods universe was about as broad as if he had lived on the inside of his own porkbarrel had cherished certain strong and unrelenting opinions concerning marthas final destination which were not shared by miss cummins martha therefore was not laid with the elect but was put to rest in the orchard under the kindly untheological shade of the apple trees and they scattered their tinted blossoms over her little white headstone shed their fragrance about her quiet grave and dropped their ruddy fruit in the high grass that covered it just as tenderly and respectfully as if they had been regulation willows the reverend joshua thus succeeded in drying up the springs of human sympathy in miss avildas heart when most she needed comfort and gentle teaching and distrusting god for the moment as well as his inexorable priest she left her place in the old meetinghouse where she had worshiped ever since she had acquired adhesiveness enough to stick to a pew and was not seen there again for many years the reverend joshua had died as all men must and as most men should and a mildvoiced successor reigned in his place so the cummins pew was occupied once more samantha ann ripley had had her heart history too one of a different kind she had kept company with david milliken for a little matter of twenty years off and on and miss avilda had expected at various times to lose her friend and helpmate but fear of this calamity had at length been quite put to rest by the fourth and final rupture of the bond five years before there had always been a family feud between the ripleys and the millikens and when the young people took it into their heads to fall in love with each other in spite of precedent or prejudice they found that the course of true love ran in anything but a smooth channel it was in fact a sort of village montague and capulet affair but david and samantha were no romeo and juliet the climate and general conditions of life at pleasant river were not favorable to the development of such exotics the old people interposed barriers between the young ones as long as they lived and when they died dave millikens spirit was broken and he began to annoy the valiant samantha by what she called his meechin ways in one of his moments of weakness he took a widowed sister to live with him a certain mrs pettigrove of edgewood who inherited the milliken objection to ripleys and who widened the breach and brought samantha to the point of final and decisive rupture the last straw was the statement sown broadcast by mrs pettigrove that samanthy ann ripleys father never would a died if hed ever had any doctorin but t was the gospel truth that they never had nobody to tend him but a hompathy man from scratch corner who of course bein a hompath didnt know no more about doctorin n coopers cow samantha told david after this that she didnt want to hear him open his mouth again nor none of his folks that she was through with the whole lot of em forever and ever n she wished to the lord shed had sense enough to put her foot down fifteen years ago n she hoped hed enjoy bein tread underfoot for the rest of his natural life n she wouldnt speak to him again if she met him in her porridge dish she then slammed the door and went upstairs to cry as if she were sixteen as she watched him out of sight poor dave milliken just sweet and earnest and strong enough to suffer at being worsted by circumstances but never quite strong enough to conquer them and it was to this household that timothy had brought his child for adoption when miss avilda opened her eyes the morning after the arrival of the children she tried to remember whether anything had happened to give her such a strange feeling of altered conditions it was saturday baking day that couldnt be it and she gazed at the little dimitycurtained window and at the picture of the deathbed of calvin and wondered what was the matter just then a childs laugh bright merry tuneful infectious rang out from some distant room and it all came back to her as samantha ann opened the door and peered in ive got breakfast bout ready she said but i wish soon s youre dressed youd step down n see to it n let me wash the baby i guess water was skerse where she come from theyre awake are they awake land o liberty as soon as t was light and before the boy had opened his eyes gay was up n poundin on all the doors n hollorin smanfy beats all how she got holt o my name so quick so t i thought sure shed disturb your sleep see here vildy we want those children should look respectable the few days theyre here i dont see how we can rig out the boy but theres those old things of marthys in the attic seems like it might be a blessin on em if we used em this way i thought of it myself in the night answered vilda briefly youll find the key of the trunk in the light stand drawer you see to the children and ill get breakfast on the table has jabe come no he sent a boy to milk n said hed be right along you know what that means miss vilda moved about the immaculate kitchen frying potatoes and making tea setting on extra portions of bread and doughnuts and a huge pitcher of milk while various noises strange enough in that quiet house floated down from above this is dreadful hard on samanthy she reflected i dont know s id ought to have put it on her knowing how she hates confusion and company and all that but she seemed to think wed got to tough it out for a spell any way though i dont expect her temper ll stand the strain very long the fact was samantha was banging doors and slatting tin pails about furiously to keep up an ostentatious show of ill humor she tried her best to grunt with displeasure when gay seated in a washtub crowed and beat the water with her dimpled hands so that it splashed all over the carpet but all the time there was such a joy tugging at her heartstrings as they had not felt for years when the bath was over clean petticoats and ankleties were chosen out of the old leather trunk and finally a little blue and white lawn dress it was too long in the skirt and pending the moment when samantha should take a tack in it it anticipated the present fashion and made lady gay look more like a disguised princess than ever the gown was lownecked and shortsleeved in the old style and samantha was in despair till she found some little embroidered muslin capes and full undersleeves with which she covered gays pink neck and arms these things of beauty so wrought upon the childs excitable nature that she could hardly keep still long enough to have her hair curled and samantha as the shining rings dropped off her horny forefinger was wrestling with the evil one in the shape of a little box of jewelry that she had found with the clothing she knew that the wish was a vicious one and that such gewgaws were out of place on a little pauper just taken in for the night but her fingers trembled with a desire to fasten the little gold ears of corn on the shoulders or tie the strings of coral beads round the childs pretty throat when the toilet was completed and samantha was emptying the tub gay climbed on the bureau and imprinted sloppy kisses of sincere admiration on the radiant reflection of herself in the little lookingglass then getting down again she seized her heap of minerva court clothes and before the astonished samantha could interpose flung them out of the secondstory window where they fell on the top of the lilac bushes me doesnt like nasty old dress she explained with a dazzling smile that was a justification in itself me likes pretty new dress and then with one hand reaching up to the doorknob and the other throwing disarming kisses to samantha byby lady gay go circus now timfy come take lady gay to circus there was no time for discipline then and she was borne to the breakfasttable where timothy was already making acquaintance with miss vilda samantha entered and vilda glancing at her nervously perceived with relief that she was taking things easy ah but it was lucky for poor david milliken that he couldnt see her at that moment her whole face had relaxed her mouth was no longer a thin hard line but had a certain curve and fullness borrowed perhaps from the warmth of innocent babykisses embarrassment and stifled joy had brought a rosier color to her cheek gays vandal hand had ruffled the smoothness of her sandy locks so that a few stray hairs were absolutely curling with amazement that they had escaped from their sleek bondage in a word samantha ann ripley was lovely and lovable timothy had no eyes for any one save his beloved gay at whom he gazed with unspeakable admiration thinking it impossible that any human being with a single eye in its head could refuse to take such an angel when it was in the market gay not being used to a regular morning toilet had fought against it valiantly at first but the tonic of the bath itself and the exercise of war had brought the color to her cheeks and the brightness to her eyes she had forgiven samantha she was ready to be on good terms with miss vilda she was at peace with all the world that she was eating the bread of dependence did not trouble her in the least no royal visitor conveying honor by her mere presence could have carried off a delicate situation with more distinguished grace and ease she was perched on a websters unabridged dictionary and immediately began blowing bubbles in her mug of milk in the most reprehensible fashion and glancing up after each naughty effort with an irrepressible gurgle of laughter in which she looked so bewitching even with a milky crescent over her red mouth that she would have melted the heart of the most predestinate old misogynist in christendom timothy was not so entirely at his ease his eyes had looked into life only a few more summers but their radiant morning visions had been dispelled experience had tempered joy gay however had not arrived at an age where peoples motives can be suspected for an instant if there had been any possible plummet with which to sound the depths of her unconscious philosophy she apparently looked upon herself as a guest out of heaven flung down upon this hospitable planet with the single responsibility of enjoying its treasures o happy heart of childhood your simple creed is rich in faith and trust and hope you have not learned that the children of a common father can do aught but love and help each other scene viii the old garden jabe and samantha exchange hostilities and the former says a good word for the little wanderers god almighty first planted a garden and it is indeed the purest of all human pleasures said lord bacon and miss vilda would have agreed with him her garden was not simply the purest of all her pleasures it was her only one and the love that other people gave to family friends or kindred she lavished on her posies it was a dear oldfashioned odorous garden where dame nature had never been forced but only assisted to do her duty miss vilda sowed her seeds in the springtime wherever there chanced to be room and they came up and flourished and went to seed just as they liked those being the only duties required of them two splendid groups of fringed pinies the pride of miss avildas heart grew just inside the gate and hard by the handsomest dahlias in the village quilled beauties like carved rosettes of gold and coral and ivory there was plenty of feathery sparrowgrass so handy to fill the black and yawning chasms of summer fireplaces and furnish green for boquets there was a stray peach or greengage tree here and there and if a plain wellmeaning carrot chanced to lift its leaves among the poppies why they were all the children of the same mother and miss vilda was not the woman to root out the invader and fling it into the ditch there was a bed of yellow tomatoes where in the season a hundred tiny golden balls hung among the green leaves and just beside them in friendly equality a tangle of pink sweetwilliams fragrant phlox delicate bridestears canterbury bells blue as the june sky nonesopretties gay cockscombs and flaunting marigolds which would insist on coming up all together summer after summer regardless of color harmonies last but not least there was a patch of sweet peas on tiptoe for a flight with wings of gentle flush oer delicate white these dispensed their sweet odors so generously that it was a favorite diversion among the village children to stand in rows outside the fence and elevating their bucolic noses simultaneously sniff miss cummins peas the garden was large enough to have little hills and dales of its own and its banks sloped gently down to the river there was a gnarled apple tree hidden by a luxuriant wild grapevine a fit bower for a lovd celia or a fair rosamond there was a spring whose crystal waters were cabined cribbed confined within a barrel sunk in the earth a brook singing its way among the alder bushes and dripping here and there into pools over which the blue harebells leaned to see themselves there was a summerhouse too on the brink of the hill a weatherstained affair with a hundred names carved on its venerable lattices names of youths and maidens who had stood there in the moonlight and plighted rustic vows if you care to feel a warm glow in the region of your heart imagine little timothy jessup sent to play in that garden sent to play for almost the first time in his life imagine it i ask for there are some things too sweet to prick with a penpoint timothy stayed there fifteen minutes and running back to the house in a state of intoxicated delight went up to samantha and laying an insistent hand on hers said excitedly oh samanthy you didnt tell me there is shining water down in the garden not so big as the ocean nor so still as the harbor but a kind of baby river running along by itself with the sweetest noise please miss vilda may i take gay to see it and will it hurt it if i wash rags in it let em all go suggested samantha theres jabe dawdlin along the road and they might as well be out from under foot dont be too hard on jabe this morning samanthy hes been to see the baptist minister at edgewood you know hes going to be baptized some time next month well he needs it but land sakes you couldnt make them slocums pious f you kep on baptizin of em till the crack o doom i never hearn tell of a slocums gittin baptized in july they allers take em after the freshets in the spring o the year n then they have to be turrible careful to douse em lengthways of the river look at him will ye i blieve hes grown sence yesterday if hed ever stood stiff on his feet when he was a boy he neednt a been so everlastin tall but he was forever roostin on fences with his laigs danglin n the heft of his feet stretched em out it couldnt do no difrent i aint got no patience with him jabe has considerable many good points said miss cummins loyally hes faithful you always know where to find him good reason why retorted samantha you always know where to find him cause he genally haint moved sence you seen him last gittin religion aint goin to help him much if he ever hears tell bout the gate of heaven bein open t the last day he wont a begun to begin thinkin bout gittin in tell he hears the door shet in his face n then hell set ri downs comftables if he was inside n say wall better luck next time slow an sure s my motto goodmornin jabe had your dinner i aint even hed my breakfast responded mr slocum easily blessed are the lazy folks for they always git their chores done for em remarked samantha scathingly as she went to the buttery for provisions wall said laigs looking at her with his most irritating smile as he sat down at the kitchen table i dont find i git thru any more work by tumblin out o bed t sunup n i dew f i lay a spell n let the univarse git het up n runnin a leetle mite slow n easy goes fur in a day s my motto rhapseny she used to say she should think id be ashamed to lay abed so late wall i be s i but id ruther be ashamed n git up but youre an awful good cook samanthy if ye air allers in a hurry n if yer hev got a sharp tongue the less you say bout my tongue the better snapped samantha right you are answered jabe with a goodnatured grin as he went on with his breakfast he had a huge appetite another grievance in samanthas eyes she always said there was no need of his being so slabsided n slacktwisted n knucklejointed that he eat enough in all conscience but he wouldnt take the trouble to find the victuals that would fat him up n fill out his bag o bones just as samanthas wellcooked viands began to disappear in jabes capacious mouth he always ate precisely as if he were stoking an engine his eye rested upon a strange object by the woodbox and he put down his knife and ejaculated well i swan now when n whered i see that babyshay why t was yesterday well i vow them young ones was comin here was they what young ones asked miss vilda exchanging astonished glances with samantha and dont begin at the book o genesis n go clean through the bible s you genally do start right in on revelations where you belong put in samantha for to see a man unexpectedly loaded to the muzzle with news and too lazy to fire it off was enough to try the patience of a saint and even david milliken would hardly have applied that term to samantha ann ripley give a feller time to think will yer expostulated jabe with his mouth full of pie everything comes to him as waits d be an awful good motto for you whered i see em why i fetched em as fur as the crossroads myself well i never i want to know cried the two women in one breath i picked em up out on the road a little piece this side o the station t was at the top o marm berrys hill thats jest where t was the boy was trudgin along draggin the baby n the basket n i thought id give him a lift so s i goin t the swamp or t the falls s i to the falls s e git in s i n ill give yer a ride f y aint in no hurry s i so in he got n the baby tew when i got putty near home i happened ter think id oughter gone roun by the tanry n picked up the widder foss n so s i i aint goin no nearer to the falls but i guess your laigs is good for the balance o the way aint they s i i guess they be s e then he thanked me s perlites deacon sawyers first wife n i left him n his folks in the road where i found em didnt you ask where he belonged nor where he was bound t aint my way to waste good breath askin questions t aint none o my bisness replied mr slocum youre right it aint responded samantha as she slammed the milkpans in the sink n its my hope that some time when you get good and ready to ask somebody somethin theyll be in too much of a hurry to answer you be they any of your folks miss vildy asked jabe grinning with delight at samanthas ill humor no she answered briefly what yer callatin ter do with em i havent decided yet the boy says they havent got any folks nor any home and i suppose its our duty to find a place for em i dont see but weve got to go to the expense of takin em back to the city and puttin em in some asylum howd they happen to come here they ran away from the city yesterday and they liked the looks of this place thats all the satisfaction we can get out of em and i dare say its a pack of lies that boy wouldnt tell a lie no more n a seraphim said samantha tersely you cant judge folks by appearances answered vilda but anyhow dont talk to the neighbors jabe and if you havent got anything special on hand today i wish youd patch the roof of the summer house and dig us a mess of beet greens keep the children with you and see what you make of em theyre playin in the garden now all right ill size em up the best i ken tho mebbe itll hender me in my work some but time was made for slaves as the molasses said when they told it to hurry up in winter time two hours later miss vilda looked from the kitchen window and saw jabez slocum coming across the road from the garden timothy trudged beside him carrying the basket of greens in one hand and the other locked in jabes huge paw his eyes upturned and shining with pleasure his lips moving as if he were chattering like a magpie lady gay was just where you might have expected to find her mounted on the towering height of jabes shoulder one tiny hand grasping his weatherbeaten straw hat while with the other she whisked her willing steed with an alder switch which had evidently been cut for that purpose by the victim himself thats the way hes sizin of em up said samantha leaning over vildas shoulder with a smile ill bet theyve sized him up enough sight better n he has them jabe left the children outside and came in with the basket putting his hat in the woodbox and hitching up his trousers impressively he sat down on the settle them aint no children to be wanderin about the earth afoot n alone same s hitty went to the beach nor they aint any common truck ter be put inter sylums n poorfarms theres some young ones thats so everlastin chuckleheaded n hombly n contrairy that they aint hardly wuth savin but these aint that kind the baby now youve got her cleaned up is hansomer n any baby on the river n a reglar chunk o sunshine besides id be willin ter pay her a little suthin for livin alongside the boy well the boy is a extraordinary boy we got on tergethers slick as if we was twins that boys got idees thats what hes got n hes likely to grow up into well most anything if you think so highly of em why dont you adopt em asked miss vilda curtly thats what they seem to think folks ought to do i aint sure but i shall mr slocum responded unexpectedly if you cant find a better home for em somewheres i aint sure but ill take em myself land sakes if rhapseny was alive id adopt em quicker n blazes but marm wont take to the idee very strong i dont spose n she aint much on bringin up children as i ken testify still shes a heap better n a brick asylum with a sixfoot stone wall round it when yer come to that but i blieve we ken do better for em i can say to folks see here heres a couple o smart hansome children you can have em for nothin n neednt resk the onsartainty o gittin married n raisin yer own n when yer come ter that yer wouldnt stan no charnce o gittin any as likely as these air if ye did thats true as the gospel said samantha it nearly killed her to agree with him but the words were fairly wrung from her unwilling lips by his eloquence and wisdom well well see what we can do for em said vilda in a noncommittal tone and here theyll have to stay for all i see tell we can get time to turn round and look em up a place and the way their edjercation has been left be continued mr slocum is a burnin shame in a christian country i don blieve they ever see the inside of a schoolhouse ive learned em more this mornin n they ever hearn tell of before but theyre s ignorant s coopers cow yit they don know tansy from sorrel nor slipry ellum from pennyroyal nor burdock from pigweed they don know a dandlion from a hole in the ground they don know where the birds put up when it comes on night they never see a brook afore nor a bullfrog they never hearn tell o catoninetails nor jacklanterns nor seesaws land sakes we got ter talkin bout so many things that i clean forgot the summerhouse roof but there this wont do for me i must be goin there aint no rest for the workinman in this country if there want no work for him hed be wuss off yet responded samantha right ye are samanthy look here when d you want that box you give me to fix i wanted it before hayin but i spose any time before thanksgivin ll do seein its you whats wuth doin t all s wuth takin time over s my motto said jabe cheerfully but seein its you ill nail that cover on ter night or bust scene ix a village sabbath now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart it was sunday morning and the very peace of god was brooding over pleasant river timothy rags and gay were playing decorously in the orchard maria was hitched to an appletree in the side yard and stood there serenely with her eyes half closed dreaming of oats past and oats to come miss vilda and samantha issued from the mosquitonetting door clad in sunday best and the children approached nearer that they might share in the excitement of the departure for meeting gay clamored to go but was pacified by the gift of a ragdoll that samantha had made for her the evening before it was a monstrosity but gay dipped it instantly in the alembic of her imagination and it became a beautiful responsive little daughter which she clasped close in her arms and on which she showered the tenderest tokens of maternal affection miss vilda handed timothy a little greenpapercovered book before she climbed into the buggy thats a catechism she said and if youll be a good boy and learn the first six pages and say em to me this afternoon samantha ll give you a top that you can spin on week days what is a catechism asked timothy as he took the book its a sundayschool lesson oh then i can learn it said timothy brightening i learned three for miss dora in the city well im thankful to hear that youve had some spiritual advantages now stay right here in the orchard till jabe comes and dont set the house afire she added as samantha took the reins and raised them for the mighty slap on marias back which was necessary to wake her from her sunday slumber why would i want to set the house afire timothy asked wonderingly well i dont know s you would want to but i thought you might get to playin with matches though ive hid em all play with matches exclaimed timothy in wideeyed astonishment that a match could appeal to anybody as a desirable plaything oh no thank you i shouldnt have thought of it i dont know as we ought to have left em alone said vilda looking back as samantha urged the moderate maria over the road though i dont know exactly what they could do except run away said samantha reflectively i wish to the land they would it would be the easiest way out of a troublesome matter every day that goes by will make it harder for us to decide what to do with em for you cant do by those you know the same as if they were strangers there was a long main street running through the village north and south toward the north it led through a sweetscented wood where the grass tufts grew in verdant strips along the littletraveled road it had been a damp morning and though now the sun was shining brilliantly the spiders webs still covered the fields gossamer laces of moist spun silver through which shone the pink and lilac of the meadow grasses the wood was a quiet place and more than once miss vilda and samantha had discussed matters there which they would never have mentioned at the white farm maria went ambling along serenely through the arcade of trees where the sun went wandering softly as with his hands before his eyes overhead the vast blue canopy of heaven and under the trees the soft brown leaf carpet woven by a thousand autumns i dont know but i could grow to like the baby in time said vilda though its my opinion shes goin to be dreadful troublesome but im more n half afraid of the boy every time he looks at me with those searchin eyes of his i mistrust hes goin to say something about marthy all on account of his giving me such a turn when he came to the door hed be awful handy round the house though vildy that is if he is handy pickin up chips n layin fires n what not but s you say he aint so takin as the baby at first sight shes got the same winnin way with her that marthy hed yes said miss vilda grimly and i guess its the devils own way well yes mebbe n then again mebbe t aint there aint no reason why the devil should own all the hansome faces n tunesome laughs t i know of it doos seem s if beauty was turrible misleading n ive ben glad sometimes the lord didnt resk none of it on me for i was behind the door when good looks was give out n im willin t own up to it but all the same i like to see putty faces roun me n i guess when the lord sets his mind on it he can make goodness n beauty git along comftably in the same body when yer come to that hombly folks aint allers as good s they might be n no comfort to anybodys eyes nuther you think the boys all right in the upper story do you hes a strange kind of a child to my thinkin i aint so sure but hes smarter n we be but he talks queer n no mistake this mornin he was pullin the husks off a baby ear o corn that jabe brought in n s e smanthy i think the corn must be the happiest of all the vegtables how you talk s i what makes you think that way why because s e god has hidden it away so safe with all that shinin silk round it first n then the soft leaves wrapped outside o the silk i guess its gods favrite vegtable dont you smanthy s e and when i was showin him pictures last night n he see the crosses on top some o the city meetinhouses s e they have two sticks on most all the churches dont they smanthy i spose thats one stick for god and the other for the peoples well now dont you remember seth pennell o buttertown how queer he was when he was a boy we thought hed never be wuth his salt he used to stan in the front winder n twirl the curtin tossel for hours to a time and dont you know it come out last year that hed wrote a reglar book with covers on it n all n that he got five dollars a colume for writin poetry verses for the papers oh well if you mean that said vilda argumentatively i dont call writin poetry any great test of smartness there aint been a big fool in this village for years but could do somethin in the writin line i guess it aint any great trick if you have a mind to put yourself down to it for my part ive always despised to see a great hulkin man that could handle a hoe or a pitchfork sit down and twirl a penstalk well i aint so sure i guess the lord hes his own way o managin things we aint all callated to hoe pertaters nor yet to write poetry verses theres as much difrence in folks s there is in anybody now i can take care of a dairy as well as the next one n nobody was ever hearn to complain o my butter but there was that lady in new york state that used to make flowers n fruit n graven images out o her churnins youve hearn tell o that piece she carried to the centennial now no sech doins s that ever come into my head ive went on makin round balls for twenty years n massy on us dont i remember when my old butter stamp cracked n i couldnt get another with an ear o corn on it n hed to take one with a beehive why i was that homesick i couldnt bear to look my butter n the eye but that woman would have had a new picter on her balls every day i shouldnt wonder for massys sake maria dont stan stock still n let the flies eat yer right up no i tell yer it takes all kinds o folks to make a world now i couldnt never read poetry its so dull it makes me feel s if id been trottin all day in the sun but theres folks that can stan it or they wouldnt keep on turnin of it out the children are nice children enough but have they got any folks anywhere n what kind of folks n whered they come from anyhow thats what weve got to find out n i guess itll be considable of a chore i dont know but youre right i thought some of sendin jabe to the city tomorrow jabe well i spose hed be back by nother spring but whod we get ter shovel us out this winter seein as there aint more n three men in the whole village aunt hitty says twentyyear engagements s goin out o fashion in the big cities n im glad if they be theyd a never come in i told her if thered ever been an extry man in these parts but there never was if you got holt o one by good luck you had ter keep holt if t was two years or twentytwo or go without i used ter be too proud ter go without now ive got more sense thanks be why dont you go to the city yourself vildy jabe slocum aint got sprawl enough to find out anythin wuth knowin i suppose i could go though i dont like the prospect of it very much i havent been there for years but id ought to look after my property there once in a while deary me it seems as if we werent ever going to have any more peace mebbe we aint said samantha as they wound up the meetinghouse hill but aint we hed bout enough peace for one spell if peace was the best thing we could get in this world we might as well be them old cows by the side o the road there there aint nothin so peaceful as a cow when you come to that the two women went into the church more perplexed in mind than they would have cared to confess during the long prayer the minister could talk to god at much greater length than he could talk about him miss vilda prayed that the lord would provide the two little wanderers with some more suitable abidingplace than the white farm and that failing this he would inform his servant whether there was anything unchristian in sending them to a comfortable public asylum she then reminded heaven that she had made the foreign missionary society her residuary legatee a deed that established her claim to being a zealous member of the fold so that she could scarcely be blamed for not wishing to take two orphan children into her peaceful home well it is no great wonder that so faulty a prayer did not bring the wishedfor light at once but the ministering angels who had the fatherless little ones in their care did not allow miss vildas mind to rest quietly just as the congregation settled itself after the hymn and the palmleaf fans began to sway in the air a swallow flew in through the open window and after fluttering to and fro over the pulpit hid itself in a dark corner unnoticed by all save the small boys of the congregation to whom it was of course a priceless boon but miss vilda could not keep her wandering thoughts on the sermon any more than if she had been a small boy she was anything but superstitious but she had seen that swallow or some of its ancestors before it had flown into the church on the very sunday of her mothers death they had left her sitting in the highbacked rocker by the window the great family bible and her spectacles on the little lightstand beside her when they returned from church they had found their mother sitting as they left her with a smile on her face but silent and lifeless and through the glass of the spectacles as they lay on the printed page vilda had read the words for a bird of the air shall carry the voice and that which hath wings shall tell the matter had read them wonderingly and marked the place with reverent fingers the swallow flew in again years afterward she could not remember the day or the month but she could never forget the summer for it was the last bright one of her life the last that pretty martha ever spent at the white farm and now here was the swallow again for a bird of the air shall carry the voice and that which hath wings shall tell the matter miss vilda looked on the book and tried to follow the hymn but passages of scripture flocked into her head in place of good dr wattss verses and when the little melodeon played the interludes she could only hear yea the sparrow hath found her an house and the swallow a nest where she may lay her young even thy altars o lord of hosts my king and my god as a bird that wandereth from her nest so is a man that wandereth from his place the foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests but the son of man hath not where to lay his head and then the text fell on her bewildered ears and roused her from one reverie to plunge her in another it was chosen as it chanced from the first epistle of timothy chapter first verse fifth now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart that means the missionary society said miss vilda to her conscience doggedly but she knew better the parson the text or was it the bird had brought the message but for the moment she did not lend the hearing ear or the understanding heart scene x the supper table aunt hitty comes to make over and supplies back numbers to all the village histories aunt hitty otherwise mrs silas tarbox was as cheery and loquacious a person as you could find in a sabbath days journey she was armed with a substantial amount of knowledge at almost every conceivable point but if an unexpected emergency ever did arise her imagination was equal to the strain put upon it and rose superior to the occasion yet of an evening or on sunday she was no village gossip it was only when you put a needle in her hand or a cuttingboard in her lap that her memory started on its interminable journeyings through the fields of the past she knew every biography and every oughttobeography in the county and could tell you the branches of every genealogical tree in the village it was dusk at the white farm and a late supper was spread upon the hospitable board aunt hitty was always sure of a bountiful repast if one were going to economize one would not choose for that purpose the day when the village seamstress came to sew especially when the aforesaid lady served the community in the stead of a local newspaper the children had eaten their bread and milk and were out in the barn with jabe watching the milking aunt hitty was in a cheerful mood as she reflected on her days achievements out of dr jonathan cummins old cape coat she had carved a pair of brief trousers and a vest for timothy out of mrs jonathan cummins waterproof a serviceable jacket and out of deacon abijah cummins linen duster an additional coat and vest for warm days the owners of these garments had been dead many years but nothing was ever thrown away and for that matter very little given away at the white farm and the ancient habiliments had finally been diverted to a useful purpose i hope i shall relish my vittles tonight said aunt hitty as she poured her tea into her saucer and set the cup in her little blue cupplate but ive had the neuralgy so in my face that its ben more n ten days sence ive ben able to carry a knife to my mouth your meat vittles is always so tasty

store was talkin bout em all of a suddent they see the two of em startin to come down marm berrys hill right in plain sight of the store well one o the edgewood boys bate one o the pleasant river boys that they could tell which one of em was the laziest by the way they come down that hill so they all watched n bime by when jabe was most down to the bottom of the hill they was struck all of a heap to see him break into a kind of a jog trot n run down the balance o the way well then they fell to quarrelin for o course the pleasant river folks said aaron peek was the laziest n the edgewood boys declared he hednt got no such record for lazinesss jabe slocum hed an when they was explainin of it one way n nother elder banks come along n they asked him to be the judge when he heerd tell how t was he said he agreed with the edgewood folks that jabe was lazier n aaron well i snum i dont see how you make that out says the pleasant river boys for aaron walked down n jabe run a piece o the way if jabe slocum run says the elder as impressive as if he was preachin if jabe slocum ever run then t was because he was too doggoned lazy to hold back an that settled it no i couldnt eat another mossel miss cummins ive made out a splendid supper you cant git such pie n doughnuts anywhere else in the village n what i say i mean do you make your riz doughnuts with emptins i want to know si says theres more faculty in cookin flour food than there is in meatvictuals n i guess hes bout right it was bedtime and timothy was in his little room carrying on the most elaborate and complicated plots for reading the future it must be known that jabe slocum was as full of signs as a farmers almanac and he had given timothy more than one formula for attaining his secret desires old wellworn recipes for luck which had been tried for generations in pleasant river and which were absolutely certain in their results the favorites were star bright star light first star ive seen tonight wish i may wish i might get the wish i wish tonight and one still more impressive four posts upon my bed four corners overhead matthew mark luke and john bless the bed i lay upon matthew john luke and mark grant my wish and keep it dark these rhymes had been chanted with great solemnity and timothy sat by the open window in the sweet darkness of the summer night wishing that he and gay might stay forever in this sheltered spot ill make a sign of my very own he thought ill get gays ankletie and put it on the windowsill with the toe pointing out then ill wish that if we are going to stay at the white farm the angels will turn it around toe in to the room for a sign to me and if weve got to go ill wish they may leave it the other way and oh dear but im glad its so little and easy to move and then ill say matthew mark luke and john four times over without stopping as jabe told me to and then see how it turns out in the morning but the incantation was more soothing than the breath of miss vildas scarlet poppies and before the magical verse had fallen upon the drowsy air for the third time timothy was fast asleep with a smile of hope on his parted lips there was a sweet summer shower in the night the soft breezes fresh from shaded dells and nooks of fern fragrant with the odor of pine and vine and wet woodviolets blew over the thirsty meadows and golden stubblefields and brought an hour of gentle rain it sounded a merry tintinnabulation on samanthas milkpans wafted the scent of dripping honeysuckle into the farmhouse windows and drenched the nightcaps in which prudent farmers had dressed their haycocks next morning the green world stood on tiptoe to welcome the victorious sun and every little leaf shone as a childs eyes might shine at the remembrance of a joy just past a meadow lark perched on a swaying applebranch above marthas grave and poured out his soul in grateful melody and timothy wakened by natures sweet goodmorning leaped from the too fond embrace of miss vildas featherbed and lo a miracle the woodbine clung close to the wall beneath his window it was tipped with strong young shoots reaching out their innocent hands to cling to any support that offered and one baby tendril that seemed to have grown in a single night so delicate it was had somehow been blown by the sweet night wind from its drooping place on the parent vine and falling on the windowsill had curled lovingly round gays fairy shoe and held it fast scene xi the honeysuckle porch miss vilda decides that two is one too many and timothy breaks a hummingbirds egg it was a drowsy afternoon the grasshoppers chirped lazily in the warm grasses and the toads blinked sleepily under the shadows of the steps scarcely snapping at the flies as they danced by on silver wings down in the old garden the still pools in which the laughing brook rested itself here and there shone like glass under the strong beams of the sun and the baby hornedpouts rustled their whiskers drowsily and scarcely stirred the water as they glided slowly through its crystal depths the air was fragrant with the odor of newmown grass and the breath of wild strawberries that had fallen under the sickle to make the sweet hay sweeter with their crimson juices the whir of the scythes and the clatter of the mowing machine came from the distant meadows field mice and ground sparrows were aware that it probably was all up with their little summer residences for haying time was at its height and the giant mounted on the avenging chariot would speedily make his appearance and buttercups and daisies tufted grasses and blossoming weeds must all bow their heads before him and if there was anything more valuable hidden at their roots so much the worse and if a bird or a mouse had been especially farsighted and had located his family near a stump fence on a particularly uneven bit of ground why there was always a walking giant going about the edges with a gleaming scythe so that it was no wonder when reflecting on these matters after a days palpitation that the little denizens of the fields thought it very natural that there should be nihilists and socialists in the world plotting to overturn monopolies and other gigantic schemes for crushing the people rags enjoyed the excitement of haying immensely but then his life was one long holiday now anyway and the close quarters scanty fare and wearisome monotony of minerva court only visited his memory dimly when he was suffering the pangs of indigestion for in the first few weeks of his life at the white farm before his appetite was satiated he was wont to eat all the white cats food as well as his own and as this highway robbery took place in the retirement of the shed where samantha ann always swept them for their meals no human being was any the wiser and only the angels saw the white cat getting whiter and whiter and thinner and thinner while every day rags grew more corpulent and aldermanic in his figure but as his stomach was more favorably located than an aldermans he could still see the surrounding country and he had the further advantage of possessing four legs instead of two to carry it about timothy was happy too for he was a dreamer and this quiet life harmonized well with the airy fabric of his dreams he loved every stick and stone about the old homestead already because the place had brought him the only glimpse of freedom and joy that he could remember in these last bare and anxious years and if there were other and brighter years far far back in the misty gardens of the past they only yielded him a secret sense of having been a memory that could never be captured and put into words each morning he woke fearing to find his present life a vision and each morning he gazed with unspeakable gladness at the sweet reality that stretched itself before his eyes as he stood for a moment at his little window above the honeysuckle porch there were the cucumber frames he had helped jabe to make them the old summer house in the garden he had held the basket of nails and handed jabe the tools when he patched the roof the little workshop where samantha potted her tomato plants and he had been allowed to water them twice with fingers trembling at the thought of too little or too much for the tender things and the grindstone where jabe ground the scythes and told him stories as he sat and turned the wheel while gay sat beside them making dandelion chains yes it was all there and he was a part of it timothy had all the poets faculty of interpreting the secrets that are hidden in everyday things and when he lay prone on the warm earth in the cornfield deep among the varnished crispness of the jointed stalks the rustling of the green things growing sent thrills of joy along the sensitive currents of his being he was busy in his room this afternoon putting little partitions in some cigar boxes where very soon two or three dozen birds eggs were to repose in fleecelined nooks for jabe slocums collection of three summers every egg acquired in the most honorable manner as he explained had all passed into timothys hands that very day in consideration of various services well and conscientiously performed what a delight it was to handle the precious bits of things like porcelain in their daintiness to sort out the tender blue of the robin the speckled beauty of the sparrow to put the peewees and the thrushs each in its place with a swift throb of regret that there would have been another little soft throat bursting with a song if some one had not taken this pretty egg and there was over and above all the never ending marvel of the one hummingbirds egg that lay like a pearl in timothys slender brown hand too tiny to be stroked like the others only big enough to be stealthily kissed so tiny that he must get out of bed two or three times in the night to see if it is safe so tiny that he has horrible fears lest it should slip out or be stolen and so he must take the box to the window and let the moonlight shine upon the fleecy cotton and find that it is still there and cover it safely over again and creep back to bed wishing that he might see a thumbs bigness of burnished plumage sheltering it with her speck of a breast ah to have a little hummingbirds egg to love and to feel that it was his very own was something to timothy as it is to all starved human hearts full of love that can find no outlet miss vilda was knitting and samantha was shelling peas on the honeysuckle porch it had been several days since miss cummins had gone to the city and had come back no wiser than she went save that she had made a somewhat exhaustive study of the slums and had acquired a more intimate knowledge of the ways of the world than she had ever possessed before she had found minerva court and designated it on her return as a sink of iniquity to which africs sunny fountains indias coral strand and other tropical localities frequented by missionaries were virtuous in comparison for you dont expect anything of black heathens said she but there aint any question in my mind about the accountability of folks livin in a christian country where you can wear clothes and set up to an airtight stove and be comfortable to say nothin of meetinghouses every mile or two and bible societies and young mens and young womens christian associations and the gospel free to all with the exception of pew rents and contribution boxes and those omitted when its necessary she affirmed that the ladies and gentlemen whose acquaintance she had made in minerva court were without exception a mess of malefactors whose only good point was that lacking all human qualities they didnt care who she was nor where she came from nor what she came for so that as a matter of fact she had escaped without so much as leaving her name and place of residence she learned that mrs nancy simmons had sought pastures new in montana that miss ethel montmorency still resided in the metropolis but did not choose to disclose her modest dwellingplace to the casual inquiring female from the rural districts that a couple of children had disappeared from minerva court if they remembered rightly but that there was no disturbance made about the matter as it saved several people much trouble that mrs morrison had had no relations though she possessed a large circle of admiring friends that none of the admiring friends had called since her death or asked about the children and finally that number had been turned into a saloon and she was welcome to go in and slake her thirst for information with something more satisfactory than she could get outside the last straw and one that would have broken the back of any selfrespecting unmarried camel in the universe was the offensive belief on the part of the minerva courtiers that the rigid puritan maiden who was conducting the examination was the erring mother of the children visiting in disguise their former dwellingplace the conversation on this point becoming extremely pointed and jocose miss cummins finally turned and fled escaping to the railway station as fast as her trembling legs could carry her so the trip was a fruitless one and the mystery that enshrouded timothy and lady gay was as impenetrable as ever i wish id a gone to the city with you remarked samantha not that i could a found out anything more n you did for i guess there aint anybody thereabouts that knows more n we do and anybody t wants the children wont be troubled with the relation but id like to give them boldfaced jigs n hussies a good piece o my mind for once youre too timersome vildy i blieve ill go some o these days yet and carry a good stout umbrella in my hand too it says in a book somewhars that theres insults that can only be wiped out in blood ketch em hintin that im the mother of anybody thats all i declare i don know what our home missionary societiess doin not to regenerate them places or exterminate em one or t other somehow our religion dont take holt as it ought to it takes a burnin zeal to clean out them slum places and burnin zeal aint the style nowadays as my father used to say religions putty much like fish n pertetters if its hot its good n if its cold taint wuth a well a short word come in there but i wont say it speakin o religion i never had any experience in teachin but i didnt spose there was any knack bout teachin religion same as there is bout teachin readin n rithmetic but i hed hard work makin timothy understand that catechism you give him to learn the other sunday he was all upsot with doctrine when he come to say his lesson now you cant scare some children with doctrine no matter how hot you make it or mebbe they dont more n half believe it but timothys an awful sensitive creeter n when he come to that answer to the question what are you then by nature an enemy to god a child of satan and an heir of hell he hid his head on my shoulder and bust right out cryin how many gods is there s e after a spell land thinks i i knew he was a heathen but if he turns out to be an idolater whatever shall i do with him why whereve you ben fetched up s i theres only one god the high and mighty ruler of the univarse s i well s e there must be more n one for the god in this lesson isnt like the one in miss doras book at all land sakes i dont want to teach catechism agin in a hurry not tell ive hed a little spiritual instruction from the minister the fact is vildy that our bliefs when theyre picked out o the bible and set down square and solid thout any softening down n explainin that they aint so bad as they sound is too strong meat for babes now im orthodox to the core here she lowered her voice as if there might be a stray deacon in the garden but pears to me if i was makin out lessons for young ones i wouldnt fill em so plumb full o brimstun let em do a little suthin to deserve it fore you scare em to death say i jabe explained it all out to him after supper it beats all how he gets on with children id ruther hear how he explained it answered samantha sarcastically hes great on expoundin the scripters jest now well i hope itll last land sakes youd think nobody ever experienced religion afore hes so set up bout it youd spose he kep the latchkey o the heavenly mansions right in his vest pocket to hear him go on he couldnt be no more stuck up bout it if hed ben one o the two brothers that come over in three ships there goes elder nichols said miss vilda now theres a plan we hadnt thought of we might take the children over to purity village i think likely the shakers would take em they like to get young folks and break em into their doctrines tim d make a tiptop shaker laughed samantha hed be an elder afore he was twentyone i can seem to see him now with his hair danglin long in his neck a blue coat buttoned up to his chin and his hands seesawin up n down prancin round in them solemn dances tim would do well enough but i aint so sure of gay theyd have their hands full i guess i guess they would anybody that wanted to make a shaker out o her would a had to begin with her grandmother and that wouldnt a done nuther for they dont blieve in marryin and the thing would a stopped right there and gray wouldnt never a been born int the world and been a great sight better off interpolated miss vilda now dont talk that way vildy who knows what lays ahead o that child the lord may be savin her up to do some great work for him she added with a wild flight of the imagination she looks like it dont she asked vilda with a grim intonation but her face softened a little as she glanced at gay asleep on the rustic bench under the window the picture would have struck terror to the sadeyed жsthete but an artist who liked to see colors burn and glow on the canvas would have been glad to paint her a little frock of buttercup yellow calico bare neck and arms full of dimples hair that put the yellow calico to shame by reason of its tinge of copper skin of roses and milk that dared the microscope red smiling lips one stocking and ankletie kicked off and five pink toes calling for some silly woman to say this little pig went to market on them a great bunch of nasturtiums in one warm hand and the other buried in rags who was bursting with the white cats dinner and in such a state of snoring bliss that his tail wagged occasionally even in his dreams she dont look like a missionary if thats what you mean said samantha hotly she may not be called n elected to traipse over to africy with a testment in one hand n a sun umbreller in the other savin souls by the wholesale but t aint no mean service to go through the world stealin into folks hearts like a ray o sunshine n lightin up every place you step foot in i aint sayin anything against the child samanthy ann you said yourself she want cut out for a shaker no more she is laughed samantha when her good humor was restored shed like the singin n dancin well enough but t would be hard work smoothin the kink out of her hair n fixin it under one o their white sunday bunnets she wouldnt like livin altogether with the womenfolks nuther the only way for gay ll be to fetch her right up with the menfolks n hev her see they aint no great things anyway land sakes if t warnt for dogs n dark nights i shouldnt care if i never see a man but gay has em all on her string aready from the boy that brings the cows home for jabe to the man that takes the butter to the city the tin peddler give her a dipper this mornin and the fishman brought her a live fish in a tinpail well she makes the house a great sight brighter to live in you cant deny that vildy i aint denyin anything in particler she makes a good deal of work i know that much and i dont want you to get your heart set on one or both of em for t wont be no use we could make out with one of em i suppose if we had to but two is one too many they seem to set such store by one another that t would be like partin the siamese twins but there theyd pine awhile and then they d get over it anyhow theyll have to try oh yes you can git over the smallpox but youll carry the scars to your grave most likely i think t would be a sin to part them children i wouldnt do it no more n id tear away that scarlit bean thats twisted itself round n round that pink hollyhock there i stuck a stick in the ground and carried a string to the winder but i didnt git at it soon enough the bean vine kep on growin the other way towards the hollyhock then the other night i got my mad up n i jest oncurled it by main force n wropped it round the string n if youll believe me i happened to look at it this mornin n there it t was as nippant as you please coiled round the hollyhock agin then says i to myself samantha ann ripley youve known what t was to be everlastinly hectored n intefered with all your life now sposin you let that bean have its hollyhock if it wants it miss vilda looked at her sharply as she said samantha ann ripley i believe to my soul youre fussin bout dave milliken again well i aint every time i talk bout hollyhocks and scarlit beans i aint meanin dave milliken n me not by a long chalk i was only givin you my views bout partin them children thats all well all i can say is remarked miss vilda obstinately that those thats desirous of takin in two strange children and boardin and lodgin em till they get able to do it for themselves and runnin the resk of their turnin out heathens and malefactors like the folks they came from can do it if they want to if i come to see that the baby is too young to send away anywheres i may keep her a spell but the boy has got to go and thats the end of it youve been crowdin me into a corner about him for a week and now ive said my say alas that tiny hummingbirds egg was crushed to atoms crushed by a boys slender hand that had held it so gently for very fear of breaking it for poor little timothy jessup had heard his fate for the second time and knew that he must move on again for there was no room for him at the white farm scene xii the village lyddy pettigroves funeral lyddy pettigrove was dead not one person but a dozen had called in at the white farm to announce this fact and look curiously at samantha ann ripley to see how she took the news to say the truth the community did not seem to be overpowered by its bereavement there seemed to be a general feeling that mrs pettigrove had never been wanted in pleasant river coupled with a mild surprise that she should have been wanted anywhere else speculation was rife as to who would keep house for dave milliken and whether samantha ann would bury the ripleymilliken battleaxe and go to the funeral and whether mis pettigrove had left her property to david as was right or to her husbands sister in new hampshire which would be a sin and a shame but jest as likely as not though she was well off and didnt need it no more n a toad would a pocketbook and couldnt bear the sight o lyddy besides and whether mr pettigroves first wifes relations would be asked to the funeral bein as how they hadnt spoke for years n wouldnt set on the same side the meetinhouse but when you come to that if only the folks that was on good terms with lyddy pettigrove was asked to the funeral thered be a slim attendance and so on aunt hitty was the most important person in the village on these occasions it was she who assisted in the last solemn preparations and took the last solemn stitches and when all was done and she hung her little reticule on her arm and started to walk from the house of bereavement to her own home where si was anxiously awaiting his nightly draught of gossip no royal herald could have been looked for with greater interest or greeted with greater cordiality all the housewives that lived on the direct road were on their doorsteps so as not to lose a moment and all that lived off the road had seen her from the upstairs windows and were at the gate to waylay her as she passed at such a moment aunt hittys bosom swelled with honest pride and she humbly thanked her maker that she had been bred to the use of scissors and needle two days of this intoxicating popularity had just passed the funeral was over and she ran in to the white farm on her way home to carry a message and to see with her own eyes how samantha ann ripley was comporting herself you didnt git out to the funral did ye samanthy she asked as she seated herself cosily by the kitchen window no i didnt i never could see the propriety o goin to see folks dead that you never went to see alive how you talk thats one way o puttin it well everybody was lookin for you and you missed a very pleasant funral david n i arranged everything as neat as wax and it all went off like clockwork if i do say so as shouldnt mis pettigrove made a beautiful remains im glad to hear it its the first beautiful thing she ever did make i guess how you talk aint you a leetle hard on lyddy samanthy she warnt sech a bad neighbor and she couldnt help bein kind o sour like she was born with her teeth on aidge to begin with and then shed ben through seas o trouble with them pettigroves like enough but even if folks has ben through seas o trouble they neednt be everlastinly spittin up salt brine passin through the valley of sorrow they make it full o fountings thats what the psalms says bout bearin trouble lyddy warnt much on fountings said aunt hitty contemplatively but there we hadnt ought to speak nothin but good o the dead land sakes youd oughter heard elder weekses remarks they was splendid we aint hed better remarks to any funral here for years i shouldnt a suspicioned he was preachin bout lyddy though our ministers sick abed you know n warnt able to conduct the excises si thinks he went to bed apurpose but i wouldnt hev it repeated so david got elder weeks from moderation he warnt much acquainted with the remains but he done all the better for that hes got a wondful faculty for funrals they say hes sent for for miles around hed just come from a funral nine miles the other side o moderation up on the bluebry road so he was a leetle mite late n david n i was as nervous as witches for every room was cram full n the thermometer stood at in the front entry n the bearers sot out there by the wellcurb with the sun beatin down on em n two of em squire hicks n deacon dunn was fast asleep inside everything was as silent s the tomb cept the kitchen clock n that ticked loud enough to wake the dead most i thought i should go inter conniptions i set out to git up n throw a shawl over it it ticked so loud then while we was all settin there s solemn s the last trump what does old aunt beccy burnham do but git up from the kitchen corner where she sot take the cornbroom from behind the door and sweep down a cobweb that was lodged up in one o the corners over the mantelpiece we all looked at one nother n i thought for a second somebody d laugh but nobody dassed n there warnt a sound in the room s aunt beccy sot down agin without movin a muscle in her face just then the minister drove in the yard with his horse sweatin like rain but behind time as he was he never slighted things a mite his prayer was twentythree minutes by the clock twentythree minutes is a leetle mite too long this kind o weather but it was an allembracin prayer n no mistake si said when he got through the lord had his instructions on most any pint that was likely to come up durin the season when he got through his remarks there warnt a dry eye in the room i dont spose it made any odds whether he was preachin bout mis pettigrove or the woman on the bluebry road it was a movin elevatin discourse n that was what we went there for it wouldnt a ben so elevatin if hed told the truth said samantha but there i aint goin to spit no more spite out lyddy pettigroves dead n i hope shes in heaven and all i can say is that shell be dretful busy up there ondoin all she done down here you say there was a good many out yes we aint hed so many out for years so susanna rideout says and shed ought to know for she aint missed a funral sence she was nine years old and shes eightyone come thanksgivin ef she holds out that long she says funrals is bout the only recreation she has n she doos git a heap o satisfaction out of em n no mistake shell go early afore any o the compny assembles shell say her clock must a ben fast n then theyll ask her to set down n make herself to home then shell choose her seat accordin to the way the house is planned she wont git too fur from the remains because shell want to see how the famly appear when they take their last look but shell want to git opposite a door where she can look into the other rooms n see whether they shed any tears when the minister begins his remarks she allers takes a little gum camphire in her pocket sot if anybody faints away durin the long prayer shes right on hand bein near the door she can hear all the minister says n how the order o the mourners is called n ef she aint too fur from the front winders she can hev a good view of the bearers and the mourners as they get into the kerridges theres a sight in knowin how to manage at a funral it takes faculty same as anything else how does david bear up asked miss vilda oh hes calm david was always calm and resigned you know he shed tears durin the remarks but i spose mebbe he was wishin they was more appropriate hes about the forlornest creeter now you ever see in your life there never was any selfassume to david milliken i declare its enough to make you cry jest to look at him i cooked up victuals enough to last him a week but that aint no way for menfolks to live when he comes in at noontime he washes up out by the pump n then he steps int the buttry n pours some cold tea out the teapot n takes a drink of it n then a bite o cold punkin pie n then more tea all the time stanin up to the shelf stid o sittin down like a christian and lookin out the winder as if his mind was in hard scrabble n his body in buttertown n as if he didnt know whether he was eatin pie or putty land i cant bear to watch him i dassay he misses lyddys jawin it must seem dretful quiet i declare it seems to me that meek resigned folks thats too good to squeal out when theyre abused is allers the ones that gits the hardest knocks but i dont doubt but what theres goin to be an everlastin evenupness somewheres samantha got up suddenly and went to the sink window its bout time the men come in for their dinner she said but though jabe was mowing the millstone hill and though he wore a red flannel shirt she could not see him because of the tears that blinded her eyes scene xiii the village pleasant river is baptized with the spirit of adoption but i didnt come in to talk bout the funral continued aunt hitty wishing that human flesh were transparent so that she could see through samanthy ann ripleys back i had an errant n oughter ben in afore but ive ben so busy these

doctors wife thinks praps shell be willin to take the baby n board her for nothing if somebody else ll pay for her clothes at least shell try her a spell n see how she behaves n whether shes good compny for her own little girl thats a reglar limb o satan anyway n considable worse sence shes had the scarlit fever n deef as a post too tho theyre blisterin her n she may git over it i told her id

pay for her clothes ruther n hev so much talk bout it tho ive told everybody that they walked right in to the front gate n you n samanthy never set eyes on em before n didnt know where they come from samantha wiped her eyes surreptitiously with the dishcloth and turned a scarlet face away from the window timothy was getting his passle o chips gay had spied him and toddling over to his side holding her dress above the prettiest little pair of feet that ever trod clover had sat down on him a favorite pastime of hers and after jolting her fat little person up and down on his patient head rolled herself over and gave him a series of bearhugs timothy looked pale and languid samantha thought and though gay waited for a frolic with her most adorable smile he only lifted her coral necklace to kiss the place where it hung and tied on her sunbonnet soberly samantha wished that vilda had been looking out of the window her own heart didnt need softening but somebody elses did she was afraid im much obliged to you for takin so much interest in the children said miss vilda primly and particlerly for clearin our characters which everybody that lives in this village has to do for each other bout once a week and the rest o the time they take for spoilin of em and the doctors wife is very kind but i shouldnt think o sendin the baby away so sudden while the boy is still here it wouldnt be no kindness to mis mayo for shed have a regular french and indian war right on her premises it was here the children came just as you say and its our duty to see em settled in good homes but i shall take a few days more to think bout it and ill let her know by saturday night what weve decided to do thats the most meddlesome inteferin gossipin woman in this county she added as mrs silas tarbox closed the front gate and i wouldnt have her do another days work at this house if i didnt have to but its worse for them that dont have her than for them that does now theres the baptist minister drivin up to the barn what under the canopy does he want tell him jabe aint to home samanthy no you neednt for hes hitched and seems to be comin to the front door i never could abide the looks of him said samantha peering over miss vildas shoulder no man with a light chiny blue eye like that oughter be allowed to go int the ministry for you cant love your brother whom you hev seen with that kind of an eye and how are you goin to love the lord whom you hev not seen mr southwick who was a spare little man in a long linen duster that looked as if it had not been in the water as often as its wearer sat down timidly on the settle and cleared his throat ive come to talk with you on a little matter of business miss cummins brother slocum has a conferred with me on the subject of a a couple of unfortunate children who have a strayed as it were under your hospitable roof and whom a you are properly anxious to place a under other rooves as it were now you are aware perhaps that mrs southwick and i have no children living though we have at times had our quivers full of them a as the scripture says but the lord gave and the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord however that is a neither here nor there brother slocum has so interested us that my wife who is leading the womans auxiliary praying legion this afternoon or she would have come herself wishes me to say that she would like to receive one of these a little waifs into our family on probation as it were and if satisfactory to both parties to bring it up a somewhat as our own in the nurture and admonition of the lord samantha waited in breathless suspense miss vilda never would fling away an opportunity of putting a nameless homeless child under the roof of a minister of the gospel even if he was a baptist with a chiny blue eye at this exciting juncture there was a clatter of small feet the door burst open and the unfortunate waifs under consideration raced across the floor to the table where miss vilda and samantha were seated gays sunbonnet trailed behind her every hair on her head curled separately and she held her ragdoll upside down with entire absence of decorum timothys paleness whatever the cause had disappeared for the moment and his eyes shone like stars oh miss vilda he cried breathlessly dear miss vilda and samanthy the gray hen did want to have chickens and that is what made her so cross and she is setting and weve found her nest in the alder bushes by the pond gay hens net in er buttes by er pond sung gay like a greek chorus and we sat down softly beside the pond but gay sat into it gay sat wite into it an dolly dot her dess wet but gay nite ittle dirl gay didnt det wet and by and by the gray hen got off to get a drink of water to det a dink o water and we counted the eggs and there were thirteen big ones firteen drate bid ones so that the darling thing had to swell out to cover them up darlin fin serwelled out an tuvvered em up said gay going through the same operation yes said miss vilda looking covertly at mr southwick who had an eye for beauty notwithstanding samanthas strictures thats very nice but you mustnt stay here now we are talkin to the minister run away both of you and let the settin hen alone well as i was goin to say mr southwick youre very kind and so s your wife and im sure timothy thats the boys name would be a great help and comfort to both of you if youre fond of children and we should be glad to have him near by for we feel kind of responsible for him though hes no relation of ours and well think about the matter over night and let you know in the morning yes exactly i see i see but it was the young child the a female child that my wife desired to take into her family she does not care for boys and she is particularly fond of girls and so am i very fond of girls a in reason miss vilda all at once made up her mind on one point and only wished that samantha wouldnt stare at her as if she had never seen her before im sorry to disappoint your wife mr southwick it seems that mrs tarbox and jabez slocum have been offerin the child to every family in the village and i spose bime bye theyll have the politeness to offer her to me but at any rate whether they do or not i propose to keep her myself and id thank you to tell folks so if they ask you mebbe youd better give it out from the pulpit though i can let mis tarbox know and that will answer the same purpose this is the place the baby was brought and this is the place shes goin to stay vildy youre a good woman cried samantha when the door closed on the reverend mr southwick im proud o you vildy n i take back all the hard thoughts ive ben hevin about you lately the idee o that chinyeyed preacher thinkin he was goin to carry that child home in his buggy with hardly so much as sayin thank you marm i like his baptist imperdence his wife hed better wash his duster afore she adopts any children if theyd carry their theories bout immersion s fur as their close t wouldnt be no harm i don know as id have agreed to keep either of em ef the whole village hadnt intefered and wanted to manage my business for me and be so dretful charitable all of a sudden and dictate to me and try to show me my duty i havent had a minutes peace for more n a fortnight and now i hope theyll let me alone ill take the boy to the city tomorrow if i live to see the light and when i come back ill tie up the gate and keep the neighbors out till this nine days wonder gets crowded out o their heads by somethin new youre goin to take timothy to the city are you asked samantha sharply thats what im goin to do and the sooner the better for everybody concerned timothy shut that door and run out to the barn and dont you let me see you again till suppertime do you hear me and youre goin to put him in one o them homes yes i am you see for yourself we cant find any place fer him hereabouts well ive ben waitin for days to see what you was goin to do and now ill tell you what im goin to do if youd like to know im goin to keep timothy myself to have and to hold from this time forth and for evermore as the bible says thats what im goin to do miss cummins gasped with astonishment i mean what i say vildy i aint so well off as some but i aint a pauper not by no means ive ben layin by a little every year for twenty years n you know well enough what for but thats all over for ever and ever amen thanks be and i aint got chick nor child nor blood relation in the world and if i choose to take somebody to do for why its nobodys affairs but my own you cant do it and you shant do it said miss vilda excitedly you aint goin to make a fool of yourself if i can help it we cant have two children clutterin up this place and eatin us out of house and home and thats the end of it it aint the end of it vildy cummins not by no manner o means if we cant keep both of em do you know what i think bout it i think wed ought to give away the one that everybody wants and keep the other that nobody does want more fools they thats religion accordin to my way o thinkin i love the baby dear knows but see here who planned this thing all out timothy who took that baby up in his own arms and fetched her out o that den o thieves timothy who stood all the resk of gittin that innocent lamb out o that sink of iniquity and hed wit enough to bring her to a place where she could grow up respectable timothy and do you ketch him say in a word bout himself from fust to last not by no manner o means that aint timothy and what doos the lovin genrous faithful little soul git he gits his labor for his pains he hears folks say right to his face that nobody wants him and everybody wants gay and if he didnt have a disposition like a cherubimanseraphim and better too for they continually do cry now i come to think of it hed be sour and bitter stid o bein good as an angel in a picturebook from sunup to sundown miss vilda was crushed by the overpowering weight of this argument and did not even try to stem the resistless tide of samanthas eloquence and now folks is all of a high to take in the baby for a spell jest for a plaything because her hair curls n shes handsome n light complected n cunning n a girl whatever that amounts to is more n i know and that blessed boy is tread under foot as if he warnt no better n an angleworm and do you mean to tell me you dont see the lords hand in this hull busness vildy cummins theres other kinds o meracles besides buddin rods n burnin bushes n loaves n fishes what do you spose guided that boy to pass all the other houses in this village n turn in at the white farm dont you spose he was led well i dont need a bible nor yit a concordance to tell me he was he didnt know there was plenty n to spare inside this gate a great empty house n full cellar n hay n stock in the barn and cowpons in the bank n two lone misable women inside with nothin to do but keep flies out in summertime n pile wood on in wintertime till they got so withered up n gnarly they warnt hardly wuth getherin int the everlastin harvest he didnt know it i say but the lord did n the lords intention was to give us a chance to make our callin n election sure n we cant do that by turnin our backs on his messenger and puttin of him oudoors the lord intended them children should stay together or he wouldnt a started em out that way now thats as plain as the nose on my face n thats considable plain as ive ben told afore now n can see for myself in the glass without any help from anybody thanks be everybody ll laugh at us for a couple o softhearted fools said miss vilda feebly after a long pause well be a spectacle for the whole village what if we be lets be a spectacle then said samantha stoutly well be a spectacle for the angels as well as the village when you come to that when they look down n see us gittin outside this dooryard n doin one o the lords chores for the first time in ten or fifteen years i guess theyll be considable excited but theres no use in talkin ive made up my mind vildy weve lived together for thirty years n aint hardly hed an ugly word n dretful dull it hez ben for both of us n i shant live nowheres else without you tell me to go but ive got lots o good work in me yit n im goin to take that boy up n give him a chance n let him stay alongside o the thing he loves best in the world and if there aint room for all of us in the fourteen rooms o this part o the house timothy n i can live in the l as youve allers intended i should if i got married and i guess this is bout as near to gittin married as either of us ever ll git now n considable nearer n ive expected to git lately and ill tell timothy this very night when he goes to bed for hes grievin himself into a fit o sickness as anybody can tell thats got a glass eye in their heads scene xiv a point of honor timothy jessup runs away a second time and like other blessings brightens as he takes his flight it was almost dusk and jabe slocum was struggling with the nightly problem of getting the cow from the pasture without any expenditure of personal effort timothy was nowhere to be found or he would go and be glad to do the trifling service for his kind friend without other remuneration than a cordial thank you failing timothy there was always billy pennell who would not go for a thank you being a boy of a sordid and miserly manner of thought but who would go for a cent and chalk the cent up which made it a more reasonable charge than would appear to the casual observer so jabe lighted his corncob pipe and extended himself under a willowtree beside the pond singing in a cheerful fashion tremblin sinner calm your fears jesus is always ready cease your sin and dry your tears jesus is always ready and dretful lucky for you he is muttered samantha who had come to look for timothy jabe jabe has timothy gone for the cow dunno jest what i was goin to ask you when i got roun to it well how are you goin to find out find out by seein the cow if he hez gone an by not seein no cow if he haint im comftable either way it turns out one o them writin fellers that was up here summerin said they also serve whod ruther stan n wait d be a good motto for me n hes about right when ive ben hayin look down there at the shiners aint they cool gorry i wish i was a fish if you was you wouldnt wear your fins out thats certain come now samanthy dont be hard on a feller after his days work want me to git up n blow the horn for the boy no thank you answered samantha cuttingly i wouldnt ask you to spend your precious breath for fear youd be too lazy to draw it in agin when i want to get anything done i can genally spunk up sprawl enough to do it myself thanks be wall now samanthy you cheat the menfolks out of a heap o pleasure bein so allfired independent did ye know it tremblin sinner calm your fears jesus is always ready when d you see him last i haint seen him sence bout noontime warnt he into supper no we thought he was off with you well i guess hes gone for the cow but i should think hed be hungry its kind o queer miss vilda was seated at the open window in the kitchen and lady gay was enthroned in her lap sleepy affectionate tractable adorable how would you like to live here at the white farm deary asked miss vilda o yet i yike to live here if timfy doin to live here too i yike oo i yike samfy i yike dabe i yike white tat n white tow n white bossy n my boofely desses n my boofely dolly n er day hen n i yikes evelybuddy but youd stay here like a nice little girl if timothy had

seepy its half past eight said samantha coming into the kitchen and timothy aint nowheres to be found and jabe haint seen him sence noontime you neednt be scared for fear youve lost your bargain remarked miss vilda sarcastically there aint so many places open to the boy that hell turn his back on this one i guess yet though the days of chivalry were over that was precisely what timothy jessup had done wilkinss wood was a quiet stretch of timber land that lay along the banks of pleasant river and though the natives for the most part never noticed but that it was paved with asphalt and roofed in with oilcloth yet it was nevertheless the most tranquil bit of loveliness in all the country round for there the river twisted and turned and sparkled in the sun and bent itself in graceful courtesies of farewell to the hills it was leaving and kissed the velvet meadows that stooped to drink from its brimming cup and lapped the trees gently as they hung over its crystal mirrors the better to see their own fresh beauty and here it wound about and in and out laughing in the morning sunlight to think of the tiny streamlet out of which it grew paling and shimmering at evening when it held the stars and moonbeams in its bosom and trembling in the night wind to think of the great unknown sea into whose arms it was hurrying here was a quiet pool where the rushes bent to the breeze and the quail dipped her wing and there a winding path where the cattle came down to the edge and having looked upon the scene and found it all very good dipped their sleek heads to drink and drink and drink of the rivers nectar here the first pink mayflowers pushed their sweet heads through the reluctant earth and waxen indian pipes grew in the moist places and yellow violets hid themselves beneath their modest leaves and here sat timothy with all his heart in his eyes bidding goodby to all this soft and tender loveliness and there by his side faithful unto death but very much in hopes of something better sat rags and thought it a fine enough prospect but one that could be beaten at all points by a bit of shedview he knew of a superincumbent hashpan an empty milkdish and an emaciated white cat flying round a corner the remembrance of these past joys brought the tears to his eyes but he forbore to let them flow lest he should add to the griefs of his little master which for aught he knew might be as heavy as his own timothy was comporting himself at this trying crisis neither as a hero nor as a martyr there is no need of exaggerating his virtues enough to say not that he was a hero but that he had in him the stuff out of which heroes are made win his heart and fire his imagination and there is no splendid deed of which the little hero would not have been capable but that he knew precisely what he was leaving behind or what he was going forth to meet would be saying too much one thing he did know that miss vilda had said distinctly that two was one too many and that he was the objectionable unit referred to and in addition to this he had more than once heard that very day that nobody in pleasant river wanted him but that there would be plenty of homes open to gay if he were safely out of the way a little allusion to a home which he caught when he was just bringing in a fourleafed clover to show to samantha completed the stock of ideas from which he reasoned he was very clear on one point and that was that he would never be taken alive and put in a home with a capital h he respected homes he approved of them for other boys but personally they were unpleasant to him and he had no intention of dwelling in one if he could help it the situation did not appear utterly hopeless in his eyes he had his original dollar and eightyfive cents in money rags and he had supped like kings off wild blackberries and hard gingerbread and more than all he was young and mercifully blind to all but the immediate present yet even in taking the most commonplace possible view of his character it would be folly to affirm that he was anything but unhappy his soul was not sustained by the consciousness of having done a selfforgetting and manly act for he was not old enough to have such a consciousness which is something the good god gives us a little later on to help us over some of the hard places nobody wants me nobody wants me he sighed as he lay down under the trees nobody ever did want me i wonder why and everybody loves my darling gay and wants to keep her and i dont wonder about that but oh if i only belonged to somebody cuddle up close little ragsy weve got nobody but just each other and you can put your head into the other pocket that hasnt got the gingerbread in it if you please if i only was like that little butchers boy that he lets ride on the seat with him and hold the reins when he takes meat into the houses or if i only was that freckledface boy with the straw hat that lives on the way to the store his mother keeps coming out to the gate on purpose to kiss him or if i was even billy pennell hes had three mothers and two fathers in three years jabe says jabe likes me i think but he cant have me live at his house because his mother is the kind that needs plenty of room he says and samanthy has no house but i did what i tried to do i got away from minerva court and found a lovely place for gay to live with two mothers instead of one and maybe theyll tell her about me when she grows bigger and then shell know i didnt want to run away from her but whether they tell her or not shes only a little baby and boys must always take care of girls thats what my dreammother whispers to me in the night and thats what im always come gentle sleep and take this friendless little knighterrant in thy kind arms bear him across the rainbow bridge and lull him to rest with the soft plash of waves and sighing of branches cover him with thy mantle of dreams sweet goddess and give him in sleep what he hath never had in waking meanwhile a more dramatic scene was being enacted at the white farm it was nine oclock and samantha had gone from pond to garden shed to barn and gate to dairy a dozen times but there was no sign of timothy gay had refused to be undressed till timfy appeared on the premises but had fallen asleep in spite of the most valiant resolution and was borne upstairs by samantha who made her ready for bed without waking her as she picked up the heap of clothes to lay them neatly on a chair a bit of folded paper fell from the bosom of the little dress she glanced at it turned it over and over read it quite through then after retiring behind her apron a moment she went swiftly downstairs to the diningroom where miss avilda and jabe were sitting there she exclaimed with a triumphant sob as she laid the paper down in front of the astonished couple thats a letter from timothy hes run away n i dont blame him a mite n i hope folks ll be satisfied now theyve got red of the blessed angel n turned him outdoors without a roof to his head read it out n see what kind of a boy weve showed the door to dere miss vilder and sermanthy i herd you say i cood not stay here enny longer and other peeple sed nobuddy wood have me and what you sed about the home but as i do not like homes i am going to run away if its all the same to you please give jabe back his birds egs with my love and i am sorry i broak the hummingbirds one but it was a naxident pleas take good care of gay and i will come back and get her when i am ritch i thank you very mutch for such a happy time and the white farm is the most butifull plase in the whole whirld tim p s i wood not tell you if i was going to stay but billy penel thros stones at the white cow witch i fere will get into her milk so no more from tim i am sorry not to say good by but i am afrade on acount of the home so i put them here illustration kisses the paper fell from miss vildas trembling fingers and two salt tears dropped into the kissing places the lord forgive me she said at length and it was many a year since any one had seen her so moved the lord forgive me for a hardhearted old woman and give me a chance to make it right not one reproachful word does he say to us about showin partiality not one and my heart has kind of yearned over that boy from the first but just because he had marthys eyes he kept bringin up the past to me and i never looked at him without rememberin how hard and unforgivin id ben to her and thinkin if id petted and humored her a little and made life pleasanter perhaps shed never have gone away and ive scrimped and saved and laid up money till it comes hard to pay it out and when i thought of bringin up and schoolin two children i callated i couldnt afford it and yet ive got ten thousand dollars in the bank and the best farm for miles around samanthy you go fetch my bonnet and shawl jabe you go and hitch up maria and well go after that boy and fetch him back if hes to be found anywheres above ground and if we come across any more o the same family trampin around the country well bring them along home while were about it and see if we cant get some sleep and some comfort out o life and the missionary society can look somewheres else for money theres plenty o folks that dont get good works set right down in their front yards for em to do ill look out for the individyals for a spell and let the other folks support the societies scene xv wilkinss woods like all dogs in fiction the faithful rags guides miss vilda to his little master samantha ran out to the barn to hold the lantern and see that jabe didnt go to sleep while he was harnessing maria but he seemed unusually spry for him although he was conducting himself in a somewhat strange and unusual manner his loose figure shook from time to time as with severe chills he seemed too weak to hold up the shafts and so he finally dropped them and hung round marias neck in a sort of mild speechless convulsion what under the canopy ails you jabe slocum asked samantha i spose its one o them everlastin old addled jokes o yourn youre tryin to hatch out but its a poor time to be jokin now whats the matter with you ask me no questions n ill tell you no lies is an awful good motto chuckled jabe with a new explosion of mirth that stretched his mouth to an alarming extent oh there i cant hold in nother minute i shall bust if i don tell somebody set down on that nail kag samanthy n ill let you hev a leetle slice o this joke if youll keep it to yourself you see i know bout whar to look for this here runaway you hev nt got him stowed away anywheres hev you if you hev itll be the last joke youll play on vildy cummins i can tell you that much jabe slocum no i haint stowed him away but i can tell putty nigh whar hes stowed hisself away and im ready to die alaffin to see how its all turned out jest as i suspicioned t would you see samanthy ann i thought bout a week ago t would be well enough to kind o create a demand for the young ones so t theyd hev some kind of a market value and so i got elder southwick n aunt hitty kind o started on that tack n it worked out slick as a whistle tho they didnt know i was usin of em as innercent instruments and aunt hitty dont need much encouragement to talk its a heap easier for her to drizzle n it is to hold up well ive ben surmisin for a week that the boy meant to run away and today i was dead sure of it for he come to me this afternoon when i was restin a spell on account o the hot sun and he was awful lowsperrited n he asked me every namable kind of a question you ever hearn tell of and all so simpleminded that i jest turned him inside out thout his knowin what i was doin well when i found out what he was up to i could a stopped him then n there tho i don know s i would anyhow for i shouldnt like livin in a sylum any better n he doos but thinks i to myself thinks i id better let him run away jest as hes a plannin and why cause itll show what kind o stuff hes made of and that he aint no beggar layin roun whar he aint wanted but a selfrespectin boy thats wuth lookin after and thinks i samanthy n i know the wuth of him aready but theres them that haint waked up to it yit namely miss vildy trypheny cummins and as miss vildy trypheny cummins is that kind o cattle that cant be drove but hez to be kind o coaxed along mebbe this runninaway bizness ll be the thing thatll fetch her roun to our way o thinkin now i wouldnt deceive nobody for a farm down east with a pig on it but thinks i there aint no deceivin bout this he don know i know hes goin to run away so hes all square and he never told me nothin bout his plans so im all square and miss vildys good as eighteenkarat gold when she gets roun to it so shell be all square and samanthys got her blinders on n dont see nothin to the right nor to the left so shes all square and i aint inteferin with nobody im jest lettin things go the way theyve started n stanin to one side to see whar theyll fetch up kind o like providence im leavin miss vildy a free agent but im shapin circumstances so s to give her a chance but land if id fixed up the thing to suit myself i couldnt a managed it as timothy hez thout knowin that he was managin anything look at that letter bizness now i couldnt a writ that letter better myself and the sperrit o the little feller jest takin his dorg n lightin out with nothin but a perlite goodbye well i cant stop to talk no more bout it now or we wont ketch him but well jest try wilkinss woods maria n see how that goes the river road leads to edgewood n hillside whar theres considable hayin bein done as i happened to mention to timothy this afternoon and plenty o blackberries side the road specially after you pass the woodpile on the lefthand side whar theres a reglar garding of em right side of an old hossblanket thats layin there one that i happened to leave there one time when i was sleepin oudoors for my health and that was this afternoon bout five oclock so i guess it haint changed its location sence jabe and miss vilda drove in silence along the river road that skirted wilkinss woods a place where jabe had taken timothy more than once so he informed miss vilda and a likely road for him to travel if he were on his way to some of the near villages poor miss vilda fifty years old and in twenty summers and winters scarcely one lovely thought had blossomed into lovelier deed and shed its sweetness over her arid and colorless life and now under the magic spell of tender little hands and innocent lips of luminous eyes that looked wistfully into hers for a welcome and the touch of a groping helplessness that fastened upon her strength the woman in her woke into life and the beauty and fragrance of longago summers came back again as in a dream after having driven three or four miles they heard a melancholy sound in the distance and as they approached a huge woodpile on the left side of the road they saw a small woolly form perched on a little rise of ground howling most melodiously at the august moon that hung like a ball of red fire in the cloudless sky thats a sign of death in the family aint it jabe whispered miss vilda faintly so they say he answered cheerfully but if t is i can count for it bein as how i fertilized the pond lilies with a mess o four white kittens this afternoon and as rags was with me when i done it he may know what hes bayin bout if t is rags n it looks enough like him to be him n it is him by jiminy n timothys sure to be somewheres near ill get out n look roun a little you set right still jabe ill get out myself for if i find that boy ive got something to say to him that nobody can say for me as jabe drew the wagon up beside the fence rags bounded out to meet them he knew maria bless your soul the minute he clapped his eyes on her and as he approached miss vildas congress boot his quivering whiskers seemed to say now where have i smelled that boot before if i mistake not it has been applied to me more than once ha i have it miss vilda cummins of the white farm owner of the white cat and hashpan and companion of the lady with the firm hand who wields the broom whereupon he leaped up on miss cumminss black alpaca skirts and made for her flannel garters in a way that she particularly disliked now said she if hes anything like the dogs you hear tell of hell take us right to timothy wall i don know said jabe cautiously theres so many kinds o dorg in him you cant hardly tell what he will do when dorgs is mixed beyond a certain pint it kind o muddles up their instincks n you cant rely on em still you might try him hold still n see what hell do miss vilda held still and rags jumped on her skirts now set down n see whar hell go miss vilda sat down and rags went into her lap now make believe start somewheres n mebbe hell get ahead n put you on the right track miss vilda did as she was told and rags followed close at her heels gorry i never see sech a fool or wait ill tell you whats the matter with him mebbe he aint sech a fool as he looks you see he knows timothy wants to run away and dont want to be found n clapped into a sylum n nuther does he and not bein sure o your intentions he aint agoin to give hisself away thats the way i size mr rags up nice doggy nice doggy shuddered miss vilda as rags precipitated himself upon her again show me where timothy is and then well go back home and have some nice bones run and find your little master thats a good doggy it would be a clever philosopher who could divine ragss special method of logic or who could write him down either as fool or sage suffice it to say that at this moment having run in all other possible directions and wishing doubtless to keep on moving he ran round the woodpile and miss vilda following close behind came upon a little figure stretched on a bit of gray blanket the pale face shone paler in the moonlight there were traces of tears on the cheeks but there was a heavenly smile on his parted lips as if his dreammother had rocked him to sleep in her arms rags stole away to jabe for even mixed dogs have some delicacy and miss vilda went down on her knees beside the sleeping boy timothy timothy wake up no answer timothy wake up ive come to take you home timothy woke with a sob and a start at that hated word and seeing miss vilda at once jumped to conclusions please please dear miss vildy dont take me to the home but find me some other place and ill never never run away from it my blessed little boy ive come to take you back to your own home at the white farm it was too good to believe all at once nobody wants me there he said hesitatingly everybody wants you there replied miss vilda with a softer note in her voice than anybody had ever heard there before samantha wants you gay wants you and jabe is waiting out here with maria for he wants you but do you want me faltered the boy i want you more than all of em put together timothy i want you and i need you most of all cried miss vilda with the tears coursing down her withered cheeks and if youll only forgive me for hurtin your feelins and makin you run away you shall come to the white farm and be my own boy as long as you live oh miss vildy darling miss vildy are we both of us adopted and are we truly going to live with you all the time and never have to go to the home whereupon the boy flung his loving arms round miss vildas neck in an ecstasy of gratitude and in that sweet embrace of trust and confidence and joy the stone was rolled away once and forever from the sepulchre of miss vildas heart and easter morning broke there scene xvi the new homestead timothys quest is ended and samantha says come along dave jabe slocum do you know its goin on seven oclock n not a single chore done jabe yawned turned over and listened to samanthas unwelcome voice which considerably louder than the voice of conscience came from the outside world to disturb his delicious morning slumbers jabe slocum do you hear me hear you gorry youd wake the seven sleepers if they was any whar within earshot well will you git up yes ill git up if youre goin to hev a brash bout it but i wish you hednt waked me so awful suddent dont ontwist the mornin glory s my motto wait a spell n the sun ll do it n save a heap o wear n tear besides go long ill git up ive heerd that story afore n i wont go long tell i hear you step foot on the floor scoot i tell yer ill be out in a jiffy yes i think i see yer your jiffies are considable like golden opportunities there aint more n one of em in a lifetime and having shot this parthian arrow samantha departed as one having done her duty in that humble sphere of action to which it had pleased providence to call her these were beautiful autumn days at the white farm the orchards were gleaming the grapes hung purple on the vines and the odor of ripening fruit was in the hazy air the pink spirea had cast its feathery petals by the gray stone walls but the welcome goldenrod bloomed in royal profusion along the brown waysides and a crimson leaf hung here and there in the treetops just to give a hint of the fall styles in color heaps of yellow pumpkins and squashes lay in the corners of the fields cornstalks bowed their heads beneath the weight of ripened ears beans threatened to burst through their yellow pods the sound of the threshing machine was heard in the land and the hull univarse wanted to be waited on to once according to jabe slocum for as he affirmed yer couldnt ketch up with your work nohow for if yer set up nights n worked sundays the craps d ripen n go to seed on yer fore yer could git em harvested and if there was peace and plenty without there was quite as much within doors i cant hardly tell whats

part miss vilda lifted her head intoxicated with the melody she had evoked did you ever hear anything like that she exclaimed proudly oh the white farm and the white farm i love it with all my heart and im to live at the white farm till death it do us part just hear the sentment of it and the way it sings along like a tune im goin to show that to the minister this very night and that boys got to have the best education there is to be had if we have to mortgage the farm samantha ann was right the old homestead wore a new aspect these days and a love of all things seemed to have crept into the hearts of its inmates as if some beneficent fairy of a spider were spinning a web of tenderness all about the house or as if a soft light had dawned in the midst of great darkness and was gradually brightening into the perfect day in the midst of this newfound gladness and the sweet cares that grew and multiplied as the busy days went on samanthas appetite for happiness grew by what it fed upon so that before long she was a little unhappy that other people some more than others were not as happy as she and aunt hitty was heard to say at the sewingcircle which had facilities for gathering and disseminating news infinitely superior to those of the associated press that samantha ann ripley looked so peart and young this summer dave milliken had better spunk up and try again but alas the younger and fresher and happier samantha looked the older and sadder and meeker david appeared till all hopes of his spunking up died out of the village heart and it might as well be stated out of samanthas also she always thought about it at sundown for it was at sundown that all their quarrels and reconciliations had taken place inasmuch as it was the only leisure time for weekday courting at pleasant river it was sundown now miss vilda and jabez slocum had gone to wednesday evening prayermeeting and samantha was looking for timothy to go to the store with her on some household errands she had seen the children go into the garden a half hour before timothy walking gravely with his book before him gay blowing over the grass like a feather and so she walked towards the summerhouse timothy was not there but little lady gay was having a party all to herself and the scene was such a pretty one that samantha stooped behind the lattice and listened there was a table spread for four with bits of broken china and shells for dishes and pieces of apple and gingerbread for the feast there were several dolls present notably one without any head who was not likely to shine at a dinner party but gays firstborn sat in her lap and only a mother could have gazed upon such a battered thing and loved it for gay took her pleasures madly and this faithful creature had shared them all but not having inherited her mothers somewhat rare recuperative powers she was now fit only for a free bed in a hospital a state of mind and body which she did not in the least endeavor to conceal one of her shoebutton eyes dangled by a linen thread in a bloodcurdling sort of way her nose which had been a pink glass bead was now a mere spot ambiguously located her red worsted lips were sadly raveled but that she did not regret for it was kissin as done it her yarn hair was attached to her head with safetypins and her internal organs intruded themselves on the public through a gaping wound in the side never mind if you have any curiosity to measure the strength of the ideal watch a child with her oldest doll rags sat at the head of the dinnertable and had taken the precaution to get the headless doll on his right with a view to eating her gingerbread as well as his own doing no violence to the proprieties in this way but rather concealing her defects from a carping public i tell you sompfin ittle mit vildy tummins gay was saying to her battered offspring you s doin to have a new ittle sitter tomowowday if you s a dood ittle dirl an does to seep nite an kick you serweet ittle vildy tummins all this punctuated with ardent squeezes fraught with delicious agony to one who had a wound in her side vay fink you s worn out weety but we know you isnt don we weety an ill tell you nite ittle tory tonight tause you isnt seepy wunt there was a ittle day hen at tole a net an laid firteen waw edds in it an bime bye erleven or seventeen ittle chits few out of em an mit vildy dopted em all in t that a nite tory you serweet ittle mit vildy tummins samantha hardly knew why the tears should spring to her eyes as she watched the dinner party unless it was because we can scarcely look at little children in their unconscious play without a sort of sadness partly of pity and partly of envy and of longing too as for something lost and gone and samantha could look back to the time when she had sat at little tables set with bits of broken china yes in this very summerhouse and little martha was always so gay and david used to laugh so but there was no use in tryin to make folks any difrent specially if they was such natral born fools they couldnt see a hole in a grindstun thout hevin it hung on their noses and with these large and charitable views of human nature samantha walked back to the gate and met timothy as he came out of the orchard she knew then what he had been doing the boy had certain quaint thoughts and ways that were at once a revelation and an inspiration to these two plain women and one of them was this to step softly into the side orchard on pleasant evenings and without a word before or afterwards to lay a nosegay on marthas little white doorplate and if miss vilda chanced to be at the window he would give her a quiet little smile as much as to say we have no need of words we two and vilda like one of old hid all these doings in her heart of hearts and loved the boy with a love passing knowledge samantha and timothy walked down the hill to the store yes david milliken was sitting all alone on the loafers bench at the door and why wasnt he at prayermeetin where he ought to be she was glad she chanced to have on her clean purple calico and that timothy had insisted on putting a pink mathy washington geranium in her collar for it was just as well to make folks mouth water whether they had sense enough to eat or not who is that sorrylooking man that always sits on the bench at the store samanthy thats david milliken why does he look so sorry samanthy oh hes all right he likes it fustrate wearin out that hard bench settin on it night in n night out like a bump on a log but there timothy ive gone n forgot the whole pepper n were goin to pickle seed cowcumbers tomorrer you take the lard home n put it in the cold room n ondress gay n git her to bed for ive got to call int mis mayhews goin along back it was very vexatious to be obliged to pass david milliken a second time though there warnt no sign that he cared anything about it one way or nother bein blind as a bat n deef as an adder n dumb as a fish n settin stockstill there with no coat on n the wind blowin up for rain n four o the millikens layin in the churchyard with gallopin consumption it was in this frame of mind that she purchased the whole pepper which she could have eaten at that moment as calmly as if it had been marrowfat peas and in this frame of mind she might have continued to the end of time had it not been for one of those unconsidered trifles that move the world when the great forces have given up trying as she came out of the store and passed david her eye fell on a patch in the flannel shirt that covered his bent shoulders the shirt was gray and oh the pity of it the patch was red and it was laid forlornly on outside and held by straggling stitches of carpet thread put on by patient clumsy fingers that patch had an irresistible pathos for a woman samantha ann ripley never exactly knew what happened even the wisest of downeast virgins has emotional lapses once in a while and she confessed afterwards that her heart riz right up inside of her like a yeast cake mr berry the postmaster was in the back of the store reading postal cards not a soul was in sight she managed to get down over the steps though something with the strength of tarred shipropes was drawing her back and then looking over her shoulder with her whole brave womanly heart in her swimming eyes she put out her hand and said come along dave and david straightway gat him up from the loafers bench and went unto samantha gladly and they remembered not past unhappiness because of present joy nor that the chill of coming winter was in the air because it was summer in their hearts and this is the eternal magic of love
