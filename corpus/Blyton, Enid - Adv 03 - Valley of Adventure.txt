 enid blyton the valley of adventure chapter up in bills aeroplane kiki the parrot was annoyed she had been left all alone for a day and she talked angrily to herself what a pity what a pity what a pity poor poor polly dingdong bell pollys down the well good morning good morning mrs mannering put her head in at the door of the room where kiki was sitting kiki dont be so absurd talking away to yourself all day like that the children will soon be back dingdong bell said kiki mournfully and made a cracking noise with her beak i suppose you miss jack said mrs mannering coming into the room and shutting the door carefully behind her he wont be long now kiki youll hear him and the others any minute now be a good bird and dont make any more noise kiki opened her beak swelled up her throat and gave her famous imitation of an express train screeching on entering a tunnel mrs mannering put her hands to her ears naughty kiki naughty how many times have we told you not to do that how many times have i told you to shut the door shut the door shut the door answered back kiki and ruffled up her feathers so cheekily that mrs mannering gave her a tap on her beak funny old bird she said ah listen that sounds like the children coming back theyve been up in an aeroplane kiki fancy that thats why you had to be left alone all day jack jack jack screamed kiki hearing the voice of her owner four children burst into the room their faces red with excitement hallo all of you said mrs mannering how did you like it was it fun being so high up in the air oh mother it was the greatest fun in the world aunt allie i shall buy an aeroplane of my own as soon as ever im grown up mother you ought to have come bill piloted the plane and he was marvellous i wasnt airsick aunt allie though bill gave me a paper bag to be sick in mrs mannering laughed all the four spoke at once and she had hard work to make out what they said kiki gave a loving screech and flew to jacks shoulder the four children sank into chairs and prepared to relate their days adventure there were philip and dinah mrs mannerings children darkeyed darkhaired just as she was and both with queer tufts of hair that insisted on sticking up in front both dinah and philip were called tufty at school then there were the other two jack and lucyann brother and sister who had no mother and father and lived with aunt allie as they called mrs mannering all four were like one family jack and lucyann trent were very alike they both had red hair and green eyes and were so covered with freckles that it was quite impossible to find a bit of pink skin on their faces arms or legs it was not surprising that jack was so often called freckles kiki the parrot belonged to him he had had her for years an amusing and talkative parrot with a gift for repeating anything she heard and for imitating any noise from a sewingmachine to an express train she adored jack and was miserable when she was not with him jack had a passion for birds and philip had a great liking for animals of all kinds he was wonderfully good with them and they obeyed him and loved him in a marvellous manner he always had some kind of queer pet about him which caused quarrels between him and his sister dinah who was scared of most animals and of nearly all insects but now all four were thinking of nothing whatever but their glorious flight in their friend bills new aeroplane bill smugs was their firm friend he and they had had hairraising adventures together in one adventure they had gone down old coppermines to track clever forgers in another they had happened on a nest of dangerous spies as bill smugs said those children simply fell into adventures now bill had actually been presented with a fine aeroplane to help him in his work the children had been wild with excitement when he had written to tell them this at school i bet hell take us up for a flight said jack i just bet he will well make him said philip but they didnt need to make him for he was quite willing to show off his aeroplane to them and to demonstrate how well he could fly it after only a short training mother we went far far higher than the clouds said dinah i looked down on them and they didnt look like clouds a bit they looked like a great big snowfield it gave me quite a funny feeling i had a parachute strapped to me in case i fell and bill showed me the ripcord i had to pull in case of danger said lucyann the youngest her eyes shining but there wasnt any danger we flew right over our old home craggytops said philip it was so queer looking down on top of it and we flew over here too mother and our house looked like a toy one aunt allie bill says its frightfully exciting flying at night and seeing the little pinpricks of light shining up from the dark countryside said jack we begged and begged him to take us on a night flight but he said he would have to ask you you will say we can go wont you golly i cant imagine what the boys at school will say when i tell them about going up in a plane day and night day and night repeated kiki dingdong bell shes got dingdong bell on the brain said jack theres a small child next door who keeps reciting nursery rhymes and kiki listens and picks up bits of them yesterday she kept moaning about three blind mice today its dingdong bell dont know what it will be tomorrow humpy dumpy said kiki obligingly humpty dumpty corrected jack not humpy dumpy humpy dumpy bumpy said kiki solemnly and scratched her head with a claw humpy dumpy all right all right said jack aunt allie can we go up at night with bill hes coming to ask you tomorrow so do say yes i suppose i shall have to said mrs mannering with a laugh you and bill so long as you dont go headlong into another awful adventure adventures arent awful said philip they are simply lovely not to the people who arent in them said mrs mannering i feel quite ill sometimes when i think of the adventures you children have been in the middle of no more please all right we wont get into any more these summer holidays said lucyann giving her aunt a hug we wont worry you i dont want any more adventures anyhow ive had enough baby said dinah scornfully well if we do have another well leave you out of it lucyann no we wont said philip giving dinah a poke in the back we cant do without lucyann now dont quarrel you two said mrs mannering foreseeing one of their everlasting squabbles boiling up youre tired now all of you after all your excitement go and do something quiet till suppertime sing for your supper put in kiki the children laughed youre an idiot kiki said jack affectionately did you miss us today well i was scared you might fly out of the aeroplane in fright if we took you but i expect youd have been quite a sensible old bird wouldnt you and sat on my shoulder all the time kiki pecked lovingly at jacks ear and made a crooning noise she sat as close to him as she could the children began to talk about their exciting day wasnt it lovely going to the aerodrome and getting in on our passes and walking up to bill just as if we were grownups said philip and golly wasnt bills aeroplane fine i didnt think it would be so big said lucyann you know it was funny i sort of held my breath when we started off thinking id get a funny feeling when we left the ground like i do in a lift and i never even knew when the wheels left the runway and we were in the air i got quite a shock when i looked down and saw we were over the housetops it seemed awfully easy to fly a plane said jack easier than driving a car i wish bill would let me have a shot well he wont said philip i say wasnt it queer when we got into that airpocket and the plane suddenly dropped down without warning my tummy sort of went up into my throat the others laughed mine did too said lucyann im glad i wasnt sick it was a waste of that nice strong paper bag but im glad i felt all right we went hundreds of miles i should think said jack i felt a bit funny when we were over the sea it looked so enormous and so flat i shouldnt like to fall out over that what a splash i bet mother will say we can go on a night flight with bill said dinah i could see in her face that she was going to say yes if only we could bill said we could fly to his old home land at dawn and spend the rest of the night with him sleeping all we liked in his two spare rooms we neednt get up till twelve if we didnt want to fancy flying all night and going to bed at dawn then wed fly back in the afternoon i suppose said jack gosh im glad weve got bill for a friend i do think hes an exciting sort of person its thrilling too to know that hes always on some sort of secret job and never says a word about it always snooping out some deadly secret i wonder if hes on any job now you bet he is said philip thats why hes got this aeroplane may have to take off at any moment after spies or somebody hope im with him when he does well you wont be said dinah bill would never run us into danger i shouldnt mind if he did said philip hallo theres the gong for supper im jolly hungry thats nothing new said dinah come on lets go and see what there is smells like bacon and eggs they went to their supper they were all hungry and finished up the eggs and bacon and plumcake in no time kiki helped herself to the plumcake too till mrs mannering protested jack will you stop kiki picking all the raisins out of that cake look at the mess shes making there wont be any cake left soon smack her on her beak naughty kiki said jack and tapped her on her beak dont eat it all how many times have i told began kiki but jack was too tired to talk to her dont argue he said im so sleepy ill have to go to bed everyone felt the same so off they went and were soon asleep and dreaming of flying aeroplanes over the clouds somersaulting and looping the loop in a most amazing but perfectly safe manner chapter bill gets his way bill came along to lunch the next day he had a ruddy face twinkling eyes and a rather bald head with plenty of hair at each side the children rushed to meet him mrs mannering smiled at him you gave the children a wonderful time yesterday she said and now i hear that you want to take them on a night flight i cant think why you want to bother yourself with a pack of children like these ah you never know when theyre going to embark on some wonderful adventure said bill smugs grinning round at them i dont want to be left out of it you know besides i feel sorry for you mrs mannering having to put up with them for eight or nine weeks these summer holidays i thought it would be a kind deed if i took them off your hands for a while well what do you want them to do asked mrs mannering just go for a night flight spend the night at your old home and come back the next day that was the first idea i had said bill but now i hear im due to have three or four days off and i thought maybe you could spare the children for longer we could fly to my old home and then stay there and mess about a bit there are heaps of wild birds for jack to see and ive no doubt that philip will find plenty of even wilder animals the girls will enjoy the change too oh it does sound good cried jack and the others agreed mrs mannering listened and thought for a moment yes i dont see why they shouldnt go with you bill i know youll look after them all right and see that they dont get mixed up in any awful adventure again i can promise you that said bill there are no adventures to be found anywhere near my old home its a most peaceful quiet place nothing doing at all well if you promise not to rush into danger or trouble you can go said mrs mannering to the delighted children when do you want them bill tomorrow if possible said bill the job i am on seems to be hanging fire at the moment so i might as well take my few days now whats the job bill do do tell us begged lucyann bill laughed i couldnt possibly tell he said all my work is secret you know that ill tell you all about the job when its over and done with though youll find it jolly interesting well have to pack suitcases wont we said dinah if were going to stay a few days i mean we may want a change of clothes and macks yes bring jerseys and shorts to mess about in said bill and macks too because it always seems to rain at my home and mrs mannering could you spare a few rugs as i may not have quite enough blankets for so many visitors of course said mrs mannering ill look some out for you ill bring my lovely camera said jack therell be room for odds and ends like that in the plane wont there bill plenty said bill bring your fieldglasses too because you may want to have a squint at the different birds in the hills around oh it will be exciting said jack his eyes shining at the thought i cant wait till tomorrow lets go today the planes not ready said bill got to have something done to her today anyway my leave doesnt start till tomorrow you get everything packed and ready and come to the aerodrome tomorrow night be there at eleven oclock sharp ill order a car to call for you and take you there what a time to start on a journey said mrs mannering i dont know that i altogether like it you cant change your mind now you cant cried the children no i wont said mrs mannering but somehow i dont feel very easy in my mind about it all oh children you wont go and do anything dangerous will you theres nothing dangerous for them to do said bill ill look after them all right anyone doing anything dangerous will be sent back to you mrs mannering the children laughed then jacks face fell i say what about kiki she wont like me being away for some days can i take her with me what about the plane will she be all right in it youd better put her into a basket or something said bill she might get scared at the noise and fly off shell be all right in a basket on your knee we cant leave her behind right said jack pleased do you hear that kiki old bird youre to travel in a basket and mind you behave yourself wipe your feet said kiki put the kettle on kettle on poor poor polly idiot said jack and scratched her poll all i hope is you dont try to imitate the noise an aeroplane makes your expresstrain screech is bad enough they all had a pleasant lunch and then bill departed the children went upstairs to put together their things dinah put a whole packet of chocolate into her case in case there were no shops to buy any at bills home jack stuffed a packet of biscuits into his case he often woke up at night and liked a biscuit to nibble then better take plenty of films with you jack if youre thinking of photographing birds said philip i bet there wont be anywhere to buy them where bill lives its somewhere buried right down in the country mrs mannering came up to see what they were packing it was a cold august with rather a lot of fain and the children would need a fair amount of warm things they had put in pullovers and jerseys and macks and souwesters she added rubber boots too thinking that shoes would not be of much use if they walked over wet fields ive found you some rugs she said you can each take one they are old but very thick and warm and as good as two blankets if bill hasnt enough blankets for you it wont matter at all the rugs will give you plenty of warmth dont forget to bring them back now jack got his camera ready he looked out his rolls of films he debated whether or not to take one of his bird books with him and then decided not to because his suitcase was already very heavy everythings done now aunt allie said lucyann sitting on her suitcase to make it shut i wish tomorrow would hurry up and come fancy flying in the dark in a plane i never in my life thought i would do that i hope its a long long way to bills home it is said mrs mannering now let me see id better pack you sandwiches and cake to take with you for the journey because you are sure to be hungry if you stay up all night ill do those tomorrow have you found a basket for kiki jack and what about taking some food for her theres a new packet of sunflower seeds come today put it into your suitcase jack found a good basket for kiki with a lid that closed down he put it on the table kiki flew over to it at once in curiosity she hopped inside and looked out comically clever bird said jack you know its your travelling basket dont you god save the king said kiki and began to rub her curved beak up and down the edge of the basket dont do that said jack youll break it stop it kiki kiki climbed out and flew to jacks shoulder she rubbed her beak against his hair dingdong bell she murmured pollys in the well dingdong bell pollys in the basket you mean said lucyann kiki youre going in an aeroplane think of that the day went slowly far too slowly for the children the next day was even slower by the time that teatime came the children felt that night would never never come but when suppertime came they felt more cheerful the car was coming at a quarterpast ten to take them to the aerodrome then into the plane they would get with bill and off they would go into the darkness somehow it seemed far more thrilling to fly through the dark night than through the sunshiny day ten oclock struck the suitcases and rugs were taken down to the hall jacks camera was there too and a large packet of sandwiches and cakes jack wore his fieldglasses on a strap over his shoulder kikis basket was in the hall too but kiki was still free she was not going into the basket till the last moment heres the car cried philip his sharp ears hearing the engine purring up to the door come along goodbye mother look after yourself well till we come back goodbye aunt allie said jack giving her a hug well send you a postcard hi kiki come on its time you got into your basket kiki made a bit of a fuss going in she was excited because of the excitement of the four children it took quite a time to get her into the basket and shut the lid down she began to shout at the top of her voice poor polly poor polly down the well down the well up the hill in the corner shes mixing up dingdong bell and jack and jill and jack horner said lucyann with a giggle be quiet kiki you ought to be glad youre coming with us even if you have to travel in a shut basket all the goodbyes were said i dont like letting you go somehow said mrs mannering its silly of me but i dont ive got an uncomfortable feeling as if youre going off into another dreadful adventure we promise not to said philip earnestly dont you worry mother well be all right and youll see us turning up like bad pennies in a few days time anyway bills on the phone and you can always ring him the taxi revved up its engine it moved off down the drive with mrs mannering left standing at the door waving the children waved back excited they were really off now for the aerodrome said philip pleased i thought tonight would never come whats the time oh were early good got the passes jack dinahs got them in her bag said jack dinah fished them out they were passes that would take them into the aerodrome and up to bill himself it was a good way to the aerodrome the night was very dark clouds covered the sky and a few drops of rain spattered the windscreen heres the aerodrome at last cried jack seeing the lights through the window look at the flarepath all lit up isnt it fine dont the aeroplanes look enormous in the shadows at each side here dinah where are the passes weve got to show them now they were shown to the man at the entrance to the aerodrome and allowed in ill set you down here and you can speak to your friend said the taximan then ill run on to his aeroplane and dump the luggage beside it for you so long now well find bill said philip as the car drove off there he is look hi bill were here chapter a grave mistake bill was talking to three or four men very earnestly he waved to the children a tall burly shadow in the night hallo kids im busy for a few minutes you cut along to the aeroplane and wait for me stow your cases in at the back where mine is ill be about ten minutes or so right bill said jack and the four of them moved off to where the taximan had put their cases beside an aeroplane not very far away it was dark where the aeroplane stood but the children could see enough to pick up their cases they climbed up the ladder and into the cabin the inside of the plane was in darkness the children had no idea how to put the lights on they felt their way to the back of the plane and put down their things they threw their rugs there too jack put kikis basket down carefully kiki had been most indignant all the way humpy dumpy bumpy she said pop goes the weasel there was a large crate in the middle of the plane the children wondered what was in it was it empty or full it must be something bill was taking back with him its blocking up all the inside said jack we cant sit down properly with that thing there lets squat down on our rugs at the back well be quite comfortable there perhaps bill will shift the crate a bit when he comes and tell us where he wants us to sit so they sat down patiently on their rugs and waited the noise of the planes engines went on and on and it was impossible to hear anything else though once jack thought he could hear somebody shouting he went to the door and looked out but all was darkness and bill was nowhere to be seen what a time he was he went back to his place yawning lucyann was half asleep i wish bill would come said philip i shall go to sleep if he doesnt then a lot of things happened very quickly indeed over and above the sound of the engine came the sound of shots gunshots that made the children sit up in a hurry then another shot sounded and then there came the noise of someone clambering hurriedly up the steps into the plane and a man flung himself down in the control seat another followed panting hardly to be seen in the darkness the children sat as if they were frozen what in the world was happening was one of the men bill who was the other and what was the hurry the first man took the controls of the plane and to the childrens amazement it began to taxi forwards they were off but why hadnt bill spoken to them why hadnt he at least looked round to see that they were safely inside keep quiet said jack to the others if bill doesnt want to speak to us theres a reason maybe he doesnt want the other fellow to know were here keep quiet the plane rose into the air its propellers making a great whirring noise it headed swiftly into the wind the men shouted to one another but the children could not make out what they were saying because the noise of the engine was so loud they sat quiet and still hidden from view by the big crate standing in the middle of the plane bill said nothing to them at all he didnt call out to know if they were there he didnt send his companion along to see if they were all right he simply took no notice of them at all it was very queer and lucyann didnt like it a bit one of the men fiddled about and found a switch he pulled it down and a light shone out just by the men but the rest of the plane was still in darkness philip peeped round the crate meaning to catch bills eye if he could almost at once he came back to the others and sat down very quietly he said nothing at all whats up asked jack sensing that philip was worried you go and look round that crate said philip have a good look at the two men jack went and peered round he came back feeling puzzled and scared neither of those men is bill he said golly its funny what do you mean said lucyann in alarm one must be bill why this is bills aeroplane yes but is it said dinah suddenly look where the light catches those seats lucyann they are red and the ones in bills plane were green i remember them quite well so they were said jack remembering too golly were in the wrong plane there was a long silence nobody knew what to think about it they were in the wrong plane not bills plane at all two strange men sat at the controls men who would probably be extremely angry when they found their unexpected passengers neither jack nor philip liked the look of the men in the least they had really only seen the backs of their heads and the side face of one man when he had turned to shout to his companion but neither of the boys had felt drawn to the two men theyve got such thick necks thought jack oh gosh this is awful and there were those shots too were they anything to do with these men they clambered into the plane in a frightful hurry and set off at once i do believe weve stumbled into an adventure again philip spoke cautiously to the others it was no good whispering because whispers couldnt possibly be heard so philip had to speak loudly and trust that he would not be heard by the men in front what are we going to do we have got into the wrong plane thats the fault of that stupid taximan putting down our things by the wrong aeroplane it was so dark we couldnt possibly tell which plane was which ourselves lucyann sat close to jack frightened it wasnt very nice to be high up in the air lost in the darkness in the wrong aeroplane with men that none of them had seen before what can we do wondered jack we really are in a mess honestly those two men wont half be mad when they see us they might tip us out said lucyann in alarm and we havent got parachutethings on jack dont let them know were here theyll have to know sooner or later said dinah what idiots we are getting into the wrong plane i never thought of that there was a silence again with everyone thinking very hard shall we just stay here at the back of the plane on our rugs and hope we shant be noticed said philip then when we arrive somewhere maybe we can slip out of the plane and look for help yes thats the best idea said jack we are well hidden here unless the men come round to the back for something maybe they will arrive at their destination get out without seeing us and then we can slip out ourselves and ask for help to get back home i did want to stay with bill said lucyann almost in tears whatever will he be thinking goodness knows said jack gloomily hell be hunting all over the aerodrome for us you know i believe that must have been bill i heard shouting when i went to the door to see he must have gone to his own plane found we werent there and yelled for us dash if only id guessed that well its too late now said philip i hope mother wont be worried oh dear shell think weve fallen headlong into another adventure and we promised not to the aeroplane roared on through the dark night the children had no idea whether they were flying north south east or west then jack remembered his pocketcompass and took it out were flying east he said i wonder where were going to i dont somehow feel as if im in a plane at all as i cant look out and see the ground far below the others felt the same lucyann lay down on the rugs and yawned im going to sleep she said i shall only feel frightened and worried if i keep awake its a good idea of yours said philip and he stretched himself out on the rugs too we shall be sure to wake up if we arrive anywhere anyone want a sandwich or bit of cake asked dinah remembering the picnic packet but nobody did the shock of finding themselves in the wrong aeroplane had taken away their appetites completely soon all of them but jack were asleep he lay awake thinking hard had bill been mixed up in the shooting they had heard were these two men anything to do with the job bill had been working on the secret job it might be just possible that jack and the others might find out something that would help bill it was important not to let the two men know that they had hidden passengers in their plane kiki gave an exasperated screech in her basket jack jumped he had forgotten kiki he tapped the basket and spoke in as low a voice as he could hoping that kiki would hear him shut up kiki dont make a noise whatever you do its very important to be quiet you hear me kiki you must be quiet be quiet be quiet be quiet repeated kiki from inside the basket shhhhhhhhhsh jack couldnt help smiling yes he said putting his face close to the basket shhhhhhsh kiki was quite quiet after that she was a mischievous noisy bird but she would always be quiet if jack wanted her to be so she sat inside the basket trying to tuck her head under her wing and go to sleep but the loud sound of the planes engines upset her she had never heard such a noise before she longed to imitate it but fortunately she didnt try just then after a bit the two men changed places and the second one took over the controls the first one yawned and stretched he got up and jacks heart almost stopped beating in fright was he going to come to the back of the plane he wondered whether or not to wake the others but the man did not come to the back he stood up for a few minutes as if to stretch his legs then lighted a pipe blue smoke drifted to the back of the cabin jack was most relieved to see the man sit down again the boy soon grew sleepy too he lay down close to the others quite glad of his coat for it was very cold soon he was asleep too only kiki kept awake cracking her beak now and again puzzled and wondering what this strange night adventure meant the plane flew on in the darkness passing over towns and villages fields rivers and woods it passed over the sea too where the lights of ships shone dimly lights of the towns twinkled up and here and there the flarepath of an aerodrome shone up to the sky but the plane did not fly down it swept over them all heading east to the dawn then just before dawn it began to circle round more slowly it dropped as it circled and once banked so steeply that the children almost rolled over it awoke them and they sat up wondering where they were they remembered at once and looked at one another with wide eyes were going to land where shall we find we are look out for a quick escape as soon as we get the chance they whispered to one another down we go were landing chapter wherever can we be the aeroplane landed with a slight bump that shook the children and made them gasp then it ran along a little way on its huge wheels and stopped they had arrived but where dawn had come and light came in at the windows but it was not full morning yet one of the men switched off the throbbing engines at once a great quiet and peace came into the cabin how marvellous not to have that enormous noise flooding into their ears any more the children were glad they heard the mens voices weve made good time and a good landing too you brought her in well juan weve not got much time to spare said juan come on lets get out and stretch our legs well go to the hut and have a meal to the childrens enormous delight the men clambered out of the plane and disappeared they hadnt even gone round to the back of the crate and seen the children maybe they could escape and get help at once anyway they would be able to send word to bill and mrs mannering telling them not to worry come on said jack getting up cautiously lets squint out of the window and see where we are on an aerodrome i hope well probably see a mechanic or two and ask them to direct us to someone in authority they all crowded to the nearest window but what a shock when they looked out they were not on an aerodrome at all they were on a broad flat piece of grassland in a valley and that valley seemed to be surrounded on all sides by towering mountains gosh said jack where are we back of beyond i should think were in a valley said philip with mountains all round awfully beautiful but awfully lonely how can we get help here there wont be a plane to take us back thats certain there wasnt a house or any kind of building to be seen the view from the other side of the plane was exactly the same mountains on every side they seemed to be at the bottom of them in a green valley it was very strange why should the men come there what are we going to do asked dinah do we get out or stay in or what well i dont know what you think philip said jack but i dont like any of this i dont like those men i dont like the way they flew off in the middle of the night after what sounded like a lot of shooting and i dont like this lonely valley either but all the same i think it would be a good idea if we got out and snooped round a bit there must be peasants somewhere about shepherds perhaps somebody like that what country are we in asked lucyann shall we be able to speak their language i dont suppose so for a minute said philip but well just have to try and make ourselves understood i wonder what those men have come here for said dinah thoughtfully it seems a funny lonely place to come to i dont think they are up to any good i think it would be just as well to get out now whilst we can and hide and then see if we cant find someone to help us we can report everything to bill when we get back thats the best idea said jack at once ill be glad to be in the open air again this planes jolly stuffy they looked cautiously out of every window to see if they could spot the two men but there was no sign of them at all better get going said jack what about our suitcases and rugs and kiki dont leave them here said philip we dont want the men to guess weve been passengers in their plane take them with us so the four of them left the plane and handed down their cases and rugs to one another kiki uttered a few words of annoyance at being lifted about like luggage but only in a very low voice soon all the children were standing outside the plane wondering which way to go jack suddenly nudged philip and made him jump look look over there they all looked and saw a thin spire of blue smoke rising into the air the men have made a fire down there i should think said jack in a low voice better not go in that direction well take this path here if it is a path the little procession wound round some big rocks and came to where a stream burbled down the hillside it gushed out there as a spring and became a little stream almost at once we could drink from that said philip im thirsty but im not hungry yet funny well were all a bit tired and worried and puzzled said jack lets get some water into our hands and lap it up im thirsty too the water was cold and crystal clear it was delicious all the children felt better for a drink dinah dipped her hanky into the stream and wiped her face she felt much fresher then and lucyann did the same the thing is to find a good hidingplace for ourselves and these cases said jack im afraid if those two men start wandering about they may come across us where can we go lets go straight on said dinah up the hill here if we keep up a little we shall be able to see the plane down in the valley and keep our sense of direction a bit keep among those trees thats a good idea said philip and they made their way slowly towards the trees they felt safer among them the men could not spot them there on the other hand they found that they could no longer see the plane we can always spot it by climbing up a tree said jack i say look there is that a house set in a clearing was what looked like a house but when the children got near they found that it was almost burnt out just a blackened ruin empty and deserted what a pity said philip we could easily have asked help from the people who lived there i wonder how the house got burnt they went on a little higher through a copse of silver birchtrees they saw another building a little higher up but to their astonishment and dismay that too was a blackened scorched ruin there was no sign of life anywhere about it two burnt houses and nobody to be found anywhere said jack very curious whats been happening in this valley higher up still they could see yet another house would that be burnt out too they laboured up to it and gazed on it in despair quite burnt out said dinah what an awful thing whats happened to the people who lived here there must have been war here or something i do wonder where we are look that cowshed or whatever it is isnt very much burntout said jack lets go over and see if the roof is still on if it is we could put our things there they made their way to the brokendown cowshed it seemed as if the flames had got hold of one half of it but had left the other half the roof was almost off but at the back was a sheltered place with stalls where cows had been put this is all right said jack making his way into the last stall of all the roof here will keep out the rain if it comes and there are some jolly big clouds about we can put our things here the floors dirty said lucyann turning up her nose in disgust well we may perhaps be able to find a broom or something to get it clean and well spread it with grass or bracken for a carpet said dinah then if we spread out our rugs on it we could even sleep here we may not be able to find anyone to help us today we could spend the night here they put their cases down in the corner and draped the rugs over them kiki was put down on top in her basket she gave a squawk of protest do you think it would be safe to let her out said jack shell sit on my shoulder for hours now im sure if i tell her to she must be so uncomfortable cooped up in that box yes let her out said philip if she does fly off for a bit and the men see her they wont know what she is or who she belongs to shell give them a fright if she begins to talk kiki was set free she was overjoyed she clambered out of the basket and flew to jacks shoulder she nibbled his ear fondly wheres your handkerchief she said how many times have i told you to all right kiki all right said jack not so loud theres a good old thing shhhhhhhhhh said kiki at the top of her voice then she said no more but just sat and cracked her beak well what are our plans said philip sitting on his suitcase shall we go exploring a bit further and see if we can find anyone to help us or shall we keep an eye on those men and see if we can find out why theyve come here or shall we just stay here and hide i think wed better go exploring said jack the most important thing really is to find help we simply must get back home at once if we can aunt allie and bill will be worried to death about us this is such a lovely valley said dinah looking out of the tumbledown cowshed i cant think why it isnt packed with houses and cattle and sheep but i cant see a soul i cant even see any smoke anywhere except for that bit over there where the men are its very mysterious why are all those houses burnt and why isnt there anyone here well weve only seen just a bit of the valley and hillside said philip we may round a corner and come on a whole village arent those mountains enormous yes they make a ring all round this valley said lucyann i wonder where the way out is mountains always have passes through them dont they yes said jack but i shouldnt care to go looking for one if i didnt know the way see that mountain over there its got a white tip i bet thats snow it shows how high it must be it certainly was a beautiful valley and the mountains that guarded it were magnificent but it had a deserted lonely air about it and even the few birds that flew by every now and again seemed silent and cautious theres something mysterious here said jack you know i believe yes i really do believe were in for another adventure rubbish said philip we shall find a farm nearby get help have a message sent somewhere find a car road go to the nearest town by car and from there to an aerodrome and i bet you well be home by tomorrow i bet we wont said jack lucyann looked alarmed but what about meals she said weve only got aunt allies picnic packet and a few biscuits and some chocolate well starve if we dont get home quickly theres nothing to eat here nobody had thought of that it was a nuisance an adventure was one thing but an adventure without anything to eat was quite another thing that wouldnt do at all i dont think well make this an adventure after all said jack but an adventure it was and they were only at the beginning of it too chapter a little exploring the four children went to the brokendown door and gazed out at the towering mountains around them they seemed to hem the valley in and make it a green prison none of the children had seen such high mountains before clouds hung about halfway up two or three of them and their tops showed now and again as the clouds shifted and parted its a very lonely kind of place said jack i bet theres all kinds of strange birds here but ive only seen one or two so far its funny that those men should have known where to land in this valley that smooth strip of grass makes a splendid landingground it looks as if theyve been here before but why should they come here there doesnt seem anything to come for at all no hotel not even a cottage that isnt burnt as far as we can see oh there may be said philip hey look at that little lizard ive never seen one like that before what a pretty little fellow the lizard ran close by philips feet the boy bent down quietly and his deft hand caught the tiny creature by the neck if he had caught it by the tail it would probably have snapped off and the lizard would have run away without it oh put it down philip do said dinah horrid creature it isnt said philip look at its dear little feet with fingers on do look dinah dinah gave a squeal and pushed philip away lucyann and jack looked at the tiny lizard with interest its like a very very small dragon said jack open your hand and see if it will stay with you philip of course it will said philip who always seemed to exercise a queer spell over any creature he picked up he opened his hand and let the lizard lie on his open palm it made no attempt to escape at all see it wants to stay with me said philip and so it shall whats your name little thing lizzie well of course i might have known that lucyann giggled forgetting her worries for a moment what a lovely name for a lizard lizzie just like philip to think of that ill see if i can catch a few flies for you lizzie said philip and went to a sunny patch where flies were buzzing he caught one and held it in finger and thumb over the lizards head in a trice the fly was gone and the lizard blinked with pleasure now i suppose youll let that lizard live in your pocket or somewhere about you for ages said dinah in disgust i shant go near you if you havent got a mouse down your neck youve got a toad in your pocket or a baby hedgehog crawling about you or a few beetles i think youre an awful boy dont lets squabble now said jack weve bigger things to bother about than lizards the lizard popped into philips sleeve kiki had been watching it with her head on one side she was not fond of philips pets and was often jealous of them pop goes the lizard she said making one of her unexpectedly apt remarks the others roared with laughter kiki was pleased she swayed herself from side to side and cracked her beak shhhhhhhhh she said oh kiki im glad we brought you said jack now everybody what are our next plans well we simply must do a bit of exploring and see if there is anyone living in this valley said philip if there is were all right if there isnt well its just too bad well have to stay here till were rescued rescued and how do you think anyone is going to rescue us if they havent the foggiest idea where we are demanded dinah dont be silly philip well do you propose to live here in this valley for the rest of your life then said philip oh heres lizzie again coming out of my other sleeve lizzie youre a jolly good explorer i must say i wish you could tell us the way out of this valley dinah went as far from philip as she could she simply could not bear his pets it was a pity because they were really amusing and friendly you know well have to be careful we dont get lost said lucyann anxiously this valley and these mountainsides are so enormous we must keep together always yes we must agreed jack and we must always be able to get back to this shed too because our things are here at least we shall have shelter here and our rugs to lie on if only we had plenty to eat those biscuits and chocolate wont last long your compass will come in jolly useful jack said philip remembering it look here what about setting off now and doing some more exploring making this shed a kind of headquarters to come back to yes we will said dinah but lets cover up the suitcases and things with something in case those men come here and see them they wont said philip what could they possibly want to come snooping round an old burnt cowshed for we can leave the things here all right they went out of the shed the sun was just over the mountaintops now shining into the valley the children saw the spire of smoke rising straight up from the fire the men must have made so long as we keep away from that direction we should be all right said jack come on lets take this path it really looks as if it was once a proper path from this place to somewhere else wed better notch the trees here and there as we go to make sure we find our way back lucyann liked the idea of that it reminded her of red indians and their ways jack and philip each took out his knife they made a cut on every fifth or sixth tree until they came out of the little wood and found themselves on a flowerstrewn grassy hillside its lovely isnt it said lucyann looking round at the carpet of flowers ive never seen such bright colours look at that blue flower jack its bluer than the sky itself and oh look at this tiny pink flower masses of it shall we be seen out on this bare place asked dinah suddenly jack and philip looked downwards into the valley they had been climbing up and were now on the mountainside theres the plane said jack and look out isnt that one of the men walking over to it lie down flat all of you they all promptly lay down flat jack had his fieldglasses on and he put them to his eyes he could now see clearly that the man was the one called juan he had a pasty white face black oilylooking hair and a small black moustache his neck was thick and his body was thick too he disappeared into the plane hes got into the plane wonder if hes going off said jack will he leave the other man behind he hasnt started up the engines yet after a minute or two the man came out again carrying something though jack could not see what it was he walked off in the direction of the smoke there was a thicket of trees nearby and he disappeared into this he just went into the plane to get something said jack now hes gone again i think perhaps wed better go another way because if we can see him he could certainly see us if he looked up see that gully over there well go that way we shall be well hidden there they made their way to the gully which was a regular suntrap there had obviously been a way up there at some time or other the children followed it climbing higher they came to a ledge that ran rather dangerously round part of the mountainside jack went first it wasnt as dangerous as it looked i think its all right he called its wider than it appears come on im sure it leads to somewhere they made their way round the ledge and came to where the hillside gave them a marvellous view down into the valley and all around it was completely deserted not a cow or sheep or goat was to be seen a little higher up was a black charred building that had clearly been a very large farmhouse only the blackened beams were left and part of the stone walls everything else had fallen to the ground and lay in a miserable ugly ruin another ruin said jack in awe what has been happening in this beautiful valley i simply cant understand it why should houses be burnt like this im beginning to think there isnt a soul here besides ourselves and those two men i think youre right said philip theres no smoke to be seen anywhere and not a single domestic animal not even a dog but what i cant make out is why no one has come here from the surrounding valleys to rebuild the houses and graze their cattle on this marvellous grass perhaps theres something bad about this valley said lucyann with a shiver i dont like the feel of it very much they sat down in the sun which was now climbing high they suddenly felt terribly hungry dinah unexpectedly produced biscuits and chocolate from a bag she carried i guessed wed all be hungry soon she said so i brought half the biscuits and choc we had with us jolly good idea said philip pleased hey lizzie come out and have a crumb dinah at once went a good distance away lizzie came out from philips open collar and ran down his front it was plain that she meant to stay with philip lizzies down the well remarked kiki pecking a piece of chocolate from jacks fingers kiki give that back cried jack where are your manners down the well down the well said kiki who seemed to have got the well on her brain they were all thirsty after the chocolate and biscuits i wish we could find something to drink nice cool clear water like we found in the spring said jack down the well said kiki all right you find us a well of water said jack would it be safe to have a snooze asked dinah suddenly feeling very sleepy its nice here in the sun well only just a little one said philip i should think were safe enough here those men wouldnt come up as far as this you know i think i can hear water somewhere said lucyann as she lay flat on her back the sun shining on her freckled face not very near listen all of you they listened certainly they could hear something that was not the wind blowing round what could it be it didnt sound like the gurgling of a spring well go and see said jack you stay here girls if you like philip and i will go oh no said lucyann at once id rather come with you you might lose us so all four went off together in the direction of the curious noise they climbed higher and came to a rocky stony part which was steep and hard to climb but the noise was now much louder once we round the next corner well see what it is said jack come on they climbed a little higher and then the path led abruptly round a crag of rock it widened out a little the other side and all four children stood gazing in awe at what was making the noise they had heard it was a waterfall but what a big one it fell from a great height almost sheerly down the mountainside and cascaded far below them fine spray rising high in the air it wetted their faces as they stood there and yet they were quite a good way from the mass of water what a wonderful sight said philip awed ive never seen such a big waterfall in my life what a noise it makes i almost have to shout isnt it grand far below the waterfall resolved itself into a winding river that curved round the foot of the mountain the children could not see where it went to the tumbling water shone and sparkled as it fell and here and there rainbows shimmered lucyann thought she had never seen a lovelier sight she licked the spray off her face it formed into little drops and ran down to her mouth im drinking the spray she said oh look theres a puddle in that rock made of the continually falling spray do you think it would be all right to drink it it was very clear and sparkling jack tasted it yes its fine he said have some they watched the waterfall for some time kiki was simply thrilled with it for some reason or other it filled her with mad delight she flew near to it getting splashed with the drops squawking loudly its a magnificent sight said dinah gazing at the roaring waterfall i could watch it all day well come again tomorrow said jack but i really think we ought to be getting back now to that cowshed come on its plain theres nobody to help us just here chapter what are the two men up to lucyann was half afraid they might lose their way going back but the boys had taken good note of everything it was when they got to the wood that difficulty might have arisen but here the notched trees soon set them right they saw that the plane was still down in the valley so the men were somewhere about it would be as well to be careful and jack told kiki to be quiet the waterfall seemed to have gone to her head and she had been very noisy coming back singing and squawking loudly theres our shed said lucyann thankfully it felt quite like home coming back to it from that enormous mountainside i hope all our things are safe they want inside yes their things were there exactly as they had left them good the sun was now sliding down the sky it was about teatime the children wondered whether to finish the rest of their chocolate and biscuits better not said jack well have them before we go to sleep tonight if were terribly hungry oh wait a minute what about the stuff aunt allie packed for us havent we still got that we havent eaten it no of course we havent said dinah i was saving it up weve got so little that i thought wed better not start on that picnic packet yet but all the sandwiches will be stale objected philip who was feeling very empty indeed whats the good of that we might as well eat them whilst theyre eatable well we could eat the sandwiches and leave the cake and the chocolate and biscuits for tomorrow said dinah but first lets get this place ready for us to sleep in tonight its filthy i dont want to sleep here said lucyann i dont like it why cant we sleep outside weve got our macks to lie on and four rugs and we can unpack some of our clothes and have them for pillows but it might pour with rain objected dinah i could perhaps rig up some sort of roof said jack looking round at the ruined shed theres some old posts here and theres a piece of corrugated iron if philip gave me a hand i could rig up the iron sheet on the old posts the two boys tried to do this but the sheet of iron was not held safely enough the girls were terrified it might blow off on to them as they slept if only we could find a cave said lucyann well we cant said jack rather cross that all his efforts with the posts and the iron were of no use anyway i dont think its going to rain look at the clear sky if it does pour well have to get into the stall at the end of the cowshed thats all their work with the posts had made them hungrier than ever dinah undid the picnic packet and took out sandwiches and huge slices of cake they ate the sandwiches in silence enjoying every bite immensely wonder what those men are doing said jack at last i cant see any smoke rising now shall i slip down towards the plane keeping well hidden and see if i can see them yes said philip youre sure you know your way there and back dont get lost for goodness sake if i do ill get kiki to do her expressengine screech said jack with a grin then youll know where we are all right look in the plane if you get a chance and see if you can spot any food there called dinah jack went off with kiki on his shoulder lucyann didnt at all like him going off alone she wished she could have gone with him but she knew he wouldnt have let her lets get our beds ready said dinah who always liked to be doing something come on lucyann help to unpack the cases and get out something for pillows and our macks to lie on whilst jack was gone the other three were very busy soon they had a cosylooking bed spread on the grass under a big birchtree first there were the four macks to keep the damp out then there was one big thick rug for softness there were four piles of woollies for pillows and finally the other three rugs for coverings that looks very good said dinah approvingly pull that rug a little over this way lucyann thats right philip youre to sleep right on the outside i wont have that lizard crawling over me in the night lizzie wont hurt you said philip taking the lizard out of one of his sleeves will you lizzie stroke her dinah shes sweet dont philip said dinah with a squeal as philip brought the lizard near to her on his outstretched hand ill box your ears if you dare to let that lizard touch me oh dont tease her tufty begged lucyann let me have lizzie for a bit i love her but lizzie would not go to lucyann much to her annoyance she ran up philips sleeve and disappeared little bumps appearing here and there in his jersey showed where she was dinah looked up at the sky it was quite clear the sun had almost gone and soon the first stars would prick through the sky she felt tired and irritable so did the others their short night and the shock they had had were beginning to make themselves felt lucyann felt that at any moment a violent quarrel might spring up between dinah and philip so she took dinah off to the spring with her and they washed in the cold clear water and drank they sat there a little while enjoying the beauty of the valley and the mountains around they seem to be crowding in on us said lucyann coming closer how you do imagine things said dinah come on lets get back jack should be here soon and i want to hear what hes got to say they went back philip had laid himself down on the coats and rugs and was yawning i was just coming to look for you girls he said what a time youve been jack isnt back yet i hope hes all right lucyann felt scared she adored her brother she went to stand on a rock so that she might see when he came she turned to the others as soon as she got there hes coming she called and kikis on his shoulder she jumped down from the rock and rushed to meet jack he grinned at her and kiki flew off his shoulder to perch on lucyanns i was beginning to get worried jack said lucyann did anything happen did you see the two men what were they doing they came up to dinah and philip my word what a fine bed said jack and he sank down on it this is something like im jolly tired what happened jack asked philip anything not much said jack i got as near to the plane as i could but i didnt dare to go right up in case i was seen because as you know its right out in the open i couldnt see or hear anything of the men at all was kiki good asked lucyann anxiously i kept on thinking she might screech or something and draw attention to you she was as good as gold said jack scratching kikis poll werent you kiki well i thought the next thing to do would be to try and find where the men were where that smoke came from so keeping as much to the bushes and trees as i could i made my way towards the smoke they must have lighted their fire again because the smoke rose up quite black and thick did you see the men asked dinah i heard their voices first said jack then i thought it would be a good idea to climb a tree and use my fieldglasses so up i shinned and came to the top of a nice little tree not far below me near a tumbledown hut were the two men cooking something over a fire they had made gracious said lucyann werent you scared of being seen no the tree hid me all right said jack and i hadnt made a scrap of noise i got my fieldglasses and looked through them the men were studying some kind of map whatever for said dinah wonderingly i should think they know this part of the world pretty well or they wouldnt have been able to land so easily well theyve come here for some reason havent they said jack goodness knows what but certainly for some definite reason they must be looking for something or someone and the map will probably show them what they want to know i heard one say this way and then up here as if they were planning some sort of expedition we could follow them said dinah at once then wed know no thanks said jack im not going mountainclimbing behind those men they look jolly tough what i say is let them get off on their expedition and well be able to explore that hut of theirs and the plane too we may find something to tell us who they are and what theyre after yes lets do that said lucyann sleepily perhaps theyll go tomorrow i hope they do jack can watch them with his fieldglasses and when theyre safely gone we can do a good old snoop round theres really nothing more to tell said jack with a yawn i couldnt hear any more the men rolled up the map and talked in low voices so i shinned down the tree and came back and here i am lets snuggle down and go to sleep said lucyann i simply cant keep my eyes open were safe here arent we perfectly i should think said jack lying down contentedly anyway kiki will give us warning if anyone comes near good night good night said the others philip added a few words dinah dont yell if a spider runs over you or a rat or a hedgehog there are sure to be plenty out here dinah gave a squeal and covered her head up at once then there was silence they were all fast asleep chapter a wonderful find soon the stars filled the sky an owl hooted and the wind whispered something in the trees overhead but the four children did not see the stars nor hear the owl and the wind they were tired out they slept solidly and though dinah was almost smothered with the rug over her head she did not wake or move kiki slept too her head under her wing she was perched on a branch of the birchtree just over jacks head she awoke when she heard the owl and hooted back softly then she put her head back under her wing and slept again when dawn came the children were still asleep kiki awoke before they did she stretched out first one wing and then another she erected the feathers on her head and shook them then she scratched her neck thoughtfully and gazed down at philip lizzie the lizard was also awake and was running over the rug that covered philip she came to where philips feet stuck out and disappeared under the rug there kikis sharp eyes watched the little moving bump she made under the rug as she made her way all the way up philips body and appeared by his neck wipe your feet said kiki suddenly to the lizard how many times how many times have i told you to wipe your feet lizzie was startled she leapt from philips neck on to jack and stood half hidden in his hair looking up into the trees though she could focus nothing there kiki annoyed at seeing lizzie daring to tread on her beloved master gave an exasperated squawk and flew down to peck the lizard who promptly disappeared under the rug again kiki landed heavily on jacks middle and gave a vicious peck where the rug covered philips right leg for she could see the moving bump there that meant the lizard was running downwards both jack and philip awoke with a start they stared up into the trees both amazed to see green leaves waving above them then they turned their heads and saw one another in a flash they remembered everything couldnt think where i was said jack and sat up oh kiki its you on my middle is it do get off here have some sunflower seeds and keep quiet or youll wake the girls he put his hand in his pocket and took out some of the flat seeds that kiki loved she flew up to the bough above cracking two in her beak the boys began to talk quietly so as not to disturb the girls who were still sleeping peacefully gosh i feel better now said jack stretching out his arms i was so tired last night i could have cried what about you philip im all right too said philip and he yawned hugely but sleepy still well we havent got to get up for breakfast we shant hear any gong sounding here lets have another snooze but jack was now too wide awake to snooze he slipped out from under the rug and went to wash himself at the spring he gazed downwards and saw the spire of smoke rising up just as it had yesterday those fellows are up and about he said to himself must be getting pretty late in the morning i suppose the suns fairly high blow i forgot to wind up my watch last night soon the girls woke up and were amazed to find they had slept solidly all the night through and had apparently not even stirred dinah looked to see where lizzie was its all right said philip amiably shes down one of my socks i like the feel of her tiny fingers on my leg ugh youre awful said dinah well im going to wash then well have breakfast only cake and biscuits im afraid unfortunately they were all so hungry that they devoured the cake the biscuits and the rest of the chocolate too now there was no food left at all well just have to do something about it about the food question i mean said dinah even if it means eating your lizard philip she wouldnt make more than a mouthful would you liz said philip hallo whats that that was the sound of voices hurriedly the four children got up and dragging their rugs macks and other clothes with them they ran quickly to the cowshed they dumped the things into the last stall and crouched there panting have we left anything at all out there whispered jack dont think so whispered back philip the grass is a bit flattened thats all lets hope they wont notice it there was a crack in the side of the old cowshed and jack put his eye to it they had only just got away in time the men were coming slowly up towards the birchtrees talking they came to where the children had slept the night before the men walked right past the spot then one of them stopped and looked back with a puzzled expression he gazed at the place where the children had slept what he said they couldnt hear but he pointed to the flattened grass both men then walked back and looked earnestly down at it whats done that asked the man called juan queer said the other man he had a big fleshy face with full lips and smallish eyes set too close together some animal perhaps why thats big enough for an elephant or two to lie on said juan shall we have a look round the other man looked at his watch no not now he said when we come back perhaps weve got a lot to do today come on it cant be anything really they went on again and were soon lost to sight among the trees im going to get up a tree with my fieldglasses and follow them with them as they go said jack to the others we must make certain they really are gone before we expose ourselves to view he went cautiously out of the shed and ran quickly to a tall tree he was up it in a trice for he was an excellent climber he sat at the top balanced in a swaying branch his legs tightly wound round it he put his glasses to his eyes as soon as the men came out on to the grassy flowery part of the hillside he saw them they did not take the same direction as the children had taken the day before but kept on the flowery part for a long time jack could see them easily with his glasses then they took out a map or paper and stood there looking at it between them not sure of their way thought the boy ah now theyre off again the men now began to climb steeply and jack watched them as long as he could see them but then they rounded a great crag of rock and disappeared from sight he slid down the tree gracious we thought youd gone to sleep in the tree said dinah impatiently im tired of waiting in this filthy shed have the men gone yes theyre far away now said jack its quite safe to come out and have a look round they didnt go the way we did i watched them climbing very steeply up the mountainside come on lets get off whilst we can we could go and have a look inside the aeroplane now said dinah so they all hurried down to the valley and came to where the big aeroplane stood on its enormous wheels the four children climbed up the steps into the cockpit the big crates gone said jack at once i wonder how they got it out it must have been empty or they could never have managed it between them look theres where we hid the other night philip and jack hunted all round the plane for food or information but there was no food at all and not a scrap of paper that would give them any idea as to who the men were or why they had come there they all climbed out again blow said jack were no better off now not even a bar of chocolate we shall starve if we could explore that hut you saw the men by last night i bet wed find plenty of food said dinah dont you remember the men saying lets go to the hut and have a meal well they couldnt have a meal without food could they so the food must be there this was a distinctly cheering idea jack led the way to where he had seen the men sitting by the campfire the night before the fire was almost out though it was still smouldering a little the hut lay nearby it was tumbledown but not burnt as had been all the other buildings they had seen rough repairs had been done to it the one window looked strong and was hardly big enough for anyone to get in or out if he had wanted to the door was also a strong one it was shut locked of course said jack giving it a tug and theyve taken the key who did they think was going to come along and take anything they dont know a thing about us lets look in at the window said lucyann we could see inside easily jack hoisted philip up the boy looked inside finding it difficult at first to make out anything because the interior of the shed was dark the only light came in from the small window ah now i can see better said philip there are a couple of mattresses and rugs and a table and some chairs and a stove of some kind and gosh just look at that what cried everyone impatiently lucyann jumped up and down trying to see in at the window too stacks of food said philip tins and tins of it and pots and jars of stuff golly they make my mouth water jack could bear philips weight no longer he set him down with a jerk hoist me up now he said and philip gave him a hoist jacks eyes nearly fell out of his head when he saw the food neatly piled on shelves that ran along one side of the hut its a kind of storehouse or resthouse he said jumping down from philips back my word if we could only get some why did those men take the key distrustful creatures can we get in at the window asked philip and he looked eagerly up at it no we cant not even lucyann could get in there besides it cant be opened its just a pane of glass set into the windowframe with no catch or fastener to open it wed have to smash it and that would give away the fact that somebody was here the children wandered gloomily round the shed then they set off to see if there was anything else to be found nearby but there wasnt i suppose wed better get back to our own shed and remove our things and hide them somewhere else in case those men do have a look round when they come back said jack how i hate leaving all that food in this shed im starving so am i said lucyann i could almost eat kikis sunflower seeds well have some said jack holding out a handful theyre not poisonous no thanks said lucyann im not as starving as all that philip went up to the door of the shed and glared at it id like to knock you down he said standing there between ourselves and a good square meal take that to the great amusement of the others he aimed a hearty kick at the door and then another it flew wide open the children gasped in surprise and stared it wasnt locked after all cried jack just shut what idiots we were to think it was locked come on now for a feast chapter kiki talks too much they all crowded into the dimly lighted shed they gazed joyfully at the piles of things on the shelves biscuits tongue pineapple sardines milk gosh theres everything here cried jack what shall we start on wait a bit dont lets disarrange the shelf so much that the men will know someone has been here said philip better take tins from the back not the front and we wont eat the fruit and other stuff here well take it away with us i think said jack slowly i really do think it would be a good idea to take away as much of this as we can carry in case we are stuck in this valley for some time we may as well face the fact that we are completely lost and cut off from the world we know and may not be rescued for ages the others looked solemn and lucyann looked scared as well youre right freckles said philip well help ourselves to as much as we can carry look heres a pile of old sacks what about filling a couple of them with the tins and carrying them off between us we could take dozens of the tins then good idea said jack heres a sack for you and dinah to fill and heres one for me and lucyann philip stood on one of the chairs and reached his hand behind the front row of tins on the shelf he threw down tin after tin and the others put them into the two sacks what a store there was in that hut soon the sacks were full and almost too heavy to carry it was nice to think of all that food waiting to be eaten jack found a tinopener too and put it in his pocket before we go lets have a look and see if we can find any papers or documents that will tell us something about these mysterious airmen said philip but although they hunted in every corner and even under the pile of sacks they could find nothing i wonder what they did with that crate they had in the plane said jack we havent found that anywhere id like to have a squint at that too the crate was not in the shed so the children wandered out and had another good look round and in a copse of young trees and bushes with a tarpaulin over them they found about six of the wooden crates funny said jack pulling away the tarpaulin look lots of them all empty what are they going to put into them goodness knows said philip who would bring empty crates to this deserted valley hoping to find something to fill them only madmen oh you dont really think those men are mad do you said lucyann in alarm what shall we do if they are keep out of their way thats all said philip come on did we shut that door yes we did now heaveho dinah catch hold of your end of the sack and well go back to our shed stumbling under the weight of the clanking sacks the four children made their way slowly back to the shed they had hidden their things in jack dumped his sack and then ran to climb the tree he had climbed before meaning to sweep the countryside with his fieldglasses and see if the men were by any chance returning yet but there was no sign of them all clear at the moment said jack going back to the others now for a meal the finest weve ever had because weve never been so hungry before they chose a tin of biscuits and opened it they took out about forty biscuits feeling perfectly certain that they could manage at least ten each they opened a tin of tongue which jack carved very neatly with his penknife then they opened a tin of pineapple chunks and a tin of milk what a meal said jack sitting down contentedly on the sunwarmed ground well here goes never did food taste so completely delicious mmmmmmmm murmured lucyann meaning this is simply gorgeous kiki imitated her at once mmmmmmm mmmmmm no word was spoken except when dinah saw kiki delving too deeply into the tin of pineapple jack do stop kiki shell eat it all kiki retired to a branch of the tree above a large chunk of pineapple in her claw mmmmmmm she kept saying mmmmmm dinah went to the spring and rinsed out the empty tin of milk then she filled it with clear cold water and came back she emptied the water into the pineapple juice left at the bottom of the tin and shook it up then she offered everyone a pineapple drink to end the meal gosh i do feel better now said jack and he undid his belt and let it out two or three holes thank goodness you lost your temper and kicked that door philip we were so sure that it was locked and the key taken silly of us said philip lying down and shutting his eyes what are we going to do with the empty tins youre obviously going to do nothing said dinah ill push them down a rabbithole the rabbits can lick them out she picked up a tin and gave a scream she dropped it and lizzie the lizard ran out in a hurry she had been sniffing in delight at the crumbs of tongue left there the tiny creature ran to philip and disappeared down his neck dont tickle lizzie murmured philip sleepily id better keep a watchout in case the men come back said jack and he climbed his tree again lucyann and dinah stuffed the empty tins down a large rabbithole kiki looked down the hole at the tins in surprise then walked solemnly down and began to tug at one of the tins no kiki dont said lucyann jack take kiki with you up the tree jack whistled kiki flew to him at once and perched contentedly on his shoulder as he climbed his tree moving from side to side when a bough threatened to knock her off wed better bring out all our cases and things ready to hide them somewhere better than in the cowshed said dinah if those men do look round here when they come back theyll see them in the cowstall as sure as anything so the two girls lugged everything out dinah grumbling because philip lay apparently asleep and would not stir himself to help them jack came down the tree no sign of them yet he said now the thing is where can we hide these things really well down the well suggested kiki hearing the word well shut up kiki said jack he looked all round but could think of nowhere then an idea struck him i tell you where would be a jolly good place he said where asked the girls well see that big tree there the one with thick spreading branches we could get up there and pull up our things quite easily and hide them in the leafy branches no one would think of looking up there either for us or our belongings the girls gazed at the thicklyleafed tree it was an eatingchestnut tree dark and full of glossy leaves just the place but how can we get the suitcases up asked dinah theyre not terribly big but theyre quite heavy jack undid a rope from round his waist he nearly always had one there here you are he said i can climb up the tree and let down this rope you can slip it through the handle of one of the suitcases and knot it then ill give a jolly good heave and up itll come lets wake philip then said dinah who didnt see why her brother shouldnt join in the labour of heaving things up a tree she went over and shook him he awoke with a jump come and help us you lazy thing said dinah jacks found a marvellous hidingplace for us all philip joined the others and agreed that it was indeed a fine place he said he would go up with jack and pull up the cases kiki was most interested in all the proceedings when jack hung the rope down the tree she flew to it and gave it such a tug with her beak that it was pulled from jacks hand and fell to the ground kiki what did you do that for you bad bird called jack now ive got to climb all the way down and up again idiot kiki went off into one of her neverending cackles of laughter she waited her chance and once again pulled the rope from poor jacks hand jack called her sternly she came cracking her beak not quite liking jacks stern voice he tapped her very sharply on the beak bad kiki naughty kiki go away i dont want you no go away kiki flew off squawking dismally jack was not very often cross with her but she knew he was this time she retired inside the dark cowshed and sat high up on a blackened beam swaying herself to and fro poor kiki poor poor kiki she groaned pop goes kiki jack and philip soon hauled everything up and stowed it away safely in the forks of the big spreading branches then jack shinned up a bit higher and put his glasses to his eyes what he saw made him call urgently to the girls the men are coming quick get up have you left anything behind have a look and see the girls took a quick look round they could see nothing lucyann climbed the tree quickly with dinah just behind her they settled themselves on broad branches and peered down they could see nothing at all for the leaves were far too thick well if they couldnt see down certainly nobody could see up so that was all right soon they could hear voices the men were coming near the children sat as quiet as mice in the tree lucyann felt a terrible longing to cough and she put her hand over her mouth down below the men were making a good search of the old cowshed they found nothing of course for everything had been removed by the children then they wandered out again and looked at the flattened grass it puzzled them very much ill just have one more look in that shed said the man called juan he disappeared into the shed once more kiki who was still up on the blackened beam sulking was annoyed to see him again wipe your feet she said severely and how many times have i told you to shut the door the man jumped violently and peered all round kiki was huddled in a corner up in the roof and he could not see her he looked in all the other corners of the room hardly believing his ears he called to his companion look here he said somebody just now told me to wipe my feet and shut the door youre mad said the other man you cant be feeling well pussy down the well announced kiki well well well use your handkerchief the men clutched one another kikis voice was so unexpected in that dark shed lets be quiet and listen said juan kiki heard the words be quiet shhhhhhhhshhhhhh she said at the top of her voice that was too much for the men they fled out into the open air chapter new plans kiki was glad to see the two men go shut the door she shouted after them shut the door the men ran off and only stopped when they were well away from the shed juan mopped his forehead what do you make of that he said a voice and nothing else the other man was rapidly recovering where theres a voice theres a body he said theres somebody here somebody playing tricks on us i thought when i saw that flattened piece this morning that we were not alone here whos here do you think anybodys got wind of the treasure the four children hidden well in the leaves of the tree just above the heads of the two men pricked up their ears at once treasure oho so that was what the men were after in this lonely deserted valley treasure how could anyone know what we know said juan scornfully dont get nerves just because you heard a voice pepi why maybe it was just a parrot pepi laughed loudly it was his turn to be scornful now a parrot what will you say next juan he said with a sneer have you ever known parrots to live here before and talking ones too if thats a parrot ill eat my hat and yours as well the listening children grinned at one another lucyann thought she would like to see pepi whoever he was eating his hat he would have to eat juans too for kiki was most certainly a parrot its somebody hiding about here said pepi though how they got here goodness knows juan maybe there is a cellar beneath that cowshed we will go and find out if anyone is hiding there he will be very very sorry for himself the children didnt like the tone of his voice at all lucyann shivered what horrid men they went cautiously to the cowshed juan stood at the brokendown doorway he called loudly come out of the cellar whoever you are we give you this one chance noone came out of course for one thing there was noone to come out and for another there was no cellar to come from juan held a revolver in his hand kiki rather alarmed at the shouting voice said nothing at all which was fortunate for her the silence was too much for juan he took aim at where he supposed a cellar might be and a shot rang out bang kiki almost tumbled off the beam in fright and the four children nearly fell out of their tree jack just clutched lucyann in time and held her tightly bang another shot the children imagined that juan must be firing blindly merely to frighten the person he thought he had heard talking what a pity kiki had been in the shed sulking jack felt most alarmed he was afraid she might have been shot the men came out again they stood looking about for some moments and then walked near to the chestnut tree talking noone there now must have slipped off i tell you pepi there has been someone here maybe spying on us well he surely wouldnt give himself away by telling us to wipe our feet and shut the door said pepi scornfully well come back tomorrow and scour this place completely said juan im certain theres somebody here talking english too what does it mean i feel very alarmed about it we didnt want anyone to get wind of our mission certainly we must scour this place well said pepi we must find out who is the owner of that voice no doubt about that id start a good hunt now but its getting dark and im hungry come on lets get back to the childrens huge relief the two men disappeared jack who by climbing to the very top of the tree could see the aeroplane waited till he could see the two men passing by it on their way to their own hut then he called down to the others all clear now theyre by the plane my word what a shock i had when those shots went off lucyann nearly fell off her branch lizzie shot out of my pocket and disappeared said philip i say i hope kikis all right jack she must have been scared out of her life when the shots rang out in that little shed kiki was sitting petrified on the beam when the children went into the cowshed she crouched down trembling jack called to her softly its all right kiki come on down im here to fetch you kiki flew down at once and landed on jacks shoulder she made a great fuss of him mmmmmmm she kept saying mmmmmm it was dark in the shed the children didnt like it lucyann kept feeling there might be someone hiding in the corners lets come out she said what are we going to do tonight is it safe to sleep where we did last night no wed better take our rugs and things somewhere else said jack theres a patch of bushes higher up where wed be sheltered from the wind and hidden from view too we could take them there i say do you know what we left in the shed said philip suddenly we left our sacks of tins look there they are in that corner what a mercy the men didnt notice they were full of something said jack still im not surprised they took no notice of them really they just look like heaps of rubbish well drag them up to the bushes though our store of food is too precious to be left behind they dragged the sacks to the patch of bushes and left them there then they debated what to do about the things up the tree lets just bring down the rugs and our macks said jack the clothes we used for pillows are wrapped in the rugs we could leave the suitcases up there we dont want them dragged about with us it was now getting so dark that it was quite difficult to get the rugs and macks down but they managed it somehow then they made their way again to the bushes dinah and lucyann spread out the bed as they called it it wont be so warm here said dinah the wind creeps round rather where are we going to hide tomorrow those men will look behind these bushes thats certain do you remember that waterfall asked philip there seemed to be a nice lot of rocks and hidingplaces down towards the foot i believe we could climb down there and find quite a good place yes lets said lucyann id like to see that waterfall again they all lay down on the rug they pressed close together for it was certainly cold dinah took a pullover from her pillow and put it on suddenly she gave a scream making the others jump oh oh theres something running over me it must be a rat well it isnt came philips delighted voice its lizzie shes found me good old lizzie so it was how the little lizard had discovered where philip was nobody could imagine it was part of the spell that philip always seemed to exercise on wild creatures dont worry dinah said philip lizzie is safely in my pocket now poor thing i bet she felt dizzy falling down the tree dizzy lizzie said kiki at once delighted with the two words dizzy lizzie everyone laughed kiki was really funny at times doesnt she love to put words together that have the same sounds said lucyann do you remember last hols she kept saying fustymustydusty till we nearly screamed at her fustymustydusty dizzy lizzie said kiki at once and screeched dont said jack youre only showing off now kiki go to sleep and if you dig your claws into my tummy like you did this morning ill smack you god save the king said kiki devoutly and said no more the children talked for a little while longer then the girls and philip fell asleep jack lay on his back with kiki on one of his ankles he looked up at the stars what was the good of promising aunt allie they wouldnt have any more adventures the very night they had promised her they had whizzed off in a strange aeroplane to an unknown valley where apparently some sort of treasure was hidden most extraordinary most extra and then jack was asleep too and the stars shone down on the four children moving across the sky till dawn slid into the east and put out all the stars one by one philip awoke early he had meant to for he did not know how early the men might start hunting for the owner of the voice he awoke the others and would not listen to their protests no youve really got to wake up dinah he said we must start early today go on wake up or ill put dizzy lizzie down your neck that woke poor dinah up properly she sat up and tried to slap philip but he dodged away she hit kiki instead the parrot gave a surprised and aggrieved squawk oh sorry kiki said dinah sorry i didnt mean that for you poor poor kiki what a pity what a pity said kiki flying off in case dinah sent out any more slaps well have a quick breakfast said jack sardines biscuits and milk i think i saw a tin of sardines at the top of one of our sacks yes here it is they saw smoke rising up from where the two men were and knew that they too were up so they finished their breakfast quickly and dinah once more pushed the tins down a convenient rabbithole then they ruffled up the grass on which they had been lying so that it did not look quite so flat i think wed better find a good hidingplace for most of these tins said philip and take just a few of them with us to last us for today we cant possibly lug these heavy sacks along all the way couldnt we drop them into the middle of these bushes said dinah theyre awfully thick nobody would guess they were there we could slip back and fetch any we wanted so the sacks were dropped into the middle of the bushes and certainly no one could see them unless they actually crawled into the very middle then the children gathered up their rugs macks and odd clothes and set off the boys carried the tins and jack had his camera and his glasses as well so they were heavily laden and could not go very fast they took the same way that they had taken before when they came to the grassy flowerstrewn hillside they sat down for a rest after all the men would hardly be following them they would be hunting all round and about the cowshed suddenly from far off jack caught sight of a brilliant twinkling flash he lay down flat at once telling the others to do the same theres someone using fieldglasses down there he said we may not be seen if we lie flat i just caught the flash of the sun on the eyelenses dash i forgot the men might sweep the mountainside with glasses theyll be after us if theyve seen us lets crawl to that rock and get behind it said philip come on once were behind there we can get on and find the waterfall chapter a fine hidingplace when they were behind the rock the children felt sure they could not be seen and they breathed more easily philip looked round and about the gully they had been in before lay a little to the left they could reach it without being seen from below come on said philip choosing a path that put rocks or bushes between them and the valley below this way up the hot gully went the children and came to the ledge that ran round a steep bit of the mountain they made their way round and once more saw the wonderful view they had seen before above them stood the ruined burntout farmhouse lucyann carefully didnt look at it it gave her such a miserable feeling to see the blackened beams and fallen walls they stood and listened for the sound of the waterfall it came softly to their ears a continuous musical sound like a faroff orchestra playing a simple tune what a lovely noise said dinah philip shall we climb down or up now if you want to go to the foot of the waterfall and hide somewhere among the rocks there we ought to climb down oughtnt we last time we climbed up over that rocky stony bit the boys stood and considered it would perhaps be best if we went down this time said jack at last those rocks just above the waterfall may be slippery to climb down on for they will be wet with the spray we dont want to slip and were carrying so many things that we havent free hands to use so they chose a way that led downwards philip went first finding the safest path he could not that there was a real path of course for there was not as they came nearer to the waterfall spray blew around them and left a fine wet mist on their hair they were hot with climbing and the spray was deliciously cool they rounded a corner and saw the whole of the cascading water at once what a sight lucyann drew a quick breath of awe and delight and stood staring what a thunderous noise shouted jack trying to make his voice heard it makes me feel all excited it does me too agreed dinah as if i want to do a jig or a hornpipe or something and it makes me want to shout and yell well lets said jack and he began to caper and shout as if he was mad the others did the same except lucyann it was almost as if they were trying to outshout and outdance the tumbling roaring water they soon stopped quite exhausted they were on a flat rock which was wet with the flying spray they were not nearly at the foot of the water after all but about a quarter of the way up the fall the noise filled their ears and sometimes the force of the spray made them gasp it was somehow very exciting well said jack at last when they had gazed their fill at the waterfall lets think about a good hidingplace i must say i dont think those men would dream of coming here to look for us they all looked about for a cave or mass of rocks in or behind which they could hide lucyann looked a little doubtful i dont know if i can bear to hear this terrific noise going on in my ears all the time she called to jack it makes me feel a bit dizzy dizzy lizzie remarked kiki at once she too had been excited by the waterfall and had shouted with the others well youll have to put up with the noise said jack youll soon get used to it lucyann looked worried she was quite sure she wouldnt get used to that thundering going on all the time she would never never be able to sleep through it the children wandered about by the waterfall not going too near it because of the thick spray around it they couldnt seem to find any good place to hide in at all all the rocks there seemed to be wet and there seemed to be no comfortable spot in which to put their things our rugs would be soaked in no time with the fine mist that hangs about the fall said dinah and we cant possibly lie on wet rugs i dont believe this was such a good idea after all jack was climbing a little higher he came to where a giant fern grew it hung down like a great green curtain and was lovely to see jack wondered whether they could hide behind it he pushed aside the hanging green fronds and gave a shout at once the others didnt hear it because of the noise of the water golly said jack to himself theres a cave behind this hanging fern and it will be quite dry because the fern screens it from the spray its like a great thick curtain hey you others but again nobody heard him jack couldnt wait for them to pay attention to him he went through the hanging fronds and found himself in a dim dry cave with a fairly low roof and moss growing on the floor he felt it it was dry probably when the fern died down in the autumn the spray flew into the cave and the moss then grew damp and flourished well but now it was like a soft dry green bed this is just exactly the place for us said jack delighted absolutely marvellous nobody could possibly see us here because the fern hangs down over the entrance and it was only quite by accident i found it it would be a most exciting place for us there was a ledge running around one side of it like a bench we could put all our things there tins and so on said jack to himself and when weve put our macks down on this moss well have a most lovely bed i really must tell the others it was quite time that he showed himself for the others had now missed him and were yelling at the tops of their voices for him jack jack where are you jack jack heard their voices as he pushed aside the fernfronds and looked out just his head showing dinah and kiki suddenly caught sight of his face peering out of the fern some way above them kiki gave a squawk of surprise and flew up at once dinah jumped look she yelled to philip and lucyann look where jack is hiding behind that giant fern jack put his hands to his mouth and yelled at the top of his voice trying to drown the noise of the waterfall come on up here ive found something marvellous the others climbed up eagerly jack held aside the green fronds for them wont you come into my parlour he said politely so pleased to see you all they passed through the green curtain into the cave behind they called out in delighted surprise what a lovely place nobody could ever find us here theres a soft green carpet on the floor its moss the roar of the fall isnt nearly so loud here we can hear ourselves speak glad you like it said jack modestly i found it quite by accident its perfect isnt it it was lucyann was relieved that the thunder of the waterfall was lessened here in the cave dinah was thrilled with the softness of the moss philip was pleased by the real safety of such a hidingplace nobody would ever find it except by chance lets go and fetch our things from the rock where we left them said dinah who always liked all her belongings set out neatly together there is plenty of room for them here i shall put our tins of food on that rocky ledge we can only just stand upright said philip he went to where the green fronds hung down over the entrance making the cave rather dark he parted the fronds and at once a ray of sunshine fell into the cave lighting it up well we could tie back some of the fern so that we get the sun in the cave said philip weve got a jolly good view of the waterfall from here and we can see everything around well so that if anyone comes we shall spot them at once its fine i shant mind living here a bit for a little while said lucyann happily i feel safe here you may have to live here a long while said philip well i can think of worse places those men would never find us here said jack never he tied back some of the fronds and the children sat down on the floor for a little while enjoying the sunshine that now poured in the moss was like a cushion to sit on after a bit they all climbed down to where they had left their rugs and tins and other things they carried them up to their new home dinah arranged the loose things on the rocky ledge they looked nice there we shall have a lovely soft bed tonight she said we ought to sleep jolly well in here its not musty or stuffy fustymustydusty said kiki at once remembering the three words she had learnt in the last holidays fustymustydusty fusty oh dont begin that again kiki said jack we got tired of that long ago kiki flew to his shoulder and looked out of the queer little cave there was really a wonderful view outside first of all the cascading waterfall with rainbows caught in it here and there then beyond it the steep mountainside and far beyond that lower down the green valley which stretched to the foot of steep mountains on the opposite side towering up one behind the other it was about time for a meal again all the children seemed to get hungry at the same time and they glanced at the tins on the shelf or ledge jack felt for his tinopener you mind you dont lose that said philip thats our most precious possession at the moment jack your tinopener dont worry i shant lose it said jack and began to open a tin kiki watched with her head on one side she liked these tins they had most exciting things inside she considered soon they were all sitting eating hungrily looking out of the cave entrance to the sparkling waterfall not far off it was nice to sit there munching away with that lovely view outside the soft moss beneath them and the warm sun on their bare legs we do seem to have some adventures said jack its most peculiar the way we cant seem to keep out of them i do hope bill and aunt allie arent worrying too much about us if only we could get word to them we cant said philip were stuck here all alone with no means of getting into touch with anyone as far as i can see except those two men im blessed if i can see what to do thank goodness weve got plenty of food wed better go back to that bush where we dumped the rest of the tins and fetch them along here as soon as we can said jack what weve brought wont last us more than today will you two girls be all right if philip and i go along and get what we can we shant be able to bring them all at one go we must make several journeys yes we shall be quite all right here said dinah giving kiki the last bit of salmon out of her tin you set off this afternoon you can leave kiki here to guard us chapter the cave of echoes it was very early in the afternoon the boys knew they would have plenty of time to go to the bush where their tins were hidden and fetch them to the cave perhaps between them they could carry one sack wed better go now said jack well have to keep a sharp lookout for those men because they were going to have a jolly good look round and we dont want them to spot us now youre sure you girls will be all right quite said dinah lazily she felt glad she was not going to go all the way back to that bush and then drag a heavy sack to the cave she lay back on the moss it was so very very soft and springy too jack slung his fieldglasses round him they might be useful in trying to spot any men from far off he and philip slid through the green fronds of fern jack called back to the girls raising his voice high if you should happen to spot anyone near here remember to untie the string that ties back these ferns at once see he said then they will swing back and the cave will be completely hidden lucyann see that kiki doesnt follow us lucyann had kiki on her shoulder where jack had just put her she put her hand round the birds ankles and held her kiki knew then that she was not supposed to go with jack and philip and she gave a dismal squawk what a pity what a pity she said gloomily and raised up her crest fiercely but lucyann would not let her go she held her until jack and philip were out of sight then she lowered her hand and kiki flew off her shoulder and out of the cave she perched on a rock looking for jack down the well she said grumpily blackbirds down the well no blackbirds in a pie said lucyann what a bird you are for getting things mixed up kiki poor kiki said kiki and cracked her beak loudly poor kiki she flew back into the cave dinah was fast asleep stretched out on the green moss her mouth open kiki flew over and put her head on one side looking at dinahs open mouth then she plucked up a bit of moss with her curved beak kiki dont you dare to put that into dinahs mouth cried lucyann knowing kikis mischievous ways youre a bad bird wipe your feet said kiki crossly and flew to the back of the cave lucyann turned over on her tummy and watched her she didnt trust kiki in this mood the sun poured into the cave it felt breathless in there lucyann thought it would be a good idea to untie the fronds and let them swing together to keep out the sun so she pulled the bit of string that jack had shown her and at once the ferny curtain descended and the cave was lost in a dim green twilight rather exciting to be in dinah didnt wake lucyann lay on her tummy again thinking of all that had happened the noise of the waterfall came in rather muffled now for the curtain of fronds was very thick kiki said lucyann kiki where are you there was no answer from kiki lucyann tried to make out where the parrot was she must be sulking because philip and jack hadnt taken her with them silly old kiki kiki come over here said lucyann come and talk to me ill teach you three little kittens have lost their mittens still there was no answer from kiki not even a squawk lucyann wondered why even if kiki sulked she would usually talk back if anyone spoke to her she peered towards the back of the cave no kiki there she looked at the ledge on which their goods were neatly arranged no kiki there well where was she then she hadnt flown out between the fernfronds that was certain she must be somewhere in the cave on the rocky ledge was a torch lucyann felt for it and took it into her hand she switched it on and flashed it round the cave kiki was nowhere to be seen she was not even perched up anywhere in the low roof of the cave how very mysterious lucyann now felt quite alarmed she awoke dinah who sat up rubbing her eyes cross to be awakened whats the matter she said i was having such a lovely snooze i cant find kiki said lucyann ive looked everywhere dont be so silly shes gone out of the cave after jack i expect said dinah even crosser she lay down again and yawned lucyann shook her youre not to go to sleep again dinah i tell you kiki was here a little while ago at the back of the cave and now shes gone absolutely vanished well let her shell come back all right said dinah leave me alone lucyann she shut her eyes lucyann didnt like to say any more dinah could be so fierce when she was cross the little girl sighed and wished the boys were back what had happened to kiki she got up and walked across the moss to the back of the cave the rock was folded in on itself there and there was a space behind one of the folds lucyann looked cautiously into the dark space expecting to see kiki hiding there ready to cry bo at her as she sometimes most annoyingly did but kiki wasnt there lucyann flashed her torch up and down the little hidden corner and suddenly her torch came to a stop focussed on one place why theres a hole there said lucyann in surprise thats where kiki must have gone she clambered up to the hole which was about shoulderhigh it was just big enough for her to squeeze through she expected to drop down into another cave the other side but she didnt the hole went upwards slightly a round narrow tunnel lucyann felt sure kiki must have disappeared into this queer dark little tunnel kiki she yelled and flashed her torch in front of her where are you idiot come back no sound from kiki lucyann squeezed herself right into the round tunnel wondering how long it was it was almost as round as a pipe maybe water had forced its way through at one time but now it was quite dry lucyann could not hear any sound of the waterfall once she was in the tunnel though she listened hard it was very quiet there kiki she yelled kiki dinah heard the yell in her dreams and awoke with a jump she sat up crossly again but this time lucyann was not in the cave with her now it was dinahs turn to feel scared she remembered that lucyann said that kiki had suddenly disappeared now it seemed as if lucyann had too the fronds of fern were hanging over the entrance lucyann would not have pushed out through them without telling dinah she was going out dinah examined the cave well no lucyann oh goodness now what had happened to her and kiki she heard another yell sounding rather muffled and distant she went to the back of the cave and discovered the hidden space she fetched another torch from the ledge and shone it up and down she stared in amazement when she saw two shoes sticking out of a round hole about as high as her shoulder she tugged at lucyanns ankles and yelled at her lucyann what do you think youre doing where are you going whats up that hole lucyann yelled back i dont know dinah i found it by accident i think kiki must have gone up it shall i go up and see if i can find her you come too all right called dinah go on up lucyann wriggled further up the narrow pipelike tunnel it suddenly widened out and by the light of her torch she saw below her another cave but a vast one this time she managed to get out of the hole and had a look round at the cave it was more like an underground hall its roof was very high indeed from somewhere in its dim vastness came a mournful voice what a pity what a pity kiki so you are here cried lucyann and then listened in astonishment to the echo that sounded immediately here here here are here are here cried the echoes repeating themselves in a weird and strange manner hurry up dinah called lucyann not liking the echoes at all up dinah dinah dinah called the echoes at once kiki flew over to lucyann frightened so many voices whatever could they all be poor kiki said the parrot in a fright poor kiki kiki kiki kiki called the echoes the parrot shivered and gazed all round trying to see who called her she suddenly gave a loud and defiant squawk at once a score of squawks sounded all round as if the cave was filled with hundreds of parrots kiki was simply astounded could there be so many birds there that she couldnt see dinah crawled out of the hole and stood by lucyann what an enormous place she said place shouted the echoes everything we say is repeated said lucyann its weird weird its weird said the echoes well lets whisper then said dinah whispering herself the cave was at once filled with mysterious whispers which scared the girls even more than the repeated shouts they had heard they clutched one another then dinah recovered herself its only the echoes she said you often get them in enormous caves like this i wonder if anyone has ever been here before never i should think said lucyann flashing her torch all round fancy we may be treading in a place that no one else has ever trodden in before lets explore the cave a bit said dinah not that there seems much to see but we might as well do something whilst were waiting for the boys so they walked slowly round the great dark cave their footsteps repeated a hundred times by the echoes once when dinah sneezed the girls were really frightened by the enormous explosive noises that came from all round them the echoes certainly enjoyed themselves then oh dont sneeze again dinah begged lucyann its really awful to hear the echoes sneezing worse than hearing them squawk like kiki they had gone almost all the way round the cave when they came to a passage leading out of it a high narrow passage between two walls of rocks look at that said dinah surprised a passage do you suppose it leads anywhere it might said lucyann and her eyes gleamed dont forget dinah that those men are after treasure we dont know what kind but its just possible it might be hidden somewhere in these mountains lets follow the passage then said dinah kiki come along we dont want to leave you behind kiki flew to her shoulder in silence the two girls entered the narrow rocky passage their torches gleaming in front of them what were they going to find chapter behind the waterfall the passage was a very winding one it led a little downwards and the floor was very uneven to the feet the girls tripped and stumbled very often once the roof came down so low that they had to crawl under it but it grew high again almost at once after a while they heard a noise they couldnt imagine what it was it was a deep and continuous roar that never stopped even for a second whats that said dinah are we getting into the heart of the mountain do you think lucyann thats not the roar of a mighty fire is it what can it be what is there that could make that noise in the middle of a mountain i dont know said lucyann and immediately wanted to go back a fire in the heart of a mountain a fire that roared like that she didnt in the least want to see it she felt hot and breathless at the thought but dinah wasnt going back now that they had come so far what go back before weve found out where this passage goes to she said of course not the boys would laugh like anything when we told them we dont often get the chance of discovering something before they do why we might even happen on the treasure whatever it is lucyann lucyann felt that she didnt care in the least about treasure all she wanted was to get back to the safety of the cave she knew the cave with the green ferncurtains well you go back then said dinah unkindly im going on baby it was more frightening to think of going back to the cave of echoes by herself than to go on with dinah so poor lucyann chose unwillingly to go on with that queer muffled roar in her ears she pressed on down the winding passage keeping close to dinah the roar became louder and then the girls knew what it was it was the waterfall of course how stupid of them not to think of that but it sounded so different there in the mountain were not going into the heart of the mountain after all said dinah were coming out somewhere near the waterfall i wonder where they got a tremendous surprise when they did see daylight the passage suddenly took one last turn and took them into subdued daylight that flickered and shone round them in a curious way a draught of cold air met them and something wetted their hair lucyann weve come out on to a flat ledge just behind the waterfall cried dinah in astonishment look theres the great mass of falling water just in front of us oh the colours in it can you hear me the water is making such a noise overwhelmed by surprise and by the noise lucyann stood and stared the water made a great rushing curtain between them and the open air it poured down shining and exultant never stopping the power behind it awed the two girls they felt very small and feeble when they watched that great volume of water pouring down a few feet in front of them it was amazing to be able to stand on a ledge just behind the waterfall and yet not to be affected by it in any way except to feel the fine spray misting the air the ledge was very wide and ran the whole width of the fall there was a rock about a foot high at one end of the ledge and the girls sat down on it to watch the amazing sight in front of them what will the boys say wondered dinah lets stay here till we see them coming back if we sit on this rock just at the edge of the waterfall we can wave to them they will be so astonished to see us here theres no way of getting to this ledge from above or below only from behind from the passage we found yes well surprise the boys said lucyann no longer frightened look we can see our cave up there at least we can see the giant fern whose fronds are hiding it we shall easily be able to see the boys when they come back kiki was very quiet indeed she had been surprised to come out behind the great wall of water she sat on a ledge and watched it blinking every now and again i hope she wont be silly enough to try and fly through the waterfall said lucyann anxiously she would be taken down with it and dashed to pieces i know she would she wont do anything so silly said dinah shes wise enough to know what would happen if she tried something like that she may fly out round the edge of the waterfall though still there shouldnt be much danger for her in that the girls sat there for a long time feeling that they would never get tired of watching the turbulence of the waterfall after a long time lucyann gave a cry and caught dinahs arm look is that the boys coming yes it is theyve got a sack between them good now we shall have plenty of food they watched the two boys labouring up the rocks that led to the cave it was no good waving to them yet then suddenly dinah stiffened with horror whats the matter said lucyann in alarm seeing dinahs face look someone is following the boys said dinah see its one of the men and theres the other one too oh my goodness i dont believe either philip or jack knows it theyll watch where they go and our hiding place will be found jack philip oh jack look out she went to the very edge of the waterfall and holding on to a fern growing there she leaned out beyond it yelling and waving quite forgetting that the men could see and hear her as well as the boys but alas jack and philip engrossed in the task of getting the heavy sack up the rocks neither saw nor heard dinah but the men suddenly caught sight of her and stared in the utmost astonishment they could not make out if she was girl boy man or woman for the edges of the waterfall continually moved and shifted all they could make out was that there was definitely someone dancing about and waving behind the great fall look said one man to the other just look at that see behind the water thats where theyre hiding my word what a place how do they get there the men stared openmouthed at the waterfall their eyes searching for a way up to it that would lead to the ledge where the excited figure stood waving meantime jack and philip quite unaware of the following men or of dinah either had reached the curtain of fern philip pushed the ferns aside and jack hauled the sack up through them panting painfully for it was heavy at last the sack lay on the floor of moss the boys flung themselves down their hearts thumping with the labour of climbing up steeply to the cave dragging such a heavy sack at first they did not even notice that the girls were not there not far off some way below stood the two men completely bewildered in watching dinah behind the waterfall they had just missed seeing jack and philip creep through the ferns into their cave so when they turned from gazing at the waterfall they found that the boys they had so warily followed had utterly disappeared where have they gone demanded juan they were on that rock there when we saw them last yes then i caught sight of that person waving down there and took my eyes off them for a minute and now theyve gone growled pepi well theres no doubt where theyve gone theyve taken some path that leads to that waterfall they hide behind it and a clever place it is too who would think of anyone hiding just behind a great curtain of water like that well we know where to find them well make our way to the water and climb up to that ledge well soon hunt the rats out they began to climb down hoping to find a way that would lead them to the ledge behind the waterfall it was difficult and dangerous going on the slippery rocks in the cave the boys soon recovered they sat up and looked round for the girls hallo where are lucyann and dinah said jack in astonishment they promised to stay here till we got back surely to goodness they havent gone wandering about anywhere theyll get lost sure as anything they were not in the cave that was absolutely certain the boys did not see the hole in the fold of rock at the back they were extremely puzzled jack parted the ferns and looked out to his enormous astonishment he at once saw the two men clambering about on rocks near the waterfall his eyes nearly dropped out of his head look there he said to philip closing the fronds a little fearful of being seen those two men golly they might have seen us getting in here how did they get here we saw them safely by the plane on our way to the bush dinah had now disappeared from behind the waterfall she could not make up her mind whether or not the men had seen the boys climbing in through the fern to their cave in any case she thought she ought to warn them of the mens appearance she felt sure that neither jack nor philip knew they were there come on lucyann she said urgently we must get back to the boys oh goodness look at those men i believe they are going to try and get over here now they must have spotted me waving do come quickly lucyann shivering with excitement lucyann followed dinah along the dark winding passage that led back to the cave of echoes dinah went as quickly as she could flashing her torch in front of her both girls forgot all about kiki the parrot was left sitting alone behind the waterfall spray misting her feathers watching the clambering men with interested eyes she had not heard the girls going off dinah and lucyann came out into the cave of echoes at last dinah stopped and considered now where exactly was that hole we came through she said came through through through called the echoes mockingly oh be quiet cried dinah to the echoes quiet quiet quiet yelled back the irritating voices dinah flashed her torch here and there and by a very lucky chance she found the hole in a trice she was in it crawling along with lucyann close behind her lucyann had an awful feeling that somebody was going to clutch her feet from behind and she almost bumped into dinahs shoes in her efforts to scramble down the hole as quickly as possible jack and philip were peeping through the fern watching the men when the girls dropped out of the hole at the back of the cave came round the fold of rock and flung themselves on the boys they almost jumped out of their skin philip hit out thinking that enemies were upon them dinah got a stinging box on the ear and yelled she immediately hit out at philip and the two rolled on the floor dont oh dont wailed lucyann almost in tears philip jack its us its us philip shook off dinah and sat up jack stared in amazement but where did you come from he demanded golly you gave us an awful scare i can tell you jumping out like that where have you been theres a hole back there we went into explained dinah giving philip an angry look i say do you two boys know that those men were following you they were not very far behind you we were scared stiff they would see you climbing in here were they following us said jack golly i didnt know that peep out between these fronds you girls and see them hunting for us down there chapter safe in the cave they all peeped out between the fernfronds lucyann holding her breath yes there were the two men clambering about dangerously near the waterfall but what are they doing down there said jack in wonder why look for us there they must have known we didnt go that way if they were following us well they must have seen me waving to you from behind the waterfall said dinah they must think thats where our hidingplace is waving to us from behind the waterfall said philip in the utmost amazement what are you talking about dinah you must be bats well im not said dinah thats where lucyann and i were when you came up the slope there to climb into the cave we were standing behind the waterfall and i tried my hardest to attract your attention and tell you that those two men were following you but how in the world did you get behind the waterfall asked jack it was an idiotic thing to do fancy climbing up those slippery rocks and getting behind the water you might have been we didnt go that way silly said dinah we went another way and she told jack and philip all about the hole at the back of the cave that led down into the cave of echoes and the passage that came out behind the roaring waterfall the boys listened in the greatest amazement gosh how extraordinary said jack well i suppose the men just caught sight of you down there dinah and took their eyes off me and philip for a minute and lost us we must have climbed into this cave through the fern just as they were watching you what a good thing thats why theyre messing about down there on those wet rocks said philip grinning they think that that is our hidingplace behind the fall and they want to get there and find us they dont guess that isnt the right way i cant for the life of me see how they can possibly get behind the water from any of those rocks in front if theyre not jolly careful theyll get swept off by the water and down theyll go like lightning lucyann shuddered i dont want to see them do that she said and wouldnt peep out of the ferns any more but dinah and the boys watched in glee they felt safe up there in their fernhidden cave and it was fun to watch the two men slipping about on the rocks near the water getting angrier and angrier kiki was still behind the waterfall watching them in interest suddenly she gave one of her dreadful cackles of laughter and the men heard it even through the roar of the water they looked at one another startled hear that said juan somebody yelling their heads off laughing at us wait till i get them thats all they must be just behind the sheet of water how do they get there it was impossible to get behind the waterfall from above or below quite impossible the men realised this after they had fallen many times and once almost slipped off a wet rock into the cascading water itself they sat down on a ledge a good way from the water and mopped their heads they were hot and angry and their clothes were soaked they were puzzled too where had those boys come from was there a whole camp of people somewhere were they hiding in the mountains no that could not be so for they would have seen them roving the countryside in search of food there could only be a few people they must have sent out the boys to seek for food the children watched them in delight there was something very enjoyable in seeing their enemies at a loss in being able to see their every action and yet not be seen themselves even lucyann had another peep now that she knew they were no longer slipping about by the waterfall wed better go said juan if thats their hidingplace they can keep it wed better get somebody else here to help us we could put him to guard this place if he sat here he could see if anyone came up to get behind the water come on im fed up with this they stood up jack watched them through the fernfronds were they going back to their hut or to the plane perhaps then seeing that they were going to pass rather near to the cave the boy hastily closed the fronds and pushed the others back keep quiet he said they may come fairly near they came extremely near they took a way that led them right past the cave itself the children sat as still as stone hearing the men scrambling along outside suddenly the fern swayed and shook and lucyanns hand flew up to her mouth to stifle a scream theyre coming in theyve found us she thought and her heart almost stopped beating the fern rustled again and then was quiet the footsteps passed and the voices of the two men were heard saying something the children could not hear have they gone wondered dinah and looking at jack she raised her eyebrows he nodded yes they were gone but what a terrible fright everyone had had when they grasped hold of the fern to help them along little did juan and pepi dream that four silent children sat within two feet of them then jack parted the fern again there was no sign of the men he felt sure they must have gone back but he did not date to go out and spy better lie low for a bit he said well have a meal ill creep out and spy around later on wheres kiki nobody knew then dinah remembered she had been with them behind the waterfall they had gone back without her in their anxiety to warn the boys about the two men she must still be there blow wed better go and fetch her said jack i dont really feel like moving just now either im really tired with dragging that heavy sack along so far a voice spoke outside the cave a gloomy dismal reproachful voice poor kiki all alone what a pity what a kiki poor pity the children laughed and jack parted the fronds cautiously in case by any chance the men were still anywhere about kiki clambered through looking very sorry for herself she flew to jacks shoulder and nibbled his ear gently all aboard she said more cheerfully and cracked her beak dinah ruffled up the feathers on her head kiki must have flown out from behind the waterfall and come straight here she said clever kiki clever old bird god save the king said kiki wipe your feet jacks tinopener came out again and a choice of tins and jars was made there was a small tin of biscuits still to be finished and the children chose some pressed meat to go with them and a large tin of juicy apricots jack opened the fronds just a little to let in enough daylight to see by once again they thoroughly enjoyed their meal and kiki got into trouble for taking more than her fair share of apricots the children waited some time before they dared to creep out of the cave when the sun was well down jack clambered out between the fronds and had a good look round there was no sign of the men at all jack found a high place from which if he sat there he could see for a good way in any direction well take it in turns to keep watch he said you can come in half an hour philip they had a fine time clambering all about they found some wild raspberries and ate great quantities of them they were delicious kiki ate them too murmuring mmmmmmmm all the time each of them took turn at keeping watch but there was nothing to see the sun went down behind the mountains and twilight came they all went back to the cave it will be lovely to sleep here tonight said lucyann pleased this moss is so nice and soft like velvet she stroked it it felt like velvet too she helped dinah to put down macks and a rug to lie on and made pillows of pullovers and jerseys a drink of apricot juice and a few biscuits for everyone said dinah as they all sat down on the bed she handed out the biscuits jack parted the fernfronds and tied them firmly back must have a little air in the cave he said it will get jolly stuffy with four of us here five said dinah dont forget kiki six said philip producing the lizard dont forget dizzy lizzie oh i really hoped youd lost her said dinah crossly i havent seen her all day they finished their biscuits and lay down it was quite dark now outside their bed felt warm and soft they all snuggled down making nice cosy places for themselves i should really enjoy all this if only i knew that mother wasnt worrying about us said philip pulling the rug over him i havent any idea at all where we are but its a very beautiful place doesnt that waterfall sound lovely singing in the night its singing jolly loudly said jack yawning but i dont think it will keep me awake oh kiki do move off my middle i cant imagine why you will keep perching there at night go on one of my feet wipe your feet ordered kiki and flew to jacks right foot she put her head under her wing tomorrow philip and i must go to that cave of echoes you told us about and stand behind the waterfall said jack fancy you girls having a little adventure like that all on your own little adventure said lucyann why it was a jolly big one especially when we suddenly saw that we were just behind that waterfall dinah was very much afraid that lizzie would run over her during the night and lay awake some time expecting the feel of tiny feet but lizzie was curled up in philips armpit tickling him dreadfully when she moved lucyann was asleep almost at once and soon the others were too the waterfall roared all through the night without ceasing the wind sprang up and moved the big fronds of the fern a fox or some other creature came sniffing up to the cave entrance was alarmed at the smell of humans there and fled away silently nobody stirred except philip when the lizard woke up felt cramped and made her way to another nice warm spot this time behind his ear he awoke for a second felt lizzie moving and then shut his eyes immediately again pleased with the feel of the tiny feet towards morning a throbbing sound awoke all four children it penetrated into the cave sounding even louder than the waterfall jack sat up at once surprised what could that be the noise grew louder and louder it seemed as if it was coming right down on their heads whatever could it be rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr its a plane cried jack a plane come to rescue us out of the cave quick they all tumbled out of the cave and looked for the plane one was climbing into the air a large shape against the sky it had evidently come very near the side of the mountain and had awakened them by its noise a plane to rescue us said philip scornfully not likely thats the plane we came here in the mens plane idiot chapter the poor prisoner sure enough it was the mens plane the children all recognised it quite well as they watched it vanishing into the distance it flew towards the west wonder if its going back to bills aerodrome said jack wonder if bill knows what those two men are up to we dont know very much ourselves except that they are after some sort of treasure said philip but honestly what treasure they think they can find here in this place beats me beats me too said jack well there they go do you suppose theyll come back sure to said philip they wont give up as easily as that maybe theyve gone to report that there are other people here now for all they know after the treasure too and they might bring back more men to smell us out oh said lucyann in alarm i dont want to be smelt out do you think both men have gone asked philip i should think so said jack but we can go and have a jolly good look round and see if one man is left hell be somewhere near that shed of theirs he wont know how many of us there are here he may think there are men with us you know and not dare to move about too much by himself but when the children left the cave later in the morning and went to have a squint as jack said they could find no sign of either juan or pepi there was no fire it had been stamped out and this time the shed was well and truly locked and the key taken no amount of shaking or kicking would open the door well if wed known the men were going to fly off we might have asked them for a lift said jack with a grin i wonder when theyll come back if they do come back that is not till its daylight tomorrow i should think said philip i expect theyll take off at night again lets go and have another squint at those crates but there was really nothing to see they were empty as before and the tarpaulin was over them the children played about for some hours and had a meal under a tree they went to get a tin or two from the rest of the store still hidden in the bush jack opened them after the meal philip suggested that they should go back to the waterfall and the girls should take them to the cave of echoes and down the passage that led behind the water so off they went first hiding all trace of having been near the mens shed but when they got back to their cave jack gave a most annoyed exclamation and began to feel in all his pockets whats the matter said lucyann well do you know what ive done ive gone and left the tinopener behind said jack think of that what an idiotic thing to do i thought we might want another tin opened so i put it down at the roots of that tree we had our picnic under and i must have left it there i havent got it anyway oh jack but we cant have a meal without opening a tin said philip seeing awful visions of a hungry night gosh you are an ass yes i know said jack gloomily well theres only one thing to be done i must go back and get it you explore the cave of echoes with the girls philip and ill take kiki and go back for the opener serves me right ill come with you jack said lucyann sorry for her brother no youve had a jolly long walk already said jack you go with the others anyway ill be quicker by myself ill just have a sitdown before i start back i can always explore the cave another time he sat down on the moss the others sat with him sorry for him knowing how annoyed he must feel with himself but it would be still more annoying to have to go without meals the opener must certainly be fetched after about half an hour jack felt able to start back again he said a cheery goodbye to the others and left scrambling quickly down the rocks they knew he would not lose his way they all felt they knew it quite well by this time jack had kiki on his shoulder and they talked together all the way kiki was simply delighted to have jack all by herself he was nearly always with the others they talked complete nonsense and both of them thoroughly enjoyed it jack arrived at last at the tree under which they had had their lunch he looked for the opener half fearful in case it had been removed by somebody but it was still there lying where he had left it he picked it up and put it into his pocket three cheers he said three blind mice said kiki handy spandy humpy dumpy i agree with you said jack well well get back i think twilight will soon be coming and i dont fancy going back in the dark off we go kiki up the hill jack and jill agreed kiki jack and kiki you mean grinned jack turning to go then he stood still suddenly and listened away in the distance he could hear a sound he knew a familiar throbbing sound rrrrrrrrrr gosh kiki are those fellows coming back so soon said jack staring into the western sky which was still faintly gold yes thats a plane all right but is it theirs the plane came nearer growing larger and larger an idea came into jacks mind he ran to where the mens shed was and climbed quickly up into a tree not far from where they had their campfire he spoke sternly to kiki now quiet kiki not a word do you understand shhhhhh what a pity what a pity said kiki in a curious hoarse whisper and then was silent pressing against jacks neck as she sat on his shoulder the plane roared nearer it circled lower and lower it dropped to the long smooth strip that made such an excellent runway it bounced along on its high wheels and then came to a stop jack could not see the plane from where he was but he was counting on the men coming to the shed or to their fire and he was right they soon arrived and jack peered out through the leaves nearly overbalancing in his efforts to see properly for twilight was almost there this time there were four men jack looked very hard he could see that one man was evidently a prisoner he had his hands tied behind him how strange he shambled along his head bent going from side to side a little as if he was dizzy now and again one of the others would give him a shove to keep him straight they came straight to the campfire juan set to work to light it pepi went off to the shed to get some tins he took a key from his pocket and unlocked the door he came out carrying tins of soup and meat the prisoner sat down on the grass his head bent it was obvious that he was not feeling well or was he merely afraid jack couldnt tell the fourth man who was a kind of guard for the prisoner as far as jack could make out sat by the fire saying nothing watching juan and pepi at first they talked in low voices and jack could not hear their words they drank hot soup and then carved up a tongue from a glass jar they ate bread with it which they had brought from the plane the prisoner looked up and saw them eating but the three men did not offer him anything he said something in a low voice juan laughed he spoke to the guard tell him he wont get anything to eat or drink till he tells us what we want to know he said the guard repeated this in some language that jack could not make out the prisoner said something and the guard struck him on the cheek jack watched in horror fancy hitting a man when his hands were tied what cowards the man tried to dodge he bent his head again and sat dismally there he says youve got the map what else do you want said the guard we cant read the map said juan its all messed up if he cant explain it to us hell have to show us the way tomorrow the guard translated this to the prisoner he shook his head he says he is too weak to walk so far said the guard well drag him all right said pepi and took another piece of tongue making himself a thick sandwich tell him hes to take us tomorrow if he wont he gets nothing to eat or drink hell soon come round when hes half starved they finished their meal then juan yawned me for bed he said theres a chair for you luis in the hut the floors good enough for the prisoner the man begged to have his hands untied but they would not allow him to jack felt very sorry for him they stamped out the fire and went to the hut jack imagined pepi and juan on the mattress and luis in the only comfortable chair the poor prisoner would have to lie on the cold hard floor with his hands still tied behind him jack waited till he thought the coast was clear then he slipped quietly down the tree kiki had been as good as gold all the time not even a whisper had come from her beak jack tiptoed to the hut he peeped cautiously in at the window a candle burned in the hut and by its flickering light he could make out the four men the prisoner was trying to make himself comfortable on the floor it was almost dark jack hoped he would be able to get back to the cave all right he slipped his hand into his pocket and was relieved to find a small torch there that was good he was very clever in the dark for he had eyes like a cat once or twice he stopped unable to think which way to go but kiki always knew she simply flew a little way in front and called to him or whistled good old kiki said jack i couldnt have found my way without you thats certain the others were very worried about him when darkness fell and still no jack had arrived lucyann wanted to go and look for him im sure hes lost im certain of it she said almost in tears yes and wed all get lost too if we went out on the mountainside in this darkness said philip i expect he hunted about for that opener saw that twilight was coming and decided not to risk coming back in the dark hell be back tomorrow morning early for certain it was too dark to do anything dinah had made the bed and they lay down on it lucyann crying quietly she was sure something had happened to jack then there came a scrambling noise up near the cave and the fern was parted and pushed aside all the children sat up their hearts beating was it jack or had their hidingplace been discovered hallo there came jacks familiar voice wheres everybody he switched on his torch and saw three delighted faces lucyann almost fell on him jack we thought you were lost what have you been doing and were so hungry too have you brought the tinopener yes ive brought that and plenty of news too said jack what about a meal whilst i tell you all about it chapter a disappointment for the men tins were opened once more and kiki gave a delighted chortle at the sight of her favourite pineapple lucyann pressed close to jack what happened to you i cant wait to hear tell me quickly let me have a bite first said jack irritatingly knowing quite well that all the others were longing to hear his news but as he was longing just as much to tell it as they were to hear it he soon began his story so the planes back exclaimed philip as jack began to tell everything both men back too jack told of the four men lucyann was distressed to hear about the poor prisoner im beginning to see daylight said philip at last somewhere in this valley is hidden treasure maybe stuff belonging to the people whose houses have been burnt those two men heard about it and somehow managed to get a map that showed them the hidingplace but they cant find it by that map so theyve got hold of somebody who knows the way thats it said jack hes foreign maybe he once belonged to this valley and even hid the things himself theyve captured him and mean to make him show them the hidingplace theyre not giving him anything to eat or to drink till he shows them what they want to know brutes said dinah and the others agreed with her do you think he will show them asked lucyann i hope he will for his own sake said jack and i tell you what i propose i propose that somehow or other one or more of us follow them and see where this hidingplace is the men cant possibly take everything away at once we might be able to get help and save the rest of the stuff being stolen by the men it cant belong to them what do you think the stuff can be asked lucyann visions of gold bars and beautiful jewels floating in her mind cant tell you said jack i think were somewhere in the depths of europe where war has been and as you know plenty of treasure of all kinds was hidden in queer places by many many people good and bad my guess is that its something of that kind these men are after they speak english but theyre not english south american perhaps goodness knows the others sat silent thinking over what jack had said they thought he was probably right but lucyann didnt at all like the idea of following the men suppose they discovered that they were being followed and captured them it might be best if philip and i did the stalking tomorrow said jack i dont think i want you girls mixed up in it this made dinah angry though lucyann was secretly relieved youre not going to keep all the excitement to yourselves said dinah im coming too no youre not if we say youre not said jack he switched on his torch and shone it at dinahs face i thought youd be glaring he said cheer up dinah after all you and lucyann had an adventure this afternoon when you found the cave of echoes and the passage that leads to the waterfall give us boys a chance well its all very well grumbled dinah but she did not press the point any more much to lucyanns relief wheres lizzie asked dinah not liking to settle down till she was quite sure of the lizards whereabouts dont know said philip annoyingly she might be anywhere under your pillow perhaps shes here said jack kikis one side of my neck and lizzies the other keeping me nice and warm what a pity said kiki and cackled loudly dont said everybody at once nobody liked kikis awful cackle she put her head under her wing offended all the children lay down they were sleepy our fourth night in this valley said philip the valley of adventure i wonder what will happen next soon they were all asleep lizzie ran across lucyann and cuddled down by dinah who would certainly have objected strongly if she had known but she didnt know so she slept peacefully everyone felt cheerful the next morning really said dinah reaching down some tins from the ledge im beginning to feel ive made this cave my home half my life its extraordinary how soon we get used to anything new how are we going to find out when those men are starting and what way they go said philip well if you remember the two of them came in this direction not the other when they set out with the map before said jack i think if we go to that big black rock we always pass on the way here we may spot them then we can follow easily enough so when they had finished their meal they set off cautiously to the big black rock they crouched behind it and jack kept peeping out to see if there was anything to be seen after about an hour he gave a low exclamation hallo here they come all four prisoner still with his hands tied stumbling along poor thing the four men passed some distance away the children saw them well they recognised the two men they knew and jack told them the fourth man was called luis the prisoners name he didnt know it was plain that the poor man was giddy with lack of food and drink now you girls stay here see said jack at any rate till we are well out of sight then go back to the waterfall and keep somewhere about there so that you dont get lost take kiki lucyann we dont want her with us lucyann took kiki and held her ankles kiki gave such an angry squawk that the children looked uneasily after the four men to see if by any chance they had heard but they hadnt jack and philip made ready to set off ive got my fieldglasses said jack i can keep the men well in sight whilst following quite a long way behind so that they wont spot us cheerio the boys went off cautiously keeping to every bit of cover they could they could still see the men far away in the distance do we need to mark the way were going asked philip or shall we be able to find the way back do you think better mark things where we can said jack you never know mark rocks with white chalk heres a bit and trees we will notch they went on climbing upwards a good way behind the four men soon they came to a very steep place difficult to keep their footing on because the surface was so loose that they slid down continually i hope theyve undone that poor prisoners hands panted jack id hate to do climbing like this and have my hands bound so that i couldnt save myself when i slipped when they came to the end of the rough piece the men were nowhere to be seen blow said jack that bit held us up too long now weve lost them he put his fieldglasses to his eyes and swept the mountainside some way to the east and above them he suddenly saw four small figures there they are he said its all right i can see them that way tufty on they went again going more quickly now because the way was easier they picked wild raspberries as they went and once stopped for a drink at a little clear spring of water that gushed from under a rock they did not lose sight of the men again except for a moment or two the men did not turn round or use fieldglasses at all plainly they did not expect anyone to follow them now the boys came to a very desolate part of the mountainside big boulders had rolled down trees had been torn in half great ruts had been torn out of the earth and rock and although the grass was growing everywhere to hide the scars it was clear that some catastrophe had happened here an avalanche i should think said jack i guess a terrific fall of snow happened here bringing down with it boulders and rocks of all sizes knocking down trees and scoring those ruts last winter i should think where are the men said philip i cant see them now they went round that ledge yes well have to be careful how we go round said jack we might be easily seen coming round there theres not much cover in this devastated bit so they went very cautiously round the ledge and it was a good thing they did for almost at once they heard voices and saw the four men jack pressed philip back just above the ledge was a bush the boys climbed up to it pressed against it and parted the leaves so that they might see through they found that they were looking down into a rocky gully here too there had evidently been a great fall of rocks in front of one heap stood the prisoner his hands were now untied he was pointing to the heap of rocks and saying something in his rather dull low voice the guard translated and jack strained his ears to hear what he had to say he says the entrance was here the guard said the four men stared at the fall of rock exactly where said juan impatiently and glared at the prisoner he pointed again mumbling something he says he didnt know there had been a fall of rock here said the guard he says the entrance seems to be blocked up but if you try to lift away some of these rocks maybe you could find enough room to go in juan flew into a temper but whether with the prisoner or the annoying fall of rocks it was difficult to say he fell upon the boulders and began to drag at them feverishly shouting to luis and pepi to help the prisoner at first did nothing but sat down miserably on a rock juan shouted at him too and he dragged himself up to help though he was too weak to do anything in the way of lifting he pulled at a rock staggered and fell the others let him lie where he fell and went on dragging at the great stones panting and wiping the sweat from their foreheads the two boys watched them it looked impossible from where they were to unblock any caveentrance there why whispered jack to philip there must have been hundreds of stones fallen there theyll never never be able to shift them like that evidently the men thought so too after a while for they gave up pulling the boulders about and sat down to rest the guard pointed to the fallen prisoner and spoke what about him how are we going to take him back oh give him some food and a drink growled juan hell be all right then wed better go now whispered philip theyll be starting back soon come on how disappointing that we havent discovered anything though i did hope we might see something of the treasure if its hidden behind that wall of fallen stone itll need powerful machinery to get it out said jack nobody could move those bigger stones by hand come on quickly they set out on their way back going as quickly as they could glad that they had marked rocks and trees or they might have missed their way here and there the girls welcomed them and poured questions on them but the boys shook their heads most disappointingly the treasure cave is blocked up said jack i only hope the men dont give up and leave this valley altogether well be properly stranded then chapter rescue of the prisoner some while after jack and philip had got back to the cave lucyann who was looking out between the fernfronds gave a cry i say theres a man down there look by the waterfall two men no three jack pulled the string which tied back the fronds and let them swing together to hide the cave then parting the fronds carefully he looked through i might have guessed they would come back this way to have another hunt for us here he said blow them one two three of them wheres the prisoner fallen by the way i should think poor fellow said philip peering out too he looked terribly feeble the children watched the three men eagerly to see what they meant to do it was soon clear luis and juan were to go back to their hut but pepi was to be left to keep watch on the waterfall to see who went in and out and to try and discover the way that was used the children could not hear what was said but it was all plain enough luis and juan departed where the prisoner was nobody could guess pepi sat down on a rock that overlooked the waterfall just about the level of the ledge where the girls had stood the day before blow said jack how can we get in and out without being seen its true hes got his back to us but he might turn round at any time lucyann began to worry about the prisoner suppose he has fallen down on the way and the men have left him there she said hed die wouldnt he i suppose so said jack feeling anxious too but jack we cant leave him to die said lucyann her eyes big with horror you know we cant i shant rest till i know whats happened to him i feel rather like that too said jack and the others nodded there was something awful about the hopeless way he sat im sure he was ill but how can we find out whats happened to him whilst that fellow down there is guarding this place said philip gloomily everyone fell silent it was a puzzler then lucyann brightened up i know she said theres one certain way of making sure pepi doesnt see anyone creeping out of this cave what said jack well if one or two of us got behind the waterfall and capered about a bit to attract the mans attention he would be all eyes for them and wouldnt notice anyone creeping out of this cave said lucyann theres something in that said jack and philip nodded yes quite a good idea well theres no time like the present shall we give a performance for dear pepi now you two girls could go and caper about if you like you are quite safe when youre behind the waterfall because nobody can possibly get at you there unless they go the same way as you do and pepi certainly doesnt know that way whilst you are attracting his attention philip and i will go off and see if we can see any sign of the prisoner well wait here till you see us behind the water said dinah and she got up she and lucyann disappeared up the hole at the back of the cave the boys waited patiently for them to appear behind the waterfall after some while philip clutched jacks arm there they are good old lucyann good old dinah theyre having a fine old game down there what are they waving oh theyve taken off those red pullovers and theyre waving them like mad doing a kind of dance pepi caught sight of them at once he stared in surprise and then stood up he yelled and shouted and waved the girls took no notice at all but went on capering pepi began to try all kinds of ways to get to the waterfall nows our chance said jack come on his eyes will be glued on lucyann and dinah for ages they crept quickly out of the cave swinging the fronds closely together behind them they climbed up the rocks there and soon took cover so that they could not be seen when the girls saw that they were safely out of the cave and could no longer be seen they left the waterfall ledge and went back into the passage that led to the cave of echoes they had done their bit the boys made their way cautiously over the rocks keeping a good lookout for the others when they were quite a long way from pepi they stopped to take counsel now should we go back to that blockedup cave where apparently the treasure is and see if we can find the prisoner fallen by the way or shall we scout a bit in the other direction back to the mens hut to see if by any chance theyve taken him there better go to the mens hut said philip thinking i dont think its very likely theyve left him to die by the wayside they might still want to get something out of him so they made their way back to the mens hut how well they knew the way now they saw the smoke of the fire long before they came near and by that they knew the men were back there was no sign to be seen of the two men or of the prisoner cautiously the boys peered through the trees near the hut the door of the hut was shut and presumably locked were the men inside hark isnt that the sound of the planes engines running asked philip suddenly yes it is are those fellows going off again they went to a place from which they could see the plane well by means of jacks fieldglasses the men were not going off merely doing something to their plane there was no sign of the prisoner being with them stay here philip with my fieldglasses and keep an eye on the plane and the men said jack pushing his glasses into philips hand come and tell me at once if they stop their work there and come towards the hut im going to peep in at the hut window and see if the prisoner is there im worried about him right said philip and put the fieldglasses to his eyes jack sped off he soon came to the hut he tried the door yes it was locked all right he crept round to the window and peeped in the prisoner was there he was sitting in the chair the picture of misery his face in his hands as jack looked he heard him groan deeply and it was such a dreadful noise that the boys heart was wrung if only i could get him out he thought no use breaking the window its too small even for me to get in and certainly that fellow couldnt squeeze out what can i do i cant break down the door its jolly strong he went all round the hut two or three times but there was absolutely no way of getting in he stood and stared at the door hating it horrid strong thing and then he saw an unbelievable sight there was a nail at one side of the door and on it hung a key a large key a key that surely must fit the door otherwise why should it be there it must have been put there so that any of the men could go in and out at any time without waiting for the one who had the key with trembling fingers jack took the key from the nail he put it into the lock of the door he turned it it was stiff but it turned all right the door swung open and jack went in the prisoner hearing the door open looked up he stared in surprise at jack the boy grinned at him ive come to set you free he said like to come with me the man did not seem to understand he frowned a little and stared even harder at jack spik slow he said jack repeated what he had said then the boy tapped himself on the chest and said i am your friend friend understand the man evidently did understand that a slow smile broke over his face it was a nice face a kindly sad trustable face jack thought the boy held out his hand come with me he said the man shook his head he pointed to his feet they were bound tightly with rope which the man obviously had not had the strength to untie jack whipped out his pocketknife in a trice he sawed through the thick strands and they fell apart the man stood up unsteadily looking as if he was about to fall jack steadied him thinking that he would never be able to walk all the way to their cave he seemed even weaker than before come on said the boy urgently we havent much time to lose jack put the cut pieces of rope into his pocket he led the man to the door put him outside and then carefully locked the door again hanging the key up on its nail he grinned at the prisoner bit of a surprise for juan and luis to find youve apparently walked through a locked door said the boy id like to be here when they unlock the door and find you gone jack took the mans arm and piloted him away into the cover of the nearby trees the man walked very unsteadily he gave a groan every now and again as if it hurt him to walk jack felt more and more certain that he would never be able to get to the cave he wondered what to do perhaps he could park the man in the old cowshed he and the others had found the first day they had arrived he could put him in the last cowstall and then fetch him the next day when he was a little more recovered that would be the best thing you stay here a minute said the boy thinking he had better run to philip tell him what had happened and get him to keep guard till he had got the man safely installed in the shed philip was intensely surprised to hear what jack had to tell him he nodded and agreed to stay on guard till jack came for him the men seem to be overhauling the plane he said looks as if theyll be busy for some time jack helped the stumbling prisoner over to the cowshed it took a long time to get there because the man went so slowly once there he sank down in the stall and panted painfully he was certainly an ill man but there was no doctor for him only jacks gentleness which he seemed to be very grateful for you stay here till tomorrow when i will fetch you to a safer hidingplace said jack speaking very slowly indeed i will leave you water to drink and food to eat the boy meant to open a tin or two from the store still hidden in the bush he could easily get them and leave them beside the man the man tapped his chest otto engler he said and repeated it two or three times jack nodded and pointed to his own chest jack trent he said me jack you otto friend said the man you english me english said jack gravely you austrian said the man pronouncing it in a curious way friend good friend why you here jack tried to explain how it was he and the others had come but it was too complicated for the man to understand and he shook his head not understand he said then he leaned forward to jack and spoke in a low voice you know of treesure treesure oh you mean treasure said jack not much you know of treasure i know all said the man all i draw you map where treesure is you good boy i trust you chapter a treasure map jacks first feeling on hearing this was one of tremendous excitement then his face fell he knew where the treasure was behind that fall of rock what use was that nobody could get at it there i know where treasure is said jack trying to speak slowly and simply i saw you show the men this morning but the rocks had fallen together and they could not get into the treasurecave behind the man gave a short laugh he seemed to understand they are fools he said big fools there is no treasure there jack stared at him do you mean to say you fooled them he said you knew that fall of rocks was there and you took them to it and pretended that the entrance to the treasure was all blocked up isnt the treasure behind those rocks after all the man was frowning hard in his attempt to follow all that jack was saying he shook his head no treesure there he said i fool juan and pepi ah ah how they hurt their hands when they pull so at the rocks jack couldnt help grinning what a fine trick to play well then where was the treesure i draw you map said otto and i tell you way out of valley too by the windy pass you will go that way you and your friends and you will take the map to a good friend of mine it is time now to find the hidden treesure for surely there is peace for us all but why cant you come with us said jack surely you could show us the way otto the pass and come to your good friend i am very ill man said otto if i not get doctor and how you say it middisin yes medicine said jack middisin soon i die said otto i have bad heart very very bad i get pain very bad i not walk far now so you take treesure map you good boy and you take pass out of valley and go to julius my good good friend then all will be well all right said jack im very sorry about you otto wish i could do something ill do my best to get to julius quickly and bring back help to you do you think you might be able to walk to our hidingplace tomorrow and hide there whilst we go pardon said otto you talk too quick i not understand jack spoke more slowly otto nodded he understood the second time you leave me here today and tomorrow perhaps i be strong enough to go with you to your place he said we will see if not you must go through the pass and find julius i draw you map now and i draw you also the way to the pass windy pass it is very very narrow but not difficult to to to travel through said jack otto nodded he found a pencil and a notebook and began to draw jack watched him in interest the waterfall appeared in the map so did a queershaped rock a bent tree came into the map and a spring of water little arrows were drawn showing in what direction to go it was really rather exciting otto folded up the map he gave it to jack julius will know he said he will read the map once he lived in the big farmhouse not far from here but our enemies burnt it down and all the other farms too and took our cows and our horses our pigs and everything we had many they killed and only few of us escaped now tell me the way to the pass said jack otto once more drew a map the waterfall appeared in it jack put his finger on it i know this water he said speaking slowly so that otto would understand our hidingplace is near very near so said otto pleased the way to the pass is above the waterfall you must climb to where it flows out of a hole in the mountainside there i have drawn you the way how shall we find julius asked jack on the other side of the pass is a village half burnt said otto you will ask anyone you meet to tell you where julius is they will know ah julius worked against the enemy all the time everyone knows julius he should be a great man now among his people but times are strange and maybe he is no longer great now that we have peace but still everyone knows julius and he will know what to do when you give him the treesure map i will also write him a letter otto scribbled a short note and gave that also to jack it was addressed to julius muller now you must leave me said otto you must go back to your friends if i am better tomorrow i will come with you but my heart is bad today so bad always it pains me here he pressed his hand over his heart well goodbye and thank you said jack getting up i do hope you will be safe here there is meat for you and tinned fruit all ready opened well so long till tomorrow the man smiled a tired smile sank back against the wall of the cowshed and closed his eyes he was completely exhausted jack felt very sorry for him he must get help as soon as he could if otto was not better by tomorrow he and the others would get out of the valley by the pass and go and find julius at once whoever he was if he was a friend of ottos he might be able to get a doctor immediately feeling much more cheerful about things jack went out of the cowshed golly what would the others say when they knew he had the map where the treasurecave was to be found and directions as to how to get out of the valley philip came running up out of breath the men have just left the plane and are walking towards their hut he said come on wed better go is the prisoner safely in the shed yes hope the men dont go there looking for him said jack come on lets get back to the girls we shall have been away from them for ages we must look out for pepi on the way back said philip as they set off he may have got tired of watching the waterfall and the girls capering about and have decided to cut back to the others i say do you know what ive got said jack unable to keep the news to himself for a moment longer what asked philip a map showing where the treasure is said jack but we know where it is said philip behind that fall of rocks we saw this morning well it isnt said jack triumphantly the prisoner his names otto he fooled them properly he pretended the treasure was in a cave behind the fall of rocks he knew the rocks had fallen but he thought he could pretend he didnt know about them and say the treasure was blocked by the landslide there see golly and all the time the treasure was somewhere else said philip that was good work have you really got a map of the whereabouts of the treasure jack and did you find out exactly what the treasure is no i forgot to ask him that said jack but i found out an awful lot ive got directions to find the pass that leads out of this valley and a note to a man called julius and i know how these houses and things got burnt and why otto says if hes strong enough tomorrow hell take us to the pass himself but he gave me the maps in case he wasnt able to come with us theyre quite clear this was really exciting news philip felt overjoyed it looked as if they would be able to escape from the valley at last and get help and perhaps be in at the discovery of the treasure look out i believe i saw something moving over there whispered jack suddenly and the two boys crouched behind a bush it was a good thing they did for pepi emerged from a thicket of trees and walked rapidly towards them but it was obvious that he hadnt seen them without a glance at their bush he strode on i bet hes hungry and wants a meal grinned jack good thing i spotted him wed have bumped right into him in two seconds well thats good we can hurry on now without being afraid of being seen gosh im hungry they both were it was ages since they had had anything to eat thoughts of tinned salmon sardines tongue apricots peaches and pears floated before the minds eye of both boys they hurried as much as they could they were thankful when they pushed aside the fernfronds and saw the girls sitting in the cave behind dinah had got a fine meal ready and waiting good old dinah cried jack i could almost give you a hug dinah grinned pepis gone she said did you meet him almost collided with him said philip gosh i could eat a whole tin of salmon by myself how have things been with you and lucyann dinah all right very dull said dinah nothing doing at all except a few capers now and again behind the waterfall to keep pepi interested you should have seen his efforts to find the way up once lucyann and i really thought he had been swept away by the water he slipped and fell and disappeared for about twenty minutes we were quite relieved when we saw him again what about you boys said lucyann you look cheerful got good news what about that poor prisoner with their mouths full the boys told of all they done that day the girls listened eagerly when jack fished the maps out of his pocket they fell on them in delight a treasure map cried lucyann i always wanted to see a real one oh heres our waterfall look surely the treasure isnt anywhere near it when are we going to find the treasure asked dinah her eyes shining were not going to said jack and her face fell at once he explained why weve got to get out of this valley and find this fellow julius apparently he will see to the unearthing of the treasure whatever it is sorry to disappoint you girls but honestly i do really think we ought to get out as quickly as we can and let aunt allie and bill know where we are we should waste a lot of time looking for the treasure and i think that now weve been told where to look for the pass out of the valley we ought to take it and get help for ourselves and for poor old otto too hes a very ill man it was clear that jack was right dinah heaved a sigh of regret i would so very much have liked to go and find that treasure she said but never mind perhaps this julius man whoever he is will let us join the treasurehunt with him we might stay for that it was now almost dark the boys were tired out they lay down on the bed which dinah had already made feeling very sleepy but the girls wanted to talk and so did kiki they had had a very dull day they chattered away kiki joining in but the boys could hardly find the energy to answer kikis been in and out of the cave of echoes today yelling and squawking for all she was worth said lucyann shes not afraid of the echoes any more you should have heard the echoes when she did her expresstrain screech jolly glad i didnt said jack sleepily shut up now girls get to sleep because weve got an exciting day before us tomorrow fetching otto and going to find the pass and looking for julius it looks as if this adventure is about to come to an end said lucyann but she was quite wrong it wasnt anywhere near its end chapter now for windy pass next morning the children peeped cautiously through the fernfronds to see if by any chance pepi was on guard again but there was no sign of him i do wonder what juan and luis thought when they got back to their hut unlocked it and found the prisoner flown said jack with a grin theyll be astonished to find he went through a locked door oh theyll guess one of us rescued him said dinah wont they be wild i do hope they dont find him in that cowshed he might tell tales of us he wouldnt said jack at once hes got a nice trustable sort of face rather like bills but not so strong i wish bill would suddenly arrive here said lucyann with a sigh i do really i know you boys have managed things awfully well but somehow when bill comes along i feel really safe well youre safe enough now arent you demanded jack didnt i find you a jolly good hidingplace yes fine said lucyann oh look philip kikis after lizzie lizzie had appeared down philips leg and kiki who happened to be sitting near had given a delighted squawk and pecked at her but the lizard was a little too quick she ran into philips shoe stop it kiki said philip well now wed better get busy busy dizzy lizzy said kiki at once and the children laughed really kikis awfully clever at putting the samesounding words together said lucyann busy dizzy lizzy id never have thought of that clever kiki kiki squawked and raised her crest high she rocked herself from side to side as she often did when she felt very pleased with herself vain bird conceited bird said jack and scratched her poll you leave lizzy alone shes about the most harmless pet philips ever had well shes better than those awful rats and mice and spiders and beetles and hedgehogs hes had running about him said dinah with a shudder i really quite like lizzie compared with them gracious said lucyann astonished you are improving dinah lizzie and kiki both joined in the breakfast the children had though kiki kept a sharp eye to see that lizzie didnt take anything she wanted when they had all finished they made their plans for the day well fetch otto first said jack philip and i i mean no need for you girls to come perhaps you could pack up a few tins for us all to take with us when we go to look for the pass through the mountains we shall want a meal on the way right said dinah i hope youll find otto better then when you bring him here well have a snack before we set out then over the pass well go and find julius and somehow manage to send off a message to mother and bill maybe bill will fly over in his plane and join the treasurehunt and let us help said lucyann what a nice plan it did seem a very nice one indeed the boys set off leaving kiki behind with the girls they went quickly over the mountain slope keeping a good lookout however for pepi and the others but they saw nobody they made their way carefully to the cowshed jack left philip on guard near by to give warning if anyone came near then he tiptoed to the shed and peeped in there was no sound in there at all he could not see the last cowstall from where he stood he walked softly in stepping over the fallen rubble he spoke softly otto im back are you better there was no reply jack wondered if the man was asleep he made his way to the last stall it was empty otto was not there jack glanced round quickly what could have happened the boy saw that the opened tins of meat and fruit that he had left for otto were untouched otto had not eaten anything left for him why blow those men must have come looking for him when they found that he was gone from the hut thought jack and they found him here gosh what have they done with him wed better look out for ourselves in case the men are on the watch for us theyll know someone must have set otto free even if he has held his tongue about me he went back to philip ottos gone he said dare we have a squint at the hut we might find out something then what theyve done with otto for instance lets shin up that big tree weve climbed before said philip the one that we can see the plane from if we saw all the men round about the plane wed know it was safe to go to the hut but i dont feel inclined to run into danger if we think the men are by the hut they might be watching for us to come again if were captured the girls wouldnt know what to do all right ill climb the tree said jack and up he went with philip close behind him he put his fieldglasses to his eyes to focus them on the plane and then he gave a loud exclamation gosh the planes gone again it isnt there no it isnt said philip in surprise well i never heard it go this time did you jack well i did think i heard a throbbing noise last night when i was half asleep said jack yes now i come to think of it it must have been the plane i heard well weve probably frightened the men away they got the wind up when they knew other people were here in a hidingplace they couldnt find people who rescued their prisoner yes and when they found they couldnt get at the treasure because a rockfall had apparently blocked the entrance to it i suppose they thought it wasnt much use staying said philip so theyve gone thank goodness now we can go back to the girls and shoot off to the pass quickly to tell you the truth i was a bit worried about taking otto with us because from what you said it didnt sound as if wed be able to go very fast with him and if hed had a heartattack by the way we wouldnt have known what to do i wonder where theyve taken him to said jack lets hope that now they find they cant get any more out of him theyve taken him back to where he belongs and will get a doctor to him they climbed down the tree and set off back to the girls as fast as they could now for the pass the girls were most surprised to see the two boys back so soon but they were even more surprised to see they were alone wheres otto asked dinah down the well said kiki nobody took any notice of her and she screeched jack explained the planes gone and ottos gone so i suppose theyve all gone off disgusted at not being able to get at the treasure good riddance to them hear hear said dinah very much relieved to know that their enemies were safely out of the way well what are we going to do now go and look for the pass said jack ive got the map otto drew what a mercy he gave it to me wed never find the pass by ourselves without a map im sure of that i mean the pass out of these mountains might be anywhere apparently there is only one pass and thats this one the windy pass come on lets go packed up a few tins dinah yes said dinah now where do we go from here up or down up said philip poring over the map that jack took from his pocket up to where the waterfall begins here look then we go along a rocky ledge see ottos drawn it then we come to a thick wood look and then up a steep bit to another ledge then we come to a proper road the pass road that i suppose all the people of the valley used when they wanted to leave this district and visit another once were on that road i shall feel better so shall i said dinah fervently it will be nice to see a road we might even see somebody walking on it shouldnt think so as we havent seen anyone in this valley at all except ourselves and the men said jack it strikes me as a bit queer i must say to think that although theres a perfectly good pass in and out of this lovely valley it appears to be quite deserted i wonder why oh i expect theres a good reason said dinah come on do lets go the first part will be easy because weve only got to keep near the waterfall but it wasnt quite so easy as she thought for the mountaincliff was exceedingly steep there and the children had to do a lot of stiff climbing still they managed it for their legs were well used to walking and climbing by now the waterfall roared by them all the way it made a terrific noise as it fell and lucyann thought how nice it would be when they reached the top and didnt have to listen to quite such a colossal din after some time they came to where the waterfall began it gushed out of a great hole in the mountainside and fell sheerly down tumbling against huge rocks on the way it was really a marvellous sight to see goodness it does give me a funny feeling to see that great mass of water suddenly coming out of the mountain said lucyann sitting down its so sudden somehow i suppose when the snows melt and the rain pours down there is a terrific amount of water soaking down into the mountaintop said jack and it all collects and has to get out somehow this is one way it gets out through this hole making a tremendous waterfall where do we go now asked dinah who was very impatient to get out of the valley we go up on that rocky ledge said jack golly it looks a bit narrow it runs right over the waterfall lucyann dont you dare look down in case you feel giddy i dont much feel as if i want to walk along there said poor lucyann ill help you said jack youll be all right as long as you dont look down they went along the rocky ledge quite safely lucyann holding tightly to jacks hand kiki flew above their heads squawking encouragement see how they run see how they run she called having apparently remembered the second line of three blind mice lucyann gave a giggle were not exactly running kiki she said oh thank goodness the ledge has come to an end now we go through that wood dont we jack looked at his map yes apparently we go straight through wheres my compass ill set it so that we walk in a straight line in the direction otto has put on his map they entered the wood it was a pinewood rather dark and silent nothing grew under the tall pinetrees the wind blew them and they made a loud whispering noise which upset kiki sh she called shhhhhhhh heres the end of the wood called jack now for another steep bit to another ledge and well look down on the road come on everybody chapter a great disappointment and a plan it certainly was a stiff climb again up the steep rather stony slope to the ledge they could see some way above lucyann almost cried because her feet kept slipping so i take one step up and slip two steps back she wailed well hang on to me then said philip and gave her a tug up each time she took a step they all wanted a rest when they came to the next ledge and to their delight they saw a patch of wild raspberries growing there they could sit down in the canes and feast as they rested lovely kiki liked the raspberries very much indeed and ate so many that jack called to her kiki youll go pop pop goes the weasel answered kiki and helped herself to a few dozen more raspberries soon they all felt they could go on again they were very high up now and could see even more mountains towering behind the ones they knew it was a most magnificent sight i feel very small and lost somehow with all those great mountains sitting there said lucyann and the others felt the same come on lets go round the ledge now we shall soon see the road thank goodness this ledge isnt narrow its almost wide enough to take a car it was not so easy walking round the ledge as lucyann thought however for there had been a fall of rocks there further along and there was a good deal of scrambling about to be done the boys went first to find a safe way for the girls they were thankful when they had got over the rockfall and come to smoother ground again the ledge rounded a bend in the mountainside and then quite suddenly the children saw the road below them yes it was really a road they stood and looked at it in delight i never thought i should be so pleased to see a road before said dinah the road out of the valley the road to somewhere at last look said lucyann it winds up from quite a long way down we cant see where it goes to from here because its hidden round that bend you can see the pass the windy pass from here though said jack pointing see where this mountain and the next almost touch thats where the pass must be fairly high up and awfully narrow i bet well have to go through it in single file no we wont said philip scornfully its bound to be wide enough to take a cart it only looks narrow because were far off come on lets get down to the road said dinah and began to climb down to it they were about twenty feet above it i say isnt it overgrown with grass and weeds said jack astonished that shows how little it has been used lately queer isnt it youd think the people would put their only road out of the valley into some sort of order its jolly peculiar i think said philip come on we can at least see its a road even if it is overgrown with weeds they walked along the road for some way it wound upwards always following long curves in and out on the slopes of the mountain at last the children could clearly see where the windy pass must be a narrow passage between the two mountains theirs and the next it was cold so high up and the wind was very strong if the children had not been warm with climbing they would have shivered as it was they were all as warm as toast now round this next corner and i bet we shall see the pass cried jack then hurrah for the way out of this mysterious valley they rounded the corner yes there lay the pass or what must once have been the pass but it was a pass no longer something had happened the narrow way between the high mountains was blocked high with great rocks and black boulders it was impassable at first the four children didnt quite take it in they stood and stared in wonder whats happened there said jack at last it looks like an earthquake or something did you ever see such a terrible mess great holes have been blown in the rocky walls on either side of the pass said philip look even high up there are holes like craters they stared in silence and then jack turned to the others do you know what i think has happened he said well when enemies were here fighting they bombed the pass and blocked it all that devastation has been caused by bombs im sure it has yes i think youre right jack said philip its just what it looks like aeroplanes must have flown just over the pass and dropped scores of bombs down on the narrow road there its absolutely impassable do you mean we cant get out asked lucyann in a trembling voice philip nodded afraid so he said nobody could get over that steep high dangerous wall of blownup rocks this explains why people havent come along to live in this valley yet i suppose most of those living here were killed and the rest escaped over the pass then it was blown up and nobody could come back those men in the plane juan and the rest must have got wind of some treasure hidden in the valley and thought they would try to enter the place by plane about the only way to enter it too lucyann sat down and cried im so disappointed she wailed i thought we were going to escape from this horrid lonely valley i really did but now were still prisoners here and nnnnobody can come in to rescue us the others sat down by lucyann feeling rather desperate too they stared hopelessly at the blocked pass what a terrible blow just as they had so hoped they would be able to escape and get to julius and tell him about the treasure lets have something to eat suggested dinah well feel better then no wonder we feel a bit dumpy now humpy dumpy said kiki at once that made them laugh idiot said philip you dont care about a blockedup pass do you kiki you could fly over its a pity we cant tie a message to your leg and send you over to julius for help oooh couldnt we do that said lucyann at once no silly for one thing kiki would probably tear the message off her leg said jack and for another shed never know who to go and look for shes a clever bird but not as clever as that they felt a lot better after their meal they ate it with their backs to the blocked pass nobody could bear to look at it i suppose well have to go back to our cave said dinah at last doesnt seem anything else to do really no i suppose there isnt said jack rather gloomily what a sell isnt it they had a good long rest the sun was very fierce but the wind was so strong that they were never too hot in fact lucyann went to a rock that sheltered her from the wind because she felt too cool they started back after their rest they were not nearly so cheerful and talkative as when they had set out that morning the thought of having to stay in the lonely valley after having such high hopes of escaping was very damping to all of them lucyann looked so miserable that jack tried to think of something to cheer her up he thought of something really startling cheer up lucyann he said maybe well find the treasure now to make up for our disappointment lucyann stopped and stared at him thrilled really she said oh jack yes lets look for the treasure ourselves now everyone stopped and thought about it for a few exciting moments well why not said philip we cant get word about it to julius because we cant get over the pass those men have gone and otto is gone too theres only us left we might as well hunt for the treasure it would be something exciting to do to pass away the time how simply gorgeous cried dinah just what ive always wanted to do hunt for treasure when shall we start tomorrow i say suppose we really found it said philip looking thrilled should we get a share of it i wonder what a good thing otto gave you the map freckles said dinah to jack she always called him freckles when she felt in a very good humour lets have a look at it jack took it out of his pocket he unfolded the sheet of paper and spread it out otto had marked it with compass directions just as he had marked the map showing the way to the pass see the things he has drawn or printed said jack see this queershaped rock its shaped like a man in a cloak with a balllike head if we saw that rock wed know it was a signpost to the treasure and whats this a bent tree asked dinah yes but how are we to know where to look for them we cant go wandering all over the mountainside looking for queershaped rocks and bent trees and things of course not said jack wed have to begin properly from the beginning and the beginning is the waterfall we know otto drew a path from where the cowshed is to the waterfall see well we can start right at the waterfall without bothering about that path then from the top of the fall we must look for that bent tree and walk to there then from the bent tree we look for this lets see what did he say that was oh yes its a stretch of smooth black rock well when we get there we look next for a spring of water and from there we look out for that queershaped rock then somewhere about there is the treasure golly said lucyann her eyes nearly popping out of her head lets get back to the waterfall and start straight away come on jack folded up the map and looked round at the three excited faces he grinned the treasure wont be much use to us cooped up in this valley as we are he said but it will be something really thrilling to do they set off once again their minds busy with treasurehunting if only they could find what those men had been looking for and had not found what would bill say he would wish to goodness he had been with them he always said they fell into adventure after adventure when they got back to the waterfall the sun had gone in and huge black clouds hung over their mountain enormous drops of rain began to fall the children gazed in disappointment at the lowering sky blow said philip theres going to be a rainstorm i should think no good going off treasurehunting in this better get into the cave before we get soaked here comes the rain properly they only just got into their cosy cave in time then the rain pelted down in torrents and added its voice to the roar of the waterfall rain all you like called jack but do be sunny tomorrow were going treasurehunting chapter signposts to the treasure they slept very soundly indeed that night for they were tired out the rain fell all night long but towards dawn the clouds cleared away and the sky when the sun rose was a clear pale blue lucyann liked it very much when she parted the soaking fernfronds and looked out everythings newlywashed and clean even the sky she said lovely just look just the day for a treasurehunt said jack i hope this sun will dry the grass quickly or we shall get our feet soaked good thing we brought so many tins out of the mens hut said dinah reaching down two or three are there still some in that bush where we first hid them jack plenty said jack i took one or two to open for otto the day before yesterday but there are heaps left we can go and get them some time they tied back the fernfronds and ate their breakfast sitting at the front of the cave looking out on the far mountains backed by the sky which was now turning a deeper blue well shall we set off said jack when they had finished kiki take your head out of that tin you know its completely empty poor kiki said kiki what a pity they all scrambled out of the cave things were certainly drying fast in the hot summer sun look those rocks are steaming said lucyann in surprise pointing to some nearby rocks so they were they looked most peculiar with the steam rising up better take some food with us said jack got some dinah of course said dinah we cant come all the way back here for food weve got to get to where the waterfall begins just as we did yesterday said jack follow me all of you i know the way they soon stood at the top of the waterfall and once more watched the great gush of water surge out from the heart of the mountain it seemed twice as big and turbulent as the day before well i suppose the underground water has been swelled up because of last nights rain said philip and so the waterfall is bigger and stronger yes thats the reason said jack raising his voice to a shout because of the noise of the water kiki stop screeching in my ear the waterfall excited kiki and she made a terrible noise that morning jack would not have her on his shoulder after a while because of her screeches she flew off in a huff now what about that bent tree said dinah remembering by this time they were standing a little way above the beginning of the waterfall i cant see any bent tree at all oh golly dont say there isnt a bent tree groaned jack looking this way and that all round and about and above his head gosh there doesnt seem to be one does there there didnt what few trees they could see were perfectly straight then lucyann gave a cry and pointed downwards there it is isnt it just below us on the other side of the waterfall look they all went to stand by lucyann and looked she was right on the other side of the fall some way below them was a curiously bent tree it was a birchtree and why it should have grown so bentover was a puzzle the wind was no stronger there than anywhere else anyway it was decidedly bent and that was all that mattered they crossed above the beginning of the waterfall clambering over the rocks and then scrambled down on the other side of the fall they reached the bent tree at last first signpost said jack no second said dinah the waterfall is really the first well second then said jack now for the third a big stretch of flat black rock a wall of it i should think they all looked in every direction for a stretch of black rock this time it was jacks keen eyes that spotted it it was some way off and looked difficult to reach for it meant climbing along the steep face of the mountainside which just there was very clifflike still it had to be done so they set off it was easier after the first stretch for there were all kinds of plants and bushes firmly rooted in the sloping cliff and these could be used as handholds or footholds jack helped lucyann along but dinah scorned philips help especially as she knew he had the lizard somewhere about him it took them at least half an hour of stiff scrambling and climbing to reach the wall of black rock though actually in distance it was not so very far they stood by the rock panting funny shiny black rock said jack running his fingers over the smooth surface wonder what it is oh never mind said dinah impatient to get on whats our next signpost this is the third a spring of water said philip isnt that right jack or shall we look at the map no i know it by heart said jack a spring of water is next not that i can see one at all though i wish i could because i could do with a drink after that hot scramble my hands are filthy and so are my knees yes we could all do with a jolly good wash now said philip a good old rub and a scrub rubbenascrub said kiki and went off into one of her dreadful cackles stop it kiki said jack ill give you a rubbenascrub in a minute there was no spring of water to be seen lucyann began to look very disappointed cheer up said jack we may not be able to see the spring from this wall of rock but we can surely find it if its anywhere near lets listen suggested dinah so they all stood perfectly still and listened shhhhhh said kiki annoyingly jack smacked her on her beak she gave a dismal squawk and sat silent and in the silence of the peaceful mountainside the children heard the tinkletinkle of water a merry gurgling noise cheerful and friendly i can hear it cried lucyann in delight it comes from somewhere over there she leapt across to a little thicket of trees and there hidden deep in the flowerstrewn grass bubbled a clear spring trickling down the hillside a tiny stream of crystal cold water it starts just up there look said jack and pointed to a big bush the spring bubbled out from below the bush fourth signpost now for the fifth and last said lucyann excited oooh do you think we really are getting near to the treasure its really not very far from our waterfall cave i thought i could hear the faint distant roar of the fall when i stood listening for the gurgling of the spring i thought i could too said dinah now what do we look for next the queershaped rock said jack you know like a man in a long cloak with a round head at the top easy said philip triumphantly and pointed upwards there it is quite clear against the sky they all looked up philip was right there stood the curiousshaped rock easy to see against the sky come on said jack excitedly up we go come along treasurehunters they climbed up to where the queershaped rock stood other rocks lay round about but this one was much taller and because of its height and shape it stood out among the others our last signpost said jack and now wheres the treasure ah yes where was the treasure lucyann looked about the hillside as if she half expected it to be strewn there the others began to search for a caveopening but nobody could find anything why didnt you ask otto exactly where to find the treasure after coming to the last signpost complained dinah tired and disappointed coming over to jack well i didnt know we were going to look for it silly did i said jack i thought julius muller was going to take charge of the treasurehunt no doubt if he got as far as this hed know where the treasure was all right well its most awfully disappointing to come all this way and read the map so well and then not find a thing said dinah who was cross and tired im fedup i shant hunt any more you can all go on looking if you like but im going to have a rest she flung herself down and lay fiat looking upwards at the steep mountainside above her it was ridged with flat slabs of rock sticking out here and there like ledges dinah examined them lazily with her eyes then she sat up suddenly hi she called to the others look up there they came over to her and looked up see those big ledges of rock sticking out all the way up the cliffside she said like shelves well look halfway up see one that sticks out rather far look underneath it is that a hole there it does look rather like a hole said jack maybe a foxhole though still its the only sizable hole hereabouts so wed better explore ill go up coming tufty rather said philip it doesnt look difficult arent you two girls coming too dinah forgot that she was fedup and she joined in the climb to the hole under the ledge of rock when they got there they found that it was a very big hole indeed it could not possibly be seen from above for the shelf of rock stuck right out over it and hid it it could only be seen from one place below at a certain angle and that was the place where dinah had flung herself down some time back bit of luck you happened to spot it dinah said jack we might have hunted all day and never found it i wonder if this is the entrance to the real treasurecave they peered down the hole yawned below them dark and appearing rather vast wheres my torch said jack and taking it from his pocket he switched it on the children gazed down into the hole it seemed nothing but a hole no treasure was there but as jack swung his torch a little further down dinah thought she caught sight of a passage further back i believe she said almost falling into the hole in her excitement i do believe it goes right back into a passage kiki flew off jacks shoulder and disappeared into the hole a mournful voice floated up to them whats down there kiki called jack three blind mice answered kiki solemnly and untruthfully three blind mice pop youre a fibber said jack anyway down we go to find the three blind mice said kiki and went off into an imitation of lucyanns giggle chapter the strange caves jack went down the hole first he lowered himself right in and only had to drop about a foot to the ground below lucyann you come next he said and helped her down then came the others excited and eager had they really found the treasure cave it simply must be the hidingplace for the treasure said jack there isnt another hole or cave anywhere now let me flash my torch round a bit at the back of the hole as dinah had thought there was a passage quite a wide one and fairly high a very tall man could have walked down it with ease come on said jack his voice shaking with excitement were getting warm they followed him down the passage kiki sitting on his shoulder lucyann held on to his sleeve half fearful of what they might find the passage was wide and high all the way along but wound about a little it went downwards and kept more or less in the same direction for all its windings that is towards the heart of the mountain suddenly the passage came to an abrupt end jack paused and gasped in front of him was a most extraordinary sight his torch shone brightly on to an unending mass of brilliant white columns hanging from the high roof of a cave whatever could they be lucyann clutched his arm and gasped too she stared at the shining white things she saw that other white columns were growing up from the floor of the cave too some had met the hanging ones and had joined so that it seemed as if the cave roof was being supported by pillars jack what is it is it the treasure whispered lucyann its icicles isnt it said dinah in an awed tone ive never seen anything so beautiful in my life look at them hanging down so still and white and lovely no theyre not icicles said jack they are stalactites at least the hanging ones are theyre not made of ice either but of limestone i think my word what a sight the children stood quite still and gazed their fill at the silent beautiful cave its roof was as high as a cathedral and the graceful stalactites hung down from it in dozens gleaming in the light of jacks torch the ones growing up from the floor are stalagmites i think said jack arent they philip do you know anything about them ive never in my life seen anything like this before yes theyre stalagmites said philip i remember seeing pictures of them stalactites and stalagmites gosh what a sight kiki tried to say the two words and couldnt even she seemed to be awed by the amazing and unexpected discovery oh look said lucyann suddenly and pointed to what looked like an old old shawl carved in ivory look this has grown here too its just like a shawl even to the pattern in it and look at that sort of gate over there all carved too surely somebody made them surely they didnt just grow well they formed said jack trying to explain you know just as the crystals in a snowflake form they dont grow because theyre not alive they form lucyann couldnt quite understand secretly she thought that all the marvellous hanging pillars had grown and then got frozen in their beauty i thought this must be the treasure she said half laughing im not surprised said jack its too beautiful for words fancy finding a cave like this its like an enormous underground cathedral it just wants an organ to begin playing a grand and magnificent hymn theres a kind of path down the middle said dinah i dont know if its just a natural path jack or whether it has been made by man do you see what i mean yes said jack flashing his torch along it bit of both i think well shall we go on theres no treasure here they went along the middle of the great silent hall surrounded on all sides by the hanging iciclelike pillars lucyann pointed out many that had joined with columns growing from the ground the drops of water from the stalactites must have dripped to the ground and made stalagmites form there growing up to meet the column above said philip they must have taken ages and ages to form hundreds of years i say no wonder this cave feels awfully old to us i feel as if there is no time here at all no years or days of the week or hours just nothing lucyann didnt like that very much it gave her a queer feeling of being only a dream and not real she took hold of jacks arm and was glad to feel its nice solid warmth they walked slowly to the end of the enormous cave a great archway stood there and that too was set with stalactites which however did not hang far down the children could walk under them with ease this archway is quite like a tunnel said philip his voice sounded big and hollow there and made them all jump kiki gave a mournful cough which was magnified to a hollow giantcough that startled everyone very much they came to another cave the roof of this was not so high as the one before and only small iciclelike stalactites hung from it do those stalactites shine in the dark asked dinah suddenly i thought i saw something glowing in the corner over there jack switched off his torch and immediately the children gasped for up in the roof and over the walls there glowed thousands of tiny stars they were green and blue and shone and flickered in a most enchanting manner gracious what are they whispered dinah amazed are they alive the boys didnt know they watched the shimmering flickering stars that seemed to go in and out like elfin lights might be a kind of glowworm said jack arent they lovely he put on his torch again and the roof shone brightly in the yellowwhite light the stars disappeared oh do put your torch out begged lucyann i want to watch those stars a bit longer i never saw anything so fascinating in my life they shine like phosphorescence all blue and green and green and blue look how they flicker off and on oh i wish i could take a hundred home and put them on my bedroom ceiling at home the others laughed at her but they too thought that the shining flickering stars were most entrancing to watch jack did not put on his torch again until each had gazed his fill thats two simply wonderful caves said lucyann with a sigh what will the next one be i really do feel as if wed discovered aladdins cave or something like that a long passage leading downwards led out of the cave of stars as lucyann named it we found a cave of echoes a cave of stalactites and a cave of stars she said i like this part of our adventure now id like to find a cave of treasure the tunnel they were in was wide and high like the first passage they had entered jacks torch suddenly shone brightly on something on the floor he stopped look at that he said what is it dinah bent to pick it up its a brooch she said a brooch without its pin the pins gone it must have broken and the brooch fell off whoever was wearing it isnt it perfectly lovely it certainly was it was a large gold brooch about three inches wide set with brilliant red stones as red as blood are they rubies said dinah in awe look how they glow oh jack do you think this is a bit of the treasure probably said jack and at once excitement caught hold of the children again and their hearts began to beat fast a ruby brooch set in carved gold what would the other treasure be wonderful visions arose in the childrens minds and they stumbled on their way eagerly their eyes searching the ground for any other gleaming jewel if we could find a cave of jewels said lucyann oooooh all gleaming like stars and suns thats what i would love we might find something like that said dinah if we do i shall deck myself from head to foot with them and pretend im a princess the passage went on and on still leading downwards but when jack looked at his compass he saw that he was no longer going into the heart of the mountain but in the opposite direction he hoped they wouldnt suddenly come out into the daylight without finding the cave of treasure suddenly they came to steps that led downwards they were carved out of the solid rock steep wide steps that curved as the passage curved almost a spiral stairway said jack where are we coming to now there were about twenty of the steps then came an enormous door made of some kind of stout wood set with iron studs the children stood and stared at it a door what was behind it was it locked and bolted who had put it there and why was it to shut in the treasure cave and guard it there was no handle to turn there was not even a lock to be seen there were great bolts but these were not shot into place how can you open a door without a handle said jack in despair he pushed at the door but it remained quite firm kick it like you did the door of the hut said philip and jack kicked it hard but the door did not open they stared at it in despair to come so far and then to be stopped by a door it was too bad jack shone his torch all over the door from top to bottom lucyanns sharp eyes noticed something see that iron stud she said pointing its much brighter than the others i wonder why jack shone his torch on it and saw that it was slightly bigger than the others and also as lucyann said it was brighter as if it had had some handling he pressed it nothing happened he banged on it with a stone no result at all let me try said philip and pushed jack aside shine your torch on it closely thats right philip took hold of the iron stud and shook it it seemed to give a little he shook it again nothing happened then he thought of twisting it it twisted round very easily indeed there was a loud click and the door swung slowly open jack switched off his torch afraid that anyone in the cave might see them though if anyone had been there surely they would have heard the bangs and kicks at the door the door now stood wide open a dim light shone beyond showing another cave lucyann clutched jacks arm in fright its full of people she whispered look chapter the treasure at last the four children stared breathlessly through the open door they saw something that made them feel very creepy in the dim light figures stood about all over the place their eyes gleamed queerly and their teeth shone in the half darkness their arms and necks flashed and glittered with jewels the children clutched one another in fright who were these strange silent folk standing about with gleaming eyes covered with jewels the people in the cave did not move they did not speak a word either not one of them was sitting all were standing they stood there some turned towards the frightened children some turned away why didnt they speak why didnt they point to the children and say look whos there lucyann began to sob lets go back i dont like them theyre not alive only their eyes are kiki suddenly gave a squawk left jacks shoulder and flew to the shoulder of one of the nearby figures a woman dressed in clothes that glowed richly in the halflight of the cave still the woman did not move how strange the children suddenly felt much better when they saw that kiki did not seem in the least afraid of the queer company polly put the kettle on said kiki and pecked at the hair of the woman he was sitting on the children held their breath again what would the woman do to kiki enchant him with her strange eyes cast a spell on him and turn him into stone perhaps all these people had been turned into stone lets go back said lucyann urgently i dont like this cave i dont like these people or their horrid gleaming eyes jack suddenly stepped down the step that was below the great open door he marched boldly into the silent cave lucyann squealed and tried to catch his sleeve jack walked right up to the woman on whose shoulder kiki sat he peered closely at her he looked into her wideopen glittering eyes he touched her hair then he turned to the horrified children what do you think shes a statue all dressed up beautifully with real hair and jewels for eyes what do you think of that the others could not believe it but they were very thankful to hear jacks words and to see him wandering among the crowd of still figures apparently quite unharmed philip and dinah stepped down into the cave of figures too but lucyann still did not quite dare to she watched the others looking at the strange beautiful statues and tried to make herself join them at last she screwed up her courage to step down into the cave she looked fearfully at the woman on whose shoulder kiki had flown yes jack was right she was nothing but a beautiful statue with a finelymoulded face and a cloud of dark hair she had magnificent jewels for eyes and her glittering teeth were exquisite jewels too round her neck were golden chains set with precious stones and her waxen fingers gleamed with rings round her waist was the most beautiful belt that lucyann had ever seen carved and set with shining red and blue stones there were dozens of these statues in the cave some of men and some of women some of them carried small babies in their arms fat smiling babies dressed in the most exquisite clothes set with thousands of tiny pearls it was the babies that gave jack the clue to what the statues were do you know what they are he said they are statues taken from churches somewhere in this country this one represents mary the mother of jesus and the little baby is meant to be jesus himself thats why they are adorned with such lovely jewels people have spent heaps of money on them to make them beautiful oh yes and some of them are carried in processions at church festivals said dinah remembering how her mother had once described such a festival to her well fancy statues taken from churches whatever for stolen i should think said jack stolen by people who took advantage of the troubled wartimes and hid them here meaning to collect them when they had a chance they must be worth a lot of money said philip fingering the magnificent jewels gosh i did get a terrible fright when i first saw them i honestly thought they were real people so did i said lucyann who had now recovered i couldnt bear them to stand so still and silent i nearly screamed with fright we were idiots not to guess they were statues said dinah i say where does the light come from that lights these statues its only a faint sort of light but its enough to see them by quite well jack looked all round it must be a sort of phosphorescent glow from the walls and roof of the cave he said its rather a greenish light isnt it i say theres another archway here called philip from beyond the statues come and see i believe theres another cave beyond they all went to see through the archway was yet another cave lighted with the same dim greenish glow in it were stacked great square oblong or round flat things there were no statues at all the children went to see what the flat things were pictures said jack as he tried to swing one to face him enormous ones where did they come from churches too do you think oh picture galleries very likely said philip maybe they are famous and quite priceless pictures very old too look at that one it looks terribly oldfashioned my word these things may be worth a fortune heaps of fortunes i remember reading not so long ago about pictures that were worth two or three million pounds i didnt know there was so much money in the world said lucyann startled she gazed in awe at the dusty dim old pictures tracing their great carved frames with her finger some of the pictures have been taken out of their frames to bring them here said jack pulling at a roll of thick canvas look this one must have been cut from its frame and rolled up so as to be taken away easily there were about fifty rolls of canvas besides the framed pictures jack shone his torch on to many of the pictures but none of the children thought the subjects interesting so many were portraits of rather fat and sternlooking men others were scenes from the bible or from old legends well this really is a find said jack i bet if those men could have found these they would have made a simply enormous fortune selling them of course they were after all these said philip and thats what those crates were for to pack them in they meant to crate them carefully and fly them away little by little what a brainwave on their part and otto fooled them said jack took them to a rockfall and said the treasure cave was behind it so they meekly gave up and flew off what idiots and we found everything rejoiced lucyann oh i wish we could tell bill are there any more caves wondered jack and walked over to the end of the second cave yes heres another archway and another cave books here and old documents come and look old books are sometimes as precious and as rare as old pictures said philip gazing round at the piles of enormous heavilybound books i say look at this one its a bible but in a foreign language isnt it enormous look at the old printing these really are caves of treasure said jack treasure from churches libraries and picture galleries i suppose the warlords must have hidden them away meaning to get them when peace came and make a lot of money out of their loot how awful to steal things like this though theres a little cave here just off this bookcave called dinah who was exploring by herself there is a big chest here oh and another and another whats in them i wonder jack came over to her and lifted up the heavy lid of one chest he stared down in surprise at the glittering coins piled together in the chest gold he said the gold coinage of some country but i cant tell which ive never seen gold coins like these before my goodness theres a fortune in that box too and in that chest and that one fortunes everywhere its like a dream said lucyann and she sat down on one of the chests it really is a cave of gleaming icicles or stalags whatever you call them a cave of stars a cave of glittering jewelled statues a cave of pictures and a cave of old books and now a cave of gold i cant believe it it did seem extraordinary they all sat down on the oak chests and rested the dim greenish light still shone everywhere a kind of pale glow that did not seem to come from anywhere in particular and yet was everywhere it was very quiet there the children could hear themselves breathing and a cough from jack sounded startlingly loud then another sound came through the stillness a sound so completely unexpected and surprising that nobody could believe their ears cluck cluckluckluck whatevers that said lucyann at last it sounded like a hen clucking must have been old kiki said jack looking round for her but she was just near by sitting on another chest humped up looking rather dismal she had had enough of caves the children stared at her could it have been kiki they listened to see if she would make the same noise again but she didnt stir and then the noise came once more quite clearly from another direction altogether clucklucklurrrrrrk clucklucklurrrrk it is a hen said jack jumping up making an egglaying noise but a hen in these caves its impossible all the children were now on their feet dinah pointed to some steps at the back of the little cave of gold thats where the noise comes from she said ill go up first and see if it really is a hen said jack i cant believe it he went cautiously up the steps and at the same time the clucking began again kiki woke up and heard it in astonishment she immediately began to cluck too which evidently astonished the hidden clucker who got very excited and let off a perfect volley of clucks jack came to the top of the steps there was another door there but not a very stout one it was ajar he pushed it open a little more very slowly so that he might see in without attracting attention though he did not expect to see anything but a hen what he saw transfixed him with astonishment philip dug his fingers into his back go on jack whats up jack turned round to the others i say he said in a halfwhisper its awfully queer but theres a little celllike room up here furnished table and chairs and a lighted lamp and theres a meal on the table come down quickly then whispered dinah we dont want to bump into anyone it must be someone whos guarding the treasure till the others come to get it come down but it was too late a curious quavering voice came from the celllike room into which jack had peeped a few strange words reached them but they couldnt understand a single one now what was going to happen chapter the guardians of the treasure the children stood absolutely still holding their breath who was there in that little room at the top of the steps the voice came again repeating the words that the children could not understand then to the top of the little flight of steps came a brown hen it stood there its head on one side peering down at the children cluck it said in a friendly kind of voice cluckluck cluck said kiki at once lucyann clutched dinah was it the hen talking before she whispered in amazement it wasnt of course the quavering voice came again and to the childrens surprise it sounded really frightened nobody came to where jack stood almost at the top of the steps the boy screwed up his courage and marched into the little room at the other end of it under a small archway of rock stood an old old man behind him was a woman just as old but more bent they stared at jack in amazement and then turning to one another they poured out a stream of hurried words that the children could not understand at all lucyann wondered what jack was doing up in the little room somebody ought to be with him she went up the steps and joined jack the two old people stared at the redhaired freckled child so like jack then the old woman made a crooning noise pushed past her husband and went over to lucyann she put her arms round her and kissed her then she fondled her hair lucyann was surprised and not very pleased who was this funny old woman who suddenly seemed so affectionate she called to the others dinah philip come along up its two old people here with their hen soon all four children were in the little underground room as soon as the old man heard them talking he joined in eagerly speaking english in a queer clipped way ah ah you are english children that is goot very goot once long time ago i was in your sobeautiful country i was in a big london hotel thank goodness he speaks english said philip i say what are they doing here with the treasure are they in league with the other men have to find out said jack they seem quite harmless anyhow but there may be others he turned to the old man the old woman was still making a fuss of lucyann evidently they had not set eyes on children for a long time who else is here besides you demanded jack just me and elsa my old wife and our hen martha answered the old man we guard all those things in the caves till the day when they go back to their right homes may that day come soon i dont believe the poor old things know that the war is over long ago said jack to the others in a low voice i wonder who left them here to guard these things he turned to the old man again who told you to guard these things he asked julius muller said the old man promptly ah what a great man how he worked against the enemy even when they were shooting and bombing and burning in our valley it was he who discovered that the enemy was using our mountain caves to hide away these treasures treasures stolen from our churches and many other places just what we thought said philip intensely interested go on tell us more then the people fled from our valley said the old man many were killed the valley was empty all save me and elsa my old wife we hid with our hens and our pig and noone found us then one day julius muller found us and ordered us to come here by a way he knew and guard the treasure not for the enemy no but for him and the people he said that one day the enemy would be defeated and would flee away and then he and the others would come back to find the treasure but he has not come he cant said jack the pass is blocked no one can get in or out of this valley now except by aeroplane the war has been over a long time but bad people are after the treasure people who have heard it is hidden here and have come to steal it the old fellow looked scared and bewildered too as if he only half understood what jack was telling him the children thought that he must have lived so long underground that his mind could not take in much news from the outer world to him his wife the treasure and perhaps his hen were the only things that mattered do you live here in this room asked lucyann where do you get your food from does your hen like living underground there are great stores of food here said the old man there is even corn for martha the hen when we first came here we had six hens and our pig but the pig died and one by one the hens died only martha is left she does not lay many eggs now perhaps one in fourteen days cluck said martha in a proud voice she was evidently proud of her one egg a fortnight kiki repeated the cluck and then went off into a series of quacks the hen looked surprised and alarmed so did the two old people shut up kiki said jack youre showing off what is that bird asked the old man is it a how do you call it a parrot yes said jack shes mine always goes with me everywhere but i say dont you want to know how we came here ah yes of course said the old man it is all so surprising you understand and my wits are dull now i cannot take in many things at once you must tell me about yourselves please wife what about some food for these children elsa did not understand and the old man repeated what he said in her own language she nodded and smiled a kind toothless smile taking lucyann by the hand she went over to where tins and jars stood on a rocky ledge shes very keen on lucyann said philip she cant fuss over her enough the old man heard and understood we had a little granddaughter he said so like this little girl with red hair and a sweet face she lived with us and one day the enemy came and took her away and we never saw her again so now my wife sees her little lost one in your sister you must excuse her for maybe she really thinks her small greta has come back poor old things said dinah what an awful life they must have led lost under this mountain guarding a treasure for julius muller waiting for him for ages not knowing what had happened outside in the world if we hadnt come they might never have come out again to the childrens huge delight elsa got them a really fine meal she would not let poor lucyann leave her side though so the little girl had to trot everywhere with her jack told the old man a little of their own story though it was plain that the old fellow did not really follow it all his wits were dull as he said and he could not really understand all this sudden news from a world he had almost forgotten kiki enjoyed herself enormously martha the hen was obviously used to keeping the old couple company and pecked about under the table brushing against everyones legs kiki climbed down to join her and kept up an interested if onesided conversation with her how many times have i told you to wipe your feet she asked martha blow your nose put the kettle on cluck answered martha politely humpy dumpy went on kiki evidently anxious to teach martha a few nursery rhymes now see how they run quack quack quack quack the hen looked surprised ruffled up her feathers and stared at kiki cluck luck luck she said and pecked up a few crumbs lucyann and the others giggled at this conversation then lizzie also thought she would join the company as there was plenty of food going she ran down philips sleeve and appeared on the table much to the old womans alarm meet dizzy lizzie said philip politely i say they must think were queer visitors said dinah keeping a watchful eye on lizzie in case she came any nearer walking in like this with a parrot and a lizard and staying to dinner i dont think they are bothering much said philip just enjoying the change it must be nice to have company after being alone so long when they had finished the meal the old woman spoke to her husband he turned to the children my wife says are you tired would you like to rest we have a beautiful place to rest in when we want to enjoy the sun this surprised the children very much the sun how did these old people ever see the sun unless they went through all the caves and passages to the hole that gave on to the mountainside where do you go to rest then asked jack come said the old man and led him out of the little celllike room elsa took lucyann by the hand they all followed the old man he went along a broad passage hollowed out of the rock i should think most of these tunnels were hollowed out by underground rivers at some time or other said jack then they took a different course and the tunnels dried up and became these passages linking all the caves together the passage twisted a little and then quite suddenly came into daylight the children found themselves on a flat ledge of rock hung about by ferns and other plants full in the sun how simply delicious another way into the treasure caves said dinah but she was wrong nobody could possibly enter the caves by way of the ledge the ledge of rock jutted over a great precipice that fell sheer down many hundreds of feet no one not even a goat could climb up or down to it it was as the old man said a fine sunny restingplace but that was all martha pecked about on the ledge of rock though what she could find there the children couldnt imagine kiki sat nearby and watched her she had formed a firm friendship with martha the children rather liked martha themselves she was such a nice plump little thing friendly and natural and as much of a pet to the old couple as kiki was to them they all lay down in the sun it was delicious to feel its warm rays after being so long underground as they lay there they heard something rumbling in the distance the waterfall said lucyann fancy we must be fairly near it if we can hear it they lay there sleepily the old fellow sat on a rock nearby smoking a pipe he seemed very contented elsa had disappeared isnt it queer to think weve found the treasure and cant do anything about it at all said dinah were stuck here no way of getting word to anyone and never will have as far as i can see till the pass into the valley is unblocked and that may not be for ages oh dear dont say such gloomy things begged lucyann anyway the men are gone thats one good thing i felt awfully afraid when they were in the valley too thank goodness theyve gone she spoke too soon there came a familiar throbbing noise and the children sat up at once the planes back blow those men will be about again now and maybe theyve even got the real truth out of otto where the treasure really is said jack we shall have to be jolly careful now chapter juan finds the caves the children held a council of war what would be the best thing to do now suppose the men did know the way into the treasure caves now and came to them they would begin to take away the treasure that was certain and we cant stop them said philip they are jolly tough men they wouldnt let a pack of children and two old people prevent them from taking what they wanted i cant think why theyve come back unless it is to search for the treasure again and find it this time everyone agreed with jack if only we could escape and get news to bill sighed philip but there simply isnt a way the plane had not come into sight they had only heard the sound of its engines the old man did not seem to have heard anything at all the children decided not to tell him in case he got into a panic what do you think it would be best for us to do said philip stay here with the old couple and see if the men do come and take anything away we can hide somewhere quite easily or go back to our own ferncave beyond the waterfall i always felt safe there and weve got plenty of food there too theres plenty here said dinah lets stay here after all if the men do come we can hide in that stalactite cave there are plenty of hidingplaces there behind those frozen columns they wont see us one of us could always be on guard there to see who comes in or out perhaps youre right said jack we must just wait and see what happens once the men really do find the treasure caves there will be a lot of coming and going taking the treasure to the plane taking off with it in the air coming back again to fetch more and so on shouldnt be surprised if they bring more planes here as soon as theyve discovered exactly where the treasure is said philip it would be a slow business taking one or two crates at a time lucyann is asleep said dinah i think ill snooze too its so lovely here in the sun those men wont be along yet so nobody needs to be on guard in the caves it would be almost better to be on guard at the entrance said philip thoughtfully then we could spot anyone in plenty of time yes thats a much better idea said jack settling down to snooze too im sure the men wont be along today the suns going down theyll wait till tomorrow that night the children spent in the old couples bedroom it was a smallish cave leading off from their sittingroom where the children had had their meal in the bedroom was a pile of rugs spotlessly clean and the old people insisted on giving up this room to the children we can sleep in chairs said the old man that will be no hardship the old woman covered lucyann up carefully and even kissed her goodnight she really thinks im greta her lost grandchild said lucyann i just cant stop her making a fuss of me because im so sorry for her in the morning after another good meal jack said he was going to take first watch at the entrance to the passage that led to the caves philip was to take second watch two hours later the boy settled himself down on the edge of the hole under the big slab of rock that stuck out from the hillside it was a fine sunny morning the others thought they would go and examine some of the statues in the statue cave and the old man said he would tell them their histories and where they had come from jack sat there gazing out down the hillside he could see a long way he could see scores of high mountains around one behind the other the pine forests on them looked like short grass he put his fieldglasses to his eyes to watch the birds around it was a disappointing district for wild birds there seemed to be very few jack swung his glasses from side to side of the hill examining everything and then he suddenly got a tremendous shock he had trained his glasses on to a bush behind which he thought he had seen a quick movement he had wondered if some bird or animal was hiding there he saw no bird instead he saw the head and shoulders of juan and juan was gazing steadily up at him through a pair of fieldglasses just as jack was gazing down at him through fieldglasses too jack was simply petrified he stared down through his glasses and juan stared up each seeing the other quite clearly so juan had come once more to seek the treasure had he come to that cliffside on chance or had he got the same map from otto that jack had had ive given the show away properly now thought jack angrily ive only got to pop into this hole and hell know where the entrance is at once but if i wander away on the hillside hell be after me what a fix im in juan did not take his eyes off jack he knelt there by the bush his fieldglasses fixed on the boy watching his every movement he cant possibly see the hole that im sitting on the edge of thought jack i think perhaps it would be best if i left this place and began to climb up the hillside if i do and juan follows he may miss the hole altogether he was about to do this when philip leapt up beside him my turn now freckles said philip hallo what are you looking at pity you came just then said jack there is juan down there philip and hes got his glasses trained on to me and on you too now i was just about to crawl up the hillside to make him chase me and perhaps miss this hole when you came now hell know theres a cave here and hell be up in no time golly said philip alarmed wed better warn the others at once then yes its the only thing to do now said jack and he jumped back into the hole come on it wont take juan long to be up here blow why didnt i think he might be about already they made their way quickly along the passage and through the many caves they came to the little celllike room and found the others there jack hurriedly told them what had happened we must hide he said but the old couple did not seem to take this in they would not hide we have nothing to be afraid of said the old man in a dignified manner they will not hurt us you have plenty to be afraid of said jack desperately do come and hide but they wouldnt jack could not waste any more time in arguing because he wanted to get the girls to safety he hurried them off in the cave of stalactites asked dinah jack nodded but when he came to the cave of silent statues he paused wouldnt this be a better place suppose they all stood at the back in the dim shadows and posed like statues would anyone notice them it was worth trying take shawls off some of the figures said the boy wrap them round you stand quite still right at the back there it didnt take long to drape themselves and stand right at the back do you remember that game called statues that we used to play whispered lucyann you had to stand quite still or you were caught i feel like that now well be sure you stand still or you will be caught said jack sh isnt that somebody shhhhhh said kiki at once jack smacked her on her beak be quiet do you want to give us away silly bird kiki opened her beak to squawk and then thought better of it she flew off somewhere and disappeared jack was quite glad to see her go for he didnt want her chattering and attracting attention to them a noise came from the tunnel beyond somebody was already there it must be juan hes already gone through the cave of stalactites and the cave of stars whispered philip now hes in the tunnel leading here hell be at the door in a minute pity we didnt shut it he might not have guessed how to twist that iron stud to get it open the door was almost closed but not shut as the children watched it in the dim greenish glow of the cave they saw it slowly pushed open then the gleaming barrel of a revolver came round it juan was evidently taking no chances lucyann gulped oh dear she hoped the gun wouldnt go off she didnt like guns at all the door was opened wide and juan stood there revolver in hand he gasped when he saw the silent figures standing about their curious eyes gleaming put your hands up said juan sharply to the statues the statues did nothing of the sort juans hand trembled the children guessed he was feeling as panicky as they had felt when they too had first seen the strange silent company wipe your feet ordered a sharp voice and the children jumped violently it was kiki she was sitting just above juan on a ledge of rock whos there shouted juan i tell you ill shoot if anyone moves the statues didnt move not even the four live ones whos there called juan again three blind mice answered kiki and went off into a terrible cackle of laughter it was almost too much for juan he backed a little and tried to see which of the statues was talking pop goes the weasel said kiki and then began to cluck like martha juans hand trembled again but he advanced a little going down the step into the cave then he saw as the children had seen that the figures were only bejewelled statues and he laughed loudly fool he said to himself fool repeated kiki and juan swung round at once whos there one of you children i suppose wait till i get you kiki began to mew like a cat the man looked for this unexpected cat then decided it was one of the children again playing a trick on him kiki flew silently to the next cave and began to talk to herself there one two button my shoe see how they run the man took one more glance at the company of statues and went into the next cave the children heaved a sigh of relief but they dared not move yet it seemed a very long time till the man came back with him came the two old people evidently very frightened juan shouted at them in their own language and the children could not understand a word then without another glance at the statues juan went through the stout oaken door and shut it the bang echoed loudly through the cave and made everyone jump then they heard another sound which made their hearts sink it was the noise of strong bolts being shot home on the other side of the door crash crash crash all three bolts were shot firmly into place now the door could not possibly be opened from the inside did you hear that groaned jack were prisoners now if only wed hidden in the cave of stalactites or the cave of stars wed have been all right we could have got out of the hole now we cant well have to stay here till the men set us free if they ever do chapter philips astonishing plan the old couple looked panicstricken when four of the statues apparently talked and came alive but when the children took off their borrowed draperies and carefully gave them back to the right statues again the old couple saw who they were elsa came running to lucyann and fondled her the old man stood trembling what did he say to you demanded jack he said he was going to make us prisoners here and that he was bringing others back with him to remove all our treasure said the old man tears suddenly poured down his cheeks he is a bad man have i guarded these beautiful things all this time to let them fall into the hands of a man so bad its sickening said jack we simply cant do a thing we shall just have to stand by and watch those rogues take away everything pack them into crates and fly off with them lets go out to that sunny ledge said dinah i cant bear this gloom any more i shall feel better when we are out there ask the old man to tell his wife to bring a picnic meal out there jack you and philip can help her to bring it i cant think properly down here in the dark with all those statues trying to listen all right said jack seeing that dinah was on the point of tears you go off with lucyann and kiki well soon come youll feel better in the sunshine wasnt kiki clever to lead the man away from us said lucyann he was scared when she suddenly spoke to him so should i have been i should have thought it was one of the statues speaking she and dinah made their way to the sunny ledge dinah threw herself down there thankfully i dont like this adventure any more dinah do you asked lucyann its not so bad if theres something we can do but we seem to be helpless here i like to make adventures go the way i want them to said dinah rather sulkily i dont like them to make me do things i dont like dont talk to me lucyann i shall snap at you i feel cross its only because of the strain we went through whilst we were pretending to be statues said lucyann dont sound so grownup snapped dinah its not that i just feel badtempered because i want to get out of this valley and i cant lucyann said nothing more she settled down in the sun waiting for the picnic that jack and philip would soon be bringing out with elsa kiki sat murmuring to herself nearby martha the hen arrived and began pecking about companionably kiki talked to her and she clucked back dinah forgot her bad temper when the others came out with a picnic meal they had a good feast and then discussed all the mornings happenings once more in the middle of the discussion they heard the sound of the plane again and this time saw it rising high into the sky why theyre off again said jack in surprise why probably to get other men along to help in removing everything now they really do know where the treasure is said philip and as you suggested jack they might even bring more planes it was hateful feeling that they were complete prisoners jack and philip went desperately to the bolted door once and tried to move it but it was hopeless of course the bolts were old but still very strong there was nothing to do and they felt bored they went to examine the statues more closely and to look at the old pictures and the musty old books the statues were loaded with magnificent jewels some of the figures were really beautifully made and dressed but others were crude and garish all however were adorned with jewels though the children were not able to tell if all the gleaming brooches dazzling earrings and necklaces glittering bracelets belts and rings were really valuable or not probably some were and others were only semiprecious i expect the men will strip the statues of their jewellery and take only that leaving the figures behind said jack they will crate the pictures and books why couldnt we strip the jewels off and hide them away somewhere so that the men wouldnt get them suddenly said dinah i dont see why wicked men like that should have them good idea said jack come on well take the jewellery now and hide it somewhere but as soon as they began to remove it the old couple flew at them in horror not do that ah bad boy cried the old man removing a brooch from jacks hand we only want to hide the things from those men protested jack theyll be back and steal these things soon they belong to these said the old man waving his hand towards the statues they must not be removed by anyone it is against the law of the church the children did not try again it was plain that elsa and the old man would fly into a rage if they attempted to they seemed to think that it was a very wicked and unholy act to take away any of the adornments belonging to the figures the long day passed at last nobody slept very well that night they were worried about what was going to happen it was horrid to feel they were at the mercy of rogues like juan they were all out on the sunny ledge the next morning early having breakfast there they had no meals in the caves now if they could help it listen said dinah suddenly i can hear the plane coming back they all listened the old couple too the noise grew louder it became very loud indeed then jack leapt to his feet its not just one plane its many look theres one circling down and another over there and here comes another gracious juans got quite a fleet of planes there were four altogether evidently juan meant to do the job properly now the children pictured the planes landing one by one on the long wide strip of grass at the bottom of the valley now we can expect things to happen said jack the whole of the treasure will be gone soon what a shame said dinah and we cant do a thing to stop it if only we could get word to bill said jack desperately but theres no way out of the valley except in one of those planes philip stared at jack a moment then he said something so exciting that the others could hardly believe their ears yes thats the only way out and im going to take it there was a silence then jack spoke astonished whatever do you mean you cant fly a plane of course not but i can hide in one said philip didnt we hide all of us in a plane coming here well why shouldnt i hide in one leaving here i bet i could hide unseen and slip out when i had a chance and get word to bill about everything philip its a grand idea said jack but ill go not you you jolly well wont said philip its my idea nobody else is going to pinch such a gorgeous idea im going see i dont want either of you to go said lucyann her lips trembling you might be seen something awful might happen to you dont leave us jack will be with you said philip and the old couple youll be all right i tell you its the only way to get help to fly off in one of the planes when the men go on their next trip theyll have to come back two or three times to take all these things and if only i can get word to bill he can catch the men actually doing the stealing it sounds too good to be true said dinah i dont believe you can do it anyway how are you even going to get to the plane you know were bolted in nobody can get out i shall watch my chance and slip out through that door when the men are going to and fro said philip enjoying his planning then i shall hide in the cave of stalactites and go up the passage to the hole as soon as i can then ill get along back to the planes and choose one to hop into i dont reckon they will have left anyone on guard there as they think were all well and truly imprisoned it sounds easy but it wont be said jack better let me do it tufty think again said philip this is my own pet adventure see you might even be able to squeeze into a crate said dinah thoughtfully nobody would think of looking into a packed crate good idea said philip in fact jolly good well we can expect quite a horde of men here today said jack it will surprise the poor old couple they will be in a dreadful state when they see their wellguarded treasure going philip we wont pretend that we are any of the statues today when the men come said dinah only you the men are sure to have a hunt round for us if they cant find us today so wed better all be found except you you can be a statue again and wait your chance to rush out of that door yes i think i will said philip it may not work but its the only thing to do now when will those men be along it will take them about an hour and a half to get here its half an hour since we saw the planes i mustnt leave it to the last minute to put myself in place better go now said lucyann who was on pins and needles about the whole thing well come with you and see that youre in a good place and really look like a statue they all went down the passage and made their way through the various caves to the one in which the statues stood martha the hen came too she had attached herself to jack now and followed him wherever he went she had laid an egg that morning and the old woman had made lucyann have it for breakfast look theres a halfhidden ledge here not far from the door said dinah eagerly if you stood there you would hardly be seen its so dark there and you would be near the door to creep out if you got a chance yes that does seem the best place said philip it really does now what about a shawl or something to drape over my head i dont want my short hair to give me away they found a very big shawl and draped it carefully round him he went to stand on the little ledge and everyone agreed that it was a splendid place you can hardly be seen said jack well good luck tufty well go now and we shant hide we shall let the men see us and hope theyll think theres nobody else in the caves at all if you cant escape we shall know because youll still be about tonight goodbye said philip looking exactly like a statue dont worry about me ill be off and away soon and ill get word to bill and mother well soon rescue you dont you worry chapter the getaway in about an hours time philip heard the sound of footsteps and then the bolts of the door were shot back juans revolver appeared round the opening door again but this time there was no kiki to talk to him nobody to be seen or heard except the silent company of statues juan came down into the cave other men followed him philip watched them through a fold of the shawl he hoped they wouldnt start stripping the jewels off the statues at once or they might discover him the men exclaimed in wonder at the statues they had powerful torches with them which they switched on at once philip was not prepared for that he shrank back into his corner glad of the draping shawl the men were a roughlooking lot and they called out to one another in surprise as they saw the gleaming jewels on the necks and arms of the statues some of them grabbed brooches and necklaces at once juan gave a sharp order and the men replaced them sulkily philip counted the men there were eight otto was not among them but that was not surprising juan pepi and luis were there there were two men for each aeroplane apparently juan led the way to the next cave through the tunnel their footsteps echoed hollowly as they passed through philip wondered if they would all go on to the next cave and the next if so he could slip out of the open door straightaway and make his way down the hillside at once he listened he could hear the mens voices from the next cave where the pictures were then footsteps again farther away then only a faint murmur of voices theyve gone to the cave of books and then theyll go to the cave where the gold is thought philip ive plenty of time to get through the door and away he dropped his shawl on the floor and went quietly to the door he was through it in a trice up the winding steps he went off to the cave of stars then to the cave of gleaming stalactites he began to feel safer he didnt think there would be anyone on guard outside the hole but he meant to be careful there there was nobody on guard the hillside was empty philip climbed out of the hole and began to make his way downwards soon he was well on his way keeping a sharp lookout all the time just in case all the men had not gone down into the caves he was tired and hungry by the time he reached the mens hut thank goodness the door was open and there was nobody about the boy got himself a good meal he found a box containing bars of chocolate and slipped some of the bars into his pocket in case he had to go some time without food then he went along to the planes there they were four of them looking quite big as he walked beside them which should he get into he climbed up into the cabin of each and looked inside in the last one there was a big heap of coats and rugs it seemed the best plane to get into he could pile the things over him and hide himself that way he didnt at the moment see any chance of squeezing himself into a crate as dinah had suggested anyway the crates were not in the plane they were under the tarpaulins where they had always been having decided exactly what he was going to do he had plenty of time left on his hands he knew that the men would not be back for some time they would be carrying heavy awkward loads and would go far more slowly than he had gone he amused himself by snooping round he went into the hut and found a coat hanging up there he ran his hands through the pockets thinking that any information he could get hold of might be useful to bill when he got to him there was a notebook in one of the pockets philip flipped over the pages he could make nothing of it it contained sentences in some kind of code and plenty of numbers perhaps bill could make head or tail of it he couldnt he went to the cowshed there was nothing to be seen there but the stillopen tins of fruit swarming with flies philip stared at them oh yes they are what jack left for otto he thought ugh look at the flies he took a stick dug a hole and buried the evilsmelling tins and their contents then he strolled off again and came to the tree where they had all once hidden he squinted up and saw something golly whats that then he remembered of course we left our suitcases up there id forgotten all about them fancy them still being there he debated whether to get them down and hide them no he thought they might be found and then the men might start looking for me ill leave them there he kept a good lookout for the returning men as the afternoon wore on he helped himself to some biscuits and a tin of peaches about five oclock still no sign of the men but about ten minutes later he saw them far away in the distance he was by the planes waiting ready to jump into the one he had chosen as soon as he saw the men coming he counted the men quickly yes eight so they were all back he climbed up the steps and leapt into the cabin he went to the pile of rugs and coats and got underneath pulling them over him so that not even the toe of his shoe showed good thing its a hot day he thought the men certainly wont want their coats or macks he heard the voices of the men evidently they were pleased with their successful day then there was a silence they had passed the planes and were on their way to the hut probably get themselves a meal and then pack up the things they have brought from the treasure caves thought philip he yawned he felt sleepy now that he was lying down soon he was asleep and he slept so soundly that he did not even stir when some hours later two men entered his plane but he did wake when the propellers swung round as the engines suddenly roared out he nearly gave himself away by sitting up in a fright then he remembered where he was and lay perfectly still wondering if it was nighttime he could see nothing under the pile of coats of course it might have been midnight or noon for all he knew one by one the planes took off philips plane went last of all he felt it leave the ground like a bird and then he was away in the air they havent seen me they dont guess theyve got me on board thought philip delighted it was easy after all hurrah he fell asleep again and the planes roared on through the night where were they going to a secret landingplace to an ordinary aerodrome the other children who were sleeping that night out on the ledge heard the roar of the planes as they left it was such a hot night that they had felt stifled indoors and had begged the old couple to let them take the rugs out on the ledge you will not walk in your sleep the old man had said you might walk off the ledge none of us walk in our sleep said jack well be all right elsa the old woman had not wanted lucyann to sleep out on the ledge at all and had almost cried when lucyann had insisted kiki and martha were both there too but the lizard wasnt she was with philip sharing his adventure the children had had a horrid day the men had found both them and the old couple in the sittingroom and had shouted at them and questioned them and frightened them very much the old man had told them that he had been living in the caves for a long time guarding the treasure and the men had jumped to the conclusion that the children also had been living there with them good thing they didnt ask us how we got to this valley said jack afterwards they just took it for granted that we and the old people came here together ages ago the old man and woman had flown to the rescue of their beloved statues when the men had begun to strip off the jewellery the men had struck the poor old things and shouted at them the old man had taken his weeping trembling wife away and the children had done their best to comfort them they had not gone near the men again but had gone to sit on the sunny ledge and wondered if philip had managed to escape im sure he did said lucyann all the men kept together and philip could easily have slipped out of the cave of statues when they came to question us the men had gone at last taking with them a haul of jewels one very precious figure some pictures and a few old papers two of them carried a box of the gold between them the children pictured their difficulties hauling it up and down the mountainside the men had bolted the door behind them again and once more the little company were prisoners how they wondered what was happening to philip had he managed to hide in one of the aeroplanes would he slip into a crate when would the planes go off they knew that the planes had gone when they awoke in the night to hear the throb of the engines they all sat up and listened kiki gave a squawk and pecked martha to wake her there go the planes said jack i bet philips in one now we shall soon be rescued what a shock for bill when he hears all about us do you think bill will fly over in his aeroplane too i hope so said lucyann fervently im longing to see bill again i sometimes feel as if well be in this valley all our lives dont be silly said dinah oh kiki leave martha alone whatever are you doing to her to make her cluck like that shhhh said kiki cheekily dont talk back to me said dinah lying down again well im glad we heard those planes good luck to you philip wherever you are good luck called the others and kiki echoed the words too good luck cluckluckluck said martha the hen sounding exactly as if she was joining in with the good wishes as well chapter a discovery and a fine idea the next day the men were all back again in the four planes they soon arrived once more at the treasure caves going through the old books and papers unrolling the dozens of canvases and looking at the pictures they had gone to find the children and the old couple and had shouted at them again they had found out that somebody had helped himself to food from the hut and they could not make it out hadnt they imprisoned all the children and the old people in the caves the children of course guessed at once that it was philip who had helped himself to the food but they were not going to say so so jack put on a bewildered air and replied quite stupidly and dinah did the same lucyann sobbed and the men soon gave up questioning her as for the old couple they knew nothing of course they did not even appear to have missed philip the men gave up their questioning after a while and returned to their work elsa was sad to see lucyann sobbing so she took her by the hand and led her into the bedroom she took down a picture she had put on a ledge there and showed lucyann a space behind lucyann stared at it what is it she said then she called to jack jack come here and bring the old man the old woman doesnt understand what i say they came and when jack saw the yawning space behind the picture he turned to the old man whats that a hideyhole oh it is only a hole in the wall said the old fellow my wife did not like it so she covered it with a picture the old woman poured out a torrent of words to him he turned to jack my wife is sad because your little sister is frightened by those men she says she can hide in this hole and they will not find her let me see what its like said jack and climbed into it it was more than a hole it was a tiny round dark tunnel that had once been a waterway where could it lead to if it led anywhere its a little tunnel jack called back rather like the one that led out of our ferncave into the cave of echoes ill see if it goes anywhere he crawled on for some way and then it suddenly dipped down so steeply that he could have slid down it if it had not been so narrow it ended in a hole that seemed to open out in the roof of a much bigger passage jack flashed his torch down yes that really was a passage down there he crawled back to the girls come behind me he said i may have found a way of escape well have to use a rope though they crawled in single file till they came to the hole that dropped into the wide passage jack undid the rope he always carried round his waist he tied it to a rock and let it drop down into the passage then down he went the girls followed jack flashed his torch up and down the passage which way shall we go he said i can hear a funny noise said lucyann its the waterfall i do believe they went down the passage towards the noise and to their intense surprise and delight they came out on to the ledge behind the waterfall the one on which lucyann and dinah had capered about to hold the attention of pepi some days before i say its the waterfall ledge and that is the passage that leads back to the cave of echoes said jack would you believe it we can get back to our dear old ferncave and we shant be prisoners in the treasure caves any more lets go and fetch the old couple too he went back down the passage swarmed up the rope wriggled back up the little tunnel and came out into the sittingroom he told the old man where the passage led to come too he said we will take you to a safe place the old man laughed sadly we cannot do as you do and crawl and climb he said it is impossible you go and we will stay here we will not say where you have gone we will put back the picture over the hole and no one will guess jack went back to the girls kiki with him pity we couldnt take martha too he said i got quite fond of her but the old people would miss her they simply wont come with us i think theyre right too theyd never be able to swarm along that little tunnel and swing down the rope nor would they ever be able to get down into the ferncave come on im longing to get back to our own cave ha ha weve escaped after all wont those men be wild i hope they wont hurt those two old people said lucyann anxiously she was such a dear gentle old woman they went down the winding passage and came to the cave of echoes where kiki annoyed them by squawking and screeching all the time bringing back echoes of hundreds of magnified squawks and screeches that almost deafened them they got through the little drainpipelike tunnel that led to the back of the ferncave and dropped thankfully down to the rugs still spread out there home again said jack and laughed funny to think we feel this is home but i really do they settled down for a rest those men must have gone off somewhere in their planes last night unloaded their goods and taken off again almost at once to get back so quickly said dinah thoughtfully i really hardly expected to see them in the caves today i didnt hear the planes come back did you no but the wind has changed so maybe the sound didnt blow in our direction said jack its not so sunny now looks like rain again the winds jolly strong we shall have to keep a lookout for bill and philip if they come said dinah philip wont know were here will he do you girls mind if i go this evening and just have a snoop round about the mens hut asked jack you know in case by any chance old tufty didnt get away but got caught and is a prisoner golly i didnt even think of that said lucyann in horror oh jack surely you dont think he got caught do you not for a minute said jack cheerfully but it would be just as well to make sure id better go now whilst the men are busy in the caves by the way were all eight of them there do you know i think so said dinah frowning but i really couldnt be certain do you remember lucyann no i didnt look at them said lucyann horrid things i expect they were all there said jack brrrrr the winds cold today ill put on an extra jersey so long girls ill be back in a short time off he went following the familiar way back to the mens hut he did not think that philip would have been caught but still he must make sure he scouted cautiously about the hut door was shut he went up to it and peeped in at the window no philip there good better just pop up to the cowshed thought jack they might have got him tied up there so off he went no it was empty good there was a sudden rush of wind such as often sweeps through a mountainous valley a torrent of rain came down and the boy ran for a tree it was the tree in which they had once all hidden a good big thick one that would keep the rain off he crouched there whilst the wind whipped round him there was such a noise of wind that the boy did not hear footsteps coming behind the tree he did not see the burly figure of pepi there staring in surprise at the crouched boy in a trice pepi was round the tree and had got hold of jacks shoulders the boy gave a howl of fright pepi gripped him tightly let me go yelled jack you brute let me go youre twisting my shoulder pepi took up a stick and grinned a little of this will do you good he said you boys are a lot of trouble to us where are the others you will tell me or i will beat you black and blue let me go yelled jack and kicked hard at pepis ankles the man gave a yelp of pain and hit jack on the back with the heavy stick jack kicked him again what would have happened to poor jack is easy to guess if something hadnt happened to pepi first the wind howled round and shook the tree violently something fell from the tree and hit the raging man full on the shoulder he dropped down at once shouting clutching at his shoulder jack sped off into the wind he turned and looked back pepi was trying to get up groaning the wind howled again and the big tree spat out something else that hit pepi on the head he fell back and did not move golly said jack staring its two of our suitcases that we left up the tree they just blew down at the right moment i hope they havent killed him he went back cautiously to the still man no he wasnt killed just completely knocked out jack saw his chance at once he took his rope and roped the mans hands firmly together and then his feet then he tied him to the tree now you wont be able to come after me my dear pepi said jack taking a quick look up the tree in case the remaining two suitcases should come down i suppose the others left you here on guard today as they knew somebody had been at their food well you wont be much use as a guard for the rest of the day but never mind the tree will shelter you from the storm suddenly such an extraordinary idea struck jack that he stood perfectly still and gasped then he struck his hands together and yelled out loudly i must do it i must i must but have i time have i time he began to run as fast as he could through the wind and the rain why didnt i think of it before if those men are in the treasure caves i can bolt the door on them just as they did to us and make them prisoners why didnt i think of it before it may be too late now he ran and ran gasping and panting hot as fire in spite of the wind and the rain it wont be any good the men will be out of the caves by now he thought i may see them at any minute oh why didnt i think of this before i could have gone and bolted them in before i left dinah and lucyann it certainly was a most wonderful idea the men would be absolute prisoners they did not know the way out behind the picture and would never think of looking for it there certainly the old people would not tell them oh if only they were still in the caves the rain poured down the wind blew like a gale fortunately it was behind jack now and it helped him on he was soaked through but he didnt care there was no sign of the men jack slowed down when he came near the waterfall he didnt want to run right into them he began to think more calmly maybe they wont come out till the rain stops and the storm dies down rain would spoil the old books and papers and pictures yes theyll be sure to wait i may be in time yet the men may even decide to stay the night there if the storm doesnt clear jack was right the men having looked out of the entrancehole of the caves had seen the rainstorm sweeping over the mountainside and had decided not to venture out with their treasures they would be ruined better spend the night here said one of the men in that room with the rugs well turn the old people and children out only the old people were there they made vague gestures when the men asked where the children were pointing towards the passage that led to the sunny ledge the men settled down on the rugs and one of them got out a pack of cards he set the lamp so that they could all see and then began to deal the cards the old people went into their sittingroom sad and afraid how they hoped that the men would not look behind the picture in the next room when jack arrived at the treasure caves he could hardly walk through the passages he stumbled along past the cave of stalactites past the cave of stars and into the first treasure cave through the open door at the bottom of the curving stairway he could see no men at all his heart sank had they gone then had he missed them he went cautiously on when he came to the sittingroom he peeped in and saw the old couple there with martha the hen then he heard the noise of the men in the next room he beckoned to the old couple they rose silently and followed him in surprise jack did not speak till he was well out of earshot of the men come he said leading them out of the cave of statues and out of the stout door i am going to bolt the men in but i dont want to lock you in too he shot all the bolts triumphantly crash crash crash hed done it hed done it chapter the day after the storm as soon as he had shot the bolts safely home jack collapsed his tussle with pepi his long run through the wind and the rain and the terrific excitement of making the men prisoners had been too much for him he sank down to the steps outside the bolted door and lay there quite still it was dark there the old couple felt about for jack in alarm what was happening to the poor boy they found his torch in his pocket and took it out they switched it on and looked anxiously at jacks pale face and closed eyes they tried to drag him up the steps his clothes are wet said the old woman feeling jacks soaked jersey and shorts he will get a chill a terrible chill maybe he will die of it what shall we do old man the old man answered her in her own language we will drag him up these steps we will make him comfortable in the cave of stars you shall wrap him in your shawl and he shall have my coat together the old couple managed to drag jack up the steps how they panted and groaned they could not get him any further than the top the old man stripped off jacks wet things and put his coat round him the old woman wrapped him all round in her thick shawl they squeezed out his wet things and hung them on the rocky wall to dry they were frightened what were they going to do now those men were bolted in the caves with what was left of their precious treasure how angry they would be when they discovered what had happened jack soon came to himself again he sat up wondering where he was he had been in a kind of half faint half sleep he clutched at his clothes what on earth had he got on a shawl gracious was he dressed up as a statue again the old people heard him moving and switched on the torch again they looked anxiously at him and were relieved to see that he was no longer so white you are better now asked the old man gently yes thanks im all right said jack pulling at the shawl whatevers this your clothes were so wet said the old man we had to take them off to dry them or you would have got a terrible chill you have my coat and my wifes shawl oh well thank you said jack feeling rather foolish in the coat and shawl sorry i gave you a fright but i just conked out that run up the mountainside i suppose i say wasnt it a good idea bolting those men in ah but what will they do to us when they know said the old man sadly nothing how can they said jack they are on the wrong side of the bolted door arent they dont you worry were all right he got up his legs were not very steady but he could walk all right im just going to the entrance of the caves to see if by any chance that awful windstorm has died down he said if it has ill make my way to the ferncave where the two girls are theyll be scared by themselves somehow he stumbled along to the entrance the clouds were so low and black that it was like night outside rain still swept over the hillside in great torrents it was quite impossible to go out i should get completely lost thought jack golly the girls will be so worried about me i hope they wont be frightened all by themselves well its no use ill have to spend the night here with the old people but it wont be very comfortable it wasnt comfortable they found a place in the cave of stars a rounded hollowedout basin of rock with only a few sharp edges for the sake of warmth they all huddled together jack tried to make the old people take back their coat and shawl saying that his clothes were almost dry but the old woman grew very angry when he suggested this and scolded her husband hard in words that jack could not understand but whose meaning he could guess my old one says that you are a bad bad boy to talk of putting on wet clothes said the old fellow we will press close together it is not cold in this cave it wasnt very cold it was true jack lay between the old man and his wife looking up at the roof of the strange cave he watched the curious greenishblue stars shine and fade flicker and glow there were hundreds of them most enchanting to watch jack wondered about them for a long time and then fell asleep in the morning the old people awoke first and felt stiff and uncomfortable but they did not move for fear of disturbing jack he awoke at last and sat up he saw the glowing stars above and around and knew where he was at once i wonder what the time is he said looking at his watch halfpast seven gracious i wonder what those men are doing are my clothes dry luckily they were jack put them on quickly and gave back the coat and shawl with warm thanks now you stay here a bit he said to the old couple im just going to the bolted door to see if i can hear anything he went off feeling quite himself again now as soon as he came to the top of the curving stairway that led down to the oaken door he heard bangs and crashes ah the men had discovered that they were bolted in crash bang thud smash they were hammering at the stout door for all they were worth how they shouted and yelled how they kicked at that door and tried to smash it down jack stood at the top of the steps and grinned in delight serve them right they were getting a taste of their own medicine they had locked the children in and now they themselves were prisoners suddenly there was a loud bang that made jack jump it was a revolver shot the men were shooting at the door hoping to smash the bolts bang bang bang jack went back a little way afraid that a bullet might glance off somehow and hit him though this was impossible bang bang the bolts could not be smashed the men gave the door a few more blows with something and then stopped jack ran back to tell the old couple all about it but they were frightened so it wasnt much fun telling them i think ill take you to the ferncave where the girls are he told the old man we have food and rugs in that cave come with me the old people wouldnt stir out of the place they knew so well they were terrified of the open air of the hillside and the outer world they shrank back and nothing that jack could say would make them change their minds well i shall just have to go to the girls myself then said jack at last ill bring them back here with food and rugs we might as well all be together those men are no longer a danger to us they cant possibly get out even if they find the hole behind that picture im sure they wont get any further than the cave of echoes he said goodbye to the frightened old people and went out into the sunshine it was warm on his head and back delicious the sky was blue again and the wind had gone he made his way to the waterfall arriving there without any mistake for he could follow the signposts easily now he was hailed by the girls as soon as they saw him they were peeping out through the fernfronds jack you didnt come back last night oh jack i hardly slept at all wondering what had happened to you cried lucyann what happened asked dinah who was looking rather pale she too had been very anxious especially when the storm had come heaps said jack marvellous news best in the world gracious is philip back then and bill here cried lucyann at once no thats not my news said jack do you know what ive done bolted those men into the caves what do you think of that what a wonderful idea said the girls together but what about the old people asked dinah oh i got them out first said jack and i found pepi back by the cowshed place and tied him up properly hes bound to that big tree where we once hid jack how marvellous you are cried lucyann did you fight him well not exactly said jack he caught me and i kicked him hard and just then the wind blew hard and a couple of our suitcases fell out of the tree and knocked him out it was as much of a surprise to me as to him oh of course we left our suitcases up there said dinah oh jack what a good thing we did pepi must have had a most uncomfortable night said jack the rain and wind were his only companions he told them how he had left the old couple in the cave of stars and related the tale of the angry men trying to smash down the door i cant get the old people to leave the caves he said so wed better take rugs and food and go back there to keep them company they lent me their coat and shawl last night when my things were soaked we cant leave them alone there without food or bedding oh dear i do like this cave so much better than anywhere else sighed lucyann still those old people have been very good to us is martha there too jack golly no id forgotten all about her said jack remembering i hope those men dont kill and eat her this was a dreadful thought and made poor lucyann quite dumb for a minute or two poor martha surely the men would leave her alone kiki of course was as delighted to see jack as the girls had been she nestled on his shoulder making crooning noises all the time he was talking pulling at his ear and ruffling up his hair jack scratched her poll delighted to have her again the girls collected a few tins and jack piled rugs over his shoulder then with kiki flying ahead they set off to follow the familiar signposts to the treasure caves the sun beat down hotly it was a really lovely day i wish i could draw a plan of how that hole behind the picture leads to our ferncave said dinah the mountain is riddled with holes and caves i say isnt the waterfall loud this morning and it seems bigger than ever i suppose its all the rain last night they arrived at the entrance to the caves at last and went in they made their way to the cave of stars and the old couple greeted them warmly and joyfully the old woman was full of delight to see lucyann again and fondled her lovingly im hungry said lucyann trying to wriggle out of elsas arms very hungry they all were it was a queer place to have a meal in the cave of stars the children watched the flickering shining lights quite entranced by them if only lucyann could take some home for her bedroom ceiling she wished this once again as she watched the shining stars well now all weve got to do is to wait said jack arranging the pile of rugs for everyone to sit on as comfortably as possible everything rests with philip now those men evidently dont know he hid in a plane or they would have said something he must have escaped all right what is he doing i wonder chapter a very strange journey what had happened to philip he was certainly having a most adventurous time he slept under the pile of coats and rugs in the plane until dawn then the planes landed and bumped along the ground on their huge wheels philip awoke at once he made a peephole through the rugs and watched to see what the two men in his plane were doing they were getting out what a bit of luck that they hadnt even looked round the plane or taken a coat from the pile other men outside were greeting the new arrivals philip sat up and tried to hear what was said but half of the speech was in a foreign language and there was such a babel that it was impossible to make out anything he glanced round the plane one of the crates was now in it and a tarpaulin was tied loosely round it philip tried to see what was in it packed in straw was one of the statues evidently one that was very valuable philip peeped cautiously out of the window of the plane for now the mens voices had ceased where were the men could he slip out now and escape to get help he stared in surprise the planes and others too were on a vast grassy plain and in front and all round was the blue sea all round well then they must be on some island somewhere he sat and thought for a moment these men were rogues they were doing a deal in valuable treasures hidden and perhaps forgotten during the last war they had planes of their own and a secret landingground what could be better than a lonely island say off the coast of scotland then i suppose theyll have motorboats or launches of their own to get the stuff away thought philip a proper gang of them ill never get away from here without being seen never if its an island and it seems as if it must be im as much a prisoner here as i was in the treasure caves blow then dinahs idea came into his mind what about hiding in the crate that figure would be sure to be put on board a boat and shipped off somewhere to be sold well couldnt he go with it he peeped out again to see where the men were they were evidently having food and drink in a hut some distance off philip reckoned that he would have at least half an hour to get to work he loosened the tarpaulin a little more he found that the crate was fastened by a hasp he pulled it undone and the whole side of the crate opened like a sideways lid straw began to tumble out the figure was inside packed loosely round with straw philip thought it must be the statue of some oldtime saint he looked at it closely could it be made of gold it looked like it anyway it didnt matter it was going to lie where philip had just been lying under the pile of rugs and coats and philip was going to take its place it was not really very difficult to get the figure out of the straw but it was heavy once it was out philip almost fell under its weight though it was only about as big as he was himself he dragged it to the pile of rugs he put it right underneath and piled the things over it so that not a scrap of it showed then he cleared up the fallen bits of straw and pushed them carefully back into the crate then he had the task of creeping into the straw himself the statue had made quite a hole and philip settled down in the same place he pulled the straw carefully round him and dragged the sideways lid shut but he could not fasten the hasp and had to leave it hoping that if the men saw it open they would simply think it had come undone by accident it was terribly warm in the straw philip began to be alarmed in case he might not be able to breath after a time and he burrowed a little tunnel from his mouth and nose to the outside of the straw after that he felt better he had been in the crate about a quarter of an hour when two men drove up in a cart they unloaded all the planes they carefully slid the crate that philip was in out of the plane and when the side swung open fastened the hasp carefully they did not guess for one moment that a live boy was inside instead of a silent statue philips crate was loaded into the cart with other things then the cart was driven off towards the sea bumping over ruts as it went philip was terribly jolted the straw tickled and pricked him everywhere he could hardly breathe but he didnt mind he would soon be on board ship and taken to the mainland somewhere then he could escape and go to the police so he lay there patiently trying to avoid the sharp prickles of the straw by wriggling about every now and again he could see nothing in the crate he could only guess when the cart arrived at a small jetty beside which a big launch was moored he was carried on board and dumped on a lower deck bump philip gasped for he was very much shaken other things were dumped beside him then there came the sound of shouts and orders the motor of the launch started up and philip felt the vessel moving smoothly over the water they were off these men dont lose much time thought philip they dont have these things on their hands very long wonder who buys them the trip to the mainland wherever it was was a long one philip was now quite sure that the landingground for the planes was on some lonely island but at last the launch eased into some kind of harbour and came to a stop men began to unload it at once the crate was rather roughly handled and once poor philip was put upsidedown for half a minute that was terrible he thought he would have to call out but just as he felt he couldnt bear it any longer he felt the crate being lifted again and put on a car or into a van which drove off almost immediately after a while it stopped philip heard the sound of an engine whistling and his heart leapt for joy they were probably at a railway station perhaps he would be put into the luggage van or on a goods train it would be easy enough to escape then he had not dared to before for he had felt certain that all the men handling the crate so far had been accomplices of the others he was not put on a train he was left in a yard along with other goods that were to go by a later train he strained his ears hoping to hear the van being driven off then he thought it would be safe for him to get out he waited for about twenty minutes then he began to try and wriggle out but he could not undo the hasp blow he yelled hi hi help me a porter not far off jumped in alarm he looked all round there was no one in sight except a solitary passenger waiting for the next train and another porter on the opposite platform philip yelled again hi hi let me out the porter felt terribly scared he looked at the waiting passenger had he heard the shouts too or was it just the porters own imagination the passenger had heard them and he was looking most alarmed somebody in trouble somewhere said the man walking to the porter sounds as if hes in that little yard there theres nobody there said the porter staring into the yard hi hurry up and let me out came philips urgent voice and to the horror of the passenger and the porter the big crate began to rock violently theres someone in there cried the porter and ran to the crate he undid the hasp with trembling fingers and out came philip straw in his hair straw down his neck straw all over him looking wild and terribly excited i want the police station said philip cant stop to explain anything to you now wheres the police station over there stuttered the porter pointing to a small square building about a hundred yards away from the railway station but but but philip left him butting away and sped off to the police station thrilled at his escape he had managed it wonderfully he thought he shot into the police station and almost scared the policeman there out of his life i want to report something important to somebody in authority said philip whos the head man here im the constable here said the policeman who are you and what do you want you can report to me i want to use the telephone said philip thinking it would be a good thing to get into touch with bill at once will you get a number for me please here here you cant go using our police phones without good cause said the policeman beginning to feel that this strawstrewn boy was mad whats your name and where do you live my name is philip mannering said philip impatiently dont hold me up please ive very important things to report to somebody the name caught the policemans attention at once philip mannering he said here are you one of the missing children theres four been missing for days you one of them he drew a leaflet from a drawer and looked at it he passed it across to philip to the boys surprise he saw a photograph of himself lucyann jack and dinah and kiki too of course at the head of the paper and their names and descriptions underneath yes im that boy he said pointing to his photograph philip mannering and i want to get into touch with bill smugs no his real names cunningham of course at once its most important the policeman suddenly got very busy he took up the receiver of the phone he barked a number into it which he got at once he evidently got on to somebody in high authority immediately sir one of the missing children has just turned up here philip mannering wants to report something to detective inspector cunningham yes sir i will sir he turned to philip are the other children with you no but theyre all right so far said philip ive escaped and i want help to rescue them can i get on to bill cunningham please the policeman spoke into the telephone the other children are all right but not with him please notify mrs mannering more news to follow when will the inspector be here the policeman put the receiver down and gazed in a very pleased manner at philip to think that this exciting case of missing children should be reported to his little station where am i asked philip suddenly what is this place called dont you know said the policeman surprised its gairdon on the northeast coast of scotland i guessed thats about where id be said philip sorry i cant tell you anything constable but i think id better wait for bill bill came in his aeroplane he landed at the nearest aerodrome took a fast police car and arrived at gairdon in two hours time very good going philip heard the car roaring up and ran to meet it bill i knew youd come oh bill ive got the most exciting news for you i dont know where to begin chapter bill gets busy bill swung out of the car took hold of philip by the arm and had a good look at him youre all right he demanded all of you your mothers been nearly off her head with worry im all right bill sos everybody but weve fallen right into the middle of a most extraordinary adventure said philip i must tell you quickly weve got to get busy you see come into the police station said bill philip followed the burly figure full of relief to hear his determined voice and to see his strong clever face soon the whole story was being poured out bill listened in amazement occasionally rapping out a sharp question when he heard how philip had taken the statue out of the crate and put himself in its place and was taken to the railway station he burst out laughing i never in my life knew children like you whatever will you do next i cant cope with you but joking apart this is a most extraordinary thing philip most amazing the men you got caught up with are the very men id been after for some time we couldnt find out what they were up to though we knew jolly well they were up to no good really said philip astonished by the way bill that night we were to go with you in your plane and got into the wrong one we heard shots was that anything to do with you it was said bill grimly it so happened that two of the men were spotted there and detained they shot their way out and that was what you heard i nearly got a bullet in my leg i can tell you we shall be very glad to get our hands on them and have something to charge them with clever rogues they are south americans in touch with the old nazis who have told them the whereabouts of many of the lost or hidden treasures in europe many of them have never been found you know gosh you wait till you see our treasure caves said philip oh by the way heres a notebook i pinched from one of the mens coats he handed it over bill squinted at it and his eyes nearly fell out of his head i say my word look here this is a code the code the rascals use and a list of all the people concerned in this racket with their addresses in code philip you deserve a medal this is a firstclass find we can round up the whole gang philip was delighted at bills pleasure bill got up and went to the telephone he made many calls short sharp and to the point philip listened but could not make much of them he hoped bill would soon set off to rescue the others they would be waiting most anxiously bill put down the telephone receiver at last were taking my aeroplane and another and twelve men counting myself he said starting at twelve im going too arent i said philip anxiously i think youd better stay and see your mother said bill and also there may be a bit of a dustup you know when we get there philip stared at him in the greatest indignation bill the others will be there jack and the rest and youd keep me out of it didnt i come here didnt i all right all right old son said bill you shall come goodness knows what further adventure youd get into if i left you behind philip cheered up at once he took lizzie out of his pocket and introduced her to bill meet busy dizzy lizzie he said and lizzie ran on to bills knee sounds like kikis makeup said bill busy dizzy lizzie what a name for a lizard i suppose we cant get anything to eat here can we asked philip wondering if there were ever any eatables at a police station ive had chocolate to nibble at times but thats all i was going to suggest that we should ask the good constable here to provide us with a really slapup meal said bill we could go to the hotel but you dont look very presentable at the moment you seem to exude bits of straw from top to toe well have a good meal and then give you a wash and brushup the wind got up as they ate their meal bill stared out of the window hope this wind dies down he said looks a bit stormy to me bill was right just before it was time for them to set off in the car to the aerodrome the telephone rang bill answered it he listened gravely and turned to philip theres a gale warning out he said afraid its no good starting off yet philip very stormy weather where we want to go blow said philip disappointed and anxious the others will be so worried waiting and waiting for us yes they will said bill but the aerodrome doesnt give out warnings like this without reason they are apparently expecting one of those sudden galestorms that mean a plane must fly absolutely blind not so funny well have to wait a bit philip looked upset it would be too awful if those men got back before they did and perhaps caught the others and he did so badly want bill to catch the men redhanded wanted him to get there before them and wait for them to come again and take away the treasures by the way bill how do you know where to fly to he asked suddenly i didnt know what the valley was or where except that it is in austria its down in that interesting little notebook you gave me said bill together with other places where they may also find hidden treasures oh that notebook told me quite a lot i wanted to know philip bill got out a map and showed philip exactly where the valley was it had a bad time in the war he said and the only pass into it was bombed it hasnt been unblocked again as far as i know plans were afoot to work on it this year a man called julius muller the one you were told to get into touch with has been trying to get permission to unblock the valley and enter it i wonder what happened to otto said philip the poor prisoner you know his address is in the book said bill i have already asked for information about him i daresay i shall get some soon he did the telephone rang that afternoon and a voice informed bill that otto engler had been found outside a big hospital unconscious he had almost died of heart trouble but was making slight progress now though he could not speak a word i bet those brutes illtreated him and made him tell them the exact whereabouts of the treasure caves said philip and then took him back and left him somewhere in the street ill and terrified quite likely agreed bill they wouldnt stop at much the telephone bell rang again and bill took up the receiver and listened once more gale getting worse he told philip have to put off our trip till tomorrow pity your mothers so far away or we could have dropped in to see her ive been trying to get her on the phone philip did speak to his mother that afternoon though it was only a threeminute talk mrs mannering was so relieved to hear his voice that she could hardly say a word herself however philip found plenty to say and had to stop halfway through because he was cut off next day dawned fair and warm the wind had almost gone blown itself out in the night which had been extremely stormy and wild philip had awakened once or twice and had felt glad they had not tried to fly off through it for certainly it was a very wild storm he had slept in a comfortable bed put up in the cell of the police station this seemed very exciting to him first time ive ever passed a night in prison he told bill well i hope it will be the last said bill prison is not a pleasant place my boy bills car was brought to the door it was large and bright and swift he and philip got in bill started up the engine and they roared away twenty thirty forty fifty sixty seventy miles an hour and more philip was thrilled she does go he said funny that a car seems faster than an aeroplane when youre in it much more of a rush somehow they reached the aerodrome at last there was bills plane its propellers whirring fast beside it stood another very like it eleven men stood about waiting they saluted bill get into my plane bill ordered philip i want a word with my men he had his word and got in five of the men got in bills plane and six in the other there was a terrific roar and first bills plane took off and then the other one they flew into the wind circled round rose higher and then made off for the east philip gave a sigh of relief now things were on the move again he would soon see the others how glad they would be after some time bill spoke to philip were coming to that valley of yours philip now or should be have a look out and see if you recognise it philip looked down oh yes he cried thats it and look there are four planes down there thats where we land youd better look out in case the men are about and shoot bills plane roared down lower it swung into the wind and landed perfectly the second plane followed suit the engines stopped there was silence bill waited to see if anyone came running out no not a soul he and the other men poured out philip followed there seemed to be no one about at all bill told his men to scatter and make a search before they went any further soon one of them gave a shout hey theres one of them here all tied up like a chicken it was pepi half dead with cold and hunger he was so glad to be set free that he did not show much surprise at seeing so many strangers in charge of one of the men he tottered over to bill put him in the hut and lock him up ordered bill who could have tied him up philip i cant imagine said philip puzzled and look bill here are two of our suitcases fallen out of the tree i suppose funny there are still seven men to be accounted for said bill right well now wed better set off to these treasure caves look out men in case theres any ambush we dont want to be shot up without warning they set off philip telling bill the way bill was filled with amazement to see the valley the towering mountains the burnt ruins it seemed so extraordinary to think of the four children marooned here in the middle of such thrilling adventures can you hear the waterfall now asked philip eagerly after a time i can were getting near the men were amazed to hear the noise of the great waterfall and even more astonished to see it they did not say very much for they were tough men not easily surprised by anything but they stood and stared for some time now careful because were getting near to the cave entrance said philip at last shall i go first i think id better chapter an exciting finish jack dinah lucyann kiki and the old couple were still in the cave of stairs they had just finished their meal and were wondering what to do what a pity the old couple wouldnt come outside the mountain it was such a lovely day we could easily go and sun ourselves there said lucyann longingly theres no danger from those men they cant get out of that locked door just as she spoke jack clutched hold of her arm and made her jump sh i can hear voices they all listened fearfully yes there were voices coming down the tunnel that led from the cave of stalactites to the cave they were now in more men quick hide said dinah urgently in a panic the children began to run to the other end of the cave stumbling and tripping their feet echoing round the big vault halt cried a stern voice and a big figure stood just inside the cave stand still put your hands up lucyann knew that voice of course she did bill bill she squealed oh bill we thought you were never coming she ran across the cave and flung herself on the surprised bill jack and dinah followed shouting in delight lucyann caught sight of philip and flung herself on him too philip dear philip you did escape and get to bill philip was astonished to see the children and the old couple there he had left them in the treasure caves how had they got out and where were the men the old couple came slowly up half frightened to see so many people by the light of the powerful torches bill was gentle with them poor frightened moles he said to philip well they will be well looked after and rewarded now where are these men i bolted them in said jack proudly they are prisoners in the treasure caves this was news to philip and of course to bill too they questioned jack eagerly and he told them how the old woman had shown them the hole behind the picture and how they had managed to escape through it to the cave of echoes and from there to their own ferncave then how jack had gone to the mens hut and had come up against pepi and tied him up and finally how he had got his great idea and slipped back to bolt the men in well that seems pretty good work to me said bill but it wont be an easy job routing them out of those caves i wonder if we could take them by surprise from the back get in at that picturehole and give them a shock oh yes said jack of course you could you could leave one or two of your men at the bolted door here attracting the attention of the seven men and whilst they are shouting and yelling at one another the rest of your men could go in the other way and surprise them that seems a very sound plan said bill and gave some orders he turned to philip im leaving two men here take them to the bolted door in half an hours time and they will then attract the mens attention jack you come with me and the others and show me the way back to your ferncave and through the cave of echoes to the passage that leads to the hole at the back of that picture the little procession set off the two men left behind waited for half an hour and went with philip to the bolted door at the bottom of the curving steps they rapped on it and shouted an answering shout came from inside who are you let us out open the door the men inside banged at the door and the men outside did the same it was a perfect babel of noise all the seven men were there arguing banging demanding to be set free and generally losing their tempers meantime bill jack and the others had gone to the ferncave they had crawled in and found to their dismay that they had to wriggle through the drainpipe hole at the back one of them almost got stuck i must say you children manage to get into the most marvellous scrapes said bill emerging from the hole into the cave of echoes my im hot hot hot hot hot said the echoes at once bill jumped whats that that that that that shouted the echoes alarmingly jack laughed its only the echoes he said kiki began to squawk and then whistled like an express engine the noise was deafening kiki always does that here said jack leading the way shut up kiki bad bird soon they were in the passage that led to behind the waterfall but before they got there they came to the hole in the roof have you got a rope on you bill said jack weve got to get up here i used my rope to tie up pepi if you can get me on your shoulder and shove me up i can crawl into the hole fix the rope and let it down it was soon done one after another the men crawled into the hole thinking that never in their lives had they done so much climbing creeping and crawling they looked at jack in admiration what a boy jack came to the hole behind the picture he listened not a sound the men were all at the bolted door shouting kicking and arguing jack gave the picture a push and it fell the room was empty he jumped down and the others followed one by one hope theres no more of this sir said one of the men to bill you want thinner men for this job better go cautiously now said jack we are near the treasure caves we go straight through three and then come to the cave of statues thats where the bolted door is quiet now ordered bill and treading softly in their rubbersoled shoes the men moved slowly forward revolvers glinting in their hands through the cave of gold through the cave of books through the cave of pictures jack laid his hand warningly on bills arm he could hear something its the men he said hark they must have got rocks or something to hammer at the door like that that really will break it down i should think by the noise bill stepped from the tunnel into the cave of statues although he had been prepared for them by philip he could not help jumping a little when he saw them in that dim greenish glow his men stepped silently behind him at the far end were the seven men they had found a big rock and were using it as a batteringram crash it struck the door violently crash nows our chance whispered bill they have their hands full not a revolver to be seen among them come on the men moved swiftly up behind juan and the others a sharp stern voice barked out behind them hands up weve got you cold the men all had their backs to bill at his voice they jumped in surprise and put their hands above their heads at once then juan swung round his hands still high his eyes swept the stern group of men in front of him how did you get here he said between his teeth what other way in is there who locked us in no questions answered now snapped bill he called loudly to the two men outside the door hey jim pete unbolt the door weve got em the door was unbolted it swung open and jim and pete looked round it grinning pretty little play we had said pete quite enjoyed it i did jack slipped down too the girls had been told to keep away till the men had been captured they were with the old couple in the cave of stars waiting impatiently bill counted the men all seven here good and weve got the eighth all right too pete take these fellows back to the planes shoot at the first sign of any trouble ill stay here and have a looksee it looks mighty interesting the men were marched off handcuffed swearing and stumbling jack watched them go delighted to think that he had had the idea of bolting them in bill had clapped him on the back for that once the men had passed through the cave of stars the girls came running to join jack philip and bill they showed the astonished bill everything he whistled when he saw so many treasures fortunes here he said well it wont be an easy task finding out where all these things came from and sending them back perhaps julius muller can help and the old couple can too said lucyann eagerly they know the histories of most of the statues anyway the old man and his wife were collected on the way out and taken with everyone else to the planes they made no objection now to going into the open air they evidently thought that bill was some great man who must be obeyed they bowed to him whenever he spoke to them well have to take them with us for questioning said bill but well return them as soon as possible to the village where this good man julius lives he may be good enough to look after these old people everyone got into one or other of the planes there were six of them in three of them were the eight prisoners with their guards in two others were pilots and the old couple bills plane carried the children their plane rose up and the children looked down at the strange valley for the last time yes have a good look said bill it will be in all the papers presently the valley of treasure no bill the valley of adventure said jack thats what we shall always call it the valley of adventure im glad we found martha all right said lucyann suddenly i did like her so much she was sweet good heavens whos martha said bill startled i thought the old woman was called elsa dont tell me martha is someone weve left behind oh no bill shes sitting on elsas knee now in one of the other planes she might even lay an egg there said lucyann bill looked even more astonished shes a hen explained lucyann she got left behind in the caves with the men and we were afraid she might have been killed by them but she wasnt she hid under the table and came clucking to join us when we went to find her you were busy looking at the gold i expect i must have missed her said bill to think i havent yet made the acquaintance of one of the ladies in this thrilling adventure what a pity what a pity what a pity what a pity said kiki at once cluckluckluck pop goes martha the end
