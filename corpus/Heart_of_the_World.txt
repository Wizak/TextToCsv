heart of the world prologue don ignatio the circumstances under which the following pages come to be printed are somewhat curious and worthy of record within the last few years a certain english gentleman whom we will call jones because it was not his name chanced to be employed as the manager of a mine not far from the usumacinto river the upper reaches of which divide the mexican state of chiapas from the republic of guatemala now life at a mine in chiapas though doubtless it has some compensations does not altogether fulfil a europeans ideal of happiness to begin with the work is hard desperately hard and though the climate is healthy enough among the mountains there are valleys where men may die of fever of sport strictly speaking there is none for the forests are too dense to hunt in with any comfort and if they were not the swarms of venomous insects of various degree that haunt them would make this particular relaxation impossible society also as we understand it is conspicuous by its absence and should a man chance even to be married he could not well bring his wife into regions that are still very unsettled across forest paths through rivers and along the brinks of precipices dangerous and impassable enough to strike terror to the heart of the stoutest traveller when mr jones had dwelt for a year at the mines of la concepcion the fact of his loneliness and a desire for acquaintances more congenial than the american clerk of the stores and his indian labourers came home to him with some force during the first months of his residence he had attempted to make friends with the owners of some neighbouring fincas or farms this attempt however he soon gave up in disgust for these men proved to be halfbreeds of the lowest class living in an atmosphere of monotonous vice in this emergency being a person of intelligence jones fell back upon intellectual resources and devoted himself so far as his time would allow to the collection of antiquities and to the study of such of the numerous ruins of preaztec cities and temples as lay within his reach the longer he pursued these researches the more did they fascinate his imagination therefore when he chanced to hear that on the farther side of the mountain at a hacienda called santa cruz there dwelt an indian don ignatio by name the owner of the hacienda who was reported to have more knowledge of the antiguos their history and relics than anybody else in this part of mexico he determined to visit him upon the first opportunity this indeed he would have done before for don ignatio boasted an excellent reputation had it not been for the length of the journey to his home now however the difficulty was lessened by an indian who offered to point out a practicable path over the mountain which brought the hacienda of santa cruz to within a threehours ride on muleback from la concepcion in place of the ten hours that were necessary to reach it by the more frequented road accordingly one day in the dry season when work was slack at the mine owing to the water having fallen too low to turn the crushingmill jones started this was on a saturday for on the monday previous he had despatched a runner to don ignatio announcing his intended visit and received in reply a most courteous and wellwritten letter begging him to pass the next sunday at the hacienda where any english gentleman would always be most welcome as he approached the hacienda he was astonished to see the faзade of an enormous white stone building of a semimoorish style of architecture having towers and ornamented doorways at either end and a large dome rising from the centre of its flat roof riding through the milpas or cornfields and groves of cocoa and coffee bushes all in a perfect state of cultivation which covered many acres on every side of the building jones came to the gateway of a large patio or courtyard where grew several gigantic ceiba trees throwing their grateful shade over the mouth of a well from under these trees an indian appeared who evidently had been watching for his arrival and taking the horse informed him with many salutations that the seсor ignatio was at evensong with his people in the chapel yonder according to his habit but that the prayers would soon be finished leaving his horse in charge of the indian jones went to the chapel and its great doors being open he entered and sat down so soon as his eyes became accustomed to the dim light he perceived that the place was unusually beautiful both in its proportions and its decorations the worshippers also were many perhaps they numbered three hundred clearly all of them indians employed upon the estate and so intent were they upon their devotions that his entry was not even noticed to his mind however the most curious object in the building was a slab of white marble let into the wall above the altar whereon the following inscription was engraved in spanish in letters so large that he had no difficulty in reading it dedicated by ignatio the indian to the memory of his most beloved friend james strickland an english gentleman and maya princess of the heart his wife whom first he met upon this spot pray for their souls of your charity o passerby while jones was wondering who this james strickland and maya princess of the heart might be and whether it was his host who had set up the tablet to their memory the priest pronounced his benediction and the congregation began to leave the church the first to pass its doors was an indian gentleman whom jones rightly took to be don ignatio himself he was a man of about sixty years but one who looked much older than his age for sorrow hardship and suffering had left their marks upon him in person he was tall and spare nor did a slight lameness detract from the dignity of his bearing his dress was very simple and quite innocent of the finery and silver buttons which have so much attraction for the mexican mind consisting as it did of a sombrero of panama straw with a black ribbon in place of the usual gilt cord a clean white jacket and shirt a black tie fastened in a bow a pair of drabcoloured trousers and brown boots of european make indeed the only really remarkable thing about don ignatio was his face never thought jones had he beheld so beautiful a countenance or to be more accurate one that gave him such assurance of its owners absolute goodness and purity of nature the features were those of a highbred indian thin and delicately cut the nose aquiline the cheekbones and brow prominent while beneath the latter shone a pair of large and soft black eyes so tender and trustful in their expression that they seemed almost out of place in the face of a man he stood by the door of the chapel in the light of the setting sun leaning somewhat heavily on a stick while the indians filed past him every one of these man woman and child saluted him with the utmost reverence as they went some of them especially the children kissing his long and finelyshaped hand when they bade him goodnight in terms of affection such as father and called on the saints to guard him jones watching them reflected upon the difference of their attitude from that of the crouching servility which centuries of oppression have induced in their race towards any master of white blood and wondered to what his hosts influence over them was due it was at this moment that don ignatio turned and saw him a thousand pardons seсor he said in spanish with a shy and singularly engaging smile as he lifted his sombrero showing his long hair which like his pointed beard was almost white you must indeed have thought me rude but it is my custom at the end of the weeks work to attend worship with the peons do not press round the noble inglese my children also i did not think that you would arrive before the sun was down pray dont apologise seсor answered jones i have been much interested in watching all your servants at their devotions what a beautiful chapel this is may i look at it before you shut the doors certainly seсor like the rest of the house it is fine the old monks who designed it two hundred years ago for this was a great monastery knew how to build and labour was forced in those days and cost nothing of course i have repaired it a great deal for those who lived here before me did not trouble about such things you would scarcely think seсor that in the old days twenty years ago this place was a nest of highway robbers smugglers and manslayers and that these people whom you see tonight or their fathers were slaves with no more rights than a dog but so it was many a traveller has lost his life in this house or its neighbourhood i myself was nearly murdered here once look at the carving of that altarpiece it is fine is it not those sapote wood columns date from the time of the old monks well i have known don pedro moreno my predecessor tie human beings to them in order to brand them with redhot irons to whom does that inscription refer asked jones pointing to the marble slab which has been described don ignatios face grew very sad as he answered it refers seсor to the greatest friend i ever had the man who saved my life at the risk of his own when i came by this limp and one who was dear to me with a love passing the love of woman but there was a woman who loved him also an indian woman too and he cared for her more than he did for me as was right for has not god decreed that a man should leave his friends yes his father and mother even and cleave unto his wife he married her then said jones who was growing interested oh yes he married her and in a strange place and fashion but it is an old story seсor and with your permission i will not tell it even to think of it revives too many painful memories memories of death and loss and disappointed ambition and high hopes unfulfilled perhaps one day if i have the courage and live long enough i will write it all down indeed some years ago i made a beginning and what i wrote seemed foolishness so i gave up the task i have lived a rough life seсor and met with many adventures in it though thanks be to god my last years have been spent in peace well well it is coming to an end now and were it not for the thought that my people here may fall into evil hands when i am gone that would not trouble me but come seсor you are hungry and the good father who has promised to eat with us must ride tonight to celebrate a mass tomorrow at a village three leagues away so i have ordered supper early the porter with your bag arrived safely it has been placed in your chamber the abbots room it is called and if you will follow me i will show you a short path to it from the chapel then he led the way to a little door in the wall unlocking this door they passed up some narrow stairs at the head of which was a landingplace with a window or rather grille so arranged that while it was invisible from below an observer standing there could hear and see all that passed in the chapel this was the place said don ignatio whence the old abbots kept secret watch upon the monks and it was here that once i saw a sight which i am not likely to forget then he passed on through several long and intricate passages till he came to a sittingroom filled with handsome old spanish furniture your sleepingplace lies beyond seсor he said opening another door that led into a large and drearylooking chamber lighted by heavilybarred windows of which the sills were not less than ten feet from the ground on the walls were frescoes of the last judgment and of scenes inspired by the bloody drama of the inquisition grim to look on and somewhat injured by damp but executed with great power and vivid if distorted imagination below the centre window and reaching to within three feet of the floor was an ancient fulllength portrait of one of the abbots of the monastery lifesize and painted in oils upon a panel representing a man of fierce and evil countenance over whose tonsured head the holy spirit was shown hovering in the shape of a dove for the rest the room was well if lightly furnished and boasted the luxury of squares of matting laid upon the brick floor i fear that you will think this but a dismal apartment seсor said don ignatio still it is our guestchamber moreover there is a room attached which i thought might be useful to you to write in should you wish to do so the people here say that the place is haunted but i know you englishmen do not bother about such things it is not wonderful however that they talk thus seeing that murders were done in this chamber in the time of don pedro moreno indeed he laid a plot to kill me and my friend here and though he did not succeed in that instance when i came into possession afterwards i found several skeletons beneath the floor two of them i remember just where the bed stands now and gave them decent burial jones as in honour bound declared himself to be totally indifferent to representations of tortures of the inquisition memories of departed abbots skeletons of murdered men beneath the floor ghosts and hoc genus omne still though he never confessed it to his host his first night in the abbots chamber owing probably to the strong coffee which he had drunk was not altogether a pleasant experience in after days however he became well accustomed to the place and indeed preferred it to any other room in the hacienda in contrast to the rude and illdressed fare with which jones was fain to satisfy himself at the mine don ignatios supper was a feast worthy of epicurus especially as it was free from the horrible messes compounded of oil and the inward parts of animals that figure so largely in mexican cookery after their meal cigars and black coffee were handed round of which the raw materials had been grown on the estate and never in his life did jones smoke better tobacco when the padre a gentle and wellinformed man had departed jones began to speak of the antiquities of the country soon he found that his hosts knowledge of the subject had not been exaggerated seeing that he was even able to decipher hieroglyphic writings of which the key was supposed to be lost and to give an outline of the history of the races who built the great temples and palaces whereof so many ruins are to be found in the palenque district it is sad to think said jones presently that nothing in which the breath of life remains is left of all this civilisation if only the old legend of the golden city hidden away somewhere in the unexplored recesses of central america were true i think that i would give ten years of my existence to visit it it would be a glorious thing to step back into the past to see a system at work and mingle with a people of which the world has lost all count and knowledge for let the imagination be active as it will it is practically impossible to reconstruct these things from ruins and traditions in fact don ignatio i do not understand how it is that you who have never seen the antiguos in the flesh can talk about them so certainly if i had never seen them seсor he answered quietly it would be wonderful indeed you might be justified in setting me down as a teller of tales but it chances that i have seen the golden city of fable and its civilisation and i can assure you that its wonders were far greater than any that have been told of in legend or even by the spanish romancers what gasped jones what have i been drinking too much of your excellent wine am i asleep or did i hear you say that you the gentleman sitting before me with your own eyes had seen the secret city of the indians you heard me say so seсor though i did not in the least expect you to believe me indeed it is because i cannot bear to be thought a liar that i have never said anything of this story and for this same reason i shall not repeat it to you since i do not wish that one whom i hope will become my friend should hold me in contempt in truth i am sorry that i have spoken so freely but in support of my veracity i will beg you to remember that among the huge forests wildernesses and sierras of central america where no white man has set his foot and whence the indians vanished generations since there is room for many ancient cities why seсor within two hundred miles or less of where we sit tonight there exist tribes of lacandones or unbaptised indians who have never seen a white man and who still follow their fathers faiths no seсor that story shall never be told at any rate in my lifetime for i have nothing to show in proof of it or at least only one thing what is it asked jones eagerly you shall see if you wish seсor his host answered and left the room presently he returned with a little leather bag from which he extracted a very curious and beautiful ornament it was a great emerald by far the largest that jones had ever seen uncut but highly polished this stone which was set in pure gold obviously had formed the clasp of a belt and could also be used as a seal for on it cut in intaglio was the mask of a solemn and deathlike human face surrounded by a hieroglyphic inscription while on the reverse were other hieroglyphics can you read this writing asked jones when he had examined the ornament yes seсor the words in front are o eyes and mouth look on me plead for me and those on the back heart of heaven be thou my home it is wonderful said jones restoring the relic with a sigh for he would have given everything that he had down to his shoes to possess it and now will you not make an exception in my favour and tell me the story i fear that i cannot oblige you seсor don ignatio answered shaking his head but pleaded jones having revealed so much it is cruel to hide the rest seсor said his host will you take some more coffee no then shall we walk a little on the roof and look at the view it is pretty by moonlight and the roofs here are wonderful all built of solid stone there is a tradition that the old monks used to dine on them in summer they have a loopholed wall round them whence that abbot whose portrait hangs in your sleepingchamber beat back a great attack of the indians whom his oppression stirred into rebellion tomorrow i shall hope to show you round the lands which have repaid me well for my twenty years of cultivation everybody in mexico runs after mines but its soil is the richest mine of all i knew that and seeing the capacities of the place i sold the other emeralds which went with this clasp they were fine stones but unengraved and therefore of no particular interest and bought it cheap enough now that the country is more settled and i have planted so much its value has become great and will be greater still when all the young cocoa bushes are in full bearing a few years hence there thanks be to the saints the stair is done of late my back hurts me when i climb up steps the air is sweet is it not seсor and the prospect pleasing look the river shines like silver ah how beautiful is gods world it makes me sad to think of leaving it but doubtless he will provide still finer places for us to work and serve him in gardens where sin and grief cannot enter surely there is room enough yonder and he nodded toward the sky this was but the first of many nights that jones spent under don ignatios hospitable roof where as the months went by he grew more and more welcome soon he conceived a great affection for the grave sweetnatured kindly old indian gentleman whose mind seemed to be incapable of any evil thought and whose chief ambitions were to improve his land and do good to all about him more especially to his indian servants or peons in the beginning of their intimacy they made several expeditions together to inspect ruins in the neighbourhood and once don ignatio came to stay with him at the mine of la concepcion where his visit proved of the greatest use to mr jones and the company he served one of the difficulties in working this particular mine lay in the scarcity of labour at a word from don ignatio this trouble vanished he sent for a cacique who lived in the mountains and spoke to him and lo within a week fifty stalwart indians appeared to offer their services at the mine thus affording one of many instances that came to joness knowledge of his friends extraordinary influence among the natives as time went on however these excursions ceased since don ignatios health grew too feeble to allow him to leave the hacienda at length it was when they had been acquainted for nearly two years a messenger arrived at the mine one morning saying that he was instructed by his master don ignatio to tell the seсor jones that he lay dying and would be glad to see him he was to add however that if it should be in any way inconvenient the seсor jones must not trouble himself to come for so small a matter as his master had written a letter which would be delivered to him after his death needless to say the seсor jones travelled across the mountains as fast as the best mule he owned would carry him on arriving at the hacienda he found don ignatio lying in his room almost paralysed and very weak but perfectly clearheaded and rejoiced to see him i am about to make my last journey friend he said and i am glad for of late i have suffered a great deal of pain in my back the result of an ancient injury also it is time that a helpless old man should make room for a more active one and he looked at his visitor strangely and smiled jones whose feelings were touched made the usual reply as to his having many months to live but don ignatio cut him short dont waste time like that friend he said but listen ever since we knew each other you have been trying to extract from me the story of how i came to visit the city heart of the world and of my friend james strickland whom thanks be to god i so soon shall see again well i never would tell it to you though once or twice i nearly did so when i saw how my silence chagrined you partly because i pride myself upon being able to keep a secret when pressed to reveal it and also because i am selfish and knew that so soon as you had heard my story you would cease to interest yourself in a stupid failing old man for who is there that cares about the rind when he has sucked the orange also there were other reasons for instance i could not have related that history without displaying unseemly emotion and i know that you englishmen despise such exhibitions lastly if i told it at all i desired to tell it fully and carefully keeping everything in proportion and this it would have been difficult to do by word of mouth yet i have not wished to disappoint you altogether and i have wished that some record of the curious things which i have seen in my life should be preserved though this last desire alone would not have been sufficiently strong to move me to the task which i finished ten days ago before the paralysis crept into my arm may i trouble you to open that cupboard near the foot of the bed and to give me the pile of writing that you will find in it a thousand thanks here seсor in these pages if you care to take the trouble to read them is set out an account of how i and my english friend came to visit the golden city of what we saw and suffered there and of some other matters which you may think superfluous but that are not without their bearing upon the tale i fear that my skill in writing is small still perhaps it may serve its turn and if not it matters nothing seeing that you seek the spirit not the letter and are not sufficient of a spanish scholar to be too critical now take the book and put it away for the very sight of it wearies me recalling the hours of labour that i have spent on it also i wish to talk of something more important tell me friend do you propose to stop in this country or to return to england return to england why i should starve where there are no mines to manage no i am too poor then would you return if you were rich asked the dying man anxiously i do not know it depends but i think that i have been too long away to go to live in england for good i am glad to hear that friend for i may as well tell you at once that i have made you my heir so that henceforth you will be a wealthy man as we understand wealth in this country you have made me your heir stammered jones yes why should i not i like you well and know you to be a good and honest man i have no relations and no friends and above all i am sure that you will deal justly and gently by my people here for i have watched your bearing towards those who work under you at the mine moreover i have conditions to make which will not be the less binding on you because they are not set out in the will namely that you should live here yourself and carry on the work that i have begun for so long as may be possible and that if you are forced to sell the place by any unforeseen circumstance or to leave it away by testament you should do so to an englishman only and one of whom you know something do you accept indeed yes and i know not how to thank you do not thank me at all thank your own character and honest face which have led me to believe that i can make no better disposal of my property and now go for i am tired but come to see me again tomorrow morning after the priest has left so jones who had entered that room possessed of a hardearned eight hundred a year departed from it the owner of a property which before long became worth as many thousands annually as any who have visited him at santa cruz can testify three days later don ignatio passed away peacefully and was laid to his rest in the chapel of the hacienda this then was how the story of the city heart of the world and of don ignatio and his friend james strickland who saw it came into the hands of him whom we have called jones here follows a translation of the manuscript chapter i how the plot failed i ignatio the writer of this history being now a man in my sixtysecond year was born in a village among the mountains that lie between the little towns of pichaucalco and tiapa of all that district my father was the hereditary cacique and the indians there loved him much when i was a lad perhaps nine years old troubles arose in the country i never quite understood them or i may have forgotten the circumstances for such things were always happening but i think that they were caused by some tax which the government at mexico had imposed upon us unjustly anyhow my father a tall man with fiery eyes refused to pay a tax and after a while a body of soldiers arrived mounted upon horses who shot down a great number of the people and took away some of the women and children of my father they made a prisoner and next day they led him out while my mother and i were forced to look on and sat him by the edge of a hole that they had dug holding guns to his head and threatening to shoot him unless he would tell them a secret which they were anxious to learn all he said however was that he wished that they would kill him at once and so free him from the torment of the mosquitoes which hummed around him but they did not kill him then and that night they put him back in a prison where i was brought to visit him by the padre ignatio his cousin and my godfather i remember that he was shut up in a dirty place so hot that it was difficult even to breathe and that there were some drunken mexican soldiers outside the door who now and again threatened to make an end of us indian dogs my godfather the priest ignatio confessed my father in a corner of the cell and took something from his hand then my father called me to him and kissed me and with his own fingers for a few moments he hung about my neck that thing which the priest had taken from him only to remove it again and give it to ignatio for safekeeping saying see that the boy has it and its story with it when he comes of age now my father kissed me again blessing me in the name of god and as he did so great tears ran down his face then the priest ignatio took me away and i never saw my father any more for the soldiers shot him next morning and threw his body into the hole that they had dug to receive it after this my godfather cousin and namesake ignatio took me and my mother to the little town of tiapa of which he was priest but she soon died there of a broken heart in tiapa we lived in the best house in the place for it was built of stone and set upon a bank overhanging a beautiful rushing river with water that was always clear as glass however much it rained which river ran a hundred feet or more below the windows about tiapa there is little to say except that in those days the people were for the most part thieves and such great sinners that my cousin the padre would not shrive some of them even on their deathbeds there was a church however whereof the roof was overgrown with the most beautiful orchids also the roads were so bad that except in the dry season it was difficult to travel either to or from the town here in this forgotten place i grew up but not without education as might have been expected seeing that my cousin was a good scholar and did all he could to keep me out of mischief when i was about fifteen years of age of a sudden a desire took hold of me to become a priest it was in this wise one sunday evening i sat in the church at tiapa looking now at the sprays of orchid flowers that swung to and fro in the breeze outside the window and now at the votive pictures on the walls offerings made by men and women who had called upon their patron saints in the hour of danger and had been rescued by them here from fire there from murderers and here again from drowning rude and superstitious daubs but doubtless acceptable to god who could see in them the piety and gratitude of those that out of their penury had caused them to be painted as i sat thus idly my godfather the good priest began to preach now it chanced that two nights before there had been a dreadful murder in tiapa three travellers and a boy the son of one of them passing from san christobel to the coast stopped to spend the night at a house near our own with them they brought a muleload of dollars the price of the merchandise that they had sold at san christobel which some of our fellowtownsmen halfbreeds of wicked life determined to steal accordingly to the number of ten these assassins broke into the house where the travellers lodged and meeting with resistance they cut down the three of them with machetes and possessed themselves of the silver just as they were leaving one of the thieves perceived the boy hiding beneath a bed and dragging him out they killed him also lest he should bear witness against them now those who had done this deed of shame were well known in the town still none were arrested for they bribed the officers with part of their booty but my godfather seeing some of them present in the church took for his text the commandment thou shalt do no murder never have i heard a finer sermon indeed before it was finished two of the men rose and crept from the church consciencestricken and when the preacher described the slaughter of the lad whom their wicked hands had of a sudden hurled into eternity many of the congregation burst into tears i tell this story because it was then for the first time as i thought of the murdered boy who some few days before had been as full of life as i was myself that i came to know what death meant and to understand that i also must die and depart for ever either into heaven or hell i shook as the thought struck me and it seemed to me that i saw death standing at my elbow as he stands today and then and there i determined that i would be a priest and do good all my life in order that i might find peace at the last and escape the fate of the evil on the morrow i went into my godfathers room and told him of my desire he listened to me attentively and answered i would that it might be so my son holding as i do that the things of the world to come outweigh those of this present earth ten thousandfold but it cannot be for reasons that you shall learn when you are older then when my trust is ended you may make your choice and if you still wish it become a priest five more years passed away during which time i grew strong and active and skilled in all manly exercises also i studied much under the teaching of my godfather who sent even to spain to buy me books among these books were many histories of my own race the indians and of their conquest by the spaniards all that had been published indeed of such histories i never tired although it maddened me to read of the misfortunes and cruel oppression of my people who today were but a nation of slaves at length on my twentieth birthday my godfather who now was grown very old and feeble called me into his chamber and having locked the door he spoke to me thus my son the time has come when i must deliver to you the last messages of your beloved father my cousin and best friend who was murdered by the soldiers when you were a little child and tell you of your descent and other matters first then you must know that you are of royal and ancient blood for your forefather in the eleventh degree was none other than guatemoc the last of the aztec emperors whom the spaniards murdered which descent i can prove to you by means of old writings and pedigrees also it is known and attested among the indians who even now do not forget the stock whence sprang their kings then by right i am emperor of mexico i said proudly for in my folly it seemed a fine thing to be sprung from men who once had worn a crown alas my son the old priest answered sadly in this world might is the only right and the spaniards ended that of your forefathers long ago by aid of torture and the noose save that it will earn you reverence among the indians it is but a barren honour which you inherit with your blood yet there is one thing that has come down to you from your ancestor guatemoc and the monarchs who ruled before him perchance you remember that on the night previous to his death your father set an amulet upon your neck and removing it again gave it to me to keep here is that amulet then he handed me a trinket made of the half of a heartshaped emerald smooth with wear but unpolished that if joined to its missing section would have been as large as a doves egg this stone was not broken but cut from the top to the bottom the line of separation being so cunningly sawn that no man unless he had one half before him could imitate the other the charm was bored through so as to be worn upon a chain and engraved upon its surface were some strange hieroglyphics and the outline of half a human face what is it i asked the old priest shrugged his shoulders and answered a relic which had to do with their wicked heathen magic and rites i suppose i know little about it except that your father told me it was the most valued possession of the aztec kings and that the natives believe that when the two halves of this stone come together the men of white blood will be driven from central america and an indian emperor shall rule from sea to sea and where is the other half father how should i know he answered testily who have no faith in such stories or in stones with the heads of idols graven upon them i am a priest and therefore your father told me little of the matter since it is not lawful that i should belong to secret societies still some such society exists and in virtue of the ownership of that talisman you will be head of it as your ancestors were before you though so far as i can learn the honour brought them but little luck i know no more about it but i will give you letters to a certain indian who lives in the district of which your father was cacique and when you show him the stone doubtless he will initiate you into its mysteries though i counsel you to have nothing to do with them listen ignatio my son you are a rich man how rich i cannot tell you but for many generations your forefathers have hidden up treasure for an object which i must explain and the gold will be handed over to you by those of your clan in whose keeping it is it was because of this treasure that your father and your greatgrandfather were done to death with many others since the rumour of it came to the ears of those that ruled in mexico who when they failed to force the secret from them tormented and killed them in their rage now this was the message of your father to you concerning the wealth which he and his ancestors had hidden tell my son ignatio should he live to grow up that there has never departed from our family the desire to win back the crown that guatemoc lost or at least to drive out the accursed spaniards and their spawn and to establish an indian republic to this end we have heaped up wealth for generations that it might serve us when the hour was ripe and because of this wealth of which the whisper could not altogether be hid in a land which is full of spies some of us have come to cruel deaths as i am about to do tonight but i shall die keeping my secret and when my son grows up others may rule at mexico or the matter may have been forgotten at least the gold will be where i left it now say to my son that it is my hope that he will use it in the cause to further which it has been amassed that he will devote his life to the humbling of our white masters and to the uplifting of the race which for centuries they have robbed murdered and enslaved nevertheless say to him that i lay no commands upon him as to these matters seeing that he must follow his own will about them for i cannot forget that from generation to generation those who went before him have reaped nothing but disaster in their struggle against the white devils whom because of the sins and idolatry of our forefathers it has pleased god to set over us those were your fathers words my son which he spoke to me in the hour of his murder and now you will understand why i said that you must wait before you determined to be a priest if that is still your wish it can be fulfilled for your father left it to you to follow whatever life you might desire when he had finished speaking i thought for a while and answered so long as my fathers blood is unavenged i cannot become a priest it is as i feared said the old man with a sigh that cursed talisman which lies about your neck has begun its work with you ignatio and you will tread the path that the others trod perchance to die in blood as they died oh why cannot man be content to leave the righting of wrongs and the destinies of nations in the hands of the almighty and his angels because for good or evil the almighty chooses men to be his instruments i answered within a week from this day some indians came to tiapa disguised as porters whose mission it was to lead me to the mountains among which my father had lived and where his treasure still lay hidden bidding farewell to my godparent the priest who wept when he parted from me i started upon my journey keeping my destination secret as it chanced i never saw him more for a month later he was seized with some kind of calentura or fever and died suddenly the best thing i can say of him is that with one exception there lives no man in heaven above whom i so greatly desire to meet again on the third day of my journey we reached a narrow pass in the mountains beyond which lay an indian village here my guides took me to the house of one antonio to whom the padre ignatio had given me letters an old man of venerable aspect who greeted me warmly and made me known to several caciques who were staying with him i knew not why so soon as we were alone in the house one of these caciques after addressing me in words which i could not understand asked me if i had a heart to this i replied that i hoped so whereat they all laughed then the man antonio coming to me unbuttoned my shirt revealing the talisman that had belonged to my father and at the sight of it the company bowed next the doors were locked and sentries having been posted before them a ceremony began which even now it is not lawful that i should describe in detail on this solemn occasion i was first initiated into the mysteries of the order of the heart and afterwards installed as its hereditary chief thus becoming while yet a boy the absolute lord of a many thousand men brethren of our society who were scattered far and wide about the land on the day after i had taken the final oaths antonio handed over to me the treasure that my ancestors hoarded in a secret place which my father had left in his keeping and it was a great treasure amounting to more than a million dollars in value now i was rich both in men and money still following the counsel of antonio i abode for a while in the village receiving those who came from every part of mexico to visit me as holder of the heart and as first in rank among the fallen peoples of the indians it was during these months that i made the great error of my life some three miles from the village where i dwelt lived two sisters indian ladies of noble blood though poor one of them a widow and the other a very beautiful girl younger than myself it chanced that riding past their house upon a certain sunday evening when most of the inhabitants of the valley were away at a fiesta i heard screams coming from it dismounting from my horse i ran in at the door which was open and saw one of the sisters the widow lying dead upon the ground while two bandits mexicans were attacking the younger woman drawing my machete i cut down the first of them before he had time to turn then i fell upon the second man with such fury that i drove him back against the wall seeing that his life was in danger he called upon me not to kill him for the sake of a low indian girl which insult maddened me so that i slew him upon the spot and caused his body with that of his companion to be buried secretly it happened that after this the girl whose life i had saved came to dwell in my village where i saw much of her so lovely was she and so clever that soon she won my heart and the end of it was that being headstrong and in love i married her against the advice of antonio and others of my brethren of the order it would have been better for the indian people and perhaps for me also if i had died before i stood at the altar with this woman though for a while she was a good wife and because of her cleverness of great service to me at that time now it must be stated that during all these months i had not been idle the more i thought on them the more the wrongs of my countrymen the real owners of the land took hold of my mind till at length they possessed it utterly and i became an enthusiast and a dreamer this was the object of my life to form a great conspiracy which should bring about a rising of the indians in every province of mexico upon a given day then when the spaniards and their bastards the spanish mexicans had been stamped out to reestablish the empire of the aztecs it was a madness perhaps but the madness lurked in my blood my forefathers had suffered from and for it and i think that it must have come down to us from our ancestor guatemoc the greatest and most unfortunate indian who ever lived where they failed i determined to succeed and strange to say in the end i went near to success for years i laboured travelling to and fro about the land till there was no province where i was not known as the holder of the heart and the chief by blood of the indian tribes everywhere i strove to rouse the people from their sloth and to win the caciques or head men to the cause and i did not strive in vain i used my great wealth to buy arms to gain over the lukewarm with bribes and in many other ways when my fortune sank low i gathered more for without gold nothing could be done treasures that were buried in the old days were given up to me as lord of the heart by those who had their secret also many brought me money each what he could spare and i hoarded it against the hour of need for a year or more i was the greatest power in mexico and yet though hundreds were privy to my plot it was so well hidden that no whisper of it came to the ears of the government at length all was ready and so carefully were my plans laid that success seemed certain but the unforeseen happened and i failed thus that woman whose life i had saved my own wife whom i loved and trusted who was bound to my cause and that of my countrymen by every tie human and divine betrayed me and it just before the time fixed for the rising it was agreed that she should be placed as one of whom we could be sure to play the part of a servant in the house of the man who ruled mexico in those days that she might spy upon him instead of so doing she my wife fell in love with him it is easy to guess the rest one night but a week before the appointed time i and some five or six others the leaders of our party were seized my companions were made away with secretly but i was brought before the great man who received me alone holding a pistol in his hand i know all your plans friend he said and i congratulate you on them for they were cleverly managed i know also that you have a great treasure in gold hidden away and he named the sum that wife of yours whom you were fool enough to trust has told me everything but she cannot tell me where the money is hidden for this you withheld from her which shows that you are not altogether mad now friend i make you a fair offer hand over this treasure and you shall go free of course when the day of vengeance is past and your sheep have found themselves without a shepherd nor shall you be molested afterwards refuse to do so and you will be brought to trial and die as you deserve how can you promise for others i asked you are not the only white man who would have fallen i can promise for others first because i am their master and secondly because nobody but myself knows anything of this matter since if i told them i must also share your wealth with them and that friend i mean to keep give it up to me and you may go and plot against my successors and the government of mexico as much as pleases you and take your wife with you for aught i care for friend having earned so comfortable a competence i propose to leave a land where as this business proves people in authority are too apt to have their throats cut now choose and be so good as to stand quite still while you are thinking the matter over or i may be forced to shoot you how about my associates i asked i believe that three or four of them have been carried off by typhus within the last day or two the prisons here are so unhealthy but i am sure that if the gold is forthcoming no more will sicken then i chose for i thought to myself that i might get more gold but i could never get another life and if i died many must suffer with me and all my hopes for the future of the indian race would come to naught also i knew this villain to be a man of his word and that what he promised he would fulfil within ten days he had the money and i was free to begin my life again nor did any of those who were doomed to perish in it learn the tale of the plot that had threatened them i was free but what a freedom was this when i had lost everything save the breath that god placed in my nostrils and perhaps my honour the great house that i had builded was fallen to the ground the moneys i had amassed were stolen the chief of my companions were dead my credit as a deliverer of the people was gone and my cause had become hopeless all these things had come upon me because of a woman a traitress whom i had nurtured in my bosom at first i was dazed but when i came to understand i swore a great oath before heaven that for her false sake i would hate and renounce her sex that whatever might be the temptation never again would i look kindly upon women or have to do with one of them in word or thought or deed that oath so far as lay in my power i have kept to this day and i hope to keep through all eternity it may be asked what became of my wife i do not know i lifted no hand against her who was flesh of my flesh but she perished the story was known i was forced to tell it to clear myself after i escaped from the prison i lay ill for many weeks and when i recovered she was gone others had been betrayed besides myself and doubtless some of them had wreaked fitting vengeance on her what it was i never asked for many years twenty perhaps i became a wanderer now as before the indians loved me and as lord of the heart and their hereditary cacique in a sense i still was great although but the shadow of power dwelt with me the substance had departed as it departs ever from those who fail from time to time i strove to rebuild the plot but now that i was friendless and without fortune few would follow me thus far so it came about that at length i abandoned the endeavour and lived as best i could i fought in three wars and gained honours therein and took my share in many adventures all of which left me as poor as i had entered on them at times i remembered my desire to become a priest but now it was over late to study also my hands were too much soiled with the affairs of the world wearying of the struggle i went back to my village in the mountains and dwelt there awhile but this also wearied me having nothing to do and i turned my attention to the management of mines it was while i was thus employed as a middleaged man that i made the acquaintance of james strickland who was destined to accompany me to the city heart of the world chapter ii the seсor strickland twoandtwenty years ago i ignatio visited a village in the state of tamaulipas named cumarvo a beautiful place halfhidden in pine forests amongst the mountains i came to this hamlet because a friend of mine one of the brethren of the order of the heart wrote to me saying that there was an indian in the neighbourhood who had in his possession an ancient aztec scroll which being in picturewriting neither he nor anyone else could read this scroll had descended to the indian through many generations and with it a tradition that it told of a very rich gold mine in the mountains whereof the site was lost which had been closed to save it from the grip of cortes by the order of guatemoc my forefather whom the spaniards murdered may their souls be accursed now i had been taught the secret of the picturewriting by old antonio my fathers friend when first i was initiated into the mysteries of the heart though it must die with me for i believe that at this hour there is no other man living who can read it this writing the indian was willing to give up to me as lord of the heart and accordingly having nothing better to do i journeyed to cumarvo to study it in this matter as in many others i was destined to meet with disappointment however at any rate for a while for on my arrival at the house of my friend i heard that the indian had died of a sudden sickness and that his son could not discover where the scroll was hidden another thing i learnt also namely that a white man an inglese the first who ever visited these parts had come to the village about six months before and was engaged in working some old silver mines on behalf of a company a task that he found difficult for the mexican owners of land in the neighbourhood being jealous of him and angry because he paid his men a fair wage were striving to prevent indians from labouring in his mine now the natives of this place from monday morning to saturday night were a gentle and industrious people but they had this fault that on the saturday night many of them were accustomed to become drunk on mescal the spirit that is distilled from the root of the aloe then their natures were changed and fierce quarrels would spring up amongst them for the most part about women that ended often enough in bloodshed it chanced that such a fray arose on the night of my arrival at cumarvo on the morrow i saw the fruits of it as i walked down the little street which was bordered by white flatroofed houses and paved with cobblestones purposing to attend mass in the limewashed church where the bell rang night and day to scare evil spirits back to hell in the middle of the street lying in the shade of a house were two dead men a handsome indian girl with a sullen and unmoved countenance was engaged in winding a serape or blanket round one of the bodies but the other lay untended certain stains upon the clothing revealing the manner of its end on a doorstep sat a third man much wounded about the head and face while the barber of the village its only doctor attempted to remove his hair with a pair of blunt scissors so that he might dress the cuts the scene was dreadful but no one took much notice of it for indian life is cheap and in those days death by violence was even more common in mexico than it is now on the opposite side of the street an old woman chaffered with a passerby about the price of her oranges while some children with shouts and laughter strove to lasso and drag away a pig that haunted the place and a girl on her way to mass stepped over the uncovered body which lay so quiet in the shade and recognising it as that of a friend crossed herself as she hurried on what is the cause of this seсor i asked of the barber i think that i have the honour of addressing don ignatio the little man answered and lifting his hands from their work he made a sign showing that he also was a member of our brotherhood though a humble one ah i thought so he went on as i gave the countersign we heard that you were going to visit us and i am glad of it for i weary of dressing wounds on sundays and perhaps you may be able to put a stop to these fights the woman was the cause of it of course seсor these are not the first she has brought to their deaths and he nodded at the girl who was wrapping the body in a blanket you see she was going to marry this man and he tapped the indian whose wounds he was dressing on the shoulder but she took up with that one pointing to the nearest body whereon number one here being drunk with mescal laid wait for number two and stabbed him dead the girl who was with him ran for number three yonder number twos brother but number one ambushed him so he was killed also then hearing the noise the village guard came up and cut down our friend here with their machetes but as you see unfortunately they did not kill him i heard and anger took hold of me approaching the girl i said this is your doing woman are you not afraid what of it she answered sullenly can i help it if i am pretty and men fight for me also who are you who ask me whether i am afraid fool cried the barber from the doorstep do you dare to speak thus to the lord of the heart the girl started and replied why not is he then my lord listen girl i said others besides these have died through you how do you know that she answered but what need to ask if you are the lord of the heart you have the evil eye and can read secrets without their being discovered to you it is you that have the evil eye woman like many another of your sex i said hear me now you will leave this place and you will never return to it for if you do you die also remember that if harm should come to any more men on your account wherever you go i shall know of it and you will die there whoever you are you are not the government and have no right to kill me she said trying to hide the fear which crept into her dark eyes no woman i am not the government but among our people i am more powerful than the government if you do not believe me ask the doctor yonder and he will tell you that i should be obeyed even by people who had never seen me where a troop of soldiers would be laughed at if i say that you are to die you will die in this way or in that for my curse will be on you perhaps you may tumble over a precipice or you may take a fever or be drowned in crossing a river quien sabe i know lord i know she whispered shivering for now she was frightened do not look so terribly at me spare me this time for the love of god i did not mean to do it but when men put their hearts into a womans hand how can she help squeezing them especially if she hates men but i did not hate this one and she touched the cheek of the dead indian caressingly i really meant to marry him it is that fellow whom i hate pointing to her wounded lover and i hope that he will be shot else i think that i shall poison him you will not poison him woman and though he deserves to die you are worse than he now begone and remember my words bending down she touched the corpses forehead with her lips then rising said i kiss your feet lord of the heart and went away without looking behind her nor was she seen again in that village then with a sigh i also was turning to go for it saddened me to think that when drink got hold of them a woman should have the power to change these men who were my brethren into savage beasts thirsting for each others blood ah i mused had it not been for that other woman who destroyed me and my hope by now i had begun to teach them better at this moment looking up i chanced to see a man such as i had never before beheld standing by my side and gazing at me stories are told of how men and women looking on each other for the first time in certain cases are filled with a strange passion of love of which come what may they can not again be rid among many misfortunes thanks be to my guardian angels this fate has never overtaken me yet at that moment i felt something that was akin to it not love indeed but a great sense of friendship and sympathy for and with this man which mastering me then is still growing to this hour though its object has for many years been dead perhaps it was the contrast between us that attracted me so much at first since human beings are ever drawn towards their opposites in nature and appearance i as you my friend for whom i write this history will remember although you have only known me in my age am tall thin and sallow like all my race with a sad expression reflecting the heart within and melancholy eyes very different were the mind and appearance of james strickland the englishman he was a fine man over thirty years of age short in proportion to his width though somewhat spare in frame and slender in limb his features were as clearly cut as those of an ancient god upon a marble wall his eyes were blue as the sea and though just now they were troubled at the sight of death merry like the eyes of a boy his curling hair for he had removed his hat in the presence of the dead was yellow as mimosa bloom darkening almost to red in the short beard and about the ears where the weather had caught it and beneath his shirt which was open at the neck his skin showed white like milk for the rest his hands were long and delicate notwithstanding the hard work of which they bore traces his glance was quick and his smile the most pleasant that ever i had seen your pardon seсor said this inglese in good spanish bowing to me as he spoke but unwittingly i have overheard some of your talk with yonder woman and i cannot understand how it comes that you a stranger have so much authority over her i wish that you would explain it to me in order that i might learn how to put a stop to such murders these dead men were two of my best workmen and i do not know where i shall look to replace them i cannot explain it seсor i answered returning his bow further than to say that i have a certain rank among the indians on account of which they reverence me still though i have no right to ask it of a stranger i pray that you will forget any words of mine which may chance to have reached your ears since of such authority the government is jealous by all means seсor they are already forgotten well adios this sight is not so pleasant that i wish to study it and replacing his hat upon his head he passed on although my journey proved to be in vain seeing that the scroll i came to read had vanished i lingered in the village of cumarvo alleging as the reason of my stay a hope that it might be discovered but really as i believe because i desired to become friendly with this white man as it chanced an opportunity was soon given to me to do him a signal service i have stated that there dwelt men of position in this place mexicans who were jealous of the englishman and these people stirred up some discontented miners in his employ to make a plot to murder him saying that if they did so they would win a great treasure which he kept hidden in his house this plot came to my ears through one of the brotherhood and i determined to frustrate it to which end i collected together twenty good men and true and arming them with guns bade them be silent about the matter above all to the inglese whom i did not wish to alarm the plan of the murderers was at the hour of dawn to attack the house where the seсor strickland slept with four or five servants only and to put all within its walls to death accordingly about one oclock on the night fixed i despatched my men by twos and threes instructing them to go round the hills at the back of the house and creeping into the garden to hide themselves there among the trees till i appeared an hour later i followed them myself without being observed by the spies of the attacking party for rain fell and the night was very dark arriving in the garden i collected my men and placed them in ambush under a low wall commanding the street up which i knew the murderers must come here we waited patiently till the cocks crew and the dawn began to break in the east presently we heard a stir in the village beneath as of men marching and in the gathering light we saw the murderers creeping stealthily up the street to the number of fifty or more so great was their fear of the englishman that they thought it safer to bring many men to kill him also each of the villains desired that his neighbour should be a sharer in the crime will you not wake up the inglese asked the man next to me no i answered it will be time enough to wake him when the affair is settled let none of you fire till i give the word now the brigands in the street below men without shame after waiting a little time for the light to grow stronger advanced towards the gate looking like a procession of monks for the air was chilly and each of them wore his serape wrapped about his head in their hands they carried rifles and drawn machetes within ten paces of the gate they paused for a minute to consult and i heard their leader a mexican direct half of them to creep round to the back of the house so as to cut off all escape then i whistled which was the signal agreed upon at the same time covering the mexican with my rifle almost before the sound had left my lips there followed a report of twenty guns and some fifteen or sixteen of the enemy were stretched upon the ground for a moment they wavered and i thought that the rest of them were going to fly but this they dared not do for they knew that they had been seen therefore they rushed at the wall with a yell firing as they came as they climbed over it we met them with pistol shots and machetes and for a few minutes the affair was sharp for they were desperate and outnumbered us still they lost many men in scaling the wall and forcing the gate and with the exception of fourteen who fled and were for the most part caught afterwards the rest of them we finished amongst the flowers and vegetables of the garden just as all was over the englishman who was a sound sleeper appeared yawning dressed in white and holding a pistol in his hand what is this noise he asked rubbing his eyes and why are you people fighting in my garden go away all of you or i shall shoot at you i trust i said bowing that the seсor will pardon us for disturbing him in his slumber but this matter could not be settled without some noise may i offer the seсor my serape the air is chilly and he will catch cold in that dress thank you he said putting on the serape and now perhaps you will explain why you come to spoil my garden by making a battlefield of it then i told him and was astonished to see that as i went on he grew very angry i suppose that i must thank you gentlemen for saving my life he said at last though i never asked you to do it but all the same i think it shameless that you should have had this fight in my own garden without giving me the opportunity of sharing it caramba am i a little girl that i should be treated in such a way and of a sudden he burst out laughing and shook me by the hand that day when all the trouble was over and the place had been made tidy the seсor strickland sent a man to ask if i would do him the pleasure to dine with him i accepted and as we sat smoking after dinner having talked of the fight till we were tired of it he spoke thus to me don ignatio i owe you my life and believe me i am grateful for i do not see why you should have risked so much for a foreign stranger i did it because i like you seсor i answered also because it is very pleasant to catch the wicked in their own toils those who perished this morning were villains every one of them they came in the hope of plunder for such men without shame will murder human beings for five dollars a head but they were set on by others who hate you because you treat your indian workmen fairly and also because they do not wish foreigners here to compete with them and think that you are but the first bird of the flock therefore they thought that it would be good policy to kill you so as to frighten away others who might follow however that danger has gone by and you need have no more fear for they have learnt a lesson which they will not forget so much the better then he answered for i have troubles enough to deal with here without being bothered to protect my life against such contemptible vermin and now don ignatio i hardly like to ask you and i daresay that you will think the offer beneath contempt but are you willing to accept an engagement i am sadly in need of a submanager one who could control the indians and to such a man i am prepared to pay a hundred dollars a month the funds of the company i represent will not allow me to offer more i thought for a while and answered seсor the money is not enough to tempt me though it will serve to buy food lodging and cigars but i accept your offer for the same reason that i fought your battles this morning because i like you and will gladly do my best to serve you and your interests still i must warn you for aught i know i may have to leave your service at short notice for my time is not altogether my own i also am the servant of a great company seсor and though now i am on leave as it were and have been for these many years i may be required at any moment thus it was then that i entered the service of the seсor james strickland or rather of his company in which i continued for something more than a year working very hard for the seсor did not spare either me or himself but as the records of those months of fruitless labour could have little interest for you my friend instead of writing of them i will tell you in few words what was the history of this englishman as he told it to me he was of noble blood as might be seen in his face for he had a right to be addressed as honourable which it would seem means more in england than it does here nevertheless his father was a priest of the heretic church and quite poor though how this came about you being an englishman will understand better than i seeing that in most countries it is the privilege of nobles to enrich themselves at the expense of others of less rank at any rate when james stricklands father died his son who was then a lad of twenty found that he possessed in the world no more than five thousand dollars this sum being of adventurous mind and sanguine temperament he invested in a ranch in texas where he endured much danger and hardship and lost all his money after this experience having nothing to live on and no friends he was obliged to labour with his hands like a peon and this he did in many ways he broke horses he herded cattle once even for two months he sank so low it makes me angry to write of it as to be forced to wait upon the guests in an inn at panama thence he drifted to nicaragua and became mixed up in mining ventures and when i first met him he had been a miner for ten years most of this time he spent managing a mine for an american in the chontales country on the frontier of honduras where the fever is so bad that few white men can live here it was that he learned to speak spanish and the indian or maya tongue at length after an attack of fever which nearly killed him he left honduras and came to mexico where he accepted the management of this silver mine at cumarvo hitherto it had been worked by a mexican on behalf of its owners who dismissed the rogue for stealing the ore and selling it this mine though very rich was hard to deal with profitably because of the water gathered in it and all the months that the seсor strickland had been its captain he was employed in driving a tunnel upwards from a lower level in the cliff in order to drain the workings shortly after i came into his service this tunnel was finished for now i was able to obtain plenty of labour which before he had lacked and we began to bring to bank ore running as high as two hundred ounces to the ton so that for some months all went well then of a sudden the ore body dipped straight downward as though it had been bent over when hot and we followed it till the water increased so much that we were unable to carry it out for in those days there were no steam pumps in mexico such as are now used for the drying of mines first we tried to strike another vein but without success then we attempted to pierce a second drainage tunnel at a still lower level but after more than three months labour the rock became so hard that we were obliged to abandon the task now there was nothing to be done except to stop work at the tunnel and report the matter by letter to the owners of the mine employing ourselves meanwhile in the smelting of such ore as we had stacked this indeed we needed to do in order to pay wages with the silver seeing that after the first few months the owners ceased to remit us money one evening on returning from the smeltingworks to the house i found the seсor strickland his chin resting on his hand and an unlighted cigar in his mouth seated at a table on which lay an open letter all through our misfortunes and heavy labour he had never lost heart or forgotten to smile and be merry but now he looked sad as a man who has just buried his mother and i asked him what evil thing had happened nothing particular ignatio he answered but listen here and he read the letter aloud it was from one of the owners of the mine and this was the purport of it that the shaft had become choked with water because of the incompetence and neglect of the seсor that they the owners hereby dismissed him summarily refusing to pay him the salary due and lastly that they held him responsible in his own person for such money as they had lost surely i cried in wrath when he had finished this letter was written by a man without shame and i pray that he may find his grave in the stomachs of hogs and vultures for i forgot myself in my indignation against those that could speak thus of the seсor who had slaved day and night in their service giving himself no rest do not trouble ignatio he said with a little smile it is the way of the world i have failed and must take the consequences had i succeeded there would have been a different story still i think that if ever i meet this man again i will kick him for telling lies about me do you know ignatio that with the exception of one thousand dollars which remain to my credit in mexico i have spent all my own money that i had saved upon this mine and of that thousand dollars eight hundred are due to you for back pay so whatever trade i take to next i shall not begin as a rich man be silent i beg of you seсor i answered for such words make my ears burn what am i also a thief that i should rob you you who have already been plucked like a fowl for the good of others insult me once more by such thoughts and i will never pardon you and i left the house to calm myself by walking among the mountains little knowing what i should hear before i entered it again chapter iii the summons as i walked down the street of the village i met my friend with whom i had stayed when first i came to cumarvo ah lord he said for those who are initiated among the indians give me this title when none are by i was seeking you the scroll has been found what scroll that picturewriting about the ancient mine which brought you here you remember that he who owned the document died and his son could not discover its whereabouts well yesterday he found it by chance while he was hunting rats in the roof of his house and brought it to me here it is and he gave me a roll wrapped in yellow linen good i answered i will study it tonight and continued my walk thinking little more about the matter for my mind was full of other things the air was pleasant and the evening fine so that i did not return to the house till the moon rose as i passed up the path a man stepped so suddenly from the shelter of a bush in front of me that i drew my machete thinking that he meant to do me a mischief stay your hand lord said the man saluting me humbly and at the same time giving the sign of brotherhood it is many years since we met so perchance you may have forgotten me still you will remember my name i am molas your fosterbrother then i looked at him in the moonlight and knew him though time had changed us both and putting my arms round him i embraced him seeing that he had been faithful when many deserted me and i loved him as today i love his memory what brings you here molas i asked when last i heard of you you were dwelling far away in chiapas a strange matter business of the heart o lord of the heart which i deemed so pressing that i have journeyed over land and sea to find you have you a place where i can speak with you alone follow me i said wondering and led him to my own chamber where i gave him food and drink for he was weary with travel now set out this business i said first show me the token lord i desire to see it once more for a purpose of my own i rose and closed the shutters of the window then i bared my breast revealing the ancient symbol for a while he gazed upon it and said it is enough tell me lord what is the saying that has descended with this trinket the saying is molas that when this half that i wear is reunited with the half that is wanting then the indians shall rule again from sea to sea as they did when the heart was whole that is the saying lord we learn it in the ritual that is called opening of the heart do we not and in this ritual that half which you wear is named day since it can be seen and that half which is lost is named night since though present it is not seen and it is told to us that the day and the night together will make one perfect circle whereof the centre is named the heart of heaven of which these things are the symbol is it not so it is so molas good now listen that which was lost is found the half which is named night has appeared in the land for i have seen it with my eyes and it is to tell you of it that i have travelled hither speak on i said lord yonder in chiapas there is a ruined temple that the antiguos built and to that temple have come a man and a woman his daughter the man is old and fierceeyed a terrible man and the girl is beautiful exceedingly there in the ruins they have dwelt these four months and more and the man practises the art of medicine for he is a great doctor and has wrought many cures though he takes no money in payment for his skill but food only now it chanced lord that my wife whom i married but two years ago was very sick so sick that the village doctor could do nothing for her therefore the fame of the old indian who dwelt in the ruined temple having reached me i determined to visit him and seek his counsel or if possible to bring him to my home when my wife heard of it she said it was of no use as she saw death sitting at the foot of her bed still i kissed her and went leaving her in charge of the padre of the village and some women her sisters with me i took a lock of her hair and some fowls and eggs as a present to the lacandone for they said that though of our race this doctor was not a christian starting before the dawn i travelled all day by the river and through the forest till at evening i came to the ruined temple which i knew and began to climb its broken stair as i neared the top a man appeared from beneath the leaning arch that is the gateway of the stair and stood gazing at the ball of the setting sun he was an aged man clad in a linen robe only very light in colour with long white beard and hair a nose hooked like a hawks beak and fierce eyes that seemed to pierce those he looked upon and to read their most secret thoughts greeting brother he said speaking in our own tongue but with a strange accent and using many words which are unknown to me what brings you here then he looked at me awhile and asked slowly say brother are you sick at heart now lord when i heard those words whereof you know the meaning i was so astounded that i almost fell backwards down the ruined stair but recovering myself i tried him with a sign and lo he answered it then i tried him with the second sign and the third and the fourth and so on up to the twelfth and he answered them all though not always as we use them then i paused and he said you have passed the door of the sanctuary enter brother and draw on to the altar but i shook my head for i could not next he tried me with various signs and strange words that have to do with the inmost mysteries but i was not able to answer them though at times i saw their drift you have some knowledge he said yet you do but stand at the foot of the pyramid whereas i watch the stars from its crest warming my hands at the eternal fire none of my order have more lord i answered save the very highest then there are higher in the land he asked eagerly but started suddenly and looking round went on without waiting for an answer you are in sorrow child of the heart and have come from one who was sick to the death to your business and perchance we will speak of these matters afterwards first lord i said i have brought an offering and i set down the basket at his feet gifts are good between brethren he replied moreover in this barren place food is welcome come hither daughter and take what this stranger brings as he spoke a lady came forward through the archway dressed like her father in a white robe of fine fabric but somewhat worn i looked at her and it is truth lord that for the second time i went near to falling for so great was the loveliness of this girl that my heart turned to water within me never before had i seen or even dreamed of such beauty in a woman to your tale molas to your tale what has the fashion of a womans beauty to do with the business of the heart i broke in angrily i do not know lord he answered and yet i think that it has to do with all earthly things then he continued the lady whose name was maya looked at me carelessly and took the basket following her through the archway to the terrace beyond i set out the matter of my wifes illness to the doctor or rather to him who passes as a doctor and who is named zibalbay or watcher praying that he would come to the village and minister to her he listened in silence then took the lock of hair that i had brought with me and going to a fire that burned near by he laid some of the hair upon an ember and watched it as it writhed and shrivelled away it would be of little use brother he said sadly seeing that your wife is now dead i felt her spirit pass us as we talked together in the gateway still until i burnt the hair i did not know whether it was she who went by or another here i may tell you lord that as i found afterwards my wife departed at that very hour of sunset though whether the doctor zibalbay guessed that she must die then from the symptoms which i described to him or whether he has the spirit sight and saw her i do not know still it seems natural that at that moment of her passing she should come to bid farewell to the husband whom she loved though i think it is a bad omen for me and i pray that i may never see that place again at the least when i heard him speak thus i did not doubt his truth for something within me confirmed it but i hid my face and groaned aloud in the bitterness of my grief then taking my hand zibalbay the watcher spoke great words to me in a solemn voice that seemed to soothe me as the song of a mother soothes a restless child for he talked with certainty as one who has knowledge and vision of those who have gone beyond telling me that this parting was not for long and that soon i should find her whom i had lost made glorious and folded close to the heart of heaven then he laid his hand upon my head and i slept awhile to wake sad indeed but filled with a strange peace food is ready my brother said zibalbay eat and rest here this night tomorrow you can return now when we had eaten zibalbay spoke to me in the presence of his daughter who though a woman is also of the order saying you are of our brotherhood therefore the words i speak will be repeated to none who are not brethren for i speak upon the heart i hear with the ears lord i answered listen he went on i come from far with this maiden my daughter and we are not what we seem but who and what we are now is not the hour to tell this is the purpose of our coming to find that which is one but divided that which is not lost but hidden perchance brother you can point the path to it and he paused and looked at me with his piercing eyes now lord i understood to what his words had reference for are they not part of the ritual of the service opening of the heart still because i desired to be sure and not commit myself i picked up a piece of burnt wood and as though in idleness bent down and by the light of the fire i drew the half of a heart with a sawlike edge upon the pavement of the chamber where we sat then i handed the stick to zibalbay who took it and passed it on to his daughter saying i have no skill at such arts finish it maya she smiled and kneeling down traced the half of a face within the outline that i had drawn saying is it enough or do you need the writing also it is enough i answered now lord what do you desire i desire to know where that which is hidden can be brought to light and if it dwells in this land for i have journeyed far to seek it it dwells here i answered for i have beheld it with my eyes and he guards it who is its keeper can you lead me to him brother no for i have no such commands but perhaps i can bring him to you though i must journey by sea and land to find him that is if he wills to come say what message shall i give that a stranger whom i have met desires to look upon the holy symbol it will scarcely bring him so far nay tell him that the hour is come for night and day to be joined together that a new sun may shine in a new sky i can tell him this but will he believe it seeing that i have no proof will he not rather think that some cunning stranger and false brother lays a plot to trap him give me proofs lord or i do not start upon this errand will he believe that which you have seen with your eyes he will believe it for he has trusted me from childhood then look said the man and opening his robe at the neck he kneeled down in the light of the fire there lord upon his breast hung that which has been hidden from our sight since the sons of quetzal the god ruled in the land the counterpart of the severed symbol which is upon your breast that is all my story lord now i ignatio listened amazed for the thing was marvellous did the man send me no further message i asked none he said that if you were a true keeper of the mystery you would come to learn his mission from himself or bring him to you and did you tell him anything of me and my history molas nothing i had no such command on the morrow at dawn i left to bury my wife if she were dead or to nurse her if she still were sick saying that so soon as might be i would travel to the city of mexico to seek out the keeper of the heart and give him this tidings and that within eight weeks or less i trusted to report how i had fared the old man asked me if i had money and without waiting to be answered he gave me two handfuls of lumps of melted gold from a hide bag whereof each lump was stamped with the symbol of the heart let me see one i said alas my lord ignatio i have none not far from the ruined temple where this zibalbay and his daughter sojourned is the hacienda of santa cruz and there as you may have heard dwell a gang of men under the leadership of one don pedro moreno who are by profession smugglers highway robbers and murderers though they pretend to earn a living by the cultivation of coffee and cocoa as it chanced in journeying homewards i fell into the hands of some of these men they searched me and finding the lumps of gold in my pocket handed them over to don pedro himself who rode up when he saw that they had the fish in their net he examined the gold closely and asked me whence it came at first i refused to answer whereupon he said that i should be confined in a dungeon at the hacienda until such time as i chose to speak then being mad to get back to my village and learn the fate of my wife i found my tongue and spoke the truth saying that the gold was given in exchange for food by an old indian doctor who dwelt with his daughter in a ruined temple in the forest mother of heaven said don pedro i have heard of this man before but now i know the kind of merchandise in which he trades i think that i must pay him a visit and learn what mint it was stamped at then having plucked me bare as a fowl for the oven they let me go without hurt but often i have sorrowed because in my hour of haste and need i told them whence the gold came since i fear lest i should have let loose these villains upon the old wanderer and his daughter and in that case they may well be murdered before ever you can reach them doubtless heaven will protect them i answered though you acted foolishly but tell me molas how did you find me out and come here without money i had some money at home lord and when i had buried my wife i travelled to frontera on the coast where i found a ship bound for vera cruz and in her i sailed giving my service as a sailor which is a trade that i have followed from vera cruz i made my way to mexico and reported myself to the head of the brotherhood in that city who as i expected was able to give me tidings of you then i came on to this village and arrived here tonight having been a month and two days on my journey and now lord if you can give me a place to sleep in since i am weary who for three days have scarcely shut my eyes tomorrow you can let me know what answer i must bear to the old man zibalbay i ignatio sat late that night pondering over these tidings which filled me with a strange hope could it be that my hour of success was at hand after so many years of waiting if there were truth in prophecies it would seem so and yet my faith wavered this traveller whom molas had seen might be a madman and his symbol might be forged i could not tell but at least i would put the matter to the proof for tomorrow or so soon as was possible i would journey down to chiapas and seek him out thinking thus i threw myself upon my bed and strove to sleep but could not then remembering the scroll that my friend had given me i rose purposing to change my thoughts in studying it and so win sleep it was a hard task but at length i mastered its meaning and found that it dealt with a mine near cumarvo and described the exact position of the mouth of the tunnel this mouth it would appear had been closed up in the reign of guatemoc and the scroll was written by the cacique who had charge of the mine in those days in order that a record might remain that would enable his descendants to reopen it should a time come when the spaniards were driven from the land that the mine was very rich in free gold was shown by the weights of pure metal stated in this scroll to have been sent year by year to the court of montezuma by this cacique and also by the fact that it was thought worth hiding from the spaniards early on the morrow i went to the room of the seсor strickland and spoke to him with a heavy heart seсor i said you will remember that when i entered your service i told you that i might have to leave it at any moment now i am here to say that the time is come for a messenger has arrived to summon me to the other end of mexico upon business of which i may not speak and tomorrow i must start upon the journey i am sorry to hear it ignatio he answered for you have been a good friend to me still you do well to separate your fortunes from those of an unlucky man and you seсor do ill to speak thus to me i answered with indignation still i forgive you because i know that at times when the heart is sore the mouth utters words that are not meant listen seсor when you have eaten your breakfast will you take a ride with me certainly if you like but whither do you wish to ride to another mine that is or should be about two hours on horseback from here in a valley at the foot of yonder peak i only heard of it last night though i came to cumarvo to seek it and it would seem that it was very rich in montezumas day in montezumas day he said yes it was last worked then and i propose that if we can find it and it looks well that you should denounce it for yourself giving a reward of a few dollars to the indian from whom i had the information who is a poor man but if it is so good why dont you denounce it ignatio and how did you come to hear about it after all these years for two reasons seсor first because i wish to do you a service if it is in my humble power and secondly because i cannot look after it and must leave you though to do so will be a true grief to me for if you will permit me to say it never have i met a man for whom i conceived a greater respect and affection perhaps if i return again you will give me a share in the profits so that we may grow rich together and now i will show you how i came to hear of the mine and i fetched the scroll with the translation which i had made and read it to him he listened eagerly for like yourself seсor jones your countryman james strickland loved adventure and all things that have to do with the past of this ancient land let us go at once he said when i had finished i will order the horses and a mule with the prospecting kit to be got ready shall we take men with us i think not seсor the mine is not yet found and the less talk there is about it the better for if the matter is noised abroad somebody may be before you in denouncing it the messenger who came to see me last night is a trusty man but he is weary with journeying and rests so we will go alone an hour later we were riding among the mountains i having left a message for molas to say that i should return before dark the trail which we were following was a difficult one and ran for some miles along the edge of a precipice till it reached the crest of the range indeed so bad was it in parts that we were forced to dismount and drive the horses and mule before us while we followed clinging to the ferns and creepers on the rocks to keep ourselves from falling at length we came to the summit of the range and turned downwards through a forest of oak and fir trees heading for a valley that lay at the base of a solitary mountain peak along which ran a stream down this stream we rode a mile or more since i was searching for a certain pointed rock that was mentioned in the scroll as standing by itself on the slope of a mountain where no trees grew beneath which should be the glen where in the days of guatemoc was a great ceiba tree that so said the writing overshadowed the mouth of the mine riding uphill through a dense grove of oaks we came presently to the glen that lay just below the slope whereon stood the tall rock this must be the place i said but i see no ceiba tree doubtless it has fallen and rotted since those days answered the seсor strickland let us tether the horses and search this we did and the hunt was long for here grasses and ferns grew thick but at length i discovered a spot where the trunk of a very ancient tree had decayed in the ground so that nothing remained except the outline of its circle and some of the larger roots round about these roots we sought desperately for an hour or more but without avail till at length my companion grew weary of the sport and went to pull up a small glossyleaved palm that he had discovered purposing to take it home and set it in his garden for he was a great lover of plants and flowers while he was thus engaged and i toiled amongst the grasses looking for the mouth of the mine which as i began to think was lost forever suddenly he called out come here ignatio beneath the roots of this palm is refuse rock that has been broken with hammers i believe that this must have been the platform in front of the mine one can see that the ground was flat here i came to him and together we renewed our search till at length by good luck we discovered a hole immediately beneath a rock large enough for a man to creep into was this made by a coyote or is it the mouth of the mine the seсor asked that we can only find out by entering it i answered doubtless when they shut down the mine the antiguos would have left some such place as this to ventilate the workings bring the pickaxe seсor and we will soon see for ten minutes or more we laboured working in soft ground with pick and spade till we bared the side of a tunnel which i examined there is no need to trouble further i said this rock has been cut with copper chisels for here is the green of the copper without doubt we have found the mouth of the mine now give me the hammer and candles and bring the leather bag for samples and we will enter chapter iv the legend of the heart when i had gone a few paces down the hole it widened suddenly so that we were able to stand upright and light our candles now there was no doubt that we were in the tunnel of an old mine a rudelydug shaft that turned this way and that as it followed the windings of the ore body along this tunnel we went for thirty or forty paces creeping over the fallen boulders and twisting ourselves between the brown stalactites that in the course of ages had formed upon the roof and floor till presently we reached an obstacle that barred our further progress a huge mass of rock which at some time or other had fallen from the roof of the tunnel and blocked it i looked at it and said now seсor i think that we shall have to go back you remember the writing tells us that this mine although so rich was unsafe because of the rottenness of the rock doubtless they propped it in the old days but the timbers have decayed long ago yes he answered we can do nothing here without help and ignatio i dont like the look of the roof it is full of cracks as these last words left his lips a piece of stone the size of a childs head fell from above almost at his feet speak softly i whispered the ring of your voice is bringing down the roof then i stooped to pick up the fallen stone thinking that it might show ore and as i did so my hand touched something sharp which i lifted and held to the candle it was the jawbone of a man yellow with age and corroded by damp i showed it to the seсor and kneeling down we examined the bed of the tunnel together and not uselessly for there we found the remainder of the skull and some fragments of an armbone but the rest of the skeleton lay under the great boulder in front of us he was coming out of the mine when the rock fell upon him poor fellow whispered the seсor look here and he pointed to a little heap of something that gleamed in the candlelight it was free gold six or seven ounces of it almost pure and for the most part in small nuggets that once were contained in a bag which had long since rotted away doubtless after the mine was closed some aztec who knew its secret had made a practice of working there for his own benefit till one day as he was coming out the rock fell upon him and crushed him leaving his spirit to haunt the place for ever there is no doubt about this mine being rich whispered the seсor but all the same i think that we had better get out of it i hear odd noises and rumblings which frighten me come ignatio and he turned to lead the way towards the opening two paces farther i saw him strike his ankle against a piece of rock that stood up some six or eight inches from the floorbed of the tunnel and the pain of the blow was so sharp that forgetting where he was he called out loudly the next instant there was a curious sound above me as of something being torn and lo i lay upon my face on the rock and upon me rested a huge mass of stone i say that it rested upon me but this is not altogether true for had it been so that stone would have killed me at once as a beetle is killed beneath the foot of a man instead of taking more than twoandtwenty years to do it the greater part of its weight was borne by the piece of rock against which the seсor had struck his leg a point of the fallen boulder only pressing into my back and grinding me against the ground now we were in darkness for the seсor had been knocked down also and his candle extinguished and in the midst of my tortures it came into my mind that he must be dead presently however i heard his voice saying ignatio do you live ignatio now i thought for a moment even in my pain i remembered that more of the roof would surely give ere long and that if my friend stayed here he must die with me nothing could save me i was doomed to a slow death beneath the stone and yet if i told him this i knew that he would not go therefore i answered as strongly as i could fly seсor i am safe and do but stay to light a candle i will follow you you are lying to me he answered your voice comes from the level of the floor and as he spoke i heard the scratching sound of a match so soon as he had found his candle and lit it he knelt down and looked at me then he examined the roof above and following his glance with difficulty i saw that next to the hole whence the boulder had fallen hung a huge block of stone that surrounded by great cracks from which water dropped trembled like a leaf whenever he moved or spoke for the love of god fly i whispered in a few hours it will be over with me and you cannot help me i am a dead man do not stop here to share my fate for a moment he seemed to hesitate then his courage came back to him and he answered hoarsely we entered this place together friend and we will go out together or not at all you must be fixed by the rock and not crushed or you would not speak of living for hours let me look and he lay upon his breast and examined the fallen rock by the light of the candle thank god there is hope he said at last the boulder rests on the ground and upon the stone against which i struck my leg for only one point of it is fixed in your back do you think that anything is broken ignatio i cannot say seсor my pain is great and i am being slowly crushed to death but i believe that as yet my bones are whole fly i beg of you i will not he answered sullenly i am going to roll this rock off you then lifting with all his strength he strove to move the stone but without avail for it was beyond the power of mortal man to stir it and all the while the black mass trembled above his head i must go for help he said presently yes yes seсor i answered go for help for i knew well that before he could return with any more of the roof would have fallen shutting me in to perish by inches or perhaps crushing the life out of me in mercy then i remembered and added stay a moment before you go you are noble i will give you something feel here round my neck there is a little chain now draw it over my head so you see a token hangs to it if ever you are in trouble with the indians take their chief man apart and show him this and he will die for you if need be englishman by this gift i have made you heir to the empire of the aztecs in the heart of every indian and the master of the great brotherhood of mexico molas the messenger will tell you all and bring you to those who can initiate you bid him lead you whither he would have led me farewell and god go with you tell the indians how i died that they may not think that you have murdered me to these words of mine the seсor made no answer but thrust the token into his pocket without looking at it like one who dreams then taking the candle with him he crept forward down the tunnel and vanished and my heart sank as i saw him go leaving me to my dreadful fate without a word of farewell doubtless he is too frightened to speak i thought and it is right that he should fly as quickly as possible to save his life now as i was soon to learn i was doing the seсor a bitter wrong in my mind seeing that he never dreamed of deserting me but went to find a means of rescue as he told me afterwards when he reached the mouth of the tunnel he could think of no way by which i might be saved since these mountains were uninhabited and it would take several hours to bring men from cumarvo outside the mine he sat himself down to consider what could be done but no thought came for it was impossible to use the strength of the horses in that narrow place then he sprang up and looked round him in despair close to him was a little ravine hollowed by water and on its very edge grew a small mimosa thorn of which the long roots had been washed almost bare by a flood he saw it and an inspiration entered into him with the help of a lever he might be able to do a feat to which his unaided strength was not equal springing at the little tree that being of so tough a wood was the best possible for his purpose he tore it from such roothold as remained to it a few strokes with his heavy huntingknife trimmed off the branches and fibres and soon he was creeping carefully up the tunnel dragging the trunk after him when he had gone some twenty paces he heard another fragment of the roof fall and so he said in his story was minded to fly he had but just escaped from a horrible end the end that generations ago overtook the poor aztec and it was awful to brave it again he knew that his chances of being able to rescue me were few indeed whereas those that he would perish miserably in the attempt were many then he remembered what my sufferings must be if i still lived and how his own conscience would reproach him in the after years should he leave me to my fate and he went on now he could see that the halfdetached mass of the roof still hung it was a smaller fragment which had fallen one nearer to the entrance he could see also that i lay in the same position beneath the rock and he thought that i was dead because i neither moved nor spoke though in fact i had but swooned under the agony of my suffering are you dead he whispered and i heard his voice through my sleep and lifting my head looked up at him astonished for i had never thought to see him again do i behold a spirit i said or is it you come back it is i ignatio and i have brought a lever now when i lift struggle forward if you can then he placed the trunk of the thorntree in what seemed to him the best position and put all his strength upon it it was in vain even so he could not stir the rock try a little more to the right i said faintly there is a better hold he shifted the lever and dragged at it till his muscles cracked and i felt the stone tremble as its bulk began to rise if you can help ever so little it will come he gasped then in my despair though the anguish of it nearly killed me i set my palms upon the ground and contracting myself like a snake that is held with a forked stick thrust upwards with my back till the point of the stone was raised to the height of eight or ten inches from the ground for a moment and one only it hung there next instant the lever slipped and down it came again but i had taken my chance for clinging to the floor with my fingers so soon as my back was free with a quick movement i dragged myself a foot or more forward then the point of rock that had been lifted from my spine fell again but this time it struck the ground between my thighs now he seized me by the arms and tore me free though i left one of my long boots beneath the stone i strove to rise but could not because of the hurt to my back you must carry me seсor i said he glanced at the mass that trembled above us then giving me the candle he lifted me from the ground like an infant and staggered forward down the tunnel perhaps we had gone some seven or eight paces not more when there was a dreadful crash behind us the roof had fallen in and the spot which we occupied some thirty seconds before was now piled high with rocks oh i said cracks are showing in the stone above us and he rushed forward till we found ourselves outside the mine now i bowed my head and returned thanks for my escape then lifting it i looked my preserver in the face and said i swear by the name of god seсor that he never made a man nobler than yourself the next instant i fell forward and fainted there among the ferns ten days had passed since i was carried from the mouth of that accursed mine back to cumarvo in a litter and during all this time i had suffered much pain in my back and been very ill so ill indeed that i was scarcely allowed to speak with anyone now however i was much better and one afternoon the seсor strickland assisted by my fosterbrother molas lifted me from my bed into a hammock by the way ignatio said the seсor when molas had gone i never gave you back this charm of yours what a strange trinket it is he added taking it from his neck and what did you mean by your talk in the tunnel about its making me heir to the empire of the aztecs in the heart of every indian and the rest of it i suppose that you were delirious with pain and did not know what you were saying is the door shut seсor i asked and are you sure that there is no one on the verandah good then draw your chair nearer and i will tell you something i am not certain that i should take this talisman back again still i will do so for reasons which you shall learn presently know seсor that this broken gem is at once the foundationstone and the secret symbol of a great order of which although you have not been initiated into it you are now one of the lords seeing that the crowning and vital ceremony of the creation of a lord of the heart consists in the hanging of the symbol about his neck for the space of a minute only by myself who am the chief lord and keeper of the heart for life and you have worn it for ten whole days before we part i will call a chapter of the order for even among these mountains we have brethren and you shall be initiated into its ritual and raised to the rank of a chief lord as is your right meanwhile i will instruct you briefly in its mysteries as it is my bounden duty to do understand seсor that the first duty of the servant of the heart is silence and that silence i demand of you men have died ere now seсor yes they have died on the rack in the dungeons of the inquisition and shrivelled as wizards in the fires of the stake sooner than reveal those things that have been told them upon the faith of the heart against which the confessional itself cannot prevail no not with the best of catholics but suppose that a man should not keep silence ignatio what then he asked there is a land seсor i answered where the most talkative grow dumb and its borders can be crossed by all even by the lords of the heart for fearful is the doom of a false brother you mean that if i repeat anything i may hear i shall be murdered indeed no seсor but you may happen to die i speak on the heart do you hear with the ears i hear with the ears he answered catching my meaning very well seсor since you have now sworn secrecy to me by the most solemn oath that can pass the lips of man i will speak to you openly this is the tale of the broken heart so far as i know it though how much of it is truth and how much is legend i cannot say you have heard the story of that white man or god sometimes called quetzal by the indians and sometimes cucumatz who came to these lands in the far past and civilised their peoples afterwards he vanished away in a ship promising that when many generations had passed he would return again when he had gone the empire which he created fell into the hands of two brothers whose chief city was either at palenque or in its neighbourhood and the citizens of this empire like we christians worshipped one good god the true god under the name of the heart of heaven and to him they offered few sacrifices save those of fruit and flowers now one of these brothers married a wife from another country a daughter of devils very beautiful and a great witch soon this woman as in the story of the wives of solomon and their lord drew away the king her husband from the true faith to the worship of the gods of her own land and brought it about that he offered human sacrifice to them then there arose a great confusion in that country and the end of it was that the people divided themselves into two parties the worshippers of the heart of heaven and the worshippers of devils they made war upon each other till many of their chief men were killed then they came to an agreement whereby the nation was sundered half of it under that king who had married the woman marched northwards and became the fathers of the aztecs and other tribes and half the faithful worshippers of the heart remained in the tobasco country now from that day forward evil overtook both these peoples for though the aztecs flourished for a while in the end spaniards despoiled them the worshippers of the heart also were driven from their cities by hordes of barbarians who rolled down upon them and their faith perished or seemed to perish but what has this history to do with the charm about your neck ignatio he asked i will tell you when quetzal sailed away from his people so says the legend he left the stone that once he had worn upon his brow of which this is the half to be a treasure to the kings who came after him also he set this fate upon it that while the heart remained unbroken for so long should the people be one and whole but if it came about that it was cut or shattered they should be divided with it to be no more one people until again the fragments were one stone now when these kingbrethren quarrelled and parted they sawed the token asunder as you see each of them keeping a half this half being that of him who married the woman for generations it was worn by his descendants and upon their deathbeds passed on by them to another or at times taken from their bodies after they were dead there are many stories told about the stone in the old days and it is certain that he who had it was the real king of the country for the time being at length it came into the hands of the great guatemoc last of the aztec emperors who before the spaniards hung him found means to send it to his son from whom it has come down to me to you what have you to do with guatemoc i am his lineal descendant seсor the eleventh in the male line then you ought to be emperor of the indians if every man had his rights ignatio that is so seсor but of my own story i will tell you presently now of this stone through all the ages it has never been lost and it is known in the land from end to end he who wears it for his life being called keeper of the heart and also hope of those who wait since it may happen in his day that the two halves will come together again and what if they do then so says the legend the indians will once more be a mighty nation and drive those who oppress them into the sea as the wind drives dust now the seсor rose from his chair and walked up and down the room do you believe all this he asked suddenly yes i answered or the greater part of it indeed if what i hear is true the lost half of the talisman that has been missing for so many generations is in mexico at this moment and so soon as i am well enough i go to seek him who bears it and who has come from far to find me that is why we must part seсor where has this man come from he asked eagerly i do not know for certain i answered but i think that he has come from the sacred city of the indians the hidden golden city which the spaniards sought for but could not find though it still exists among the mountains and deserts of the far interior whither i hope to journey with him that still exists ignatio you must be mad it never has existed except in the imagination you say so seсor but i think differently at least i knew a man whose grandfather had seen it he the grandfather was a native of san juan batista in tobasco and when he was young he committed some crime and fled inland to save his life all that befell him i do not know but at length he found himself wandering by the shores of a great lake somewhere in or beyond the country that is now known as guatemala and being exhausted he laid himself down to die there and fell asleep when he awoke people were standing round him like the indians to look at but very light in colour and beautifully dressed in white robes with necklaces of emeralds and feather capes these people put him on board a great canoe and took him to a glorious city with a high pyramid in the centre of it which was named heart of the world of this city he saw little however for its inhabitants kept him a prisoner only from time to time he was brought before their king and elders who sat in a hall filled with images of dead men fashioned in gold and there was questioned as to the country whence he came the tribes that dwelt in it and more especially of the white men who ruled the land in that hall alone so he said there were more gold and precious stones than are to be found in all mexico when he had nothing more to tell them the people wished to kill him fearing lest he should escape and bring upon them the white men who loved gold the end of it was that he did escape by the help of a woman who guided him back towards the sea though she never came there for she died upon the road afterwards this man went to live in a little village near palenque where he also died having revealed nothing of what he had seen since he feared lest the vengeance of the people of the heart should follow him when he was dying he told his son who told his son who told the tale to me seсor it has been the dream of my life to visit that city and now at last i think that i have found the clue which will lead me to it why do you want to visit it ignatio to understand that seсor you must know my history and i told him of the failure of the great plot and the part that i had played in it all of which i have already set out also of the secret hopes and ambitions of my life seсor i added though i am beaten i am not yet crushed and i still desire to build up a great indian empire i see by your face that you think me foolish you may be right or i may be right i may be pursuing truths or dreams i may be sane and a redeemer or insane and a fool what does it matter i follow the light that runs before me willothewisp or star it leads to one end and for me it is the light that i am born to follow if you believe nothing else at least believe this seсor that i do not seek my own good or advancement but rather that of my people at the worst i am not a knave i am only a fool but how will you help your cause by visiting this city supposing it to exist ignatio thus seсor these people among whom without doubt the old man of whom i have spoken who is named zibalbay is a chief or king are the true stock and head of all the indian races and when they learn my plans and whom i am they will be glad to furnish me with means whereby i can bring them to their former empire and if they take another view of the matter ignatio then i fail that is all and among so many failures one more will scarcely matter i am like a swimmer who sees or thinks that he sees a single plank that may bear him to safety maybe he cannot reach that plank or if he reach it maybe it will sink beneath his weight at least he has no other hope seсor i have no other hope there in the golden city is untold wealth for the man saw it and without money great sums of money i am helpless therefore i go thither to win the money the ship has foundered under me and with it the cargo of my ambitions and the work of my life so being desperate i fall back upon a desperate expedient first i will seek this man that the two halves of the heart may come together and the prophecy be fulfilled then if it may be i will travel with him to the city heart of the world careless whether i live or die but determined if there is need to die fighting for the fulfilment of the dream of an indian empire christian regenerated and stretching from sea to sea that i have followed all my days the dream ignatio perhaps you name it well yet few have such noble dreams and now who goes with you on this journey who goes with me molas as far as the temple where the indian is after that if i proceed no one who would accompany a man grown old in failure whom even those that love him deem a visionary on such a desperate quest why if i should dare to tell my projects even men would mock me as children mock an idiot in the street i go alone seсor perhaps to die as regards the dying ignatio of course i can say nothing since all men must die sooner or later and the moment and manner of their end is in the hand of providence but for the rest you shall not make this journey alone that is if you care to have me for a companion for i will accompany you you seсor you think what it means the certainty of every sort of danger the risk of every kind of death and at the end the probability of failure it is folly seсor ignatio he answered i will be frank with you notwithstanding all the prophecies about the wonders that are to follow the reuniting of the heart and the messages from the old man in the temple i think your scheme of building up an indian empire greater than that which cortez destroyed as impracticable as it is grand since the time has gone by when it could have been done or perhaps it has not yet returned before the indians can rule again they must forget the bitter lessons and the degradation of ages in short they must be educated ignatio still if you think otherwise that is your affair you can only fail and there are failures more glorious than most successes do you understand me perfectly seсor very well and now as regards the search for this golden city to me the matter seems very vague since your hopes of finding it are based upon a travellers tale told by a man who died seventy or eighty years ago and the chance that a certain person whom you have not yet seen has come from there and is willing to guide you back to it still the prospect of hunting for that city pleases me for i am an adventurer in my heart if ever we get further than the forest country in tobasco where your friend with the token is waiting for you our search will probably end in the leaving of our bones to decorate some wilderness or mountain top in the unknown regions of guatemala but what of that i have no chick or child my death would matter nothing to any living soul for years i have worked hard with small results why should i not follow my natural bent and become an adventurer i can scarcely do worse than i have done and i think that the way of life would suit me that mine you showed me is rich enough no doubt but i have no capital to deal with it and if i had my experience of the place was such that i never wish to set foot in it again in short i am ready to start for tobasco and the sacred city and wherever else you like so soon as you are fit to travel do you swear that on the heart seсor i asked by all means but i should prefer to give you my hand upon it and he stretched out his hand which i took good you swear on the heart and give me your hand the oath is perfect we are comrades henceforth seсor for my part i ask no better one i have nothing more to say i cannot promise that you will find this city or that if you find it it will advantage you i am an unlucky man and it is more likely that by yoking yourself with me you will bring my misfortunes upon your head this i swear however that i will be a true comrade to you as you were to me yonder in the mine and for the rest the adventure must be its own reward chapter v the beginning of the quest something more than a month from the day when the seсor strickland and i made our compact to search for the secret city of the indians we found ourselves together with molas at vera cruz waiting for a ship to take us to frontera where we proposed to disembark this port we had chosen in preference to campeche although the latter was nearer to the ruins where we hoped to find the indian zibalbay because from it we could travel in canoes up the grijalva and other rivers unobserved by any save the natives things are changed now in these parts but in those days the white men who lived thereabouts beyond the circle of the towns were too often robbers as molas had found to his cost some few weeks before at vera cruz we purchased such articles as were necessary to our journey not many for we could not be sure of finding means to carry them among them were hammocks three guns that would shoot either ball or shot with ammunition as many muzzleloading colts revolvers the best that were to be had twenty years ago some medicines blankets boots and spare clothes also we took with us all the money that we possessed amounting to something over fifteen hundred dollars in gold which sum we divided between us carrying it in belts about our middles at vera cruz where people are very curious about the business of others we gave out that the seсor strickland was one of those strange englishmen who love to visit old ruins for which purpose he was travelling to yucatan that i ignatio was his guide and companion and that molas my fosterbrother was our servant now we purposed to leave vera cruz by a fine american vessel a sailing ship that after touching at the ports along the coast traded to havana and new york as it chanced the departure of this ship was delayed for a week so being pressed for time and fearing lest we should catch the yellow fever that was raging in the town unhappily for ourselves we took passage in a mexican boat called the santa maria she was an old sailing vessel of not more than two hundred and fifty tons burden that had been converted by her owners into a paddlewheel steamer with the result that except in favourable weather she could neither sail nor steam with any speed or safety her business was to trade with passengers and cargo between vera cruz and the ports of frontera and campeche where for asked the agent of the seсor strickland as he filled in the tickets frontera he answered your boat stops there does she not oh certainly seсor he said as he pocketed the dollars and yet all the while this shameless rogue knew that she had orders to touch at campeche which is the furthest port first and return to frontera a week later but of this more in its place that afternoon the santa maria with us on board of her was piloted out of the harbour of vera cruz and we heard the pilot swearing because she would not answer properly to her helm standing by the engines we noticed also that though they had not been working for more than half an hour it was found necessary to keep a stream of water in constant play upon the bearings the seсor asked the reason of this of the man who was mate and engineer of the boat and he answered with a shrug that sand had got into the machinery when she was steaming over the bar of the grijalva river but that he thought the bearings should it please the saints would last this voyage unless they had the bad luck to run into a norther as you english call el norte the fearful gales that in certain seasons of the year sweep over the gulf of mexico and if we run into a norther he asked whereupon the man made a grimace crossed himself to avert the omen and vanished down the stokehole now we began to feel sorry that we had not taken passage in the american ship since of late northers had been frequent but as for good or ill we were on board the santa maria we amused ourselves by studying our fellowpassengers of these there were several on board perhaps twenty in all mexican landowners and officials returning to their haciendas and native towns after a visit to vera cruz or the capital some of them pleasant companions enough and others not so three or four of these gentlemen were accompanied by their wives but the ladies had already retired to the bunks opening out of the cabin where although the sea was quite smooth they could be heard suffering the pains of sickness among the passengers was one a man of not more than thirty years of age who particularly attracted our attention because of the gorgeousness of his dress in appearance he was large handsome and coarse and he had indian blood in his veins as was shown by the darkness of his colour and the thick black eyebrows that gave a truculent expression to his face while i was wondering who he might be molas made a sign to me to come aside and said you see yonder man with the silver buttons on his coat he is don josй moreno the son of that don pedro moreno who waylaid and robbed me of the nuggets which the old indian gave me for the cost of my journey to find you i heard at the time that he was away from the hacienda in vera cruz or mexico and now doubtless he returns thither beware of him lord and bid the englishman to do the same for like his father he is a bad man and he told me certain things connected with him and his family while molas was talking a bell had rung for dinner but i waited till he had finished before going down at the door of the cabin i met the captain a stout man with a face like a full moon and a bland smile what do you seek seсor he asked my dinner seсor i answered it shall be sent to you on the deck he said not without confusion i do not wish to be rude seсor but you know that these mexicans i am a spaniard myself and do not care hate to sit at meat with an indian so if you insist upon coming in there will be trouble now i heard and though the insult was deep it was one to which i was accustomed for in this land which belongs to them and where their fathers ruled to be an indian is to be an outcast therefore not wishing to make a stir i bowed and turned away meanwhile it seems that the seсor strickland missing me in the cabin asked the captain where i was saying that perhaps i did not know that the meal was ready if you refer to your servant the indian said the captain i met him at the door and sent him away surely the seсor knows that we do not sit at table with these people captain answered the seсor strickland if my friend is an indian he is as good a gentleman as you or anybody else in this cabin moreover he has paid for a firstclass fare and has a right to firstclass accommodation i insist upon a seat being provided for him at my side as you wish answered the captain smiling for he was a man of peace only if he comes there will be trouble and he ordered the steward to fetch me now this steward was an indian who knew my rank therefore not wishing to offend me by repeating what had passed he said simply that the captain sent his compliments and begged that i would come down to dinner the end of it was that i went though doubtfully and seeing me in the doorway the seсor strickland called to me in a loud voice saying you are late for dinner friend but i have kept your place here by me sit down quickly or the food will be cold i bowed to the company and obeyed and then the trouble commenced for all present had heard this talk as i took my seat the mexicans began to murmur and the passenger who was next to me insolently moved his plate and glass away now almost opposite to me sat don josй moreno that man of whom molas had told me as i took my seat he consulted hastily with a neighbour on his right then addressing the captain said in a loud voice there is some mistake it is not usual that indian dogs should sit at the same table with gentlemen the captain shrugged his shoulders and answered mildly perhaps the seсor will settle the question with the english seсor on my left to me it does not matter i am only a poor sailor and accustomed to every sort of company seсor strickland said don josй be so good as to order your servant to leave the cabin seсor he answered for his temper was quick i will see you in hell before i do so caramba said the mexican laying a hand upon the knife in his belt you shall pay for that englishman when and how you will seсor i always pay my debts then the captain broke in in a strange way first he put a hand behind him and drawing a large pistol from his pocket he laid it by his plate seсors both he said in a soft voice and with a gentle smile i am loth to interfere in a quarrel of two esteemed passengers but though i am only a poor sailor it is my duty to see that there is no bloodshed on board this vessel therefore much as i regret it i shall be obliged to shoot dead the first man who draws a weapon and he cocked the pistol now the mexican scowled and the seсor strickland laughed outright for it was a curious thing to hear a man with the face of a sheep growl and threaten like a wolf meanwhile i had risen for this insult was more than i could bear seсors i said speaking in spanish as i see that my presence is unwelcome to the majority of those here i hasten to withdraw myself but before i go i wish to say something not by way of boasting but to justify my friend the english gentleman in his action on my behalf however wellborn you may be my descent is nobler and more ancient than yours and therefore it should be no shame to you to sit at table with me least of all should the don josй moreno whose father is a murderer a highway robber and a man without shame and whose mother was a halfbred mestiza slut dare to be insolent to me who as any indian on board this ship can tell you am a prince among my own people now every eye was fixed upon don josй his sallow complexion turned to a whitish green as he listened to my words and for a moment he sank back in his chair overcome with rage then he sprung up once more gripping at his knife you dog he gasped let me but come at you and ill cut your lying tongue out you will do nothing of the sort don josй moreno i answered fixing my eyes upon his face what i have said of your father is true more there is a man on board this ship whom not three months since he robbed with violence if the gentlemen your companions would like to hear the story i can tell it to them for the rest i am well able to defend myself moreover this vessel is manned by indians who know me and should any harm come to me or to my friend the seсor strickland i warn you that you will not reach your home alive gentlemen i salute you and i bowed and left the cabin friend i thank you i said to the seсor when he came upon deck after the dinner was ended knowing who i am and seeing how in common with my race i am accustomed to be treated by such hounds as these can you wonder that i am not fond of mexicans no ignatio he answered but all the same i advise you to be careful of this don josй he is not a man to kiss the stick that beats him and he will make an end of you and me too for the matter of that if he can do not be afraid seсor i answered laughing besides the steward and molas there are twenty indians on board most of them belonging to the tribe that dwells beyond campeche the finest race in mexico two of these men are associates of the heart and all the rest know my rank and will watch that man day and night so that he can never come near us without finding them ready for him only we shall do well to sleep on deck and not below that night we spent wrapped in our serapes upon two coils of rope on the forecastle of the santa maria with molas sleeping close behind us it was a lovely night and we whiled away the hours in telling tales to each other of our adventures in past years and in wonderings as to those that lay before us till at length fearing nothing for we knew that our safety was watched over we fell asleep to be awakened by the sudden stoppage of the vessel the day was on the point of dawn a beautiful and pearly light lay upon the quiet surface of the sea above us the stars still shone faintly in the heavens but to the east the cloudbanks were tinged with pink and violet we sat up wondering what had happened and saw the captain wrapped in a dirty blanket engaged in earnest conversation with the engineer who wore a still dirtier shirt and nothing else hearing that something was wrong the seсor james went to the captain and asked him why we had stopped because the engines wont go any more and there is no wind to sail with he answered politely but have no fear my comrade says that he can mend them up he has nursed them for years and knows their weak points certainly there is not much to fear in weather like this said the seсor except delay nothing nothing replied the captain glancing anxiously at a narrow black band of cloud that lay on the rim of the horizon beneath the fleecy masses in which the lights of dawn were burning do you think that we are likely to have a norther asked the seсor in his blunt white mans way no no exclaimed the captain crossing himself at the name of that evil power el norte but quien sabe god makes the weather not we poor sailors and with another glance at the threatening line of cloud he hurried away as though to avoid further conversation presently the engines began to work again though haltingly like a lame mule and as the morning drew on the day became clear and the thin black cloud vanished from the horizon towards three oclock in the afternoon molas pointing to a low coastline and a spot on the sea where the ocean swell showed tipped with white told us that yonder was the bar of the grijalva river and that behind it lay the village of frontera our destination good said the seсor then i think that i will get my things on deck and going to his cabin he brought up a sack containing some wraps and food why do you fetch your baggage asked the captain presently you may want it tonight that is why i brought it up he answered i do not wish to land at frontera with nothing land at frontera seсor no one will land at frontera from this ship for another six or seven days we pass frontera and run straight on to campeche which by the blessing of the saints we shall reach tomorrow evening but i have taken a ticket for frontera said the seсor the agent gave them to me and i insist upon being put on shore there that is quite right seсor all being well we shall call at frontera this day week and then you can go ashore without extra charge but before this my orders are to put into no port except campeche that is unless a norther forces me to do so may the norther sink you your ship your agents and every thing you have to do with answered the seсor in so angry a voice that the mexican passengers who were listening began to laugh at the englishmans discomfiture though the more thoughtful of them crossed themselves to avert the evil omen then followed a storm for the seсor whose temper as i have said was not of the coolest raged and swore in no measured terms the captain shrugged his shoulders and apologised the passengers smiled and seeing that there was no help for the matter i looked on patiently after the manner of my race at length the captain fled wiping his brow and exclaiming what manner of men are these english that they make such a trouble about a little time mother of heaven why are they always in a hurry is not tomorrow as good as today and better that evening we dined together upon deck for neither of us were in any good mood to descend to the cabin and meet don josй moreno of whom we had seen nothing since the previous night as we were finishing our meal the light faded and the sky grew curiously dark while suddenly to the north there appeared a rim of cloud similar to that which we had seen upon the horizon at dawn but now it was of an angry red and glowed like the smoke from a smeltingfurnace at night the sky looks very strange ignatio said the seсor to me and at that moment we heard molas and an indian sailor speaking together in brief words el norte said moras pointing towards the red rim of light si el norte answered the sailor as he went towards the cabin presently the captain hurried up the companionladder and studied the horizon of which the aspect seemed to frighten him in another minute the mate joined him appearing from the engine hatch and the two of them began to converse or rather to dispute i was sitting near unobserved in the darkness and so far as i could gather the mate was in favour of putting the ship about and running for frontera from which port we were now distant some forty miles on the other hand the captain said that if they did so and the norther came up it would catch them before they got there and wreck them upon the bar of the grijalva river but he added that he did not believe there would be any norther and if by illluck it should come their best course was to stand for the open sea and ride it out the mate answered that this would be an excellent plan if the ship were staunch and the engines to be relied on but he declared loudly that they might as well try to sail a boat with a mast made of cigarettes as to attempt to lie head on to a norther with leaking boilers wornout engines and a strained paddlewheel after this the discussion grew fierce and as full of oaths as a sharks mouth with teeth but in the end the two sailors determined that their safest plan would be to hold on their present course and if necessary round point xicalango and take shelter behind carmen island or if they could in the mouth of the usumacinto river then they parted the captain adjuring the mate to say nothing of the state of the weather to the passengers and above all to that accursed englishman who had called this misfortune upon them because he was not put off at frontera and whose evil eye brought bad luck another two hours passed without much change except that the night grew darker and darker and stiller and yet more still the seсor strickland who had been walking up and down the deck smoking a cigar came and sat beside me on a coil of rope and asked me if i thought the norther was coming yes it is coming i answered and i fear that it will sink us at least so say the indian sailors you take the idea of being drowned like a puppy in a sack very coolly ignatio how far are we from point xicalango about twelve miles i believe and i take it coolly because there is no use in making an outcry god will protect us if he chooses and if he chooses he will drown us it is childish to struggle against destiny a true indian creed ignatio he answered you people sit down and say it is fate let us accept it but one that i and the men of my nation do not believe in if they had done so instead of being the first country in the world today england long ago would have ceased to exist for many a time she has stood face to face with fate and beaten her for my part if i must die i prefer to die fighting tell me are any of these people to be relied on if it comes to a pinch the indian sailors are campeche men and brave also they know the coast and if need be they will do anything that i tell them for the rest i cannot say but the captain seems to understand something of his business look and listen as i spoke a vivid patch of lightning pierced the heavens above us followed by a deafening peal of thunder in its fierce and sudden glare we could see the coast some three or four miles away and almost ahead of us the bolder outline of point xicalango the water about our ship was dead calm and slipped past her sides like oil the smoke in the funnel rose almost straight into the air where at a certain height it twisted round and round and a sail that had been hoisted flapped to and fro for lack of wind to draw it a mile or so to windward however was a different sight for there came the norther rushing upon us like a thing alive in front of it a line of white billows torn from the quiet surface of the sea and behind it fretted by little lightnings a dense wall of black cloud stretching from the face of ocean to the arc of heaven now the captain who was on deck saw his danger for if those billows caught us broadside on we must surely founder in the strange silence that followed the boom of the thunder he shouted to the helmsman to bring the ship head on to the sea and to the sailors to batten down the afterhatch the only one that remained open shutting the passengers except ourselves and molas into the cabin his orders were obeyed well and quickly the santa maria came round and began to paddle towards the open water and the advancing line of foam it was terrible to see her so small a thing driving on thus into what appeared to be the very jaws of death now the unnatural quiet was broken a low moaning noise thrilled through the air the waters about the ships side began to seethe and hiss and spray flying ahead of the ship cut our faces like the lash of a whip a few more seconds and something white and enormous could be seen looking above our bows and the sight of it caused the captain whose face looked pale as death in the gleam of the lightnings to shriek another order to his crew lie down and hold on tight to the rope i said to the seсor strickland and molas who were beside me here comes el norte and he brings death for many of us on board this ship chapter vi el norte another moment and el norte had come in strength first a sudden rush of wind struck the vessel causing her to shiver and with a sharp report rending from its fastenings the jib which had not been furled this gust went howling by and after it rolled the storm to us it seemed that the santa maria dived head first into a huge wave a level line of white illumined with lightnings and swept forward by the hurricane for in an instant a foot of foaming water tore along her deck from stem to stem sweeping away everything movable upon it including two indian sailors we should have gone with the rest had we not clung with all our strength to the rope coiled about the foremast but as it was we escaped with a wetting for a while the ship stood quite still and it seemed as though she were being pressed into the deep by the weight of water on her decks but as this fell from her in cataracts she rose again and ploughed forward fortunately the first burst of the tempest was also the most terrible and it had not taken her broadside on for one or two more such waves would have swamped us after it had passed shorewards driven by the hurricane wind for a little space there was what by comparison might be called a lull then the santa maria met the full weight of the norther for a while she forged again against the shrieking wind and vast succeeding seas shipping such a quantity of water that presently the captain found it necessary to reduce her engines to half speed which it was hoped would suffice to give her way without filling her now less water came aboard but on the other hand as was soon evident the vessel began to drift towards the point xicalango and from this moment it became clear that only a miracle could save her for an hour or more the santa maria kept up a gallant and unequal fight being constantly pressed backwards by the might of the storm till at length we could see in the glare of the lightning that the breakers of the point were raging not two hundred paces from her stern the captain saw them also and made a last effort shifting the vessels bow a little so that the seas struck her on the port quarter he gave the order of full steam ahead and once more we drove forward before and since that day i have made many voyages across the gulf of mexico in all weathers but never have i met with such an experience as that which followed the ship plunged and strained and rocked lifting now her bow and now her stern high above the waves till it seemed as though she must fall to pieces while water in tons rushed aboard of her at every dip which as she righted herself streamed through the broken bulwarks slowly very slowly we were forging away from the point and out into the channel which lies between it and carmen island but the effort was too fierce to last presently after a succession of terrible pitchings one paddlewheel suddenly ceased to thrash the water while the other broke to pieces and a faint cry from below told those on deck that the wornout machinery had collapsed now we were in the midrace or channel through which the boiling current driven by the fury of the gale and the push of the tide tore at a speed of fifteen or sixteen knots carrying the santa maria along with it as a chip of wood is carried down a flooded gutter twice she whirled right round for now that her machinery had gone there was no power to keep her head to the waves and on the second occasion as she lay broadside to them a green sea came aboard of her that swept her decks almost clean taking away with it every boat except the cutter which fortunately was slung upon davits to starboard and out of its reach crouching under shelter of the mast again the three of us clung to our ropes nor did we leave go although the water ground us against the deck covering us for so long that before our heads were clear of it we felt as though our lungs must burst as it chanced what remained of the starboard bulwarks was carried away by the rush allowing the sea to escape or the ship must have foundered at once but it had done its work for the engineroom hatchway and the cabin light were stove in and the santa maria was half full of water before a second sea could strike her her nose swung round and in this position she was washed along the race her deck not standing more than four feet above the level of the waves now from time to time the moon shone out between rifts in the storm clouds revealing a dreadful scene fragments of the little bridge still remained and to them was lashed the large body of the captain in an upright position though as he neither spoke nor stirred we never learned whether he was only paralysed by terror or had been killed by a blow from the funnel as it fell you will remember my friend that he had ordered the passengers to be battened down and there in the cabin they remained twenty or more of them until the hatchways were stove in then with the exception of one or two who were drowned by the water that poured down upon them they rushed up the companion men and women together for they could no longer stay below and shrieking praying and blaspheming clung to fragments of the bulwarks shrouds of the mast or anything which they thought could give them protection against the pitiless waves awful were the wails of the women who clad only in their nightdresses now quitted their bunks for the first time since they entered them in the harbour of vera cruz overcome by fear and having no knowledge of the dangers of the deep these poor creatures flung themselves at full length upon the deck striving to keep a hold of the slippery boards whence one by one they rolled into the ocean as the vessel lurched or were carried away by the seas that pooped her some of the men followed them to their watery grave others more selfpossessed crept forward attempting to escape the waves that broke over the stern but none made any effort to save them and indeed it would have been impossible so to do among those who crawled forward to where we and some of the indian sailors were clinging to the rope that was coiled round the stump of the broken foremast was don josй moreno even in his terror which was great this man could still be ferocious for recognising the seсor he yelled ah maldonado evilgifted one you called down the norther upon us well at least you shall die with the rest and suddenly drawing his long knife he rose to his knees and holding the rope with one hand attempted to drive it into the seсors body with the other doubtless he would have succeeded in his wickedness had not an indian boatswain who was near bent forward and struck him so sharply on the arm with his clenched fist that the knife flew from his hand in trying to recover it don josй fell face downwards on the deck where he lay making no further effort at aggression afterwards the seсor told me such was the horror and confusion of the scene that at the time he scarcely noticed this incident though every detail came back to him on the morrow and with it a great wonder that even when death was staring them in the face the indians did not forget their promise to watch over our safety meanwhile swept onward by the tide and gale the santa maria waterlogged and sinking rushed swiftly to her doom our last hour was upon us and for a space this knowledge seemed to benumb the mind of the seсor strickland who crouched at my side as the wet and cold had benumbed his body nor was this strange for it seemed terrible to perish thus can we do nothing he said to me at length ask the indians if there is any hope putting my face close to the ear of the boatswain i spoke to him then shouted back he says that the current is taking us round the point of the island and if the ship weathers it we shall come presently into calmer water where a boat might live if there is one left and it can be launched he thinks however that we must sink when the seсor heard this he hid his face in his hands and doubtless began to say his prayers as i did also soon however we ceased even from that effort for we were rounding the point and once more the seas were breaking on and over the vessels side for a few minutes there was a turmoil that cannot be described then although the wind still shrieked overhead we felt that we were in water which seemed almost calm to us the ship no longer pitched and rolled she only rocked as she settled before sinking while the moon shining out between the clouds showed that what had been her bulwarks were not more than two or three feet above the level of the sea six indians our three selves don josй who seemed to be senseless and the body of the captain lashed to the broken bridge alone remained of the crew and passengers of the santa maria the rest had been swept away but there close to us the cutter still hung upon the davits the seсor saw it and i think that he remembered his saying of a few hours before that he would die fighting at least he cried the ship is sinking to the boat quick and running to the cutter he climbed into her as did i molas and the six indian sailors she was full of water almost to the thwarts which could only be got rid of by pulling out the wooden plug in her bottom happily the boatswain that same man who had struck the knife from the hand of don josй knew where to look for this plug and being a sailor of courage and resource he was able to loose it so that presently the water was pouring from her in a stream thick as a hawser meanwhile urged to it by the hope of escape the other indians were employed in getting out the oars and in loosening the tackles before slipping them altogether when enough water had run out to allow the boat to swim get the plug back said the seсor the vessel is sinking you must bale the rest half a minute more and it was done then at a word from the boatswain the sailors lowered away they had not far to go and we were afloat and better still quite clear of the ship scarcely had they brought the head of the cutter round and pulled three or four strokes when from the deck of the santa maria there came the sound of a mans voice crying for help and by the light of the moon we discovered the figure of don josй moreno clinging to the broken bulwarks that now were almost awash for the love of god come back to me he screamed the oarsmen hesitated but the boatswain said with an indian oath pull on and let the dog drown it seemed as if don josй heard him at least he raised so piteous a wailing that the seсors heart which was always overtender was touched by it we cannot desert the man he answered put back for him he tried to murder you just now shouted the boatswain and if we go near the ship she will take us down with her then he turned to me and asked do you command us to put back lord since the seсor wills it i command you i answered we must save the man and take our chance he commands whom we must obey shouted the boatswain again put back my brothers sullenly but submissively the indians backed water till we lay almost beneath the counter of the vessel that wallowed in the trough of the swell before she went down on the deck clinging to the stays of the mast stood don josй his straight oiled hair beat about his face his gorgeous dress was soaked and disordered save me he yelled hoarsely save me throw yourself into the sea seсor and we will pick you up i dare not was the answer come aboard and fetch me does the seсor still wish us to stay asked the boatswain calmly listen you cur shouted the seсor the ship is sinking and will take us with it at the word three give way men now will you come or not one two i come said the mexican and driven to it by desperation he cast himself into the sea with difficulty the seсor assisted by an indian with a boathook succeeded in getting hold of him as he was washed past on the swell i confess that i would have no hand in the affair since may i be forgiven the sin my charity was not true enough to make me wish to save this villain there however the matter rested for the present as they could not stop to pull him into the boat for just then the deck of the santa maria burst with a rending sound and she began to go down bodily row for your lives shouted the boatswain and they rowed dragging don josй in the wake of the cutter down went the santa maria bow first making a hollow in the sea that sucked us back towards her for a moment the issue hung doubtful for the whirlpool caused by the vanished vessel was strong and almost engulfed us but in the end the stout arms of the indians conquered and drew our boat clear so soon as this great danger had gone by the sailors with much labour lifted don josй into the cutter where he lay gasping but unharmed then arose the question of what we could possibly do to save our lives we were lying under the lee of carmen island which sheltered us somewhat from the fury of the norther and we might either try to land upon this island or to put about and run for the mouth of the usumacinto river there was a third course to keep the boats head to the seas if that were possible and let her drift till daylight in the end this was what we determined to do indeed while we were discussing the question it was settled for us for suddenly the rain began to fall in torrents blotting out such moonlight as there was and to land in this darkness would have been impossible even if the nature of the beach allowed of it therefore we lay to and gave our thoughts and strength to the task of preventing the waves which became more and more formidable as we drifted beyond the shelter of the island from swamping or oversetting us it was a great struggle and had it not been that the heavy rain beat down the seas we could never have lived till morning as it was we must have been swamped many times over but for the staunchness of the boat which fortunately was a new one and the seamanship and ceaseless vigilance of the indian boatswain who commanded her for hour after hour he crouched in the bow of the cutter staring through the sheets of rain and the darkness with his hawklike eyes and shouting directions to the crew as he heard or caught sight of a whitecrested billow rolling down upon us that presently would fling us upwards to sink deep into the trough on its further side sometimes half filling the boat with water which must be baled out before the next sea overtook us afterwards the seсor told me that knowing it to be the nature of indians to submit to evil rather than to struggle against it he wondered how it came about that these men faced the fight so gallantly instead of throwing down their oars and suffering themselves to be drowned i also was somewhat astonished till presently the matter was explained for once when a larger sea than those that went before had almost filled us the boatswain called out to his companions be brave my brothers and fear nothing the keeper of the heart is with us and death will flee him to the seсor however this comfort seemed cold since he did not believe that any talisman could save us from the powers of the sky and sea nor indeed did i wet and half frozen as he was his nerve broken by the terrible scenes that we had witnessed upon the lost ship and by thoughts of the many who had gone down with her his spirit so he told me failed him at last he gave no outward sign of his inward state indeed he did not follow the example of the mexican who lay in the water at the bottom of the boat groaning weeping and confessing his sins which seemed to be many only he sat still and silent and surrendered himself to destiny till by degrees his forces mental and bodily deserted him and he sank into a torpor it was little wonder for rarely have shipwrecked men been in a more hopeless position the blinding rain the bewildering darkness the roaring wind and sea all combined to destroy us while we drifted in our frail craft we knew not whither as minute after minute of that endless night went by our escape seemed to become more impossible for each took with it something of the strength and mental energy of those who fought so bravely against the doom that overshadowed us for my part i was sure that my hour had come but this did not trouble me overmuch since my life had not been so happy or successful that i grieved at the thought of losing it moreover ever since i became a man it has been my daily endeavour to prepare my mind for death and so to live that i should not have to fear the hour of his coming in truth it seems to me that without such preparation the life of any man who thinks must be one long wretchedness seeing that at the last strive as he may fate will overtake him and that there is no event in our lives which can compare in importance with the inevitable end we live not to escape from death but in order that we may die this is the great issue and object of our existence still death is terrible more especially when we are called upon to await him hour after hour amid the horror and turmoil of a shipwreck therefore i was very thankful when having flung my serape about the form of my friend at length i also was overcome by cold and exhaustion and after a space of time in which the present seemed to fade from me taking with it all fears and hopes of the future and the past alone possessed me peopled by the dead i sank into unconsciousness or swoon how long i remained in this merciful state of oblivion i do not know but i was roused from it by molas who shook me and called into my ear with a voice that trembled with cold or joy or both awake awake we are saved saved i said confusedly what from from death in the sea look lord then with much pain for the salt spray had congealed upon my face like frost i opened my eyes to find that the morning was an hour old and though the skies were still leaden we were no longer at sea but floated on the waters of a river whereof the bar roared behind us where are we i asked in the usumacinto river thanks be to god answered molas we have been driven across the bay in the dark and at the dawn found ourselves just outside the breakers somehow we passed them safely and there before us is the blessed land i looked at the bank of the river clothed with reeds and grasses and the noble palmtrees that grew among them then i looked at my companions the seсor strickland lay as though he were dead beneath the serape that i had thrown over him his head resting on the thwarts but the mexican don josй was sitting up in the bottom of the boat and staring wildly at the shore as for the indians the men to whom we owed our lives they were utterly worn out two of them appeared to have swooned where they sat and i saw that their hands were bleeding from the friction of the oars three others lay gasping beneath the seats but molas held the tiller at my side and the boatswain still sat upright in the bow where he had faced death for so many dreadful hours say lord he asked turning his face that was hollow with suspense and suffering and white with encrusted salt to speak to me can you row if so take the oars and pull us to the bank while molas steers for our arms will work no more then i struggled from my seat and with great efforts for every moment caused me pain i pulled the cutter to the bank and as her bows struck against it the sun broke through the thinning clouds so soon as the boat was made fast molas and i lifted the seсor from her and laying him on the bank we removed his clothes so that the sun might play upon his limbs which were blue with cold as the clouds melted and the warmth increased i saw the blood begin to creep beneath the whiteness of his skin which was drawn with the wet and wind and rejoiced for now i knew that he did but sleep and that the tide of life was rising in his veins again as in my own whilst we sat thus warming ourselves in the sunlight some indians appeared belonging to a rancho or village half a league away on learning our misfortunes and who we were these men hurried home to bring us food having first pointed out to us a pool of sweet rainwater of which we stood in great need for our throats were dry when they had been gone nearly an hour the seсor awoke and asked for drink which i gave him in the balingbowl next he inquired where we were and what had happened to us when i had told him he hid his face in his hands for a while then lifted it and said i am a fool and a boaster ignatio i said that i would die fighting and it is these men who have fought and saved my life while i swooned like a child i did the same seсor i answered only those who were working at the oars could keep their senses for labour warmed them somewhat come to the river and wash for now your clothes are dry again and throwing the serape over his shoulders i led him to the water as we climbed down the bank we met the boatswain and the seсor said holding out his hand to him you are a brave man and you have saved all our lives no seсor not i answered the indian you forget that with us was the keeper of the heart and the heart that has endured so long cannot be lost this we knew and therefore we laboured on well assured that our toil would not be in vain i shall soon begin to believe in that talisman of yours myself ignatio said the seсor shrugging his shoulders certainly it did us good service last night then he washed and by the time he had dressed himself women arrived from the rancho bearing with them baskets laden with tortillas or meal cakes frijole beans a roast kid and a bottle of good agua ardiente the brandy of this country on these provisions we fell to thankfully and before we had finished our meal the alcalde or head man of the village presented himself to pay his respects and to invite us to his house now i whispered to molas who had some acquaintance with this man to take him apart and discover my rank to him and to learn if perchance he had any tidings of that stranger whom we came to visit the doctor zibalbay he nodded and obeyed and after a while i rose and followed him behind some trees where the alcalde who was of our brotherhood greeted me with reverence i have news my lord said molas this man says that he has heard of the old indian and his daughter and that but this morning one who has travelled down the river told him how some five or six days ago they were both of them seized by don pedro moreno the father of don josй yonder and imprisoned at the hacienda of santa cruz where dead or alive they remain now i thought a while then sending for the seсor james i told him what we had learnt but what can this villain want to do with an old indian and his daughter he asked the seсor forgets said molas that don pedro robbed me of the gold which the doctor gave me and that in my folly i told him from whom it came doubtless he thinks to win the secret of the mine whence it was dug and of the mint where it was stamped with the sign of the heart also there is the daughter whom some men might value above all the gold in mexico now lord i fear that your journey is fruitless since those who become don pedros guests are apt to stay with him for ever that i think we must take the risk of said the seсor yes i answered having come so far to find this stranger we cannot turn back now at least we have lived through worse dangers than those which await us at santa cruz chapter vii the hacienda returning to the place where we had eaten we found the alcalde talking with the sailors as to their plans on seeing us the boatswain advanced and said that if it was our pleasure he and his companions proposed to rest for a few days at the neighbouring rancho and then to row the boat along the coast to campeche which they hoped in favourable weather to reach in sixty hours adding that he trusted we would accompany them i answered that we wished for no more of the sea at present and that we intended to pursue our journey to the town of potrerillo where we could refit before undertaking an expedition to the ruined cities of yucatan the boatswain said it was well though he was sorry that they could not escort us so far as it was their duty to report the loss of the ship to its owner who lived at campeche when we heard this the seсor unbuckled the belt of money which he wore about his waist and pouring out half a handful of gold pieces he begged the boatswain to accept of them for division between himself and his companions all this while don josй was sitting close to us watching everything that passed and i saw his eyes brighten at the sight of the belt of gold you are fortunate to have saved so much he said speaking for the first time all that i had has gone down with the ship yes three thousand dollars or more you should have followed our example answered the seсor we divided our cash between the three of us and secured it upon our persons though perhaps you were wise after all since such a weight of gold might have been awkward if like you we had been called upon to swim by the way seсor what are your plans if you will allow me answered the mexican i will walk with you towards potrerillo for my home lies on that road would you be offended seсor if on behalf of my father i ventured to offer his hospitality to you and your companions to speak plainly don josй said the seсor our past experience has not been such as to cause us to desire to have anything more to do with you may i remind you putting aside other matters that last night you attempted to stab me seсor answered the man with every sign of contrition if i did this it was because terror and madness possessed me and most humbly do i beg your pardon for the deed and for any angry and foolish words that i may have spoken before it seсor you saved my life and my heart is filled with gratitude towards you who have thus repaid evil with good i know that you have heard an ill report of my father and to speak truth at times when the liquor is in him he is a bad and violent old man yet he has this virtue that he loves me his son and all those who are kind to me therefore in his name and my own i pray that you will forget the past and accept of our hospitality for some few days or at least until you have recovered from your fatigue and we can furnish you with arms and horses to help you forward on your journey certainly we desire to buy mules and guns answered the seсor and if you think that your father will be able to supply these we will avail ourselves of your kindness and pass a night or two at his hacienda seсor the place is yours and all that it contains don josй answered with much courtesy but as he spoke i saw his eye gleam with an evil fire doubtless i interrupted for i understand that don pedro moreno is famed for his hospitality still in accepting it i venture to ask for a promise of safeconduct more especially as save for our pistols and knives we are unarmed do you wish to insult me seсor don josй asked angrily not in the least seсor but i find it a little strange that you who two nights ago refused to sit at meat with a dog of an indian should now be anxious to receive that same dog into your home have i not said that i am sorry for what is past he answered and can a man do more gentlemen if any evil is attempted towards you in my fathers house i will answer for it with my life that is quite sufficient broke in the seсor especially as in such an event we should most certainly hold you to your bond and now tell me how far is the hacienda from this spot if we start at once we should reach it at sundown he answered that is on foot though it is but three hours ride from the house to the mouth of the river then let us go he said and ten minutes later we were on the road before we went however we bade a warm farewell to the sailors and also to the alcalde of the village all of whom were somewhat disturbed on learning that we proposed to sleep at santa cruz the place has an evil name said the alcalde and it is a home of thieves and smugglers only last week a cargo that never paid duty went up the river they say that don pedro was fathered by the devil in person may the saints protect you from him lord we have business that takes us to his house friend i answered but doubtless it will be easy for you to keep yourself informed of what chances in that neighbourhood and if we should not appear again within a few days perhaps it may please you to advise the authorities at campeche that we are missing the authorities are afraid of don pedro answered the alcalde shaking his head also he bribes them so heavily that they grow blind when they look his way still i will do the best i can be sure of that and as an inglese is with you it is possible that i may be able to get help if necessary our walk that day was long and hot though we had nothing to carry except the clothes on our backs all our possessions having been lost in the ship at noon we halted and the heat being great ate some food that we had brought with us and slept two hours in the shade which sleep was most grateful for we were weary then we rose and tramped on till at length we came within sight of this hacienda where though i little guessed it at the time i was fated to spend so many years of my life walking through a large milpa or corn field that in front of the building which is now planted with coffeebushes we reached the gateway and entered the courtyard where we were met by many fierce dogs which rushed upon us from all sides don josй beat back the dogs that knew him and leaving us under the charge of some halfbreeds he entered the house after a while he returned again and led us through the passages into the dininghall which as you know is the largest room in the hacienda and in former days served as the refectory of the monks several lamps were hung upon its walls for already it grew dark and by their light we saw five or six people gathered round a long table waiting for supper which was being laid by indian girls of these men it is sufficient to say that they were of mixed nationality and villainous appearance turning from them we looked towards the far end of the chamber where a hammock was slung from the beams in the roof in which lay a man whom a handsome girl also an indian was employed in rocking to and fro come and be introduced to my father who expects you said don josй leading the way towards the hammock father here is that brave englishman who saved my life last night and with him the indian gentleman who did not wish to save my life as i told you i have offered them hospitality on your behalf feeling sure that they would be welcome here at the sound of his sons voice don pedro awoke or pretended to awake from his doze and bade the girl cease swinging the hammock then he sat up and looked at us he was a short stout man of about sixty years of age so short indeed that although the hammock was slung low his legs did not touch the floor notwithstanding this lack of stature don pedros appearance was striking while his long carefully brushed white hair gave him a venerable aspect other beauties he had none however for his cheeks were flabby and wrinkled his mouth was cruel and sensuous and his dull eyes which were small half opened and protected from the glare of the lamps by spectacles of tinted glass can best be described as horrible like those of a snake looking at him we could well believe that his reputation was not exaggerated for he bore the stamp of evil on his face still he bowed with much courtesy and addressed the seсor in spanish so you are the englishman who saved my son here from the sinking ship he said in a slow powerful voice peering at us with his fishlike eyes from beneath the coloured glasses he tells me that you rowed back to the side of the foundering vessel merely in order to fetch him well it was a brave deed and one that i should not have dared myself for i have always found it hard enough to keep my own breath in me without attempting to preserve that of other people but as i have seen several times you englishmen are peculiar in these matters foolhardy indeed seсor i am grateful to you and this house and all within it is at your disposal and that of your companions and he glanced with genuine affection at the coarse beetlebrowed man beside him who was gnawing one end of his moustache and staring at us out of the corners of his eyes tell me he added to what do i owe the honour of your presence to an accident don pedro the seсor answered as it chances the ruins of this ancient land interest me much and i was travelling to palenque with my indian friend don ignatio when we were so unfortunate as to be wrecked near your hospitable house in our dilemma we accepted the invitation of your son to visit you in the hope that you may be able to sell us some guns and mules ruins seсor strickland decidedly you englishmen are strange what pleasure can you find in hunting about among old walls built by men long dead unless indeed you seek for treasure there for my part i hate the name of ruins for i have always suffered from a presentiment that i should meet my end among them and that is bad to think of bah and he spat upon the floor there it comes upon me again suddenly as a fit of the ague well he went on you are lucky to have saved your lives and your money and tomorrow we will see about the things that you desire to buy meanwhile you are travelstained and doubtless will wish to cleanse yourself before you eat josй conduct the seсor and his indian friend since he is so fond of his company to their room the abbots chamber supper will be served shortly till then adios girl go with them he added addressing the woman who had been engaged in swinging the hammock water may be wanted and other things the woman bowed and went away and at the door we found her standing lamp in hand to light us down the passage now seсor jones you for whom i write my history have so often slept in the abbots chamber in this house that it is needless for me to stop to describe it except for the furniture the room is just as it was in those days then it was empty save for a few chairs a rough washingstand and two truckle bedsteads of american make which were placed at a little distance from each other on either side of the picture of the abbot i fear that you will think this a poor place after the luxury of mexico gentlemen said don josй but it is our guestchamber the best that we have thank you answered the seсor it will do very well though perhaps your visitors suffer sometimes from nightmare and he glanced at the awful and lifesized picture on the south wall of an indian being burnt at an autodafй while devils hanging above his head dragged the soul from his tortured and expiring body pretty are they not said don josй i would have them whitewashed over but my father likes them you see all the victims are indians there isnt a white man among them and the old man never could bear indians well when you are ready will you come to supper you will not lose the way for you can follow the smell of the food and he left the room one moment i said addressing the girl who was about to accompany him perhaps you will see that our servant and i pointed to molas has some meat brought to him here since your masters will not wish him to sit at table si answered the girl whose name was luisa searching my face with her eyes by this time don josй was through the door which the draught pushed to behind him i watched it close then a thought struck me for i remembered that among our order there are women associates of the outer circle and i whispered some words into luisas ear and made a sign with my hand she started and gave the ancient answer which is taught even to children whereto i replied with another sign that of the presence of the heart where she asked glancing at each of us in turn here i answered and drawing out the symbol i held it before her eyes she saw and made obeisance and at that moment we heard don josй calling her from the further side of the door i come she cried in answer then added in a whisper lord you are in danger in this house i cannot tell you now but if possible i will return the wine is safe but drink no coffee and do not sleep when you lie down search the floor and you will understand the reason i come seсor i come and she fled from the room so soon as the girl was gone the seсor james went to the door and locked it then he returned and said what does all this mean ignatio i did not answer but pushing aside one of the beds i searched the floor beneath it it was discoloured in several places next i pulled the blankets off the beds and examined the webbing that formed the mattresses to discover that this also was stained though slightly for it had been washed then i said men have died in these beds seсor and yonder stains were made by their blood it would seem that the guests of don pedro sleep well first they are drugged then they are murdered and it is for this purpose that we have been lured to the house well we expected nothing else that is a pleasing prospect he answered we are this mans guests surely therefore he will not and he drew his hand across his throat certainly he will seсor and it is to this end that we have been brought here by don josй if others have been murdered it is not likely that we shall escape since don pedro will be sure that an inglese would not travel without a large sum of money moreover we have a quarrel with the son and i know too much about the father again i say that the prospect is a pleasant one answered the seсor on the whole it would have been better to be drowned than to live on to be butchered by those villains in this awful place what an end do not despair i answered we were warned in time and therefore i think shall escape by the help of that girl and the other indians in the place since in an hour every one of them will have learned who we are and be prepared to venture their lives to save us also we came for a purpose knowing our risk now let us make ready and go among these men with a bold face for of this you may be sure that nothing will be attempted till late at night when they think us sleeping have you understood molas yes answered the indian then watch here or in the outer room till we return and should the girl come learn all you can from her as to the whereabouts of the old doctor and his daughter and other matters for when she knows you to be of the order she will speak have you been recognised by anyone i think not seсor when we entered it was too dark for them to see good then keep out of their way if possible do the best you can with the girl and take note of all that passes farewell when we reached the dininghall nine of the company were already seated at the table impatient for their food but don pedro was still sitting in his hammock engaged in earnest conversation with his son josй of those at the table but one was a white man a lanky witheredlooking person with a broken nose whose general appearance filled us with disgust the rest were halfbreeds the refuse of revolutions villains who had escaped the hand of justice and who lived by robbery and murder looking at these outcasts it became clear to us that if once we fell into their power we could expect little mercy at their hands for they would think no more of butchering us in cold blood than does a sportsman of shooting a deer when don pedro perceived us he slid from his hammock to the ground and taking the seсor by the hand he said let me introduce you to my overseer the seсor smith from texas he is an american and will be glad to meet one who can speak english for notwithstanding much practice his spanish is none of the best the seсor bowed and the american desperado spoke to him in english wearing a grin on his face like that of a wicked dog as he did so though i do not know what he said then don pedro conducted his guest to a place of honour at the head of the table that beside his own seat while i was led to another table at a little distance where my meat was served to me alone since as an indian of pure blood i was not thought fit for the company of these crossbred curs don josй having taken his place at the further end of the board with the americano the meal began and an excellent one it was now in the conversation that ensued i took no part except when members of the gang called to me to drink wine with them for they desired to make me drunk but while i pretended to be occupied with my meat i thought much and watched more the talk that passed i set down as i overheard it and as it was reported to me by the seсor try some more of this burgundy said don pedro when the dishes had been removed filling his tumbler for the seventh or eighth time it is the right stuff straight from france though it never paid duty and he winked his leaden eye your health seсor and may you live to do many such brave deeds as that of yesterday when you saved my son from the sea by the way do you know that on board the santa maria they said that you had the evil eye and brought her to wreck yes and your longfaced companion the indian also indeed i never heard of it before answered the seсor with a laugh but if so our evil eyes shall not trouble you for long as we propose to continue our journey tomorrow nonsense friend nonsense you dont suppose that i believe in that sort of rubbish do you we say many things that we do not believe just for a joke thus and he raised his voice so that i could hear him at my table your companion there is he not named ignatio told a story to my disadvantage on board the ship which i am sure that he did not believe and suddenly he stared at me and added insolently is it not so indian if you seek my opinion don pedro i answered leaning forward and speaking very clearly i say that it is unprofitable to repeat words that are said or to remember deeds that are done with if i spoke certain words or if in the past you did certain deeds here beneath your hospitable roof is not the place to recall them quite so indian quite so you talk like an oracle as montezuma used to talk to cortes till the conqueror found a way to teach him plain speaking a great man cortes he understood how to deal with indians then he spat upon the floor and having looked down the table spoke to the seсor in a somewhat anxious voice tell me he said for your sight is better than mine how many are there present here tonight counting my friend thirteen he answered i thought so said our host with an oath and it is too late to mend matters now well may the saints and they should be thick about a monastery avert the omen i see you think me a fool not at all he replied i am rather superstitious myself and dislike sitting down thirteen to table so do i so do i seсor strickland listen last time we dined thirteen in this room there were two travellers here americanos friends of don smith who were trying to open up a trade in these parts they drank more than was good for them and the end of it was that in the night they quarrelled and killed each other yonder in the abbots chamber where you are sleeping poor men poor men there was trouble about the matter at the time but don smith explained to his countrymen and it came to nothing indeed answered the seсor it was strange that two drunken men should kill each other so i say seсor in truth for a while i thought that indians must have got into their rooms and murdered them but it was proved beyond a doubt that this was not so ah they are a wicked people the indians i have seen much of them and i should know now the government wishes to treat them too well our fathers knew better how to deal with them but luckily the arm of the government scarcely reaches here and no whining padres or officials come prying about my house though once we had some soldiers and he cursed at the recollection and drank another glass of burgundy i tell you that they are a wicked people he went on the demonios their fathers worshipped still possess them also they are secret and dangerous there are indians now who know where vast treasures are buried but they will tell nothing yes and suddenly growing excited under the influence of the strong drink he leaned over and whispered into his guests ear i have one such in the house at this moment an old lacandone that is an unbaptised indian not that i think him any the worse for that and with him his daughter a woman more beautiful than the night perhaps if i go on liking you englishman i will show her to you tomorrow only then i should have to keep you for you would never go away beautiful yes she is beautiful though a devil at heart i have not dared to let these little ones see her and he winked and nodded towards the villains at the table but josй is to pay her and her papa a visit tonight and he wont mind her tempers though they frighten me well would you believe it this girl and her old father have the secret of enough treasure to make every man of us here rich as the queen of england how do i know that i know it because i heard it from their own lips but fill your glass and take a cigar and i will tell you the story chapter viii the supper and after listen seсor if you are interested in old ruins and the indians you must have heard tales of races living away in the forest country where no white man has set his foot and of their wonderful cities that are said to be full of gold many say that these tales are lies that no such people and no such cities exist and they say this because nobody has found them but i for my part have always believed there was something in the story seeing that otherwise it would not have lasted so long well a few months back i heard that a strange old indian doctor who was said to have travelled from the far interior was dwelling somewhere in the forest together with a woman but where he dwelt exactly i could not learn nor indeed did i trouble myself to do so about eight weeks ago however it happened that an indian being asked for the toll which i charge all passersby to recoup me for my expense in making roads seсor paid it with a little lump of pure gold having a heart stamped on either side of the metal now you may not know though i do that the heart is a sacred symbol among these indians and has been for many generations for it is to be seen cut upon the walls of their ruins though what it means only satan their master can tell therefore when i saw the lump of gold with the token on it i asked the indian whence he had it and he told me readily enough that it came from this old doctor who gave it to him in payment for some food he told me also where i might find him and went upon his way but his heart being full of deceit he lied as to the place so that i searched in vain well to shorten a long story although to this hour i do not know where the indian was hiding i set a trap for him and caught him ay and his daughter too it was a simple one a man in my pay knew another man who visited the doctor in the forest to get medicine from him but who would not reveal his hidingplace still my servant drew it out of him thus he sent piteous messages through his friend begging the doctor to come and save the life of his dying child which lay in a house near here and could not be moved the end of it was that the doctor came and his daughter with him yes they walked at night straight to the snare into this very house seсor and only discovered their mistake when they found the doors locked upon them and that the dying child was none other than your humble servant don pedro moreno i can tell you seсor that i laughed till i nearly cried at the sight of their faces when they found out the trick though there was nothing to laugh at in them for the man looked like an old king and the girl like a queen quite different from the indians in these parts moreover they were two such serapes as i had never seen made of green feathers fastened to a foundation of linen when the old man found himself caged he asked what it meant and where he was speaking in a dialect so like the maya tongue that i could understand him quite well i told him that he was to be my guest for a while and with the help of two men who were with me i proceeded to secure him and his daughter in a safe place whereat he flew into a fearful rage and cursed all of us most dreadfully and more especially that man who had betrayed him so awful were his curses and the vengeance that he conjured upon us from heaven that my hair stood straight upon my head and as for the man who lured him here under pretence of visiting his child it came about that within two days he died of a sudden sickness bred of his own fears when the second man heard of his companions death he in turn fled from the place dreading lest a like fate should overtake him and has been no more heard of thus it comes about seсor that i alone know where these birds are caged though i hope to introduce my son to them tonight for i dare not trust the others and wish to keep them in the family nor will i let any indians near them well when they had calmed down a little i spoke to my prisoners through a grating telling them that i wished to know whence they had obtained those lumps of gold stamped with a heart to which the old man answered that he had no knowledge of any such gold now i was sure that he lied and took refuge in another trick the cell they were shut up is that in which the old monks imprisoned such as were suspected of heresy and others and close to it is a secret place there are many such in this house seсor where a spy may be hid and both see and hear all that passes in the cell in this place i ensconced myself and lay there for hours with the rats running over me so anxious was i to get at the truth in the end i was not disappointed for they began to talk a great deal of their conversation i could make nothing of but at length the girl said after examining an old gilt crucifix that hung upon the wall look father here also they have gold it is gilt not gold he answered i know the art of it though with us it is not practised except to keep from corruption the spears and arrowheads that fowlers use upon the lake then he added i wonder what that leadenfaced greedyeyed white thief would say if he knew that in a single temple we could show him enough of the metal he covets to fill this place five times over from floor to ceiling hush she said ears may be listening even in these walls let us risk nothing seeing that by seeming to be ignorant alone we can hope to escape well asked the seсor eagerly and what did zibalbay answer i think that you said the old mans name was zibalbay he added trying to recover the slip zibalbay no i never mentioned that name don pedro replied suspiciously and with a sudden change of manner he answered nothing at all next morning when i came to question them the birds had flown it is a pity for otherwise i might have asked the old man if his name is zibalbay i suppose that the indians had let them out but i could not discover why don pedro you said just now that they were still in the house did i then i made a mistake as you did about the name this wine is strong it must have gone to my head sometimes it does a weakness and a bad one it is an odd tale but there it ended so far as i am concerned come seсor take a cup of coffee it is good thank you no answered the seсor i never drink coffee at night it keeps me awake still i beg you to try ours friend we grow it ourselves and are proud of its flavour it is poison to me i dare not he said but pray tell me do the gentlemen whom i have the honour to see at table cultivate your plantations yes yes they cultivate the coffee and the cocoa and other things also when they have a mind i daresay you think them a roughlooking lot but they are kindhearted ah so kindhearted feeble as i am they treat me like a father bah seсor what is the good of hiding the truth from one of your discernment we do business of all sorts here but the staple of it is smuggling rather than agriculture the trade is not what it was those sharks of customs officers down on the coast there want so much to hold their tongues but still there are a few pickings in the old times when they did not ask questions it was otherwise for then men of pluck were ready for anything from revolution down to the stringing up of a coachload of fat merchants but now is the day of small profits and we must be thankful for whatever trifles providence sends us such as the two americans who got drunk and killed each other suggested the seсor whose tongue was never of the most cautious instantly don pedros face changed the sham geniality born of drink went out of it and was replaced by a hard and cunning look i am tired seсor he said as you must be also and if you will excuse me i will light another cigar and take a nap in my hammock perhaps you will amuse yourself with the others seсor till you wish to go to rest then rising he bowed and walked somewhat unsteadily to the far end of the room when don pedro had retired to his hammock whither the indian girl luisa was summoned to swing him to sleep i saw his son josй and the texan outcast smith both of whom like the rest of the company were more or less drunk come to the seсor and ask him to join in a game of cards guessing that their object was to make him show what cash he had about him he also affected to be in liquor and replied noisily that he had lost most of his money in the shipwreck and was moreover too full of wine to play then you must have lost it on the road friend said don josй for you forget that you made those sailors a present from a belt of gold which you wore about your middle however no gentleman shall be forced to gamble in this house so come and talk while the others have their little game yes that will be better answered the seсor and he staggered to an empty chair placed not far from the table at which i remained and was served with spirits and cigars here he sat watching the play which was high although the counters looked innocent enough they were cocoa beans and listened to the conversation of the gamblers in which he joined from time to time the talk was not good to hear for as these wretches grew more drunken they began to boast of their past exploits in various parts of the country one man told how he had kidnapped and tortured an indian who had offended him another how he had murdered a woman of who he was jealous and the third of the successful robbing of a coachload of travellers and their subsequent butchery by the driving of the coach over the edge of a precipice all these stories however were as milk to brandy compared to those that don smith the americano growing confidential in his cups poured forth one after the other till the seсor unable to bear them any longer affected to sink into a tipsy doze all this while i sat at the little table where my dinner had been served saying nothing for none spoke to me but within hearing of everything that passed there i sat quiet my arms folded on my breast listening attentively to the tales of outrage wrong and murder practised by these wicked ones upon my countrymen to them i was only a member of a despised and hated race admitted to their company on sufferance in order that i might be robbed and murdered in due course but in my heart i looked on them with loathing and contempt and felt far above them as the stars while i watched and wondered how long the great god would suffer his world to be outraged by their presence some such thoughts seemed to strike others of that company for presently don smith called out look at that indian rascal friend he is proud as a turkeycock in springtime why he reminds me of the figure of the king in that ruin where we laid up last year waiting for the seсora and her party you remember the seсora dont you josй i can hear her squeaks now and he laughed brutally and added come king have a drink gracias seсor i answered i have drunk then smoke a cigar o king gracias seсor i do not smoke tonight my lord cacique of all the indians wont drink and wont smoke said don smith so we will offer him incense and taking a plate he filled it with dry tobacco and cigarettepaper to which he set fire then he placed the plate on the table before me so that the fumes of the tobacco rose into the air about my head there now he looks like a real god said the americano clapping his hands i say josй let us make a sacrifice to him there is the girl who ran away last week and whom we caught with the dogs no no comrade broke in josй none of your jokes tonight you forget that we have a visitor not but what i should like to sacrifice this old demonio of an indian to himself he added in an outburst of drunken fury curse him he insulted me and my father and mother yonder on board the ship and are you going to put up with that from this wooden indian god why if i were in your place by now i would have filled him as full of holes as a coffeeroaster just to let the lies out thats what i want to do said josй gnashing his teeth he has insulted me and threatened me and ought to pay for it the black thief and drawing a large knife he flourished it in my face i did not shrink from it i did not so much as suffer my eyelids to tremble though the steel flashed within an inch of them for i knew that if once i showed fear he would strike therefore i said calmly you are pleased to jest seсor and your jests are somewhat rude but i pass them by for i know that you cannot harm me because i am your guest and those who kill a guest are not gentlemen but murderers which the highborn don josй moreno could never be stick the pig josй said smith he is insulting you again it will save you trouble afterwards then as don josй again advanced upon me with the knife of a sudden the seсor sprang up from his chair and stood between us come friend he said a joke is a joke but you are carrying this too far according to your custom and seizing the man by the shoulders he put out all his great strength and swung him back with such force that striking against the long table with his thighs he rolled on to and over it falling heavily to the ground upon the farther side whence he rose cursing with rage by now don pedro who had wakened or affected to waken from his sleep thought that the time had come to interfere peace little ones peace he cried sleepily from his hammock remember that the men are guests and cease brawling let them go to bed it is time for them to go to bed and they need rest by tomorrow your differences will be healed up for ever i take the hint said the seсor with forced gaiety come ignatio let us sleep off our hosts good wine gentlemen sweet dreams to you and he walked across the hall followed by myself at the door i turned my head and looked back every man in the room was watching us intently and it seemed to me that the drunkenness had passed from their faces scared away by a sense of some great wickedness about to be worked don smith was whispering into the ear of josй who still held the knife in his hand but the rest were staring at us as people stare at men passing to the scaffold even don pedro wide awake now sat up in his hammock and peered with his horny eyes while the indian girl luisa her hand upon the cord watched our departure with some such face as mourners watch the outbearing of a corpse all this i noted in a moment as i crossed the threshold and went forward down the passage and as i went i shivered for the scene was uncanny and fateful presently we were in the abbots chamber our sleepingplace and had locked the door behind us near the washstand on which burned a single candle set in the neck of a bottle sat molas his face buried in his hands have they brought you no supper that you look so sad asked the seсor the woman luisa gave me to eat he whispered listen lord and you seсor strickland our fears are well founded there is a plot to murder us tonight of this the woman is sure for she heard some words pass between don pedro and a white man called smith also she saw one of the halfbreeds fetch spades from the garden and place them in readiness which spades are to be used in the hollowing of our graves beneath this floor now when we heard this our hearts sank for it was terrible to think that we were doomed within a few hours to lie beneath the ground whereon our living feet were resting yet if these assassins were determined upon our slaughter our fate seemed certain seeing that we had only knives wherewith to defend ourselves for though we had saved the pistols and some powder in a flask the damp had reached the latter during the shipwreck so that it could not be relied upon i am afraid that we have been too venturesome in coming here i said and that unless we can escape at once we must be prepared to pay the price of our folly with our lives do not be downcast lord answered molas for you have not heard all the tale the woman has shown me a means whereby you can save yourselves from death at any rate for tonight come here and leading us across the room he knelt upon the floor at a spot almost opposite the picture of the abbot and pressed on a panel in the low wainscoting of cedar wood with which the wall was clothed to a height of about three feet the panel slid aside leaving a space barely large enough for a man to pass through this opening we crept one by one and descended four narrow steps to find ourselves in a chamber hollowed out of the foundations of the wall so small that there was only just room for the three of us to stand in it our heads being some inches above the level of the floor and here i may tell you seсor jones that though i have never shown it to you this place still exists as you may discover by searching the wainscoting for many years i have used it for the safe keeping of papers and valuables there by the way you will find that emerald which i showed you on the first night of our meeting what the purpose of this chamber was in the time of the abbots i do not know and perhaps it is as well not to inquire though they also may have used it to store their wealth how can we save ourselves by crouching here like rats in a drain i asked of molas doubtless the secret of the hidingplace is known to those who live in the house and they will drag us out and butcher us the woman luisa says that it is known to none except herself lord for she declares that not two months ago she discovered it for the first time by the accident of the broom with which she was sweeping the floor striking against the springs of the panel now let us come out for a while for it is not yet eleven oclock and she says that there will be no danger till after midnight has she any plan for our escape i asked she has a plan though she is doubtful of its success when the murderers have been and found us gone they will think either that we are wizards or that we have made our way out of the house and will search no more till dawn meanwhile if she can luisa will return and entering the chamber by the secret entrance will lead us to the chapel whence she thinks that we may fly into the forest where is this secret entrance molas i do not know lord she had no time to tell me but the murderers will come by it she did tell me however that she believes that a man and a woman are imprisoned near the chapel though she knows nothing of them and never visits the place because the indians deem it to be haunted doubtless these two are zibalbay and his daughter so that if you live to come so far you may find them there and speak with them why do you say if you live molas because i think lord that then i shall be already dead at least death waits on me what do you mean asked the seсor i will tell you after the woman luisa had gone i ate the food she brought me and drank some wine then i think that i fell asleep for when i awoke the candle had burned out and i was in darkness hastily i turned to search for another candle that i had placed by the bottle and was about to make fire when something drew my eyes causing me to look up this was what i saw at the far end of the chamber enclosed in a film of such pale light as is given by the glowfly stood the figure of a man and that man myself dressed as i am now there i stood surrounded by faint fire and though the face was the face of a dead man yet the hand was not dead for it beckoned towards me through the darkness now i saw and the cold sweat of fear broke out upon me so that i could scarcely light the candle which i held at length however it burned brightly and holding it over my head i walked towards the spot where i had seen the shadow only to find that it was gone or in other words that you had slept off your indigestion said the seсor i congratulate you on getting rid of it so soon it is easy to mock answered molas but that which i have seen i have seen and i know that it portends my death well so be it i am not yet old but i have lived long enough and now it is time to go may heaven have mercy on my sins and thus let it be after this the seсor and i strove to reason him out of his folly but in vain nor in fact was it altogether a folly seeing that molas was doomed to die upon the morrow though whether the vision that he saw came to warn him of his fate or was but a dream it is not for me to say presently we ceased talking of ghosts and omens for we must look to our own bodies and the necessities of the hour some minutes before midnight we extinguished the light and creeping one by one through the hole in the panelling we closed it behind us and took our stand in the little dungeon here the darkness was awful and as the warmth of the wine that we had drunk passed from our veins fears gathered thick upon us and oppressed our souls those hours on the sinking ship had been evil but what were they compared to this deep as was the silence yet there were noises in it strange creaks and flutterings that thrilled our marrows we prayed till we were weary then for my part i tried to doze only to find that at such a time sleep was worse than waking for my imagination peopled it with visions till it seemed to me that all the painted horrors on the walls of the chamber took life and enacted themselves before my eyes i heard the groaning of the martyrs and the cruel jeers of those who watched their agony urged on by the hardfaced abbot whose picture hung above us then the vision changed and i seemed to see the tragedy of the two americans of whose fate the seсor had told me and whose blood still stained the floor the darkness opened as it were and i saw the beds on which they were sleeping heavily stalwart men in the prime of life then appeared figures standing over them don pedro don josй and others while from the shadows behind peeped the wicked face of their countryman don smith the bedclothes were twitched away and once more all was black but in the darkness i heard a sound of blows and groaning of the hurrying feet of murderers and the clinking of bags of money stolen from the dead men now the seсor touched me and i woke with a start hark he whispered into my ear i hear men creeping about the room for the love of god be silent i answered gripping his hand chapter ix the duel now we placed our ears against the panelling and listened first we heard creaks that were loud in the stillness then soft heavy noises such as are made by a cat when it jumps from a height to the ground and a gentle rubbing as of stockinged feet upon the floor after this for some seconds came silence that presently was broken by the clink of steel and the sound of heavy blows delivered upon a soft substance with swords and knives the murderers were driving their weapons through the bedclothes thinking that we slept beneath them next we heard whisperings and muttered oaths then a voice don josйs said be careful the beds are empty another instant and candles were lit for their light reached us through small peepholes in the panel and by putting our eyes to these we could see what passed in the room there before us we beheld don josй don smith and four of their companions all armed with knives or machetes while framed as it were in the wall in the place that had been occupied by the picture of the abbot stood our host don pedro holding a candle above his head and glaring with his fishlike eyes into every corner of the room where are they he said where are the wizards find them quick and kill them now the men ran to and fro about the chamber dragging aside the beds and staring at the pictures on the walls as though they expected to see us there they are gone said josй at length that indian ignatio has conjured them away he is a demonio and not a man i thought it from the first impossible cried don pedro who was white with rage and fear the door has been watched ever since they entered it and no living thing could force those bars search search they must be hidden search yourself answered don smith sullenly they are not here perhaps they discovered the trick of the picture and escaped down the passages to the chapel it cannot be said don pedro again for just now i was in the chapel and saw no signs of them we have some traitor among us who has led them from the house by heaven if i find him out and he uttered a fearful oath shall we bring the dogs asked josй and i trembled at his words they might smell their footing fool what is the use of dogs in a place where all of you have been tramping answered the father tomorrow at dawn we will try them outside for these men must be found and killed or we are ruined already the authorities suspect us because of the disappearance of the two americanos and they will send soldiers from vera cruz to shoot us down for without doubt this inglese is rich and powerful it is certain that they are not here but perhaps they are hidden elsewhere in the building come let us search the passages and the roof and he vanished into the wall followed by the others leaving the chamber as dark and silent as it had been before their coming for a while the danger had passed and we pressed each others hands in gratitude for to speak or even to whisper we did not dare ten minutes or more went by when once again we heard sounds and a light appeared in the room borne in the hand of don pedro who was accompanied by his son don josй they have vanished said the old man the devil their master knows how well tomorrow we must hunt them out if possible till then nothing can be done you were a fool to bring them here josй have i not told you that no money should tempt me to have more to do with the death of white men i did it for revenge not money answered josй a nice revenge said his father a revenge that is likely to cost us all our lives even in this country i tell you that if they are not found tomorrow and silenced i shall leave this place and travel into the interior where no law can follow us for i do not wish to be shot down like a dog listen josй bid those rascals to give up the search and go to bed it is useless then do you come quietly to my room and we will visit the indian and his daughter if we are to screw their secret out of them it must be done tonight for like a fool i told that englishman the story when the wine was in me thinking that he would never live to repeat it yes yes it must be tonight for tomorrow we may have to fly but what if the brutes wont speak father we will find means to make them answered the old man with a hideous chuckle but whether they speak or not they must be silenced afterwards and he drew his hand across his throat adding come an hour passed while we stood in the hole trembling with excitement hope and fear and then once more we heard footfalls followed presently by the sound of a voice whispering on the further side of the panel are you there lord the whisper said it is i luisa yes i answered now she touched the spring and opened the panel listen she said they have gone to sleep all of them but before dawn they will be up again to search for you far and wide therefore you must do one of two things lie hid here perhaps for days or take your chance of escape at once how can we escape i asked there is but one way lord through the chapel the door into it is locked but i can show you a place from which the priests used to watch those below and thence if you are brave you can drop to the ground beneath for the height is not great once there you can escape into the garden through the window over the altar which is broken as i have seen from without though to do so perhaps you will have to climb upon each others shoulders then you must fly as swiftly as you can by the light of the moon which has risen the dogs have been gorged and tied up so if the heart is your friend you may yet go unharmed now i spoke to the seсor saying although the woman does not know it i think it likely that we shall find company in this chapel seeing that the indian and his daughter are imprisoned there where don pedro and josй have gone to visit them the risk is great shall we take it yes answered the seсor after a moments thought for it is better to take a risk than to perish by inches in this hole of starvation or perhaps to be discovered and murdered in cold blood also we have travelled far and undergone much to find this indian and if we lose our chance of doing so we may get no other what do you say molas i asked i say that the words of the seсor are wise also that it matters little to me what we do since whether i turn to left or right death waits me on my path now one by one we climbed through the false panel and by the light of the moon luisa led us across the chamber to the spot between the beds where hangs the picture of the abbot which picture that is painted on a slab of wood proved to be only a cunningly devised door constructed to swing upon a pivot placing her knee on the threshold of the secret door luisa scrambled into the passage beyond when the rest of us stood by her side she closed the panel and bidding us cling to one another and be silent she took me by the hand and guided us through some passages till at length she whispered be cautious now for we come to the place whence you must drop into the chapel and there is a stairway to your right we passed the stairway and turned a corner luisa still leading next instant she staggered back into my arms murmuring mother of heaven the ghosts the ghosts indeed had i not held her she would have fled still grasping her hand i pushed forward to find myself standing in a small recess the one i showed you seсor jones that was placed about ten feet above the floor of the chapel and like other places in this house so arranged that the abbot or monk in authority without being seen himself could see and hear all that passed beneath him of one thing i am sure that during all the generations that are gone no monk watching here ever saw a stranger sight than that which met my eyes the chancel of the chapel was lit up by shafts of brilliant moonlight that poured through the broken window and by a lamp which stood upon the stone altar within the circle of strong light thrown by this lamp were four people namely don pedro his son don josй an old indian and a girl on either side of the altar then as now rose two carven pillars of sapote wood the tops of which were fashioned into the figures of angels and to these columns the old indian and the woman were tied one to each column their hands being joined together at the back of the pillars in such a manner as to render them absolutely helpless my eyes rested first upon the woman who was nearest to me and seeing her even as she was then dishevelled worn with pain and hunger her proud face distorted by agony of mind and impotent rage i no longer wondered that both molas and don pedro had raved about her beauty she was an indian but such an indian as i had never known before for in colour she was almost white and her dark and waving hair hung in masses to her knees her face was oval and smallfeatured and in it shone a pair of wonderful darkblue eyes while the clinging white robe she wore revealed the loveliness of her tall and delicate shape bad as was the girls plight that of the old man her father who was none other than the zibalbay we had come to seek seemed even worse as molas had described him he was thin and very tall with white hair and beard wild and hawklike eyes and aquiline features nor had don pedro spoken more than the truth when he said that he looked like a king his robe had been torn from him leaving him half naked and on his forehead breast and arms were blood and bruises which clearly had been caused by a ridingwhip that lay broken at his feet it was not difficult to guess who had broken it for in front of the old man breathing heavily and wiping the perspiration from his brow stood don josй this mule wont stir he said to his father in spanish ask the girl it must wake her up to see the old man knocked about then don pedro slipped off the altar rail upon which he had been seated and advancing to the woman he peered at her with his leaden eyes my dear he said to her in the maya language this sight must grieve you put an end to it then by telling us of that place where so much gold is hidden as with my last breath daughter broke in zibalbay i command you to say nothing no not if you see them murder me by inches before your eyes silence you dog said don josй striking him across the lips with his hand oh that i were free to avenge you gasped the girl as she strained and tore at the ropes which held her dont be in a hurry my love sneered don josй wait a while and you will have yourself to avenge as well as your father if he wont speak i think we can find a way to make you talk only i do not want to be rough with you unless i am forced to it you are too pretty much too pretty the girl shivered gasping with fear and hate and was silent what shall we try him with now he went on addressing don pedro hot steel or cold make up your mind for i am growing tired well if you wont just hand me that machete will you now friend he said addressing the indian for the last time i ask you to tell us where is that temple full of gold of which you spoke to your daughter in my fathers hearing there is no such place white man he answered sullenly indeed friend then will you explain where you found those little ingots which we captured from the indian who had been visiting you and whence came this machete and he pointed to the weapon in his hand it was a sword of great beauty as i could see even from where we stood made not of steel but of hardened copper and having for a handle a female figure with outstretched arms fashioned in solid gold the machete was given to me by a friend said the indian i do not know where he got it really answered josй with a brutal laugh perhaps you will remember presently here father warm the point of the machete in the lamp will you while i tell our guest how we are going to serve him and his daughter don pedro nodded and taking the sword he held the tip of it over the flame while josй bending forward whispered into the indians ear pointing from time to time to the girl who overcome with faintness or horror had sunk to the ground where she was huddled in a heap half hidden by the masses of her hair are you white men then devils said the old man at length with a groan that seemed to burst from the bottom of his heart and is there no law or justice among you not at all friend answered josй we are good fellows enough but times are hard and we must live as for the rest we dont trouble over much about law in these parts and i never heard that unbaptised indian dogs have any right to justice now once more will you guide us to the place whence that gold came leaving your daughter here as hostage for our safety never cried the indian better that we two should perish a hundred times than that the ancient secrets of my people should pass to such as you so you have secrets after all father is the sword hot asked josй one minute more son said the old man quietly turning the point in the flame this was the scene that we witnessed and these were the words that astonished our ears it is time to interfere muttered the seсor and placing his hand upon the rail he prepared to drop into the church now a thought struck me and i drew him back to the passage perhaps the door is open i said are you going in there asked the girl luisa certainly i replied we must rescue those people or die with them then seсors farewell i have done all i can for you and now the saints must be your guide for if i am seen they will kill me and i have a child for whose sake i desire to live again farewell and she glided away like a shadow we crept forward down the stair at the foot of it was a little door which as we had hoped stood ajar for a moment we consulted together then we crawled on through the gloom towards the ring of light about the altar now josй had the heated sword in his hand look up my dear look up he said to the girl patting her on the cheek i am about to baptise your excellent father according to the rites of the christian religion by marking him with a cross upon the forehead and he advanced the glowing point of the sword towards the indians face at that instant molas pinned him from behind causing him to drop the weapon while i did the same office by don pedro holding him so that struggle as he might he could not stir make a sound either of you and you are dead said the seсor picking up the machete and placing its hot point against josйs breast where it slowly burnt its way through his clothes what are we to do with these men he asked kill them as they would have killed us answered molas or if you fear the task cut loose the old man yonder and let him avenge his own and his daughters wrongs what say you ignatio i seek no mans blood but for our own safety it is well that these wretches should die away with them now don pedro began to bleat inarticulately in his terror and that hero josй burst into tears and pleaded for his life writhing with pain the while for the point of the sword scorched him you are an english gentleman he groaned you cannot butcher a helpless man as though he were an ox as you tried to butcher us in the chamber yonder us who saved your life answered the seсor still you are right i cannot do it because as you say i am a gentleman molas loose this dog and if he tries to run put your knife through him josй moreno you have a sword by your side and i hold one in my hand i will not murder you but we have a quarrel and we will settle it here and now you are mad seсor i said to risk your life thus i myself will kill him rather than it should be so will you fight if i loose you josй moreno he asked making me no answer or will you be killed where you stand i will fight he replied good let him free molas and be ready with your knife i command you i began but already the man was loose and the seсor stood waiting for him his back to the door and grasping the indian machete handled with the golden woman now josй glanced round as though he sought a means of escape but there was none for in front was the machete and behind was the knife of molas for some seconds ten perhaps they stood facing each other in the ring of the lamplight whilst the moonbeams played faintly about their heads we watched in utter silence the indian girl shaking the long hair from her face and leaning forward as far as her bonds would allow that she might see this battle to the death between him who had insulted and tormented her and the noblelooking white man who had appeared out of the gloom to bring her deliverance it was a strange scene for the contrast of light and darkness or of good and evil is not greater than was that of these two men and what made it stranger were the place and hour behind them was the halflit emptiness of the deserted chapel before them stood the holy crucifix and the desecrated altar of god and beneath their feet lay the bones of the forgotten dead whose spirits mayhap were watching them from the shadows as earnestly as did our living eyes yes that midnight scene of death and vengeance enacted in the house of peace was very strange and even now it thrills my blood to think of it from the moment that i saw them fronting each other my fears for the issue vanished victory was written in the calm features of the seсor and more especially in his large blue eyes that of a sudden had grown stern as those of an avenging angel while the face of josй told only of baffled fury struggling with bottomless despair he was about to die and the terror of approaching death unnerved him still it was he who struck the first for stepping forward he aimed a desperate blow at the seсors head who springing aside avoided it and in return ran him through the left arm with a cry of pain the mexican sprang back followed by the seсor at whom he cut from time to time but without result for every blow was parried now they were within the altar rails and now his back was against one of the carved pillars of sapote wood that to which the girl was tied further he could not fly but stayed there laying about him wildly so that the woman at the other side of the pillar crouched upon the ground to avoid the sweep of his sword then the end came for the seсor who was waiting his chance drew suddenly within reach only to step back so that the furious blow aimed at his head struck with a ringing sound upon the marble floor where the mark of it may yet be seen before don josй whose arm was numbed by the shock could lift the sword again the seсor ran in and for the second time thrust with all his strength but now the aim was truer for his machete pierced the mexican through the heart so that he fell down and died there upon the altar step now i must tell of my own folly that went near to bringing us all to death you will remember that i was holding don pedro and how it came about i know not but in my joy and agitation i slackened by grip so that with a sudden twist he was able to tear himself from my hands and in a twinkling of an eye was gone i bounded after him but too late for as i reached the door it was slammed in my face nor could i open it for on the chapel side were neither key nor handle fly i cried rushing back to the altar he has escaped and will presently be here with the rest the seсor had seen and already was engaged in severing with his sword the rope that bound the girl while molas cut loose her father now i leapt upon the altar may the sacrilege be forgiven to my need and springing at the stonework of the broken window i made shift to pull myself up with the help of molas pushing from below seated upon the window ledge i leaned down and catching the indian zibalbay by the wrists for he was too stiff to leap with great efforts i dragged him to me and bade him drop without fear to the ground which was not more than ten feet below us next came his daughter then the seсor and last of all molas so that within three minutes from the escape of don pedro we stood unhurt outside the chapel among the bushes of a garden where to now i asked for the place was strange to me the girl maya looked round her then she glanced up at the heavens follow me she said i know a way and started down the garden at a run presently we came to a wall the height of a man beyond which was a thick hedge of aloes over the wall we climbed and through the aloes we burst a path not without doing ourselves some hurt for the thorns were sharp to find ourselves in a milpa or cornfield here the girl stopped again searching the stars and at that moment we heard sounds of shouting and looking back saw lights moving to and fro in the hacienda we must go forward or perish i said don pedro has aroused his men then she dashed into the milpa and we followed her there was no path and the cornstalks that stood high above us caught our feet and shook the dew in showers upon our heads till our clothes were filled with water like a sponge still we struggled on one following the other for fifteen minutes or more till at length we were clear of the cultivated land and standing on the borders of the forest halt i said where do we run to the road lies to the right and by following it we may reach a town to be arrested as murderers broke in the seсor you forget that josй moreno is dead at my hands and his father will swear our lives away or that at the best we shall be thrown into prison no no we must hide in the bush sirs said the old indian speaking for the first time i know a secret place in the forest an ancient and ruined building where we may take refuge for a while if we can reach it but first i ask who are you you should know me zibalbay said molas seeing that i am the messenger whom you sent to search for him that you desire to find the lord and keeper of the heart and he pointed to me are you that man asked the indian i am i answered and i have suffered much to find you but now is no time for talk guide us to this hidingplace of yours for our danger is great then once more the girl took the lead and we plunged forward into the forest often stumbling and falling in the darkness till the dawn broke in the east and the shoutings of our pursuers died away chapter x how molas died for some few minutes we rested to recover our breath then we started forward again in front went the girl maya our guide whom the seсor led by the hand while behind followed zibalbay supported by molas and myself at first these two had run as quickly as the rest of us but now all the fatigues and terrors that they had undergone took hold of them so that from time to time they were forced to stop and rest this was little to be wondered at indeed seeing that during five days they had eaten no solid food for it had been don pedros purpose to starve their secret out of them doubtless he would have succeeded in this design or in doing them to death had it not been for a quantity of a certain preparation of the cuca leaf mixed with pounded meat and other ingredients which they carried with them zibalbay had the secret of this indian food and by the help of it he and his daughter had journeyed far across unpopulated wastes for so wonderful are its properties that a piece no larger than a bullet will serve to stay a mans stomach for twentyfour hours even when his power is taxed by work or travel on this nutriment they had sustained themselves to the amazement of their captor who could not discover whence they drew their strength still it is a stimulant rather than a food and so great was their craving to fill themselves that as they ran they plucked cobs of the indian corn and devoured them our path lay through a tropical forest so dense that even when the sun shone the gloom was that of twilight many sorts of huge and uncouth trees grew in it whereof the boughs were starred with orchids and hung with trailing ferns or in places with long festoons of grey spanish moss that gave them a very strange and unnatural appearance up these trees climbed creepers some of them thicker than a mans thigh and beneath them the ground was clothed with softwooded bush or with vast brakes of a plant that in mexico attains a height of from ten to twelve feet which the seсor told me is cultivated in english gardens under the name of indian shot slowly and with much toil we forced a path through this mass of vegetation now we were creeping over the rotten trunks of fallen and fernencumbered trees now foot by foot we must make our way between the stout stems of the indian shot and now our clothes were caught and our flesh was torn by the hooklike thorns and brambles or our feet tripped in the roots of climbing plants no breath of air penetrated that measureless thicket whereof the stagnant atmosphere laden with the decay of ages choked and almost overpowered us causing the sweat to start from every pore above us hiding the sky hung masses of deep green foliage beneath which we struggled on in the solemn gloom and the silence that was broken only from time to time by the grunting of an ape or by a distant crash as some great tree after centuries of life fell with a noise like thunder to the earth from whence it sprang this forest that seemed so destitute of life was peopled by millions of insects all of them venomous garrapatas tiny grey flies woodwasps and ants black and red tormented us with their bites and stings till we groaned aloud in misery then remembering our danger pushed on again thus two hours and more passed till reaching a little stream that ran through a ravine in the forest we paused to drink and to cool our fevered feet and hands zibalbay sank exhausted upon the bank where i brought him water in my sombrero while his daughter sat herself down on a stone in the stream suffering it to flow over her feet and ankles that by now were swollen with antbites and bleeding from the cuts of thorns and grasses presently she looked up and seeing the seсor who stood upon a bank talking to me she invited him with a motion of her hand to seat himself beside her what is your name white man she asked james strickland lady james strickland she repeated with some difficulty i thank you james strickland for rescuing my father from torment and me from insult and because of that deed i maya of the heart whom many have served am your servant for ever you should thank my friend don ignatio he said pointing to me for a few moments she looked at me searchingly then replied i thank him also but you i thank the most for your hand rid me of that hateful man and saved us it is early to return thanks lady he said we are not out of danger yet i have little fear now that we have escaped from that dreadful house she answered almost indifferently since our hidingplace is at hand also how can they find us in this forest hark what was that as she spoke a faint and distant sound fell upon our ears such a sound as might have been made by a bell struck far away at night that is how they will find us he said springing to his feet do you hear ignatio the dogs have hit our trail which way does our road run now lady along the banks of this stream then we must go forward in the water said the seсor it is our only chance for the hounds cannot track us there now we began to scramble down the bed of the stream as fast as the boulders and the weariness of zibalbay would allow fortunately it was not a broad river nor very deep still sometimes we could hardly stand in the rapids and twice not daring to set foot upon the bank we were forced to swim the length of the pools which we did in terror fearing lest they should be haunted by alligators for something over an hour we followed the stream thus till suddenly maya halted saying that if we would gain the building where they had dwelt we must leave the water and plunge into the forest by now we were exhausted indeed unless he were carried the old indian zibalbay could not have gone another mile so notwithstanding the danger of setting foot upon the land on learning that the place was near and that food was to be found in it we hesitated no longer but once more began to thread the bush not more than three hundred paces from the banks of the river we came upon a high mound densely overgrown with trees between the boles of which appeared masses of cut stone this is the place gasped zibalbay look yonder above us are the walls of the temple and here is the stairway that led to it and he pointed to a long flight of crumbling stone almost hidden in ferns and bushes which stretched from the base of the pyramid to the ancient indian fane on its crest up these steps we went with caution for the climb was dangerous molas carrying zibalbay upon his broad back since so weary was he that the old indian could mount them in no other fashion this staircase was built in three flights the top flight now almost entirely broken away emerging on what once had been a broad and splendid terrace but today was a chaos of stonework in the crevices of which grew bushes and even large trees over the head of the stairway still stood a colossal arch sculptured with the figures of gods and beasts this arch was in the last stage of decay indeed the crown of it a mass of masonry that must have weighed between one and two hundred tons had been nearly separated from its supports by the action of time and rain aided perhaps by a shock of earthquake and hung threateningly over the top steps of the stair in truth so slight were the attachments which remained between it and its supporting side columns and buttresses that at first sight it seemed as though it must fall at once a closer examination showed however that it was held in place by three or four great roots which springing from trees that grew upon the crown of the arch in the course of years had thrust themselves deep into the crevices of the masonry of the massive pillars and through their foundations into the soil beneath beyond the arch on the further side of the terrace rose the ruined temple a long singlestoried building with a flat roof whereon grew many shrubs and palms passing through the central doorway of this temple maya led us into a chamber decorated everywhere with serpents carved in stone which had been occupied and recently for it was clean and upon the floor were ashes and bits of burnt wood in the corner also lay a little pile of articles covered over with a serape that maya hastened to remove revealing amongst other things an earthen cookingpot a copper axe of similar workmanship to the machete with which the seсor had killed don josй two curiously fashioned blowpipes with a supply of poisoned darts and lastly bags containing dried flesh beans and cuca paste all is safe she said now let us eat that we may be strong to meet danger while we were filling ourselves thankfully with the dried meat the seсor spoke to me saying he hoped that our pursuit had been abandoned you can know little of these men to speak thus i answered they must hunt us down for their own sakes also don pedro will certainly seek to avenge the blood of his son our only hope is that the water will baffle the hounds or that if they strike the place where we left it the heat of the day may have killed our scent but i fear that this will not be so since the ground is damp beneath the trees then what do you propose to do he asked start on again or stop here seсor we must stop here because we cannot travel farther unless you would abandon the old man and his daughter moreover in the forest it would be easy to overwhelm us but this place is hard to climb and here at least we may die fighting let us make ready for the worst seсor how are we to make ready he asked when we have nothing to fight with except machetes and indian blowpipes the powder in the pistol flasks is damp and the caps will miss fire so that if we are attacked our death is certain it seems so i answered yet if it pleases god we may live yonder lie stones in plenty let us pile them up beneath the archway perhaps we can kill some of our foes by rolling them down the steps this we did then while maya watched us at length the task was finished and as we turned to leave the heaps of stones of a sudden we heard a dog baying down by the river followed by a sound of men and horses forcing a path through the bush for a while we stared at each other in silence then molas said they are coming if so i wish they would come quickly answered the seсor why white man are you afraid asked maya yes very much he answered with a little laugh for the odds are heavy and probably we shall soon be killed that is all the men among us will be killed does not the prospect frighten you why should it she answered with a shrug and a smile seeing that if it comes to the worst i shall be killed also and spared a long journey home how can you be sure of that lady so she answered holding a tiny blowpipe dart before his eyes if i prick myself with this here and she touched the large vein in her neck in one minute i shall be asleep and in two i shall be dead i understand but you talk of death very easily for one so young and beautiful if so seсor it is because i have not found life too soft nor she added with a sigh do i know what destiny awaits me in the future but i do know that when we sleep upon the heart of heaven we shall find peace if nothing more i hope so said the seсor look here they come and as he spoke a party of seven or eight men three of them riding on mules appeared at the foot of the mound and dismounting picketed their animals to trees now for it said the seсor rising and shaking himself like a dog that leaves the water i wonder how many of us will be left alive when this sun sets as he spoke one of the men reached the foot of the stairway holding a great hound in a leash for a moment the dog sniffed the stones then lifting his head he bayed aloud whereat the band shouted for they knew that they had trapped us still for a while they did not advance but gathering themselves in a knot they consulted together earnestly we looked at each other in despair for truly our case was desperate fly we could not and we had no arms wherewith to fight therefore it seemed certain that within some few minutes we must lose our lives at the hands of these murderers if indeed they chose to kill us outright in mercy the seсor hid his face in his hands for awhile then he looked up and said can we bargain with them ignatio impossible i answered what have we to give that they cannot take then there is nothing for it except to die as bravely as we may he answered this is the end of our quest for the golden city the quest has not been a lucky one ignatio now the old indian zibalbay who was crouched upon the ground beside us spoke for the first time saying friends why do you not fly doubtless you can find a path down the further side of the pyramid and in the forest you may hide from these men how can we fly answered the seсor when you have no strength to walk a step i am old and ready to die he answered leave me here and be sure that when the time comes i shall know how to slip through the grasp of these villains my daughter go you with them you have the holy symbol and should you escape and prove this stranger to be the man whom we seek lead him to our home that things may befall as they are fated peace my father said maya throwing her arms about his neck together we will live or perish these seсors may go if it pleases them but here i stay with you and so do i said molas for i weary of flying from the death that dogs me also it is too late to talk of flight for look they are coming up the stair the eight of them with don pedro and the americano at their head i looked it was true already they had climbed half the steps of the first flight oh for some rifles groaned the seсor it is useless to cry for what we have not i answered god can help us if he wishes and if he does not we must bow us to his will then there was silence broken only by the voice of zibalbay who standing behind us lifted his hands to heaven and prayed aloud to his gods to bring a vengeance upon our foes now we could see through the trees and bushes that the men were beginning to climb the second flight come let us do something said the seсor and running to the piles of stones which we had prepared he called to us to help him roll the heaviest of them upon the enemy this we did for awhile but without effect for the treetrunks turned our missiles moreover those against whom they were directed taking cover at the sides of the stairway opened so sharp a fire on us with their rifles that in a few minutes we were driven from the stone heaps and forced to retreat behind the shelter of the arch now they came on again till presently they reached the foot of the third flight and paused to take breath then it was that molas seizing one of the indian blowpipes ran out on to the terrace followed by the seсor though why the latter went i do not know for he could not use this weapon before the men beneath were aware of their presence molas had set the blowpipe to his lips and discharged the poisoned dart among them as it chanced it struck the texan smith full in the throat watching round the corner of the arch i saw him lift his hand to pull out the dart then of a sudden he fell to the ground and in that instant a storm of bullets swept through the archway aimed at molas and the seсor as they fled back for refuge i saw molas fall and the seсor stop to lift him to his feet and as he was in the very act a patch of red appear upon his face another moment and they were under cover are you hurt i asked of the seсor no no he answered my cheek was grazed by a bullet that is all look to molas he is shot in the side leave me said molas it is nothing then we were silent only maya sobbed a little as she strove to staunch the blood that flowed from the seсors wound with cobwebs which she gathered from among the stones do not trouble lady he said with a sad smile for soon there will be other wounds that cannot be dressed what shall you do by way of answer she showed him the poisoned dart which she held in the hollow of her hand i cannot advise you otherwise he said farewell i am glad to have met you and i hope that we may meet again yonder and he glanced towards the sky now you had best say goodbye to your father for our time is short she nodded went to the old man zibalbay who stood silent stroking his grey beard and putting her arms about his neck she kissed him tenderly looking out carefully we saw that the men had dragged don smith to the side of the stairway where some of them supported him while he died of the poison and others watched for a chance to shoot us should we show ourselves upon the terrace presently he was dead and cursing us aloud his companions commenced to mount the third flight with great caution for they feared a snare is there nothing to be done to save our lives asked the seсor in a heavy voice there was no answer but of a sudden molas who was standing with one hand pressed upon the wound in his side and the other before his eyes turned and ran into the chamber behind us whence he reappeared carrying the copper axe then without speaking he climbed the masonry of the archway with great swiftness till he stood with his feet in the crack beneath the crown of the arch which you will remember was held in place only by the tough treeroots that grew from it into the stonework of the buttresses supporting himself by a creeper with his left hand with his right he struck blow after blow at the biggest of these roots severing them one by one now we saw his purpose to send two hundred tons of stonework thundering down the stairway upon the heads of the murderers by heaven that is an answer to my question said the seсor then he paused and added come down molas if the arch falls you will fall with it and be crushed it matters little he answered this is my doom day that bullet has cut me inside and i bleed to death and on this spot as i have long feared it is fated that i should die pray for my soul and farewell fare you well you gallant man said the seсor i have no axe or i would come with you farewell molas my brother true servant of the heart i echoed of this i am sure that you shall not lose your reward now three of the roots were severed but the fourth and largest which was thicker than a mans leg remained and at this molas began to hew despairingly are they near he gasped as the white chips flew we peeped round the corner of the arch and saw that some seventy feet below us the band had halted on the slippery face of the pyramid fearing they knew not what for they heard the dull sound of the axe blows but could not guess what it portended one of their number was talking to don pedro apparently urging something upon him to which he did not agree and in this way they wasted two minutes before at last the order was given to rush up the remaining steps and take the temple by storm two minutes it was but a short time yet it meant much for only a third of the root remained unsevered and the bark crackling and peeling showed how great was the strain upon it quick whispered the seсor they come and as he spoke the handle of the axe broke and its head fell to the ground now if the root holds we are lost i said but it was not to be for molas still had his heavy huntingknife and with this he hewed frantically at the wood at the third cut it began to part torn slowly asunder as though by the strength of a giant and while it gave the vast superincumbent mass of masonry which it had helped to support for so many years shifted a little with a grinding sound then hung again come down molas come down cried the seсor but molas would not he struck one more blow severing the root then with a shout of farewell either through faintness or by design he cast himself forward with outstretched arms against the face of the wall his weight was little indeed yet it seemed that it sufficed to turn the balance as dust turns a scale for again the trembling mass moved perceptibly and the tall trees upon the top of it began to nod as though beneath the sudden pressure of wind now it slid forward faster and faster while sharp sounds like pistolshots came from the heart of it and the trees above bent like a rod beneath the rush of a fish now also for the first time the villains on the slope below perceived the doom that threatened them and uttered such a yell as i had never heard some stood still and some flung themselves down the stair one only don pedro himself rushed forward it was too late the mass of stonework sixty feet long by twenty in breadth was falling it was falling it fell taking molas with it with a roar like that of thunder it struck upon the stairway and bursting into fragments swept it from end to end no discharge of grapeshot could have been so terrible in its effects as this hurricane of stones that nothing could withstand for even the big trees which stood in its path were snapped like sticks and borne away upon its crest as the carved masonry that had been carried up the pyramid by the long labour of the indians of a bygone age rushed downward to its foot in less than a minute it was done the sounds had died away and nothing was left to tell of what had happened except a little dust and some remains that had been men of all those who stood upon the stairway only one survived don pedro who had run forward in the hope of escaping the fall of the arch as it chanced he was too late for though the mass had missed him a single stone struck him across the middle breaking his bones and sweeping him to the foot of the first flight but leaving him alive when all was finished and the dust had fallen to the earth again the seсor spoke saying let us go and search for the body of our deliverer so we went the three of us leaving zibalbay in the temple but we could not find it doubtless to this day molas lies buried beneath some of the larger blocks of masonry there were other bodies indeed from which we did not scruple to take the rifles and whatever else was likely to be of value to us better still tied among some trees near the foot of the pyramid we found four good mules one of them laden with ammunition and provisions for don pedro had come out determined to hunt us down even if he must follow us for days having picketed the mules where they could graze we returned to the temple bearing with us food and drink of which we stood in sore need on our way up the steps don pedro called to us from where he lay broken and bleeding against an uprooted tree water he cried give me water the seсor gave him some mixed with brandy that we had found upon the sumpter mule your heart is merciful said maya gravely i am not cruel yet i think that i should suffer that dog to die untended we all of us have sins to pay for lady and the thought of them should teach us charity especially now when it has pleased god to spare us answered the seсor i am dying moaned the wretch my presentiment has come true and death finds me amongst ruins how dare i die who have been a murderer and a thief from my boyhood the seсor shrugged his shoulders for he could not answer this question give me absolution he went on for the love of christ give me absolution i cannot said the seсor i have no authority pray to heaven to shrive you for your time is short then he turned and went but for a long time we were troubled by the last cries and blasphemies of this most evil man indeed they did not cease till sunset when the devil came to claim his own chapter xi zibalbay tells his mission when we reached the ruins of the temple we ate and drank then knowing that we could travel no farther that night i spoke saying some two months since zibalbay you sent a message to molas my fosterbrother that man who died to save us this day to him who among the indians is known as lord of the heart your messenger travelled fast and far by sea and by land till he found him and delivered the message to whom did he deliver it asked zibalbay to me for i am the man you seek and with my companion i have journeyed here to find you suffering many dangers and evils on the path prove that you are the man and he asked me certain secret questions to all of which i returned answers you are instructed he said at length yet something is lacking if indeed you are the lord of the heart reveal its mystery to my eyes nay i answered it is you who seek me not i you to molas your messenger you showed a certain symbol let me see that symbol for then and not till then will i reveal the mystery now he looked round him doubtfully and said you i have proved and this woman is my daughter and knows all but what of the white man is it lawful that i should unveil the heart before him it is lawful i answered for this white man is my brother and we are one till death also he is sworn of our brotherhood and himself for a while was lord and holder of the heart for i passed it on to him when i thought that i lay dying and to him cling its virtues and prerogatives so it comes about that we have no secrets from each other that his ears are my ears and his mouth is my mouth speak to us then as though we were one man or be silent to both for i vouch for him and he for me are these things so white man asked zibalbay making the sign of the brotherhood they are so replied the seсor giving the countersign then i speak said zibalbay i speak in the name of the heart and woe be to him who betrays the secrets that he learns under cover of this name come hither daughter and give me that which is hidden about you now maya put her hands to her head and drawing forth something from the dense masses of her hair she passed it to her father is this what you would see he asked holding the talisman in the light of the setting sun i looked and lo there before me was the very counterpart of that which had descended to me from my forefathers and which i wore about my neck it would seem so unless my sight deceives me i answered and is this what you have come so far to seek zibalbay and i drew forth the ancient symbol of the broken heart now he leaned forward and examined first the one half and then the other searching them both with his eyes then he clasped his hands and looking to the heavens said i thank thee o nameless one god of my fathers that thou hast led my feet aright and given it to mine eyes to see their desire as thou hast prospered the beginning so prosper thou the end i beseech thee then he turned to me and continued as in an ecstasy now have day and night come together and soon shall the new sun rise the sun of our glory for already the dawn is breaking take that which is in your keeping and i will take that which is in mine for not here must they be joined but far away listen brethren to my tale which shall be brief seeing that if it be the will of heaven your eyes shall prove my words where all things can be made clear to you and if not that of which little is told is the more easily forgotten perchance my brethren you have heard legends of that ancient undiscovered city the last home of our race which is undefiled by the foot of the white conqueror and the secret sanctuary of the pure faith given to our forefathers by the divine cucumatz who is of some named quetzal we have heard of it and greatly desire to see it i answered if this be so went on zibalbay in us you have found those who can guide you to that city of which i am the cacique and hereditary high priest and my only child here is the heiress and lady you wonder how it comes then that we being of this condition are found unguarded and alone wandering like beggars in the land of the white man listen the city of the heart as it is called is of all cities the most beautiful and ancient and once in the far past she ruled these lands from sea to sea for her walls were built by one of those brethren whom the holy cucumatz the white god left to share his throne after there had been war between the brethren and they separated each becoming the father of a nation so great was her power in the early days that all the cities whose ruins may be found buried in these forests were her tributaries but as the years went by hordes of barbarians rolled down upon her frontier towns so that they were lost to her still no enemies came near her gates and she remained the richest and most powerful of the cities of the world now the city of the heart is built upon an island in the centre of a lake but many thousands of her children lived upon the mainland where they cultivated fields and dug in the earth for gold and gems so she flourished and her children with her till twelve generations since when there came tidings to the king of that day that a nation of white men had conquered the empires near the sea putting their inhabitants to the sword and possessing themselves of their wealth tidings came also that these white men having learned the tale of the city of the heart and of the measureless treasures of gold with which it is adorned purposed to seek it out to sack it when the ruling cacique was sure that these things were true he took counsel with his wise men and with the oracle of the god which is in the sanctuary and issued a decree that all those who lived upon the mainland should be brought within the walls of the city so that the white men might find none to guide them thither this was done then and the spoilers sought in vain for many years till it was reported among them that this legend of a town filled with gold was but a fable now however great sickness took hold of those who lived in the city of the heart because it was over full of men so great a sickness indeed that soon there was space and to spare for all who remained within its walls the sickness went away but as the generations passed a new and a worse trouble fell upon our forefathers the blood of the people grew old and but few children were born to them there were none left upon the mainland to replenish the race and this is our law a law which cannot be broken under pain of death that no man or woman may leave our territories to seek a husband or a wife of different blood thus then has it come about that the people have grown less and less wasting away like snow upon a mountain top in summer till at length they are dwindled to a few thousands who in bygone days could count their number by tens and twenties of thousands now i zibalbay have ruled this city since i was young and bitterly has it grieved me to know that before another hundred years have been added to the past the city heart of the world must become nothing but a waste and a home for the dead though of that those who live therein today reck but little for the people have no thought for the morrow and the hearts of its nobles have become gross and their eyes blind but an ancient prophecy has come to us from our forefathers and it is that when once more the two halves of the symbol of the heart are laid side by side in their place upon the altar in the sanctuary of the holy city then from that hour she shall grow great again over this saying i brooded long and long and often did i pray to that god whom i worship and whose highpriest i am the nameless god heart of heaven and lord of all the earth that it would please him to give me light and wisdom whereby i might find that which was lost and save the people from perishing as in a season of drought flowers perish for lack of rain bringing forth no seed at length upon a certain night it came about that a voice spoke to me in a dream answering my prayer bidding me to wander forth from the country of the heart and follow the ancient road towards the sea for there near to the eastern shore i should find that which was lost then i summoned the council of the heart and opened my mind to them telling them of my dream and that i purposed to obey it but they made a mock of me for they thought me mad and said that i might go if i wished for being their ruler they had no power to stay me but that no man of the people should accompany me across the mountains for that was against the ancient law i answered that it was well and i would go alone since go i must whereon my daughter rose in her place and said that she would journey with me as she had a right to do and to this they must consent though one of their number spoke bitterly against it for he was my nephew and affianced to my daughter was it not so maya it was so she answered with a smile to be short went on zibalbay since my heart was set upon this mission and my daughter yonder who is wilful would not be gainsayed of her desire to accompany me tikal my nephew was placed over the city to rule as cacique in my stead until i should return again then i left the city with this my daughter many of the nobles and of the common people accompanying us across the lake and a days journey beyond it to the mountain pass where they bid us farewell with tears for they were certain that we were mad and went to our deaths alone we crossed the mountains and alone following the traces of the ancient road we travelled through the desert and the forest that lies beyond it till at length we reached this secret place and stayed here for though we were unharmed danger toil and hunger had worn us out moreover we were afraid to venture among the white people brethren there is no need to tell the rest of the tale for it is known to you that power which sent me on my mission has guided me through all its troubles and after much hardship and suffering has caused me to triumph seeing that tonight we are still alive having found that which we came forth to seek such is my story brother now if it pleases you let us hear yours and learn what purpose led you and your companion here in time to save us from the group of that white devil who lies dead upon the stairway then i spoke telling to zibalbay and his daughter the story of my life whereof i have written already and of my great scheme to build up again that empire which fell in the day of montezuma now you speak words that are after my own heart said the old chief but tell me how is it to be done by your help i answered men are here in plenty but to use them i must have gold whereas yonder it seems you have gold but no men therefore i ask of you some portion of your useless wealth that by its help i may lift up your people and my own follow me to the city and if i can bring it about you shall have all that you desire he answered brother our ends are one and fate has brought us together from far away in order that they may be accomplished the prophecy is true and truly have i dreamed soon shall the severed symbol be brought together in the sanctuary and the will of heaven be made clear oh not in vain have i lived and prayed enduring the mockery of men for day and night have met and already the light of the new dawn is shining in the sky place your hand in mine and let us swear an oath upon the heart that we its guardians will be true to each other and to our purpose until death chooses us so it is sworn now daughter lead me to my rest for i am overwhelmed not with toil and suffering but with too much joy o heart of heaven i thank thee and lifting his hands above his head as though in adoration zibalbay turned and followed by the girl maya he tottered rather than walked into the chamber when he had gone the seсor spoke to me this is very well ignatio he said and most interesting but just now as i may remind you there are things more pressing than the regeneration of the indian race for instance our own safety tomorrow at the latest men will come to seek these villains who lie yonder and if we are found here it seems likely that we shall be shot down as murderers say then what do you propose to do i propose seсor that at the first light of dawn we should take the mules and ride away the forest is dense and it will be difficult to find us in it moreover two days journey will place us beyond the reach of white men tell me lady i added to maya who had returned from the chamber do you know the road i know the road she answered but sirs before you take it it is right that i should tell you something seeing that not to do so would be to make an ill return for all the nobleness which you have shown towards my father and myself saving us from death and shame you have heard my fathers words and they are true every one of them but they are not all the truth he rules that city of which he has spoken to you but the nobles there are weary of his rule which at times is somewhat harsh also they deem him mad it was for this reason that they suffered him to wander forth seeking the fulfilment of a prophecy in which none of them have faith for they were certain that he would perish in the wilderness and return no more to trouble them then why did they allow you who are his heiress to accompany him lady because i would have it so i love my father and if he was doomed to die because of his folly it was my wish to die with him moreover if you would know the truth i hate that city where i was born and the man in it to whom i am destined to be married and desired to escape from it if only for a while and does that man hate you lady no she answered turning her head aside but if he loves me i believe that he loves power more had i stayed although i am a woman my father must have appointed me to rule in his place and tikal my cousin would have been next the throne not on it therefore it was that he consented to my going or at the least i think so sirs i learn now that you are to accompany us to the city of the heart should we live to reach it and for my own part i rejoice at this though i should be glad if our faces were set towards some other land but i learn also that you have entered into a compact with my father under which he is to give you the gold you need and many great things are to happen having for their end the setting up of the indian people above the white men and the raising of the city of the heart to the place and power that she has lost which according to the prophecy shall come about after the two halves of the broken symbol are set once more in the place that is prepared for them do you not believe then in the prophecy asked the seсor quickly i did not say so she answered certainly it is strange that by following a dream my father should have found that which he sought so eagerly the trinket that your companion bears upon his breast and yet i will say this that i have no great faith in priests and visions and gods for of these it seems there have been many and she glanced at the walls of the temple that were sculptured over with the demons which our forefathers worshipped then added indeed if i understand aright you sire follow a faith that is unknown to us we follow the true faith i answered all the rest are false it may be so she said but i know not how this saying will sound in the ears of the servants of the heart of heaven come if you will but be warned my people are a jealous people and the name of a stranger is hateful to them few such have ever reached the city of the heart for many generations and of those save for one or two none have escaped from it alive they do not desire new things they have little knowledge of the world beyond their walls and seek for none they wish to live as their forefathers lived careless of a future which they will never see and i think that it must go very ill with any who come among them bringing new faiths and doctrines seeking to take power from their hands and to awake them from their narrow sloth now sirs choose whether you will accompany us in our march towards the city of waters or whether you will set your face to the sea again and forget that you chanced to hear a certain story from a wandering doctor whose misfortunes had made him mad and an indian girl who tended him now i listened to these words which the lady maya spoke very earnestly and with power and understood that they meant much they meant that in going to the city of the heart we were as she believed going to our doom lady i said it may well chance that death waits me yonder but i have looked too often in his eyes of late to shun them now death is everywhere lady and did men stop to let him pass little work would be done in the world i have my task to do or to attempt and it seems that it lies yonder in the secret city therefore thither i shall go if my strength does not fail me and fate will suffer it come what may i travel with your father towards the city of the heart for the seсor here it is different weeks ago i told him that no good could come to him from this journey and what i said then i say now he has heard your words and if he will hearken to them and to mine he will bid us farewell tomorrow and go his ways leaving us to go ours she listened and turning towards him said you hear what say you white man and it seemed to me who was watching her that she awaited his answer anxiously yes lady i hear he replied with a laugh and doubtless it is all true enough and i shall leave my bones yonder among your countrymen well so be it i have determined to go not in order to regenerate the race of indians or any other race but that i may see this city and go i will since other things apart i am too idle to change my mind also it seems to me that after this days business there is more danger in staying here than in pushing forward i am glad that you are going since you go of your own free will she said smiling may our fears be confounded and your journey and ours prove prosperous and now let us rest for you must be very weary as i am and we should be stirring before the dawn next morning at the first break of light we started upon our journey riding on three of the mules that we had captured and leading the fourth laden with our goods and waterskins very glad were all of us to see the last of that ruined temple and yet it was sad to me to leave it for there hidden beneath some of the masses of the fallen masonry lay all that was left of my friend and fosterbrother molas he whose bravery and wit had saved our lives at the cost of his own our plan was to avoid villages where we might be seen by men and to keep ourselves hidden in the forest for we feared lest we should be followed and brought to judgment because of the death of don pedro and his companions this as it chanced we were able to do since having guns and ammunition in plenty we shot birds and deer for our daily food travelling thus on muleback soon our strength returned to us even to the old man zibalbay who had suffered the most from fatigue and from illtreatment at the hands of the mexicans in something less than a week we had passed through the inhabited districts of yucatan and far out of reach of the white man and now were journeying through the forest towards the great sierra that lies beyond it to find a way in this thick and almost endless forest appeared impossible indeed it would have been so but for the knowledge that zibalbay and his daughter had gathered on their path seaward and for an ancient map which they brought with them on this map were traced the lines of the roads that in the days of indian civilisation pierced the country in every direction one of these roads the largest ran from the mountain range which surrounds the lake of the city of the heart straight across sierras and through woodlands to the ruined town of palenque and thence to the coast this road or rather causeway was in many places utterly overgrown by trees and in others sunk in swamps or hidden by the dust and sand of the sierras sometimes for two or three days journey there was nothing to show us that it had ever existed still by following the line traced upon the map and from time to time taking our position by the ruins of cities marked thereon we never failed to find it again the number of these old cities and temples was wonderful and astonished the seсor beyond measure which is not strange seeing that he was the first white man who had ever looked upon them often as we rode he would talk to me about them and strive to paint in words a picture of this country now but desert plains or tangled bush as it must have been five hundred years or more before our day when cities and villages palaces and temples crowded with tens of thousands of inhabitants were to be seen everywhere and the fertile face of the earth was hidden in the green of crops what histories lay buried in those jungles and what scenes must have been enacted on the crumbling pyramids which confronted us day by day before the sword of the conqueror or the breath of pestilence or both made the land desolate then it would have been a sight worth seeing and our hearts beat at the thought that if things went well with us it might be our fortune to witness that sight that our eyes might behold the greatest of these cities sought for many generations but as yet unfound the very navel of this ancient and mysterious civilisation dying indeed but still existent i had other hopes to draw me onward but as i believe it was this desire that sustained the seсor in many a difficulty and danger of our march it was with him while he was hacking a mulepath through the scrub with his machete when we toiled along hour after hour beneath the burning sun and even at night as he lay overtired and sleepless tormented by insects and aching with fever filled with this thought he was never weary of questioning the silent zibalbay as to the history or rather the legend of the land through which we journeyed or of listening to the lady mayas descriptions of the city of the heart till even she grew tired and begged him to speak instead of the country across the water where he was born of its ceaseless busy life and the wonders of civilisation strange as it may seem i who watched them both from day to day know it to be true that she was in mind the more modern of the two so much so indeed that in listening to their talk i might have fancied that maya was the child of the new world filled with the spirit of today and he the heir of a proud and secret race dying beneath its weight of years i cannot understand you she would say to him why do you so love histories and ruins and stories of people that have long been dead i hate them once they lived and doubtless were well enough in their place and time but now they are past and done with and it is we who live live live and she stretched out her arms as though she would clasp the sunshine to her breast i tell you she went on that this home of mine of which you are so fond of talking is nothing but a great buryingplace and those who dwell in it are like ghosts who wander to and fro thinking of the things that they did or did not do a thousand years before it was their ancestors who did the things not they for they do nothing except plot against each other eat sleep drink and mumble prayers to a god in whom they do not believe did my father but know it he wastes time and trouble in making plans for the redemption of the people of the heart who think him mad for his pains they cannot be redeemed were it otherwise do you suppose that they would have been content to sit still all these hundreds of years knowing nothing of the great world outside of them and day by day watching their numbers dwindle till life but flickers in the race as in a dying lamp so it is also if in a less degree with those indians whom don ignatio here seeks to lift out of the mire into which the spanish trod them sirs i believe that our blood has had its day there is no more growth in us we are corn ripe for the sickle of death that is most of us are therefore if i could have my will while i am still young i would turn my back upon this city which you so desire to see taking with me the wealth that is useless there but which it seems would bring me many good things in other lands and live out my time among people who have a present and a future as well as a past then the seсor would laugh and argue that the past is more than the present and that it is better to be dead than alive and many other such follies and i would grow angry and reprove maya for her words which shocked me whereat she would yawn and talk of something else for i and my discourses wearied her only zibalbay took no heed for his mind was set upon other things even if he heard us which i doubt but all this while notwithstanding her light talk and careless manner the lady maya was learning yes even from me when the seсor was not at hand for she would inquire into everything and forget nothing that she heard the history of the countries of the world their modes of government and religions the manners customs and appearance of their inhabitants he told her of them all from day to day nor did she weary of listening till at length the seсor met with an adventure that went near to separating him from her for ever and showed me although i had no great love for her or any of her sex that whatever might be her faults this womans heart was true and bold chapter xii maya descends the cueva one evening it was after we had left the forest country and with much toil climbed the sierra till we reached the desert beyond a desert that seemed to be boundless we set our camp amongst a clump of great aloes that grew at the foot of a stony hill this hill was marked on zibalbays map as being the site of an underground reservoir known as a cueva whence in the old days when this place was inhabited the indians drew their supply of water in the dry season from deep down in the bowels of the earth that this particular cueva existed was proved by the fact that the ancient road which here was plainly visible ran through the ruins of a large town whereof the population must once have been supplied by it but when zibalbay and his daughter slept at the spot on their downward journey they were spared the necessity of looking for it by the discovery of a rainpool in the hollow of a rock now however no rain having fallen for weeks after we had eaten and drunk such water as remained in the waterskins we determined to seek for the cueva in order to refill the skins and give drink to the thirsty mules accordingly we began to examine the rocky hill and presently found a stone archway now nearly filled up with soil and half hidden by thorn bushes which from its appearance and position we judged to be the entrance to the cueva having provided ourselves with an armful of torches made from the dead stems of a variety of aloe that grew around in plenty we lit four of them and i led the way through the hole to find myself in a cave where a great and mysterious wind blew and sighed in sudden gusts that almost extinguished our lights following this cave we came to a pit or shaft at the end of it which evidently led to the springs of water this shaft of unknown depth was almost if not quite as smooth and perpendicular as though it had been hollowed by the hand of man but the strangest thing about it was the terrible stairway that the ancients had used to approach the water consisting as it did of a double row of notches eight or ten inches deep cut in the surface of the shaft up and down these notches the watercarriers must have passed for generations for they were much worn and a groove made by the feet of men ran to the top of this awful ladder the seсor finding a fragment of rock let it fall over the edge of the pit and several seconds passed before a faint sound told us that it had touched the bottom what a dreadful place he said i think that i had rather die of thirst than attempt to go down it still people have gone down in the past answered maya for look this is where they stepped off the edge perhaps they had a rope to hold by lady i suggested when i was a young man i have descended mines almost as steep with no other ladder than one made of treetrunks monkeypoles they are called notched after this fashion and set from side to side of the shaft but now it would be my death to try for such heights make me dizzy come away said zibalbay none of us here could take that road and live the mules must go thirsty five hours journey away there is a pool where they can drink tomorrow then we turned and left this cave of the winds and were glad to be outside of it for the place had an unholy look and all the draught notwithstanding was hot to suffocation zibalbay walked to the camp but we stayed to pluck some forage for the mules soon the others grew weary of this task and fell to talking as they watched the sunset which was very beautiful on these lonely plains presently i heard the lady maya say pick me that flower friend to wear upon my breast and she pointed to a snowwhite cactusbloom that grew amongst some rocks the seсor climbed to the place and stretched out his hand to cut the flower when of a sudden i heard him utter an exclamation and saw him start what is it i said have you pricked yourself or cut your hand he made no answer but his eyes grew wide with horror and he pointed at something grey that was gliding away among the stones and as he pointed i saw a spot of blood appear upon his wrist maya saw it also a snake has bitten you she cried in a voice of agony and springing at him before i guessed what she was about to do she seized his arm with both hands and set her lips to the wound he tried to wrench it free but she clung to him fiercely then calling to me to bring a stick she tore a strip off her robe and made it fast round his wrist above the puncture by now i was there with the stick and setting it in the loop of linen i twisted it till the hand turned blue from the pressure what snake was it i asked the deadly grey sort he answered adding dont look so frightened maya i know a cure come to the camp quick in two minutes we reached it and the seсor had snatched a sharp knife and a powderflask now friend he said handing me the knife cut deep since it is life or death for me and there are no arteries in the top of the wrist seeing what had come about zibalbay held the seсors hand and i cut twice he never winced but at each slash maya groaned then having let the blood fall till it would run no more we poured powder into the wound as much as will lie on a twenty cent piece and fired it it went off in a puff of white smoke leaving the flesh beneath black and charred now as we have no brandy there is nothing more to be done except to wait said the seсor with an attempt at a smile but zibalbay going to a bag produced from it some cuca paste eat this he said it is better than any firewater the seсor took the stuff and began to swallow it till presently i saw that he could force no more down for a paralysis seemed to be creeping over him his throat contracted and his eyelids fell as though weighed upon by irresistible sleep now notwithstanding our remedies seeing that the poison had got hold of him we seized him by the arms and began to walk him to and fro encouraging him at the same time to keep a brave heart and fight against death i am doing my best he answered feebly then his mind began to wander and at length he fell down and his eyes shut a great fear and horror seized me for i thought that he was about to die and with them a kind of rage because i was impotent to save him already to tell the truth i was jealous of the lady maya and now my jealousy broke out in bitter and unjust words this is your fault i said you are cruel she answered and you speak thus because you hate me perhaps i am cruel lady would not you be cruel if you saw the friend you love perishing through a womans folly are you the only one that can love she whispered unless we can rouse him the white man will die said zibalbay oh awake cried maya despairingly placing her lips close to the seсors ear they say that i have killed you awake awake he seemed to hear her for though his eyes did not open he smiled faintly and murmured i will try then with our help he struggled from the ground and began to walk once more but like a man who is drunk thrice he staggered backwards and forwards along the path our feet had worn then he fell again and putting our hands upon his breast we could feel the contractions of his heart growing weaker every moment till at last they seemed to die away but of a sudden when we had already abandoned hope it pulsed violently and from every pore of his skin which till now had been parched and dry there burst so profuse a perspiration that in the light of the rising moon we could see it running down his face i think that the white man will live now he has conquered the poison said zibalbay quietly and hearing his words i returned thanks to god in my heart then we laid him in a hammock piling blankets and serapes over him till at length the perspiration ceased all the fluid in his body having evaporated taking the venom with it for an hour or more he slept then awoke and asked for water in a faint voice we who were watching looked at each other in dismay for we had not a single drop to give and this we were obliged to tell him he groaned and was silent for a while then said it would have been kinder to let me die of the poison for this torment of thirst is more than i can bear can we try the cueva faltered maya it is impossible answered her father we should all be killed yes yes repeated the seсor it is impossible better that one should die than four father said maya you must take the best mule and ride forward to the pool where we should camp tomorrow the moon shines and with good fortune you may be back in eight or nine hours it is useless murmured the seсor i can never live so long without drink my throat is hot like a coal zibalbay shrugged his shoulders he also thought that it was useless but his daughter turned upon him fiercely and said are you going or shall i ride myself then he went muttering in his beard and in a few minutes we heard the footsteps of the mule as it shambled forward into the desert fear not i said to the seсor it is the poison that has dried you up but thirst will not kill you so soon and presently you will feel it less oh that we had medicine here to make you sleep he lay quiet for a space giving no answer but from the workings of his hands and face we could see that he suffered much maya he said at length can you find me a cool stone to put in my mouth she searched and found a pebble which he sucked but after a time it fell from his lips and we saw that it was as dry as when it entered them then of a sudden his brain gave way and he began to rave huskily in many languages are you devils he asked that you suffer me to die in torment for the want of a drink of water why do you stand there and mock me oh have pity and give me water for a while we bore it though perhaps our agonies were greater than his own then maya rose and looked at his face it was sunken as with a heavy illness thick black rings had appeared beneath his blue eyes and his lips were flecked with blood i can endure this no more she said in a dry voice watch your friend don ignatio you are right i answered this is no place for a woman go and sleep yonder so that i can wake you if there is need she looked at me reproachfully but went without answering and sat down behind a bush about thirty yards away here it seems for all this story she told me afterwards and for the most part i do but repeat her words she began to think she was sure that without water the seсor could not live through the night and it was impossible that her father should return before dawn at the earliest he was dying and she felt as though her life were ebbing with his own for now she knew that she loved him unless something could be done he must soon be dead and her heart would be broken only one thing could save him and her water in the depths of yonder hill within a few paces of her doubtless it lay in plenty but who would venture to seek it there and yet the descent of the cueva must be possible since the ancients used it daily and why could she not do what they had done she was young and active and from childhood it had been a delight to her to climb in dangerous places about the walls and pyramids of the city of the heart nor had her head failed her however lofty they might chance to be why then should it fail her now when the life of the man she loved was at stake and what would it matter if it did fail her seeing that if he died she wished to die also yes she would try it when once she had made up her mind maya set about the task swiftly i was standing by the hammock praying to heaven to spare the life of my friend who lay there beating his hands to and fro and moaning in misery when i saw her creep up and look at him you think you love him she said to me suddenly but i tell you that you do not know what love is if i live i whom you despise will teach you don ignatio i took no heed of her words for i thought them foolish then unseen by me maya glided away to where the mules were picketed and provided herself with flint steel tinder a rope and a small waterskin of untanned hind which she strapped upon her shoulders in another minute she was running across the desert like a deer at the entrance to the cueva she paused to gather up the aloe torches which had been thrown down there and also to look for one moment at the familiar face of night the night that she might never see again then she lit a torch and crept through the narrow opening the place had been awful in the evening when she visited it in the company of the rest of us now alone and at night it appalled her great winds roared round its vast recesses sucked thither from the hollows of the earth and in them could be heard sounds like to those of human voices sobbing and making moan myra shivered for she thought that these were the ghosts of dead antiguos bewailing their eternal griefs in this unearthly place but she pressed forward boldly notwithstanding her fears till she stood on the brink of the pit here she halted to strip herself so that there might be as little as possible to impede her movements in climbing the stair and twisted her hair into a knot next she tied the cord about her middle and the waterskin to which she fastened the flint and steel upon her shoulders lighting two of the largest torches she fixed them slantingwise in crevices of the rock so that their flame shone over the mouth of the shaft down which she threw first a bundle of unlit torches and lastly one on fire this torch did not go out as she half expected that it would for presently looking down the pit she saw a spark of light shining a hundred and fifty feet or more beneath her now all her preparations were complete and nothing remained to be done except to descend and search for the water for a moment maya hesitated looking at the spark of fire that gleamed so far below and at the narrow niches cut in the smooth surface of the rock then feeling that if she stood longer thus her terrors would master her she knelt down and holding to the rock with her hands she thrust her leg over the edge of the pit feeling at its side with her foot till she found the first niche resting her weight on this foot she dropped the other till she reached the second niche which was about eighteen inches lower and ten inches to the left of the first for these niches were cut in a zigzag fashion no being above no no above no and so on now she must face one of the most terrible risks of the descent for it was impossible for her to reach no niche without leaving go of the edge of the pit nor could she get a hold of no with her hand until her foot was in no so that there was no alternative except to balance herself on one leg and placing her palms against the smooth rock slide them down it till her foot rested on no and her fingers in no clinging thus like a fly to the rock she stepped into no and not daring to pause began at once to feel for no in her anxiety she dropped her leg too low and while drawing it back almost overbalanced herself a thrill of horrible fear struck her causing her spine to creep but resting her face against the rock by a desperate effort she retained her presence of mind and in another second was standing in no and holding to no thenceforward the descent was easier since all she had to do was to shift the grip of her hands from hole to hole and remember in which line she must search with her foot for the succeeding niche so far from hindering her the darkness proved a boon since it prevented her from beholding the horror of the place by the time that she was a third of the way down the shaft her courage returned to her and the only fear she felt was lest some of the niches should be broken fortunately this was not the case although one of them was so much worn that her toes slipped out of it and for a second or two she hung by her hands recovering herself she went on from step to step till at length she stood at the bottom of the shaft after a minutes pause to get her breath maya found one of the dry aloe stems and lit it at the embers of the torch which she had thrown down the pit then she looked round her to find herself in a large natural cavern of no great height which sloped gently downwards further than she could see turning her eyes to the floor she searched for and discovered the path that had been hollowed out by the feet of the ancients but now was half hidden in sand and dust it ran straight down the cave and she followed it for fifty paces or more holding the light in one hand and some spare torches under her arm here in this cave the atmosphere was so hot and still that she was scarcely able to breathe though even at a distance she could hear a strange eddying wind roaring in the shaft down which she had come presently the cavern began to decrease in size till it narrowed into a small passage and maya sighed aloud fearing lest she should be coming to the mouth of a second shaft for she had heard me say that the water in these cuevas was sometimes found at a depth of five or six hundred feet whereas she had not descended more than two hundred when she had walked another ten or fifteen paces however the passage took a sudden turn and her doubts were set at rest for there in the centre of a wonderful place such as she had never seen before gleamed the water which she had risked her life to reach how large the place where she found herself might be maya never knew since the feeble light of her torch did not pierce far into the gloom all that she could see was a number of white columns without doubt stalactites though she imagined them to have been fashioned by man rising from the floor of the cavern to its roof and in the midst of them a circular pit thirty feet or more across in which lay the water this water though clear as crystal was not still for once in every few seconds a great bubble three or four feet in diameter rose in the centre of the pool to burst on its surface and send a ring of ripples to the rocky sides so beautiful was this bubble and so regular its appearance that for some minutes maya watched it then remembering that she had no time to spare she set herself to get the water only to learn that she was confronted by a new difficulty and one which but for her foresight might have proved insuperable the rock bank of the pool was so smooth and sloped so steeply to the water that it was quite impossible for anyone to keep a footing on it the ancients had overcome the trouble by means of a wooden staircase as was evident from the places hollowed in the rock to receive the uprights but this structure had long since rotted away at the head of where this staircase had stood a hole was bored in the rock doubtless to receive a rope by which the waterbearers supported themselves while they filled their jars and the sight of this hole gave maya a thought untying the cord which she had brought with her she made it fast through the hole and having fixed the torch into one of the spaces hollowed to hold the timbers of the stairway she slid down the bank till she stood breast high in the water for a minute or more she remained thus drinking her fill and enjoying the coolness of her bath which was pleasing after the stupefying heat of the caves then first having taken care to remove the tinder that was tied to it she slipped the waterskin from her shoulder washed it out filled and replaced it next she dragged herself up the bank and by the light of a new torch started for the foot of the shaft here maya rested awhile gathering up her energies then feeling that once more she began to grow afraid she commenced the ascent there were a hundred and one of the notches for she had counted them as she came down and now again she began to count so that she might know her exact position in the shaft of which she could see nothing because of the intense darkness before she had ascended fifty steps she was dismayed to find a feeling of weariness taking possession of her which forced her to pause awhile hanging to the face of the pit then she went on again and with great efforts reached the seventyfifth step where once more she was obliged to hang gaining breath till a pain in her right leg upon which most of her weight rested warned her that she must stay no longer for the third time she struggled upwards desperately and despairingly dragging her feet from niche to niche her breath came in gasps the straps of the heavy waterskin cut into her tender flesh and her brain began to reel now there were but ten more steps it came into her mind that she might save herself by loosing the burden of water from her shoulders to fall to the bottom of the pit but this she would not do now only three niches remained and the goal would be won but now also her brain was giving darker and more bewildered it grew yet by a desperate effort she kept some fragment of her sense her foot was in the topmost hole her body was balanced upon the edge of the pit and pulled down by the choking weight of the water she was like to fall backwards then it seemed that a voice called her and for the last time she struggled writhing forward as does a wounded snake till darkness closed in upon her mind when maya recovered a while later she found that she was lying on the edge of the shaft over which her feet still hung instantly she remembered all and with a little scream of terror drew herself along the floor then with difficulty for she was still breathless and her muscles seemed to have no strength she rose to her feet and having felt for and picked up her linen robe she crept towards the spot of light which marked the entrance to the cave presently she was through it and with a sigh of thankfulness sank to the earth and put on her garment then rising she walked slowly towards the camp bearing the precious water with her meanwhile knowing nothing of all this i ignatio also had been thinking i remembered how when i lay crushed beneath the rock the seсor had ventured his life to save me should i not then venture mine to save his it seemed so without water he would certainly die and greatly as i dreaded to attempt the descent of the cueva yet it must be done leaving the hammock i searched for the lady maya but could not find her so i called aloud seсora seсora where are you seсora here she answered what is it is he dead no i said but i am sure that unless he has water he will die within little more than an hour therefore i have made up my mind to try to descend the cueva will you be so good as to watch the seсor till i return and if i return no more as is probable to tell your father what has happened he will find the talisman of the broken heart lying with my clothes at the mouth of the pit i pray that he will take it and i pray also that he should travel back to mexico bearing with him some of the wealth of his city there to continue the great work that i have begun of which i have spoken to him farewell seсora stop don ignatio said maya in a hoarse voice there is no need for you to descend the cueva why not lady i should be glad to escape the task but this is a question of life or death yes she answered and because it is a question of life or death don ignatio i have already climbed that hideous place and here is the water and she fell forward and swooned upon the ground i said nothing i was too much amazed and indeed too much ashamed to speak lifting mayas senseless form i placed her in a hammock that was slung close by then i took the waterskin and a leather cup and ran with it to my friends side by now the seсor was lost in a coma and lay still only moaning from time to time undoing the mouth of the skin i poured out a cupful of water with which i began to sprinkle his brow and to moisten his cracked lips at the touch and smell of the fluid a change came over the face of the dying man the empty look left it and the eyes opened that was water he muttered i can taste it then he saw the cup and the sight seemed to give him a sudden strength for he stretched out his arms and snatching it from my hand he drained it in three gulps more he gasped more but as yet i would give him no more though he prayed for it piteously and when i did allow him to drink again it was in sips only for an hour he sipped thus till at length even his thirst was partially satisfied and the shrunken cheeks began to fill out and the dull eyes to brighten that water has saved my life he whispered where did it come from i will tell you tomorrow i answered sleep now if you can chapter xiii ignatios oath at sunrise on the following day i lit a fire by which to prepare soup for the seсor who still slept and as i was engaged thus i saw the lady maya walking towards me and noticed that her hands and feet were swollen seсora i said bowing before her i humbly congratulate you upon your courage and your escape from great dangers last night i said words to you in my grief that should not have been spoken for it is my fault that i am apt to be unjust to women i crave your pardon and i will add that if in atonement for my past injustice i can serve you in any way now and afterwards i pray you to command me she listened and answered i thank you for your kind words don ignatio and i forget other words that were not kind which you have spoken to me from time to time if in truth you wish to show yourself my friend it is in your power to do so you have guessed my secret therefore i am not ashamed to repeat that the seсor yonder has become everything to me though as yet i may be little to him i ask you then to swear upon the heart that you will do nothing to turn him from me or to separate us should he ever learn to love me but rather should this come about that whatever may be our need you will help us by all means in your reach you ask me to swear a large oath seсora and one that deals with the future of which we have no knowledge i answered hesitating i do seсor but remember that were it not for me at this moment your friend who sleeps yonder like a child would be stiff in death remember also that you have ends to gain in the city of the heart where it will be well for you to keep me as a friend should we ever live to reach it still do not swear unless you wish only then i shall know that you are my secret enemy and i shall be yours there is no need to threaten me seсora i answered nor am i to be moved thus but i promise that i will not stand between you and the seсor why should i his will is his own and as you say you saved his life but see he awakes and his soup is ready she took the pot off the fire skimmed it and poured the contents into a gourd shall i take it or will you she asked i think that you had better take it i answered then she walked to the hammock and said seсor here is your soup he was but newly awakened and looked at her vacantly tell me maya he asked what has happened last evening she began in picking a flower for me you were bitten by a snake and very nearly died i know he answered without doubt i should have died had you not sucked the wound and tied a bandage round my wrist for that grey snake is the deadliest in the country go on after the danger of the poison was past you became thirsty so thirsty that you were dying of it and there was no water to give you yes yes he said it was agony i pray that i may never suffer so again but i drank water and lived who brought it to me my father started on to the next campingplace where there is a pool she answered has he returned no not yet then he cannot have brought the water where did it come from it came from the cueva that cave which we examined before you were bitten who went down the cueva to get it the place is unclimbable i went down you he said in amazement you it is not possible do not jest tell me the truth quickly i am tired i am not jesting listen seсor you were dying for want of water dying before our eyes it was horrible to see i could not bear it and i knew that my father would not be back in time so i took the waterskin and some torches and went without saying anything to ignatio the shaft was hard to climb and the adventure strange i will tell you of that by and by but as it chanced i came through it safely to find ignatio about to start on the same errand the seсor heard and understood but he made no answer he only stretched out his arms towards her and there and thus in the wilderness did they plight their troth remember that i am but an indian girl she murmured presently and you are one of the white lords of the earth is it well that you should love me it is well he answered for you are the noblest woman that i have known and you have saved my life zibalbay did not return till past midday when he appeared with the water leading the mule which had set its foot upon a sharp stone in the desert and gone lame does he still live he asked of maya yes father he must be strong then he whispered i thought that thirst would have killed him ere now he has had water father i descended the cueva and fetched it she added after a moments pause the old man looked at her amazed how came it that you found courage to go down that place daughter he asked at length the desire to save a friend gave me courage she answered letting her eyes fall beneath his gaze i knew that you could not be back in time so i went zibalbay pondered awhile then said i think that you would have done better to let him die daughter for i believe that this white man will bring trouble upon us it has pleased the gods to preserve you alive remember then that your life belongs to them and that you must follow the path which they have chosen not that which you would choose for yourself remember also that one waits you in the city yonder who may have a word to say as to your friendship with this wanderer and he passed on with the mule that same evening maya told me of her fathers words and said i think that before all is done i shall need the help that you have sworn to give me seсor for i can see well that my father will be against me unless my wish runs with his purpose of one thing i am sure that my life is my own and not a possession of the gods for in such gods as my father worships and i was brought up to serve i have lost faith if indeed i ever had any you speak rashly i answered and if you are wise you will not let your father hear such words lest by and by my life should be forfeit to the gods whom i blaspheme she broke in say then do you believe in these gods don ignatio no lady i am a christian and have no part with idols or those who worship them i understand it is only in their wealth that you would have part well and why should i not become a christian also i have learned something of your faith from the seсor yonder and see that it is great and pure and full of comfort for us mortals may grace be given to you to follow in that road lady but it is not christian to taunt me about the wealth which i come to seek for the advantage of our race seeing that you know i ask nothing for myself forgive me she answered my tongue is sharp as yours has been at times don ignatio hark the seсor calls me for two more days we rested there by the cueva till the seсor was fit to travel then we started on again ten days we journeyed across the wilderness following the line of the ancient road and meeting with no traces of man save such as were furnished by the familiar sight of ruined pyramids and temples on the eleventh we began to ascend the slope of a lofty range of mountains that pushed its flanks far out into the desertland and on the twelfth we reached the snowline where we were obliged to abandon the three mules which remained to us seeing that no green food was to be found higher up and the path became too steep for them to find a footing in it that night we slept with little to eat in a hole dug in the snow wrapped in our serapes or rather we tried to sleep for our rest was broken by the cold and the moaning of bitter and mysterious winds which sprang up and passed away suddenly beneath a clear sky also from time to time by the thunder of distant avalanches rushing from the peaks above how far must we travel up this snow i asked of zibalbay as we stood shivering in the ashy light of the dawn look yonder he answered pointing to where the first ray of the sun shone upon a surface of black rock far above us there is the highest point and we should reach it before nightfall thus encouraged we pushed forward for hour after hour zibalbay marching ahead in silence until our sight was bewildered with snowblindness and i was seized with a fit of mountain sickness fortunately the climbing was not difficult so that by four in the afternoon we found ourselves beneath the shadow of the wall of black rock must we scale that precipice i asked of zibalbay no he answered it would not be possible without wings there is a way through it twice in the old days bodies of white men searching for the golden city to sack it came to this spot but finding no path through the cliff they went home again though their hands were on the door does the wall of rock encircle all the valley of the city asked the seсor no white man it ends many days journey away to the west but he who would travel round it must wade through a great swamp also the mountains may be crossed to the east by journeying for three days through snows and down precipices but so far as i have learned only one man lived to pass them a wandering indian who found his way to the banks of the holy waters in the days of my grandfather now stay here while i search are you glad to see the gateway of your home maya asked the seсor no she answered almost fiercely for here in the wilderness i have been happy but there sorrow awaits me and you oh if indeed i am dear to you let us turn even now and fly together back to the lands where your people live and she clasped his hand and looked earnestly into his eyes what he answered and leave your father and ignatio to finish the journey by themselves you are more to me than my father though perhaps the solemn ignatio is more to you than i am no maya but having come so far i wish to see the sacred city as you will she said letting fall his hand see my father has found the place and calls us we walked on for about a hundred paces threading our path through piles of boulders that lay at the foot of the precipice till we came to where zibalbay stood leaning against the wall of rock in which we could see no break or opening although i trust you and as i believe heaven has brought us together for its own purposes said the old cacique yet i must follow the ancient custom and obey my oath to suffer no stranger to see the entrance to this mountain gate come hither daughter and blindfold these foreigners she obeyed and as she tied the handkerchief about the seсors face i heard her whisper fear not i will be your eyes then we were taken by the hand and led this way and that till we were confused after we had walked some paces we were halted and left while as we judged from the sounds our guides moved something heavy next we were conducted down a steep incline through a passage so narrow and low that our shoulders rubbed the sides of it and in parts we were obliged to bend our heads at length after taking many sharp turns the passage grew wider and the path smooth and level loose the bandages said the voice of zibalbay maya did so and when our eyes were accustomed to the light we looked round us curiously to find that we stood at the bottom of a deep cleft or volcanic rift in the rock made not by the hand of man but by that of nature working with her tools of fire and water this cleft along which ran a road so solidly built and drained that save here and there where snowdrifts blocked it it was still easily passable after centuries of disuse did not measure more than forty paces from wall to wall on either side of it towered sheer black cliffs honeycombed with doorways that could only have been reached by ladders what are those i asked of zibalbay buryingplaces no he answered dwellinghouses they were there so say the records before our forefathers founded the city of the heart and in them dwelt cavemen barbarians who fed on little and did not feel the cold it was by following some of these cavemen through that passage which we have passed that the founder of the ancient city discovered this cleft and the good country and great lake that lie beyond it where the rockdwellers whom our forefathers killed out used to live in the winter season once when i was young with some companions i entered these caves by means of ropes and ladders and found many strange things there such as stone axes and rude ornaments of gold relics of the barbarians but let us press on or night will overtake us in the pass by degrees the great cleft that had widened as we walked began to narrow again till it appeared to end in a second wall of rock passing round a boulder that lay at the foot of this wall zibalbay led the way into a tunnel behind it do not fear the darkness he said the passage is short and there are no pitfalls so we followed the sound of his footsteps through the gloom till presently a spot of light appeared before us and in another minute we stood on the further side of the mountain though we could see nothing of the place because of the falling shadows without pausing zibalbay pushed on down the hill and suddenly turning to the right stopped before the door of a house built of hewn stone enter he said and welcome to the country of the people of the heart as the door was thrown open light from the fire within streamed through it and a mans voice was heard asking who is there without answering zibalbay walked into the room it was a low vaulted apartment and at a table placed before the great fire which burnt upon the hearth sat a man and a woman eating is this the way that you watch for my return he asked in a stern voice haste now and make food ready for we are starved with cold and hunger the man who had risen stood hesitating but the woman whose position enabled her to see the face of the speaker caught him by the arm saying down to your knees husband it is the cacique come back pardon cried the man taking the hint but to be frank o lord it has been so dinned in my ears down in the city yonder that neither you nor the lady of the heart would ever return again that i thought you must be ghosts yes and so they will think in the city where i have heard that tikal rules in your place peace said zibalbay frowning heavily we left robes here did we not go lay them out in the sleepingchambers and with them others for these my guests while the woman prepares our meat the man bowed stretching out his arms till the backs of his hands touched the ground then taking an earthenware lamp from a side table he lit it and disappeared behind a curtain an example which the woman followed after she had rapidly removed the dishes that were upon the table and fed the fire with wood when they were gone we gathered round the hearth to bask in the luxury of its warmth what is this place asked the seсor zibalbay who was wrapped in his own thoughts did not seem to hear him and maya answered a poor hovel that is used as a resthouse and by hunters of game no more these people are its keepers and were charged to watch for our return but they seem to have fulfilled their task ill pardon me i go to help them come father they went and presently the seсor awoke from a doze induced by the delightful warmth of the fire to see the custodian of the place standing before him staring at him in amazement not unmixed with awe what is the matter with the man and what does he want ignatio he asked in spanish he wonders at your white skin and fair hair seсor and says that he does not dare to speak to you because you must be one of the heavenborn of whom their legends tell wherefore he asks me to say that water to wash in and raiment to put on have been made ready for us if we will come with him accordingly we followed the indian who led us into a passage at the back of the sittingchamber and thence to a small sleepingroom one of several to which the passage gave access in this room which was lit by an oil lamp were two bedsteads covered with blankets of deerskin and cotton sheets and laid upon them were fine linen robes and serapes made in alternate bands of grey and black feathers worked on to a foundation of stout linen standing upon wooden stools in a corner of the room and halffilled with steaming water were two basins which the seсor noticed with astonishment were of hammered silver these people must be rich he said to me so soon as the keeper of the place had gone if they fashion the utensils of their resthouses of silver till now this story of the sacred city of which zibalbay was cacique and maya heiress apparent has always sounded like a fairy tale to me but it seems that it is true after all for the mans manner shows that zibalbay is a very important person then we put on the robes that had been provided for our use not without difficulty since their make was strange to us and returned to the eatingroom presently the curtain was drawn and the lady maya joined us the lady maya but so changed that we started in astonishment different indeed was she to the illclad and travelstained girl who had been our companion for so many weeks now she was dressed in a robe of snowy white bordered with embroidery of the royal green and having the image of the heart traced in gold thread upon the breast on her feet were sandals also worked in green while round her throat wrists waist and ankles shone circlets of dead gold her dark hair no longer fell loose about her but was twisted into a simple knot and confined in a little golden net and from her shoulders hung a cloak of pure white feathers relieved here and there by the delicate yellow plumes of the greater egret like you i have changed my garments she said in explanation is the dress ugly that you look astonished ugly answered the seсor i think it is the most beautiful that i ever saw this is the most beautiful dress that you ever saw why friend it is the simplest that i have wait till you see me in my royal robes wearing the great emeralds of the heart what will you say then i wonder i cannot tell but i say now that i dont know which is the most lovely you or your dress hush she said laughing yet with a note of earnestness in her voice you must not speak thus freely to me yonder in the pass friend i was the indian girl your fellowtraveller here i am the lady of the heart then i wish that you had remained the indian girl in the pass he answered after a pause but perhaps you jest i was not altogether jesting she answered with a sigh you must be careful now or it might be ill for you or me or both of us since by rank i am the greatest lady in this land and doubtless my cousin tikal will watch me closely see here comes my father as she spoke zibalbay entered followed by the two indians bearing food he was simply dressed in a white togalike robe similar to that which had been given to the seсor and myself a cloak of black feathers covered his shoulders and round his neck was hung a massive gold chain to which was attached the emblem of the heart also fashioned in plain gold we noticed that as he came his daughter maya made a courtesy to him which he acknowledged with a nod and that whenever they passed him the two indians crouched almost to the ground evidently the friendship of our desert journeying was done with and the person of whom we had hitherto thought and spoken as an equal must henceforth be treated with respect indeed the proudfaced whitebearded chief seemed so royal in his changed surroundings that we were almost moved to follow the example of the others and bow whenever he looked at us the food is ready said zibalbay such as it is be seated i beg of you nay daughter you need not stand before me we are still fellowwanderers all of us and ceremony can stay till we are come to the city of the heart then we sat down and the indians waited on us what the dishes consisted of we did not know but after our long privations it seemed to us that we had never eaten so excellent a meal or drunk anything so good as the native wine which was served with it still notwithstanding our present comfort i think the seсors heart misgave him and that he had presentiments of evil maya and he still loved one another but he felt that things were utterly changed as she herself had shown him while they wandered in some sense he had been the head of the party as to speak truth among companions of a coloured race a white man is always acknowledged to be by right of blood now things were changed and he must take his place as an alien wanderer admitted to the country upon sufferance and already this difference could be seen in zibalbays manner and mode of address formerly he had called him seсor or even friend tonight when speaking to him he used a word which meant foreigner or unknown one and even myself he addressed by name without adding any title of respect one good thing however we found in this place who had lacked tobacco for six weeks and more for presently the indian entered bearing cigarettes made by rolling the herb in the thin sheath that grows about the cobs of indian corn come hither you said zibalbay to the indian when he had handed us the cigarettes start now to the borders of the lake and advise the captain of the village of the corngrowers that his lord is returned again commanding him in my name to furnish four travelling litters to be here within five hours after sunrise warn him also to have canoes in readiness to bear us across the lake but as he values his life to send no word of our coming to the city go now and swiftly the man bowed and snatching a spear and a feather cloak from a peg near the door vanished into the night heedless of the howling wind and the sleet that thrashed upon the roof how far is it to the village asked the seсor ten leagues or more zibalbay answered and the road is not good still if he does not fall from a precipice or lose his life in a snowdrift he will be there within six hours come daughter it is time for us to rest our journey has been long and you must be weary goodnight to you my guests tomorrow i shall hope to house you better then bowing to us he left the room maya rose to follow his example and going to the seсor gave him her hand which he touched with his lips how good it is to taste tobacco again he said as maya went no dont go to bed yet ignatio take a cigarette and another glass of this agua ardiente and let us talk do you know friend it seems to me that zibalbay has changed i never was a great admirer of his character but perhaps i do not understand it do you not seсor i think that i do like some christian priests the man is a fanatic and like myself a dreamer also he is full of ambition and tyrannical one who will spare neither himself nor others where he has an end to gain or thinks that he can promote the welfare of his country and the glory of his gods think how brave and earnest the man must have been who at the bidding of a voice or a vision dared in his old age unaccompanied save by his only child to lay down his state and travel almost without food through hundreds of leagues of bush and desert that none of his race had crossed for generations think what it must have been to him who for many years has been treated almost as divine to play the part of a medicineman in the forests of yucatan and to suffer in his own person and in that of his daughter insults and torment at the hands of low white thieves yet all this and more zibalbay has borne without a murmur because as he believes the object of his mission is attained but ignatio what is the object of his mission and what have we to do with it to this hour i do not quite know the object of his mission and indeed of his life is to build up the fallen empire of the city of the heart in short seсor though i do not believe in his gods in zibalbays visions i do believe seeing that they have led him to me whose aim is his aim and that neither of us can succeed without the other why not because i need wealth and he needs men and if he will give me the wealth i can give him men in thousands i hear answered the seсor it sounds simple enough but perhaps you will both of you find that there are difficulties in the way what i do not understand however is what part maya and i are to play in this affair who are not anxious to regenerate a race or to build up an empire i suppose that we are only spectators of the game how can that be seсor when she is lady of the heart and heiress to her father and when i added dropping my voice you and she have grown so dear to one another i did not know that you had noticed anything of that ignatio you never seemed to observe our affection and as you hate women so much i did not speak of it he answered colouring i am not altogether blind seсor also is it possible for a man not to know when a woman comes between him and the friend he loves but of that i will say nothing for it is as it should be besides you might scarcely understand me if i did no no seсor you cannot be left out of this game you are too deep in it already though what part you will play i cannot tell it depends perhaps upon what the gods reveal to zibalbay or what he guesses that they reveal at present he is well disposed towards you because he thinks that the oracle may declare you to be the son of quetzal through whom his people shall be redeemed since it seems that here there is some such prophecy and for this reason it is that he has not forbidden the friendship between you and his daughter or so he hinted to me but be warned seсor for if he comes to know that you are not the man then he will sweep you aside as of small account and you may bid farewell to the lady of the heart i will not do that while i live he answered quietly no seсor perhaps not while you live but those who stand in the path of priests and kings do not live long still though there is cause to be cautious there is no cause to be downhearted seeing that if you are not the man i may be in which case i shall be able to help you as i have sworn to the lady maya that i will do or perhaps you will be able to help me at any rate we will stand together said the seсor and now as there is no use in talking of the future i think that we had better go to sleep of one thing however you may be certain unless she dies or i die i mean to marry maya chapter xiv the city of the heart while it was yet dark on the following morning we were awakened by the voice of zibalbay calling us arise he said it is time to start upon our road are the litters here i asked no nor can be for some hours i desire to reach the city this night therefore we must push forward on foot to meet them then we rose and having no choice dressed ourselves as best we could in the garments of the country that had been given to us for our own were but rags in which we were ashamed to be seen in the common room we found zibalbay and the lady maya eat said the old man pointing to food that was ready and let us be going ten minutes later we were outside the house there was no wind but at this great height the air is of so piercing a quality that we were glad to fold our serapes round us and walk briskly forward zibalbay leading the way at first a grey gloom reigned but presently snowy peaks shone through it everywhere radiant with the hues of the unrisen sun although the mountain sides beneath us were still wrapped in night by degrees as the light grew we saw that the country at our feet was shaped like a bowl whereof the mountain range upon which we stood formed the rim and at the bottom of the bowl fed by numberless streams that had their sources among the surrounding snows lay the lake the holy waters of this people of all this however we could as yet see little since the vast expanse beneath us lay hidden in volumes of mist that moved and rolled like the face of ocean never before had we looked upon anything so strange as this dense garment of vapour while the light of heaven gathered upon its surface tingeing it with lines and patches of colour it seemed as though a map of the world was unrolled before us continents seas islands and cities formed themselves only to disappear in quick succession and assume new and endless shapes it is beautiful is it not said maya but wait until the mist breaks look it is beginning as she spoke of a sudden the sea of mist grew thin and opened in its centre and through the gap thus formed showed first the pyramids and temple tops and then the entire panorama of the city heart of the world floating as it were upon the face of the holy waters it was far away but now that the night fog no longer thickened the air so clear was the atmosphere and so high were we above it that it seemed to be almost at our feet the city which appeared to be surrounded by a wall was built of marble or some other snowwhite stone whereon the light gleamed and flashed it stood upon a heartshaped island and round about the shores of this island stretching further than the eye could reach sparkled the blue waters of the holy lake by degrees the ring of mist rolled up the sides of the mountains and vanished and in place of it the round bowl of the valley was filled with the clear light of day now we could see the shores of the lake with their green fringe of reeds and above them grass lands threaded by silver streams and above these again upon the flanks of the mountains great forests of oak and cedars rising almost to the snow line to the right and left of us the huge roundshouldered mountains stretched in a majestic sweep till they melted into the blue of the horizon while here and there some tall snowrobed peak the cone of an extinct volcano towered above us like a sentinel there lies my country said maya with a proud wave of her hand does it please you white man it pleases me so well maya he answered that now less than ever can i understand why you wish to leave it because though lakes and mountains and cities full of wealth are fine things it is not to these but to the men and women among whom we live that we must look for happiness some people might think otherwise maya they might say that happiness must be sought for in ourselves at least i could be happy in such a land as this you think so now she answered meaningly but when you have been awhile in the city yonder you will think otherwise oh she went on passionately if indeed you care for me we should never have crossed that mountain behind us but you do not care for me not truly for all this time you have been half ashamed of your affection for an indian girl whom you were obliged to become fond of because she was pretty and you were so much with her and she chanced to save your life yes you would have been ashamed to marry me according to your customs and to show me as your wife among the white people me the wandering indian with a mad father whom you found in the hands of thieves here it will be different for here at least i am a great lady and you will see the people in the streets bow themselves to the ground before me and if i say that a man shall die you will see that man killed also here i have wealth more than any white woman and you will be fond of me for that you are very unjust he broke in angrily it is shameful that you should speak to me thus for no cause perhaps i am unjust she answered with a sob but there are so many troubles before us first there is tikal what does tikal want asked the seсor he wants to marry me or to become cacique of the city in my right which is the same thing at least he will not give me up without a struggle then there is my father who serves two masters only his gods and his country and who will use me like a piece in a game if it suits his purpose yes and you too our good days are done with the evil ones have to come and after them the night henceforward we shall find few opportunities of speaking even for i shall be surrounded by officers and waitingladies who will watch my every action and hear my every word and my father will watch me also now i begin to be sorry that i did not take your advice and stop on the further side of the mountain answered the seсor do you think that we could escape there no it is too late they would track us down we must go on now and meet our fate whatever it may be only swear to me by my gods or your own or whatever you hold dear that you will cleave to me till i am dead as i will cleave to you and taking his hand in hers she looked up appealingly into his face at this moment zibalbay who was walking in front lost in his own thoughts chanced to turn and see them come hither daughter and you white man he said in a stern voice listen both of you i am old but my sight and hearing are still keen though yonder in the wilderness i took no heed of much that i saw and heard here in my own land it is otherwise learn white man that the lady of the heart is set far above you and there i think she will remain do you understand my meaning perfectly answered the seсor striving to control his anger but chief it is a pity that you did not see well to tell me this before had it not been for what we and one dead were able to do to save you today your bones would have been whitening in the forest why did you not tell me there that i was no fit company for your daughter because you were sent by the gods to do me service and because there i had need of you white man answered zibalbay quietly as may be i shall have need of you again had it not been for that chance we should have parted company on the further side of the mountain in truth i wish that we had exclaimed the seсor i may come to wish it too said the old man grimly but you are here and not there perhaps for so long as you shall live and i would have you remember that you are in my power a word from me will set you high or lay you low beneath the earth therefore be warned and take with gratitude that which it shall please me to give you no do not look behind you escape is impossible submit yourself to my will in this and everything and all shall be well with you struggle against it and i will crush you i have spoken be pleased to walk in front of me and do you my daughter walk behind now i saw that the seсors rage was great and that he was about to answer angrily and lifted my hand in warning while maya looked at him entreatingly he saw and checked himself i hear your words chief he said in a forced voice you are right i am in your power and it is useless for me to answer you and he took his place in front as he had been commanded while maya fell behind as i walked on side by side with zibalbay i spoke to him saying you use sharp words towards him who is my brother chief and therefore towards me i speak as i must he answered coldly many troubles await me at the city did you not hear what that knave said last night that tikal my nephew whom i left in charge rules in my stead well this girl of mine who is affianced to him and through whom he hopes to govern in after years may be the only bait that will tempt him from his place for he looks upon me as one dead and it will not please him to lay down the rod of power how should it please him then and those who follow him to see a white stranger holding that daughters hand and whispering in her ear ignatio i tell you that such a sight would provoke a war against me and therefore it is that i spoke sharply while there is yet time and therefore you will do well to drive the nail home seeing that if i fall your plans will come to nothing and your life be forfeit i made no answer for at that moment we turned a corner and came face to face with the bearers of the litters whom zibalbay had summoned to meet us there were forty of these men or more for the most part they were tall and well shaped with regular features and like zibalbay and maya very fair for indians but the look upon their faces was different from any that i have seen among my people it was not stupid or brutal or even empty rather did it suggest great weariness the youngest man there notwithstanding his rounded cheeks and eyes full of health seemed as though he were weighed down by the memories of many years weariness was the master not of their bodies for they were very strong and active but of their minds and looking at them i could understand what zibalbay meant when he said that his race was outworn even the sight of the white face of the seсor strange as it must have been to them did not seem to move them they stared indeed muttering something to each other as to the length and colour of his beard and that was all but to zibalbay they said in low guttural tones father we salute you then at a signal given by their captain they cast themselves on the ground before him and lay there with outstretched arms as though they were dead rise my children said zibalbay then summoning the captain of the bearers he talked to him while his companions ate food that they had brought with them and i noted that what he heard seemed to give him little pleasure next he ordered us to enter the litters which were of rude make being constructed of chairs without curtains lashed between two poles and carried each of them by eight bearers for the road was very steep and rough we started forward down the mountain and in an hour we had left the region of snow behind and entered the cedar forests these great trees grew in groups which were separated by glades of turf the home of herds of deer so thick was their foliage that a twilight reigned beneath them while from each branch hung a fringe of grey spanish moss that swayed to and fro in the draught of the mountain breeze everywhere stretched vistas that brought to my mind memories of the dimlylighted nave of the great cathedral at mexico roofed by the impenetrable boughs of these cedars whereof the trunks might have been supporting columns and the scent of their leaves the odour of incense after the cedar belt came the oak groves and then miles of beautiful turf slopes clothed in rich grass starred with flowers truly it was a lovely land it was late in the afternoon before we descended the last of these slopes and entered the tract of alluvial soil that lay between them and the lake where the climate was much warmer it was easy to see by the irrigation ditches and other signs that this belt of country had always supplied the inhabitants of the city of the heart with corn and all necessary crops here grew great groves of sugarcane and cocoabushes laden with their purple pods together with many varieties of fruittrees planted in separate orchards soon it became clear to us that the greater part of these ancient orchards were untended since their fruit rotted in heaps upon the ground evidently they had been planted in more prosperous days and now their supply exceeded the wants of the population at length as the evening began to fall we entered the village of corngrowers a halfruined place of which the houses were for the most part built of adobe or mud bricks and roofed with a concrete of white lime in the centre of the village was a plaza planted round with trees and having in its midst a fountain near to which stood a simple altar piled with fruit and flowers close to this altar the inhabitants of the village to the number of a hundred or so were gathered to meet us most of the men had but just come in from their labours for their garments and feet were stained with fresh earth and they held copper hoes and reapinghooks in their hands all these men wore upon their faces the same look of weariness of mind which we had noticed in the bearers so monotonous were their countenances indeed that i turned my eyes impatiently to the group of women who were standing behind them like their husbands and brothers these women were very fair for indians and handsome in person but they also had been stamped with melancholy the sight of the seсors white skin and chestnutcoloured beard seemed for some few moments to rouse them from their attitude of listless indifference soon however they fell into it again and began to chat idly or to play with and pull to pieces the flowers that every one of them wore at her girdle there were hardly any children among the crowd and it was strange to observe how great was the resemblance of the individuals composing it to each other indeed had they all been members of a single family it would not have been more marked seeing that it was difficult for a stranger to distinguish one woman from another of about the same age when zibalbay descended from his litter all those present prostrated themselves and remained thus till followed by some of the headmen he had passed into a house which was made ready for his use leaving us without do all your people look so sad i asked the lady maya yes she answered that is all the common people who labour it is otherwise with the nobles who are of a different blood here don ignatio there are two classes the lords and the people and of the people each family is forced to work for three months in the year the other nine being given to them for rest the fruits of their labour are gathered into storehouses and distributed among all the children of the heart but the temples the cacique and many of the nobles have their own serfs who have served them from father to son and what happens if they will not work asked the seсor then they must starve for nothing is served out to them or their families from the common store and when they grow hungry they are set to the heaviest tasks now we understood why these people looked so weary and listless what could be expected from men and women without ambition or responsibility the gain of whose toil was placed to the public credit and doled out to them in rations in my old age i have heard that there are teachers who advocate such a system for all mankind but of this i am sure that had they dwelt among the people of the heart where it had been in force for many centuries they would cease to preach this doctrine for there at least it did not promote the welfare of the race presently a messenger came from zibalbay to summon us into the house where we found an ample meal prepared consisting chiefly of fish from the lake baked wildfowl and many sorts of fruit by the time we had finished eating and had drunk the chocolate that was served to us in cups of hammered silver the night had fallen completely i asked zibalbay if we should sleep there to which he replied shortly that we were about to start for the city accordingly we set out by the light of the moon and were guided to a little harbour in the shore of the lake where a large canoe fitted with a mast and sail and manned by ten indians was waiting for us we embarked and the wind being off land hoisted the sail and started towards the island of the heart which stood at a distance of about fifteen miles from the mainland the breeze was light but after the cold of the mountains the air was so soft and balmy and the scene so new and strange that i for one did not regret our slow progress nobody spoke in the boat for all of us were lost in our own reflections and the indians were awed to silence by the presence of their lord who alone seemed impatient since from time to time he pulled his beard and muttered to himself so we glided across the blue lake whose quiet was broken only by the whistling wings of the wildfowl travelling to their feeding grounds by the sudden leaps of great fish rising in pursuit of some nightfly and by the lapping of the water against the wooden sides of the canoe before us luminous and unearthly in the perfect moonlight shone the walls and temples of the mysterious city which we had travelled so far to reach we watched them growing more and more distinct minute by minute and as we watched strange hopes and fears took possession of our hearts this was no dream before us lay the fabled golden town we had so longed to see soon our feet would pass its white walls and our eyes behold its ancient civilisation what waits us there whispered the seсor and he looked at maya she heard his words and shook her head sadly there was no hope in her eyes which were dimmed with tears then he turned to me as though for comfort and the easy fires of enthusiasm burnt up within me and i answered fear not the goal is won and we shall overcome all difficulty and danger the useless wealth of yonder golden city will be ours and by its help i shall wreak the storedup vengeance of ages upon the oppressors of my race and create a great indian dominion stretching from sea to sea whereof this city shall be the heart he heard and smiled answering it may be so for your sake i trust that it will be so but we seek different ends ignatio and he looked again at the lady maya on we glided through the moonlight and the silence for from the town came no sound save the cry of the watchmen calling the hours as they kept their guard along the ancient walls till at length we entered the shadow of the holy city lying dark upon the waters and the indians getting out their paddles for the wind no longer served us rowed the canoe up a stoneembanked canal that led to a watergate now we halted in front of the gate where there was no man to be seen in an impatient voice zibalbay bade the captain hail the guardian of the gate and presently a man came down the steps yawning and inquired who was there i the cacique said zibalbay open indeed that is strange answered the man seeing that this night the cacique holds his marriagefeast at the palace yonder and there is but one cacique of the people of the heart get back to the mainland wanderers and return in the daytime when the gates stand wide now when zibalbay heard these words he cursed aloud in his anger but maya started as though with joy i tell you that i am zibalbay come home again your lord and no other he cried and you will be wise to do my bidding the man stared and hesitated till the captain of the boat spoke to him saying fool would you become food for fishes this is the lord zibalbay returned from the dead then he hastened to open the gate as fast as his fear would let him pardon father pardon he cried prostrating himself but the lord tikal who rules in your place has given it out that you were dead in the wilderness and commanded that your name should be spoken no more in the city zibalbay swept by him without a word when he had passed up the marble steps and through the waterway pierced in the thickness of the frowning walls he halted and addressing the captain of the boatmen said let that man be scourged tomorrow at noon in the marketplace that henceforth he may learn not to sleep at his post on the further side of the wall ran a wide street bordered by splendid homes built of white stone which led to the central square of the city a mile or more away up this street we walked swiftly and in silence and as we went i noticed that much of it was grassgrown and that many of the great houses seemed to be deserted indeed though light came from some of the latticed windowplaces i could see no sign of any human being here is the city whispered the seсor to me but where are the people doubtless they celebrate the weddingfeast in the great square i answered hark i hear them as i spoke the wind turned a little and a sound of singing floated down it that grew momentarily clearer as we approached the square another five minutes passed and we were entering it it was a wide place covering not less than thirty acres of ground and in its centre rising three hundred feet into the air gleamed the pyramid of the temple of the heart crowned by the star of holy fire that flickered eternally upon its summit in the open space between the walls of the inclosure of this pyramid and the great buildings that formed the sides of the square the inhabitants of the city were gathered for their midnight feast all were dressed in white robes while many wore glittering feather capes upon their shoulders and were crowned with wreaths of flowers some of them were dancing some of them were singing while others watched the tricks of jugglers and buffoons but the most of their number were seated round little tables eating drinking smoking and making love and we noticed that at these tables the children seemed the most honourable guests and that everybody petted them and waited on their words nothing could be more beautiful or stranger to our eyes than this innocent festival celebrated beneath the open sky and lighted by the moon yet the sight of it did not please zibalbay along the side of the square ran an avenue of trees bearing white flowers with a heavy scent and zibalbay motioned to us to follow him into their shadow many of the tables were placed just beyond the spread of these trees so that he was able to stop from time to time and unseen himself to listen to the talk that was passing at them presently he halted thus opposite to a table at which sat a man of middle age and a woman young and pretty what they said interested him and we who were close by his side understood it for the difference between the dialect of these people and the maya tongue is so small that even the seсor had little difficulty in following their talk the feast is merry tonight said the man yes husband answered his companion and so it should be seeing that yesterday the lord tikal was elected cacique by the council of the heart and today he was wedded in the presence of the people to nahua the beautiful child of the lord mattai it was a fine sight said the man though for my part i think it early to proclaim him cacique zibalbay might yet come back and then zibalbay will never come back husband or the lady maya either they have perished in the wilderness long ago for her i am sorry because she was so lovely and different from other great ladies but i do not grieve much for him for he was a hard taskmaster to us common people also he was stingy why tikal has given more feasts during the last ten months than zibalbay gave in as many years moreover he has relaxed the laws so that we poor women may now wear ornaments like our betters and she glanced at a gold bracelet upon her wrist it is easy to be generous with the goods of others answered the man zibalbay was the bee who stored tikal is the wasp who eats they say that the old fellow was mad but i do not believe it i think that he was a greater man than the rest of us that is all who saw the wasting of the people and desired to find a means to stop it certainly he was mad answered the woman how could he stop the wasting of the people by taking his daughter to wander in the wilderness till they died of starvation both of them if anybody dwells out yonder it is a folk of white devils of whom we have heard who kill and enslave the indians that they may rob them of their wealth and we do not desire that such should be shown the way to our city also what does it matter to us if the people do waste away we have all things that we wish those who come after must see to it yet wife i have heard you say that you desired children suddenly the womans face grew sad ah she answered if zibalbay will give me a child i will take back all my words about him and proclaim him the wisest of men instead of what he is or rather was an old fool gone crazy with vanity and too much praying but he is dead and if he were not he could never do this that is beyond the power of the gods themselves if indeed the gods are anything but a dream so what is the use of talking about him let me enjoy the feast that tikal gives us husband and do not speak of children lest i should weep and learn to hate those of my sisters who have been blest with them then at a sign from zibalbay we moved on but maya hanging back for a moment whispered look at my fathers face never have i seen him so angry yet these tidings are not altogether ill and she glanced at the seсor now zibalbay walked on swiftly pulling at his beard and muttering to himself till we came to a great archway where two soldiers armed with copper spears stood on guard chatting with women in the crowd that gathered round the open door and eating sweetmeats which they offered them zibalbay covered his face with the corner of his robe and bidding us do likewise began to walk through the archway whereupon the two soldiers crossing their spears demanded his name and title by whose orders do you ask said zibalbay by order of our lord the cacique who celebrates his marriagefeast with the nobles his guests answered one of them say are you of their number who come so late then zibalbay uncovered his face and said look at me man did i command you to shut my own doors against me he looked and gasped it is the cacique come home again how then do you say that you keep the doors by order of the cacique can there be two caciques in the city of the heart asked zibalbay in a bitter voice and without waiting for an answer he walked on followed by the three of us into the plaza or courtyard of the palace where many fountains splashed upon the marble pavement passing beneath a colonnade and through an open doorway whence light flowed of a sudden we found ourselves in a great and wonderful chamber a hundred feet or more in length having a roof of panelled cedar supported by a double row of wooden columns exquisitely carved between which were set tables laden with fruit and flowers drinkingvessels and other ornaments of gold the walls also were cedarpanelled and hung over with tapestries worked in silver and ranged along them stood grotesque images of dwarfs and monkeys fashioned in solid gold each of which held in its hand a silver lamp at the far end of this place was a small table and behind it seated upon thronelike chairs were a man and a woman having an armed guard on either side of them the man was magnificently dressed in a white robe broidered with the symbol of the heart and a glittering feather cloak upon his brow was a circlet of gold from which rose a panache or plume of green feathers and in his hand he held a little golden sceptre tipped with an emerald he was of middle height very stoutly built and about fiveandthirty years of age having straight black hair that hung down upon his shoulders in face he was handsome but forbidding for his dark eyes shone with a strange fire beneath the beetling brows and his powerful mouth and chin wore a sullen look that did not leave them even when he smiled the lady at his side was also beautifully attired in white bridal robes broidered with silver and having the royal heart worked upon her breast while on her brow arms and bosom shone strings of emeralds she was young and tall with splendid eyes and a proud handsome face somewhat marred however by the heaviness of the mouth and it was easy to see that she loved the husband at her side for all her looks were towards him between us and this royal pair stretched the length of the great hall filled with people for the most of the feasters had left their seats so splendidly attired and so bright with the flash of gems and gold that for a few moments our eyes were dazzled the company who may have numbered two or three hundred stood in groups with their backs towards us leaving a clear space at the far end of the chamber where beautiful women in filmy silken robes adorned with flowers and turquoises were singing and dancing to the sound of pipes before the bride and bridegroom on the throne chapter xv how zibalbay came home for a while we stood unnoticed in the shadow of the doorway observing this strange and beautiful scene till as zibalbay was about to advance towards the throne the lord tikal held up his sceptre as a signal and suddenly the women ceased from their dance and song at the sight of the uplifted sceptre zibalbay halted again and drew back further into the shadow motioning us to do likewise then tikal began to speak in a rich deep voice that filled the hall councillors and nobles of the heart he said and you highborn ladies wives and daughters of the nobles hear me but yesterday as you know i took upon myself the place and power of my forefathers and by your wish and will i was proclaimed the sole chief and ruler of the people of the heart now i have bidden you to my marriage feast that you may grace my nuptials and share my joy for be it known to you that tonight i have taken in marriage nahua the beautiful daughter of the high lord mattai chief of the astronomers keeper of the sanctuary and president of the council of the heart her in the presence of you all i name as my first and lawful wife the sharer of my power and your ruler under me who whateer betide cannot be put away from my bed and throne and as such i call upon you to salute her then ceasing from his address he turned and kissed the woman at his side saying hail to you lady of the heart whom it has pleased the gods to lift up and bless may children be given to you and with them happiness and power for many years thereon the whole company bowed themselves before nahua whose fair face flushed with pride and joy and repeated as with one voice hail to you lady of the heart whom it has pleased the gods to lift up and bless may children be given to you and with them happiness and power for many years nobles went on tikal when this ceremony was finished it has come to my ears that there are some who murmur against me saying that i have no right to the ancient sceptre of cacique which i hold in my hand this night nobles i have somewhat to say to you of this matter that tomorrow after the sacrifice i shall repeat in the ears of the common people and i say it having consulted with my council the masters of the mysteries of the heart tomorrow a year will have gone by since zibalbay my uncle who was cacique before me and his only child and heiress of his rank and power the lady maya my affianced bride left the city upon a certain mission before they departed upon this mission it was agreed between zibalbay maya the lady of the heart myself and the council the brotherhood of the heart that i should rule as next heir during the absence of zibalbay and his daughter and that if they should not return within two years then their heritage should be mine for ever to this agreement i set my name with sorrow for then as now i held that my uncle was mad and in his madness went to doom taking with him his daughter whom i loved yet when they were gone i fulfilled it to the letter but trouble arose among the people for they will not listen to the voice of one who is not their anointed lord but say we will wait until zibalbay comes again and hear his command upon these matters also zibalbay being absent there was no high priest left in the land so that until a successor was raised up to him certain of the inmost mysteries of our worship must go uncelebrated thus bringing down upon us the anger of the nameless god so it came about that many pressed it on me that for the sake of the people and the welfare of the city i should shorten the period of my regency and suffer myself to be anointed but remembering my promise i answered them sharply saying that i would not depart from it by a hairs breadth and that come what might two full years must be completed before i sat me down in the place of my fathers to this mind then i held till three days since when those of the people to whose lot it fell in turn to pass to the mainland there to cultivate the fields that are apportioned to the service of the temple refused to get them to their labour declaring that the high priest alone had authority over them and there was no high priest in the city then in my perplexity i took counsel with the lord mattai master of the stars and he consulted the stars on my behalf all night long he searched the heavens and he read in them that zibalbay who led by a lying dream broke the laws of the land and wandered across the mountains has paid the price of his folly and is dead in the wilderness together with his daughter that was my affianced and the lady of the heart is it not so mattai now the person addressed a stout man with a bald head quick shifting eyes and a thick and grizzled beard stepped forward and said bowing if my wisdom is not at fault such was the message of the stars o lord nobles went on tikal you have heard my testimony and the testimony of mattai whose voice is the voice of truth for these reasons i have suffered myself to be anointed and set over you as your ruler seeing that i am the heir of zibalbay by law and by descent for these reasons also she to whom i was affianced being dead i have taken to wife nahua the daughter of mattai say do you accept us some few of the company were silent but the rest cried we accept you tikal and nahua and long may you rule over us according to the ancient customs of the land it is well my brethren answered tikal now before we drink the partingcup have any of you ought to say to me i have something to say to you cried zibalbay in a loud voice from the shadows wherein we stood at the far end of the hall at the sound of his voice the tones of which he seemed to know tikal started and rose in fear but recovering himself said advance from the shadow whoever you are and say your say where men may see you turning to his daughter and to us zibalbay bade us follow him and do as he did then veiling his face with a corner of his robe he walked up the hall the crowd of nobles and ladies opening a path till we stood before the throne here he uncovered himself as we did also and standing sideways so that he could be seen both by tikal and all that company he opened his lips to speak before a word could pass them a cry of astonishment broke from the nobles and of a sudden the sceptre fell from the hand of tikal and rolled along the floor zibalbay said the cry it is zibalbay come back or the ghost of him and with him the lady of the heart aye nobles he said in a quiet voice although his hand shook with rage it is i zibalbay your lord come home and not too soon as it would seem what my nephew were you so hungry for my place and power that you must break the oath you swore upon the heart and seize them before the appointed time and you mattai have you lost your skill or have the gods smitten you with a curse that you prophesy falsely saying that it was written in the stars that we who are alive were dead thereby lifting up your daughter to the seat of the lady of the heart nay do not answer me standing yonder i have heard all your story i say to you tikal that you are a foresworn traitor and to you mattai that you are a charlatan and a liar who have dared to use the holy art for your own ends and the advancement of your house on both of you will i be avenged aye and on all those who have abetted you in your crimes guards seize that man and the lord mattai with him and let them be held fast till i shall judge them now the soldiers that stood on either side of the thrones hesitated for a moment and then advanced towards tikal as though to lay hands upon him in obedience to zibalbays order but nahua rose and waved them off saying what dare you to touch your anointed lord back i say to you if you would save yourselves from the doom of sacrilege living or dead the day of zibalbay is done for the council of the heart has set his crown upon the brow of tikal and whether for good or ill their decree cannot be changed aye said tikal whose courage had come back to him the lady nahua speaks truth touch me not if you would live to look upon the sun but all the while he spoke his eyes were fixed upon maya whose beautiful face he watched as though it were that of some lost love risen from the dead now as zibalbay was about to speak again mattai the astronomer bowed before him and said be not angry but hear me my lord you have travelled far and you are weary and a weary man is apt at wrath you think that you have been wronged and doubtless all this that has chanced is strange to you but now is not the time for us to give count of our acts and stewardship or for you to hearken rest this night and tomorrow on the pyramid in the presence of the people all things shall be made clear to you and justice be done to all welcome to you zibalbay and to you also daughter of the heart and say who are these strangers that you bring with you from the desert lands across the mountains zibalbay paused awhile looking round him out of the corners of his eyes like a wolf in a trap for he sought to discover the temper of the nobles then finding that there were but few present whom he could trust to help him he lifted his head and answered you are right mattai i am weary for age travel and the faithlessness of men have worn me out tomorrow these matters shall be dealt with in the presence of the people and there before the altar it shall be made known whether i am their lord or you tikal there too i will tell you who these strangers are and why i have brought them across the mountains until then i leave them in your keeping for your own sake charging you to keep them well nay here i will neither eat nor drink do you come with me and he called to certain lords by name whom he knew to be faithful to him then without more words he turned and left the hall followed by a number of the nobles it seems that my father has forgotten me said maya with a laugh when he had gone greeting to you all friends and to you my cousin tikal and greeting also to your wife nahua who once my waitinglady by the gift of fortune has now been lifted up to take my place and title whatever may be the issue of these broils may you be happy in each others love tikal and nahua now tikal descended from the throne and bowed before her saying i swear to you maya no do not swear she broke in but give me and my friends here a cup of wine and some fragments from your weddingfeast for we are hungry i thank you how beautiful is that brides robe which nahua wears and surely those emeralds were once my own well let her take them from me as a weddinggift make room i pray you tikal and suffer these ladies to tell me of their tidings for remember that i have wandered far and it is pleasant to see faces that are dear to me for a while we sat and ate or made pretence to eat while maya talked thus lightly and all that company watched us for we were wonderful in their eyes who never till now had seen a white man indeed the sight of the seсor auburnhaired longbearded and whiteskinned was so marvellous to them that unlike the common people they forgot their courtesy and crowded round him in their amazement still there were two who took small note of the seсor or of me and these were tikal who gazed at maya as he stood behind her chair serving her like some waiting slave and nahua his wife who sat silent and neglected on her throne sullenly noting his every word and gesture at length she could bear this play no longer but rising from her seat began to move down the chamber make room for the bride ladies said maya cousin goodnight it grows late and your wife awaits you then muttering i know not what tikal turned and went and side by side the pair walked down the great hall followed by their guard of soldiers how beautiful is the bride and how brave the groom said maya as she watched them go and yet i have seen couples that looked happier on their weddingday well it is time to rest friends goodnight mattai i leave these strangers in your keeping guard them well and stay bring them to my apartments tomorrow after they have eaten for if it is my fathers will i would show them something of the city before the hour of noon when we meet upon the templetop when she had gone mattai bowed to us with much ceremony and begged us to follow him which we did across the courtyard and through many passages to a beautiful chamber dimly lighted with silver lamps that had been made ready for us here were beds covered with silken wrappings and on a table in the centre of the room cool drinks and many sorts of fruits but so tired were we that we took little note of these things bidding goodnight to mattai who looked at us curiously and announced that he would visit us early in the morning we made fast the copper bolts upon the door and threw ourselves upon the beds weary as i was i could not sleep in this strange place and when from time to time my eyes closed the sound of feet passing without our chamber door roused me again to wakefulness of one thing i was sure that zibalbay was not wanted here in his own city and that there would be trouble on the morrow when he told his tale to the people for certainly tikal would not suffer himself easily to be thrust from the place he had usurped and he had many friends doubtless it was their feet that i heard outside the door as they hurried to and fro from the chamber where mattai sat taking counsel with them what would be our fate i wondered in this struggle for power that must come these people feared strangers so much i could read in their faces and doubtless they would be rid of us if they might well we had a good friend in maya and the rest we must leave to providence thinking thus at length i fell asleep to be awakened by the voice of the seсor who was sitting upon the edge of his bed singing a song and looking round the chamber for now the daylight streamed through the lattice i wished him goodmorrow and asked him why he sang because of the lightness of my heart he answered we have reached the city at last and it is far more splendid and wonderful than anything i dreamed of also the luck is with us for this tikal has taken another woman in marriage who to judge from the look of her will not readily let him go and therefore maya has no more to fear from him thirdly there is enough treasure in this town if what we saw last night may be taken as a sample to enable you to establish three indian empires if you wish and doubtless zibalbay will give you as much of it as you may want therefore friend ignatio you should sing as i do instead of looking as gloomy as though you saw your own coffin being brought in at the door i shook my head and answered i fear you speak lightly there is trouble brewing in this city and we shall be drawn into it for the struggle between tikal and zibalbay will be to the death as for the lady maya of this i am certain that wife or no wife tikal still loves her and will strive to take her i saw it in his eyes last night lastly it is true enough that here there is boundless wealth but whether its owners will suffer me to have any portion of it to forward my great purposes useless though it be to them is another matter there was a man in the bible called job and he had a friend named eliphaz i think you are that friend come to life again ignatio answered the seсor laughing for my part i mean to make the best of the present and not to trouble myself about the future or the politics of this benighted people but hark there is someone knocking at the door i rose and undid the bolt whereon attendants entered bearing goblets of chocolate and little cakes upon a tray after we had eaten they led us to the baths which were of marble and very beautiful one of them being filled with water from a warm spring and then to a chamber where breakfast was made ready for us while we sat at table mattai came to us and i saw that he had not slept that night for his eyes were heavy i trust that you have rested well strangers he said courteously yes lord i answered well it is more than i have done for it is my business to watch the stars especially my own star which just now is somewhat obscured and he smiled if you have finished your meal my commands are to lead you to the apartments of the lady maya who wishes to show you something of our city which being strangers may interest you by the way if i do not ask too much perhaps you will tell me to what race you belong and he bowed towards the seсor we have heard of white men here though we have learned no good of them and tradition tells us that our first ruler cucumatz was of this race are you of his blood stranger i do not know answered the seсor laughing i come from a cold country far beyond the sea where all the men are as i am then the inhabitants of that country must be goodly to behold answered mattai gravely i thank you for your courtesy son of the sea in answering my question so readily i did not ask it from curiosity alone since the people in this city are terrified of strangers and clamour for some account of you doubtless our friend zibalbay will satisfy them i said good now be pleased to follow me and mattai led us across courts and through passages till we reached a little anteroom filled with ancient carvings and decorated with flowers where some girls stood chatting tell the lady maya that her guests await her said mattai then turned to take his departure adding in a low voice doubtless we shall meet at noon upon the pyramid and there you will see i know not what but whatever befalls be sure of this strangers that i will protect you if i can farewell one of the girls vanished through a doorway at the further end of the chamber and having offered us seats the others stood together at a little distance watching us out of the corners of their eyes presently the door opened and through it came maya wearing a silken serape that covered her head and shoulders and looking very sweet and beautiful in the shaded light of the room greetings friends she said as we bowed before her i have my fathers leave to show you something of this city that you longed so much to see these ladies here will accompany us and a guard but we shall want no litters until we have ascended the great temple for i desire that you should see the view from thence before the place is cumbered with the multitude come if you are ready accordingly we set out maya walking between us while her guards and ladies followed after crossing the square which had been the scene of the festival of the previous night but now in the early morning was almost deserted we came to the inclosure of the courtyard of the pyramid a limestone wall worked with sculptures of hunting scenes relieved by a border of writhing snakes and at intervals by emblems of the heart at the gateway of this wall we paused to contemplate the mighty mass of the pyramid that towered above us there is one in the land of egypt that is bigger so said the seсor although he believed this to be a more wonderful sight because of its glittering slopes of limestone whose expanse was broken only by the vast stair that ran up its eastern face from base to summit it is a great building said maya noting our astonishment and one that could not be reared in these days tradition says that fiveandtwenty thousand men worked on it for fifty years twenty thousand of them cutting and carrying the stone and five thousand laying the blocks where did the material come from then asked the seсor some of it was hewn from beneath the base of the temple itself she answered but the most was borne in big canoes from quarries on the mainland for these quarries can still be seen is the pyramid hollow then i asked yes in it are many chambers for the most part store and treasure houses and beneath its base lie crypts the buryingplace of the caciques their wives and children there also is the holy sanctuary of the heart which you being of the brotherhood may perhaps be permitted to visit come let us climb the stair and she led us across the courtyard to the foot of a stairway forty feet or more in breadth which ran to the platform of the pyramid in six flights each of fifty steps and linked together by restingplaces up these flights we toiled slowly followed by the ladies and the guard till at length our labour was rewarded and we stood upon the dizzy edge of the pyramid before us was a platform bordered by a low wall large enough to give standing room to several thousand people on the western side of this platform stood a small marble house used as a place to store fuel and as a watchtower by the priests who were on duty day and night tending the sacred fire which flared in a brazier from its roof sitting in front of it was a small altar wreathed with flowers but for the rest the area was empty look said maya the city beneath us was built upon a low heartshaped island so hollow in its centre that once it might have been the crater of some volcano or perhaps a mere ridge of land inclosing a lagoon this island measured about ten miles in length by six across at its widest and seemed to float like a huge green leaf upon the lake the holy waters of these indians of which the circumference is so great that even from the summit of the pyramid a few small and rocky islets excepted land was only visible to the north whence we had sailed on the previous night elsewhere the eye met nothing but blue expanses of inland sea limitless and desolate unrelieved by any sail or sign of life amidst these waters the island gleamed like an emerald here were gardens filled with gorgeous flowers and clumps of beautiful palms and willows framed by banks of dense green reeds that grew in the shallows around the shores so luxuriant was the vegetation fertilised year by year with the rich mud of the lake and so lovely were the trees and flowers in the soft light of the morning that the place seemed like a paradise rather than a home of men and as was the island so was the city that was built upon one end of it following the lines of the land upon which it stood it was heartshaped a heart of cold white marble lying within a heart of glowing green all about it ran a moat filled with water from the lake and on the hither side of this moat stood a wall fifty feet or more in height built of great blocks of white limestone that formed the bedrock of the island which wall was everywhere sculptured with allegorical devices and designs and the gigantic figures of gods within the oblong of this wall lay the city a city of palaces pyramids and temples or rather the remains of it for we could see at a glance that the population was unable to keep so many streets and edifices in repair thus palmtrees were to be found growing through the flat roofs of houses and in crevices of the templepyramids while many of the streets and avenues were green with grass and ferns a narrow pathway in the centre of them showing how few were the feet of the passersby even in the great square beneath us the signs of traffic were rare and there was little of the bustle of a people engaged in the business of life although this very place had been the scene of last nights feast and would again soon be filled with men and women flocking to the pyramid now and again some graceful languid girl a reed basket in her hand might be seen visiting the booths where rations of fish from the lake or of meal fruit dried venison and cocoa were distributed according to the wants of each family or perhaps a party of men on their way to labour in the gardens stopped to smoke and talk together in a fashion that showed time to be of little value to them here and there also a few a very few children played together with flowers for toys in the shadow of the palaces barracks and storehouses which bordered the central square but this was all for the rest the place seemed empty and asleep chapter xvi on the pyramid does not the city lie very low i asked of maya when we had studied the prospect on every side to my eye its houses seem almost upon a level with the waters of the lake i believe that is so she answered moreover during those months of the year that are coming the surface of the lake rises many feet so that the greater portion of the island is submerged and the water stands about the wall how then do you prevent the town from being flooded asked the seсor if once the water flowed in the place would vanish and every soul be drowned yes friend but the waters never rise beyond a certain height and they are kept from flooding the city by the great sluicegate if that gate were to be opened in the time of inundation then we should perish every one but it never is opened during those months for if any would leave or enter the city they do so by means of ladders leading from the summit of the wall to floating landingstages on the moat beneath also night and day the gate is guarded moreover it can be moved from one place only by those that know its secret who are few it seems a strange place to build a city answered the seсor i do not think that i should ever sleep sound during the months of inundation knowing that my life depended upon a single gate yet men have slept safely here for a thousand years or more she said legend tells us that our ancestors who came up from the coast in ancient days settled on the island and by command of their gods choosing this hollow bed of land to build in so that rather than submit themselves to foes as their fathers were forced to do in the country beyond the mountain they could if need were flood the place and perish in the water for this reason it is that the holy sanctuary of the nameless god the heart of heaven is hollowed deep in the rock beneath us for the waters of the lake would flow in upon it at a touch burying it and all its treasures from the sight of man for ever now if you have seen enough i will take you to visit the public workshops where fish is dried linen woven and all other industries carried on that are necessary to our comfort and turning she led the way with her ladies towards the head of the stairs as we drew near to it however three men appeared upon the platform in one of whom i knew tikal seeing maya he advanced toward her bowing as he came lady he said learning that you were here with these strangers i have followed you to beg that you will speak with me alone for some few minutes that i cannot do cousin she answered coldly for who knows what colour might afterwards be put upon my words if you have anything to say to me say it before us all that i cannot do he replied for what i have to say is secret still for your fathers sake and perhaps for your own you will do well to hear it without a witness i will not listen to you tikal then lady farewell he said and turned to go stay cousin if you fear to speak before our own people let this stranger and she pointed to me ignatio be present at our talk he is of our blood and can understand our tongue a discreet man moreover one of the brethren of the heart one of the brethren of the heart how can a stranger be a brother of the heart prove it to me wanderer and drawing me aside he said certain words which i answered giving him the signs do you agree asked maya yes lady since i must though it pleases me little to open my mind before a stranger let us step apart and he walked to the centre of the platform followed by maya and myself lady he began my business with you is not easy to tell for many years we were affianced and both you and your father promised that we should be wed when you returned from this journey surely as things are cousin it is needless to discuss the matter of our betrothal she broke in with sarcasm not altogether needless lady he answered i have much to ask your pardon for yet i make bold to ask it maya you know well that i have loved and love you dearly and that no other woman has ever been near my heart indeed she said with a laugh these words sound strange in the mouth of the newmade husband of nahua perhaps lady and yet they are true i am married to nahua but i do not love her though she loves me it is you whom i love and when i saw you yesterday all my heart went out to you so that i almost hated the fair bride at my side why then did you marry her because i must and because i believed you dead and your father with you as did every man in the city you and zibalbay being dead as i thought was it wonderful that i should wish to keep the place that many were plotting to take from me this could be done in one way only by the help of mattai the most clever and the most powerful man in the city and this was mattais price that his daughter should become the lady of the heart well she loved me she is beautiful and she has her fathers strength and foresight so that among all the ladies in the land there was none more fitted to be my wife well and you married her and theres an end you ask my forgiveness and you have it seeing that it does not befit me to play the part of a jealous woman doubtless time will soften the blow to me tikal she added mockingly there is not an end maya and i come to ask you today to renew your promise that you will be my wife what cousin having broken your troth would you now offer me insult do you then propose that i the daughter of the heart should be nahuas handmaid no i propose that when nahua is put away you should take her place and your own how can this be seeing that the lady of the heart cannot be divorced if she ceases to be the lady of the heart she can be divorced like any other woman at the least love has no laws and i will find a way the way of death perhaps no i will have none of you honour has laws tikal if love has none go back to your wife and pray that she may never learn how you would have treated her is that your last word lady why do you ask because more hangs on it than you know listen very soon all the men in the city will be gathered on this place to hear your fathers words and to decide whether he or i shall rule see already they assemble in the temple square promise to be my wife and in return i will yield to your father and he shall be master for his lifes days and have his way in all things refuse and i will cling to power and matters may go badly for him for you and he added threateningly for these strangers your friends all this must befall as it chances she answered proudly i do not meddle with such questions nor do your threats move me if you are so base as to plot mischief against an old man who has poured benefits upon you plot on and in due time meet with your reward but for myself i tell you that i have done with you and that come what may i will never be your wife perhaps you may yet live to take back those words lady he said in a quiet voice then with a bow of obeisance he turned and went you have made a dangerous enemy lady i said when he was out of earshot i do not fear him ignatio that is well i answered but for my part i do i think that his plans are ready and that before this day is done there will be trouble indeed i shall be thankful if we live to see tomorrows light by this time we had reached the others are you weary of waiting she said to the seсor giving him a sweet look as she spoke well i should have been happier here than i was yonder give me your hand and lead me down the stair for i am tired ah friend did you but know it i have just dared more for your sake than i should have done for my own what have you dared he asked that you will learn in due time if we live long enough friend she answered but oh i would that we had never set foot within this city two hours had passed and following in the train of zibalbay and maya who walked beside him once more we found ourselves upon the summit of the pyramid now however it was no longer empty for on it were collected men to the number of some thousands indeed all the adult male population of the city on one side of the altar were seated tikal his bride nahua who was the only woman there and some hundreds of nobles all of whom i noted were armed and guarded by a body of soldiers that stood behind them on the other side were many vacant places and as zibalbay with maya and all the great company of followers that he had gathered advanced to take them tikal and every man present on the pyramid uncovered their heads and bowed in greeting to him after a few moments pause two priests came forward from the watchhouse behind the altar and having laid upon it an offering of fresh flowers the elder of them who was robed in pure white uttered a short prayer to the nameless god the heart of heaven asking that he would be pleased to accept the gift and to send a blessing upon the deliberations of his people here assembled then zibalbay rose to address the multitude and i noted that his fierce face was pale and anxious and that his hand shook although his eyes flashed angrily nobles and people of the city of the heart he began on this day a year ago i your hereditary ruler and cacique and the highpriest of the heart of heaven left this city on a certain mission this was my mission to find the severed portion of the sacred symbol that lies in the sanctuary of the temple the portion that is called day which has been lost for many an age you know that our race has fallen upon evil times and that year by year our numbers dwindle till at length the end of the people is in sight seeing that within some few generations they must die out and be forgotten you know also the ancient prophecy that when once more the two halves of the symbol of the heart day and night are laid side by side in their place upon the altar in the sanctuary then from that hour this people shall grow great again and you know how a voice spoke to me in answer to my prayers bidding me zibalbay to wander forth from the country of the heart following the road to the sea for there i should find that which was lost thither then having won the permission of my council the brotherhood of the heart i have wandered alone with my daughter the lady maya suffering much hardship and danger in my journeyings and lo i have found that which was lost and brought it back to you for here it hangs upon the neck of this ignatio who has accompanied me from the lands beyond the desert now a murmur of astonishment went up from the multitude and zibalbay paused awhile of this matter of the finding of the symbol he continued i will speak more fully at the proper time and to those who have a right to hear it namely to the elected brotherhood of the heart in the holy sanctuary on the day of the rising of waters being one of the eight days in each year on which it is lawful for the council of the heart to meet in the sanctuary but first in this hour i will deal with other questions it is known to you that when i went upon my mission i left my nephew tikal to sit in my place it being agreed between us and the council that if i should return no more within two years he should become cacique of the people i have returned within one year and i find this that already he has allowed himself to be anointed cacique and more that he who was affianced to my daughter has taken another woman to be his wife last night with my own ears i heard him proclaim his treachery in the hall of the palace and when i spoke out the bitterness that was in my heart i your lord was met with threats and told that tikal having been anointed could not now be deposed i use the saying against him nobles have i not been anointed and can i then be deposed i who am not a traitor to my master nor a forswearer of my oaths as is my nephew yonder again he paused and some of the audience with those who had accompanied zibalbay shouted no but the most of them looked towards tikal and were silent now mattai rose from his place behind tikal and spoke saying as one who had to do with the anointing of tikal to be cacique when we believed you and the lady maya to be dead i would ask you zibalbay before we on this side of the altar answer you to tell us openly what is the meaning of this journey that you have undertaken and for what purpose you have brought these two strangers who are named ignatio and son of the sea with you in defiance of the ancient law which says that he who brings a stranger across the mountains into the land of the city of the heart shall die together with the stranger now when zibalbay heard this question he started for he had forgotten this law and saw the cunning trap that mattai had spread for his feet nevertheless he answered boldly since it was his nature to be outspoken and straightforward it becomes you ill mattai to question me you who have proved yourself a plotter and a lying prophet reading in the stars that i and my daughter were dead while we still draw the breath of life beneath them yet i will answer you and scorning subterfuge or falsehood set out the whole matter in the hearing of the people that they may judge between me your party and your master first i will say that i had forgotten the law of which you speak whereof i have broken the letter or if at any time i remembered it my necessities caused me to disregard it learn then that the stranger ignatio is of royal indian blood and the holder of that symbol which i went forth to seek and that the white man whom you call son of the sea is as a brother to him and that both of them are of the fellowship of the heart the lord ignatio being no less a man than the master of the order in yonder lands as i am here this lord ignatio i summoned to me and he came he came and with his companion son of the sea saved me and my daughter from shame and death at the hands of certain murderers white men then when we had escaped we tried each other and laid the symbols side by side and lo day and night came together and they were one then also i told him the story of how it happened that i was wandering far from my own place and he told me what was his purpose and the desire of his life this is his purpose to break the yoke that the white man has set upon the neck of the indians in the far lands and to build up a mighty indian nation stretching from sea to sea whereof this city heart of the world shall be the centre and the capital then we made a compact together a compact that cannot be broken and it was this that the lord ignatio with the white man his companion from whom he will not be separated should accompany us here where the symbols should be set in the appointed place that the prophecy may be fulfilled and fortune return to us that i should give to him so much as he may need of the treasures which lie useless in our storehouses wherewith he may arm troops and bring about his ends and that in return he should bring to us what we need far more than gold and gems men and women with whom we may intermarry so that our race ceasing to dwindle may once again multiply and grow great such nobles is our compact and this is the path which the god who rules us has pointed out for our feet to tread accept it and grow great refuse it and perish for know that not for myself do i speak who am old and near to death but for you and your posterity for ever be not bewildered or amazed for though these things are new to you it may well chance that after the council of the heart has been celebrated in the sanctuary on the night of the rising of waters the god whom we worship the nameless god under whose guidance all these things have come about will reveal his purpose by the mouth of his oracle and show what part these strangers and each of us shall play in the fate that is to be oh nobles and my people let not your sight be dimmed nor your heart hardened and put not away the fortune and the future that lies before you i have dared much for your sake dare a little for your own shut your ears and your gates and rise in rebellion against me and i tell you that soon there shall remain of you and of your glorious home scarcely a memory but be gentle and be guided by my wisdom and the will of your gods and your fame and power shall cover the world ay you shall be to what you were as is the sun in all its glory to some faint and fading star i have spoken now choose he ceased and for a while there was silence the silence of amaze for the nobles stared each on each and such of the common people as were within earshot stood gaping at him with open mouths since to them who did not meddle in matters of polity and indeed thought little for themselves his words had small meaning presently it was broken and by tikal who sprang from his seat and cried aloud of a truth they were wise who said that this old man was mad have you heard and understood o people of the heart this is what you must do to fulfil the will of zibalbay first you must set him in his place again giving him all power and me you must condemn to death or chains next you must pardon him his breaches of the law the law that he of all men was bound to keep then you must hand over your treasures the treasures hoarded by your forefathers for many a generation to these wandering thieves whom he has brought with him and lastly you must open your gates which have been kept secret for a thousand years to other thieves that they shall lead here to whom forsooth you must give your women in marriage that the race may be increased say will you do these things children of the heart now all the nobles who stood behind tikal shouted never and the people beyond took up the cry with a voice of thunder though the most of them understood little of what was passing tikal held up his hand and there was silence you will not do them he said and base indeed were you had you answered otherwise what then will you do tell me first whom do you choose as your ruler my uncle who now is mad and would bring you to shame and ruin or me who have sworn to preserve your ancient laws we choose you tikal tikal came the answer i thank you he cried but what then shall be done with this old man and those whom he has brought with him to spy out our secrets and to rob us kill them before the altar they shouted waving their swords tikal thought for a moment then pointed towards us and said seize those men at his word a hundred or more of the nobles who evidently had been instructed to execute his orders rushed at us suddenly as they came across the open space i saw the seсor put his hand to his belt and said to him for the love of god do not strike for should you touch one of them they will certainly kill us that they will do in any case but as you wish he answered then they broke on us as they came all those nobles who had followed zibalbay to the crest of the pyramid gave way before their rush leaving the three of us and the lady maya standing alone cowards said zibalbay glancing behind him then he drew his machete and with a great shout cut down the foremost of those who assailed us a great noble in another instant the weapon was struck from him and the seсor and i were being dragged towards the altar followed by zibalbay and the lady maya upon whom however our assailants laid no hand what shall we do with these men cried tikal again and again the nobles answered kill them so they threw us down and men came at us with swords to make an end of us which indeed they would have done quickly had not the lady maya sprung forward and standing over the seсor cried hold in so piercing a voice that they stayed their hands listen people of the heart she said would you do murder upon your own holy altar staining it with the blood of innocent men you talk of broken laws is there not a law in the city that none can be put to death except after trial before the cacique and his council have these men been tried and if so by whom you say that my father your lawful ruler is deposed if that is so not tikal but i who am his heir rule in his stead and i have passed no judgment on them now at her words there was a murmur of mingled doubt and applause but tikal answered her saying lady the law you quote holds good for you for your father and for every citizen of the heart however humble but in the case of these men it does not hold for they are wandering strangers and spies who can claim no protection from our justice and therefore it is right that they should die it is not right that they should die she answered passionately you tikal have usurped my fathers place and now you would celebrate the beginning of your rule by a deed of the foulest murder i tell you that these men are innocent of all offence if any are guilty it is my father and i and if any should suffer we should suffer more she went on with flashing eyes if these men to whom we have sworn safeconduct must die then for my part i will die with them and whether i pass by your hands or by my own may the curse of my blood rest upon you for ever and for ever as she spoke she snatched a knife from her jewelled girdle and stood before them its bare blade glittering in the sunlight looking so beautiful and fierce that the nobles fell back from her and hundreds of the people applauded saying hear the lady maya and obey her she is cacique and no other now zibalbay who had covered his eyes with his hands looked up and said you are right daughter since the people reject us and we cannot even protect our guests it is best that we should die with them and once more he covered his eyes with his hands then there came a pause and a sound of whispering i looked up between the swordblades which were pointed at my throat and saw that nahua was standing at the side of her lord and pleading with him they were so close to me that my hearing always keen being sharpened moreover by the fear of instant death enabled me to catch some of their talk she will do what she says said nahua and that will be your ruin for if her father is hated she is beloved and many will arise to avenge her why should she kill herself because of a white wanderer he asked nahua shrugged her shoulders and smiled darkly as she answered who can tell he is her friend and women have been known to give their lives for their friends do as you will but if maya dies i do not think that we shall live to see another dawn and leaving his side she sought her chair again now tikal looked at the seсor who was stretched upon the ground beside me and seeing that there was hate in his eyes i trembled thinking that the end had come then turned my head aside and began to commend my soul to the care of heaven as i prayed he spoke addressing himself to maya lady he said you have appealed to the law on behalf of these wanderers of your father and of yourself and by the law you shall be dealt with tomorrow the judges shall be chosen and hold their court here before the people it cannot be tikal she answered calmly there is but one court which can try us four all of whom are brethren of the heart and that is the council of the heart sitting in the sanctuary which assembles on the eighth day from now on the night of the rising of waters is it not so nobles if you are of the number of the brethren of the heart all of you it is so they answered so be it said tikal but till then i must hold you in safekeeping will it please you to follow mattai lady and you my lord zibalbay guards bring these men to the watchhouse yonder and keep them there till i come to you maya bowed and turning to the audience she said in a clear voice farewell my people if we are seen no more you will know that my father and i have been done to death by tikal who has usurped our place and to you i leave it to take vengeance for our blood chapter xvii the curse of zibalbay thankful enough was i to rise from the ground feeling my life whole in me death has been near to us said the seсor with something between a sob and a laugh as we followed zibalbay and maya into the guardhouse he is near to us still i answered but at least unless tikal changes his mind we have won some days of respite thanks to her he said nodding to maya and as he spoke we entered the guardhouse a small chamber with a massive door somewhat roughly furnished so soon as we were in the door was shut upon us and we found ourselves alone zibalbay sat himself down and fixing his eyes upon the wall stared at it as though it offered no hindrance to his sight but the rest of us stood together near the door listening to the turmoil of the multitude without clearly argument ran high among them for we could hear the sound of angry voices of shouting and of the hurrying footfalls of the people leaving the pyramid by way of the great stair you have saved our lives for a while for which we owe you thanks said the seсor to maya presently but tell me what will they do with us now i cannot say she answered but in this pyramid are chambers where we shall be hidden away until our day of trial at the least i think so for they dare not let us out among the people lest we should cause a tumult in the city before the words had left her lips the door was opened and through it came tikal mattai and other of the great lords who were hostile to zibalbay what is your pleasure with us asked zibalbay awaking from his dream that you should follow me answered tikal sternly you and the others adding with a low bow to maya forgive me lady that i must exercise this violence towards you and your father but i have no other choice if i would save you from the vengeance of the people it is not the vengeance of the people that we have to fear tikal she answered quietly but rather your hate which it is in your power to appease lady he said in a low voice it may be in my power but it is not in my will she answered setting her lips come cousin take us to the dungeon that you have prepared for us as you wish he said follow me and he led the way across the guardhouse through a sleepingchamber of the priests that lay behind it to the further wall that was hidden by a curtain this curtain on being drawn revealed a small stone door which mattai having first lit some lamps that stood ready in the chamber unlocked with a key which hung at his girdle one by one we passed through the door tikal preceding us and mattai with others of the great lords to the number of six following after us beyond the door lay a flight of twenty steps then came a gate of copper bars on the further side of this gate were flight upon flight of steps joined together by landings and running now in this direction now in that into the bowels of the mighty pyramid at length when my limbs were weary of descending so many stairs we found ourselves in front of other gates larger and more beautifully worked than those that we had already passed presently they clanged behind us and we stood in a vast apartment or hall that was built in the heart of the pyramid it would seem that this hall had been made ready for our coming for it was lighted with many silver lamps and in one part of it rugs were laid and on them stood tables and seats so great was the place that the light of the lamps shone in it only as stars shine in the sky still as we passed down it we saw that its roof was vaulted and that its walls and floor were of white marble finely polished once as we learned afterwards it had served as the assemblyrooms for the priests of the temple but now that they were so few it was not used except from time to time as a prison for offenders of high rank at intervals along its length were doors leading to sleeping and other chambers some of the doors were open and as we passed them mattai told us that these were to be our bedchambers then having announced that food would be brought to us the nobles headed by tikal withdrew and we heard the copper gates clash and the echo of their footsteps into nothingness upon the endless stairs for a while we stood staring at each other in silence it was zibalbay who broke it and his voice rang strangely in the vaulted place it is his hour now he said shaking his fist towards the stair by which tikal had left us but let him pray that mine may never come and suddenly he turned and walking to a couch flung himself upon it and buried his face in his hands maya followed him and bending down strove to comfort him but he waved her away and she came back to us this is a gloomy place said the seсor in a half whisper for here one scarcely dared to speak aloud because of the echoes that ran about the walls but dark though it is it seems safer than the summit of the pyramid where swordpoints are so many and he pointed to a little cut upon his throat it is safe enough maya answered with a bitter laugh and safely will it keep our bones till the worlds end for through those gates and the men that guard them there is no escape and the death that threatened us in the sunshine shall overtake us in the shadow did i not warn you against this mad quest and the seeking of the city of my people i warned you both and you would not listen and now the trouble is at hand and your lives will pay the forfeit for your folly and my fathers what must be must be answered the seсor with a sigh but for my part i hope that the worst is past and that they will not kill us it was your fathers rashness which brought these evils on us and perhaps misfortune may teach him wisdom never she answered shaking her head for they are right on this matter he is mad as you ignatio are mad also come let us look at our prison for i have not seen it till this hour and taking one of the handlamps that stood near she walked down the length of the hall at its further end were gates similar to those by which we had entered and through them came a draught of air where do they lead i asked i do not know she answered perhaps to the sanctuary by a secret way at least the pyramid is full of these chambers that in old days were used for many things such as the storage of corn and weapons and the buryingplaces of priests thousands of whom are at rest within it now they are empty and deserted as we walked back again i stopped before a wooden door that stood ajar leading into one of the chambers of which i have spoken let us go in said maya pushing it open and we entered to find ourselves in a small room lined with shelves on these shelves each of which was numbered lay hundreds of rolls thickly covered with dust maya took up one of them at a hazard and unrolled the parchment revealing a manuscript beautifully executed in the picturepainting of the indians this must be nearly a thousand years old she said i know it by the style of the painting well we shall not lack history to read while we sojourn here and she threw the priceless roll back on to its shelf and left the chamber a few steps further on we came to another room of which the door was closed but so rotten was the woodwork with age that a push freed it from its fastenings and we entered here also there were shelves packed some of them with yellow and some with white bars of metal copper and lead said the seсor glancing at them not so answered maya with a laugh but that which you white men covet gold and silver look what is painted upon the shelves and she held up the lamp and read pure metal from the southern mines set apart for the services of the temple of the heart and of the temples of the east and west of gold such a weight of silver such a weight i stared and my eyes grew greedy for here in this one room neglected and forgotten was enough wealth to carry out my purpose three times over stored there by the forefathers of this strange rusteaten race ah if only i could see one half of it safe across the mountains how great might be my future and that of the people which i lived to serve perhaps you may win it after all ignatio said maya interpreting my thoughts but to be frank i fear that you will gain nothing except a sepulchre in these gloomy vaults after this we visited several chambers that were empty or filled only with the wreck of motheaten tapestries and curious furnitures till at length we came to a room or rather a large cupboard piled from floor to ceiling with golden vessels of the most quaint and ancient workmanship which had been discarded by the priests and cast aside as worthless why i do not know in front of this gleaming pile stood a chest unlocked that the seсor opened it was packed with priestly ornaments of gold set with great emeralds maya picked out a belt from the box and gave it to me saying take it ignatio since you love such trinkets it will set off that robe of yours i took it and put it on not over my robe but beneath it my friend it is the clasp of that belt which now is yours that i showed you a while ago and with the price of the other gems in it i bought this hacienda and all its lands wearied at length by the sight of so much useless treasure we returned to zibalbay who was seated as we had left him lost in thought at this moment the gates of our prison were opened and men came through them escorted by captains of the guard bringing with them food in plenty which they set upon the table waiting on us while we ate but speaking no word good or bad our meal finished they cleared away the fragments and having replenished the lamps and prepared the chambers for us to sleep in they bowed and left us for a while we sat round the table zibalbay and i in silence and maya and the seсor talking together in a low voice till at length the dreariness of the place overcame us and as though by a common impulse we rose and sought the sleepingvaults there to rest if we might we slept and woke and rose again though whether it was night or day here where no light came we could not tell indeed as time went on our only means of distinguishing the one from the other was by the visits of those who brought our food and waited on us i think it must have been in the early afternoon of the day following that on which we were imprisoned that tikal visited us accompanied only by four guards a small band said the seсor as he watched them advance but enough to put us to death who are unarmed for all our weapons had been taken from us if such should be their will have no fear friend said maya they will not do murder so openly by now tikal stood before us bowing and zibalbay who as usual was seated brooding at the table looked up and saw him what do you seek traitor he asked angrily the blood flushing beneath his withered skin would you kill us if so slay on for thus shall i come the sooner to the bosom of that god whose vengeance i call down upon you i am no murderer zibalbay answered tikal with dignity if you die it will be by command of the law that you have broken and not by mine i am here to speak with you if you will come apart with me then speak on before these others or leave your words unsaid he answered for not one step will i stir with you who doubtless seek some opportunity to stab me in the back yet it is necessary that you should hear what i have to say zibalbay say on then traitor or go tikal thought for a while looking doubtfully at maya from whose fair face indeed he rarely took his eyes is it your wish that i should withdraw she asked shortly it is not mine said zibalbay stay where you are daughter now tikal hesitated no longer but bidding the guards who had accompanied him to fall back out of earshot he said listen zibalbay yesterday before the gathering on the pyramid i saw your daughter the lady maya and spoke with her telling her that now as always i loved her although believing her to be dead for reasons of state i had taken another woman to be my wife then i made her this offer that if she would consent to become my wife i would put away nahua whom i had married moreover i added this that i would give up my place as cacique to you zibalbay whose it is by right to hold for so long as you should live and would not oppose you or your policy in any matter i told her on the other hand that if she refused to become my wife i would surrender nothing but would put out my strength to crush you and her and these strangers your friends she answered me with contempt saying that i might do my worst but she would have naught to say to me what happened afterwards you know zibalbay and you know also the danger in which you stand today now that power has left you and your very life trembles in the balance he paused and zibalbay who had been listening to his words amazed turned to maya and said sternly does this man speak lies daughter as she was about to answer though what she meant to say i do not know tikal broke in what is the use of asking her zibalbay is it to be thought that she will answer you truly though that i speak truth this wanderer who stands at your side can bear witness for he was present and heard my words this offer i made to her and that it may be put beyond a doubt now i make it to her and to you again if she will take me in marriage for her sake i will put away nahua i will lay down my rule and set you in your place again with liberty so long as you shall live to work such follies as the gods may suffer all these things i will do because i love her to whom i have been affianced from my youth up better than them all because she is as the light to mine eyes and the breath to my nostrils and without her i have no joy in life as i have had none since i believed her to be dead zibalbay heard and rising lifted his hand to the vault above him and said i thank thee o god who in answer to my prayers hast shown me a way of escape from the troubles that beset me tikal it shall be as you wish and we will swear our peace upon the altar of the heart doubtless there will be trouble with mattai and some of his following but if we stand together they can be overcome rejoice with me ignatio my friend for now the seed that we have planted with so much labour shall bring forth golden fruit here i heard the seсor groan with doubt and wrath behind me and knew that like so many others this vision which filled my mind with glory must be brought to nothing because of the fancy of a woman your pardon zibalbay i interrupted the lady maya has not spoken spoken he exclaimed why what should she say what i said to my cousin tikal yesterday she answered setting her lips and speaking very low that i will have nothing to do with him nothing to do with him girl nothing to do with him why he is your affianced you do not understand i understand well father but for naught that can be offered to me upon the earth will i give myself in marriage to a man who has treated you and me as my cousin tikal has done a man who could not keep his oath to you or wait for me one single year cease to be foolish said zibalbay tikal has erred no doubt but now he would make atonement for his error and if i can forgive him so can you think no more of the girls folly tikal but send for ink and parchment and let us set down our contract for i am old and have little time to lose and perhaps before another year is gone that which you would have snatched by force shall come to you by right i have the paper here lord said tikal drawing a roll from his breast but pardon me does the lady maya consent aye aye she consents i do not consent father and if you drag me to the altar with yonder man i will cry out to the people to protect me or failing their aid i will seek refuge in death by my own hand if need be now zibalbay turned upon his daughter trembling with rage but checking himself of a sudden he said tikal for the moment this girl of mine is mad leave us and come back in some few hours when you shall find her of another mind go now i pray before words are said that cannot be forgotten tikal turned and went and until the gates at the far end of the hall had clashed behind him and his guards there was silence then zibalbay spoke to his daughter girl he said i know your heart and that your lips spoke a lie when you told us that it was because of tikals forgetfulness of his vow and troth that you will not marry him there is another reason of which you have not spoken this white man who in his own country is named james strickland is the reason you have suffered yourself to look on him with longing and you cannot pluck his image from your breast do i not speak truth you speak truth father she answered placing her hand in that of the seсor as she said the words to you at least i will not lie i thank you daughter now hear me i am sorry for your plight and for that of the white man if indeed he would make of you anything more than his toy but here your wishes must give way to the common good who and what are you that your whims should stand between me and the fulfilment of my lifelong desire between your people and their redemption must all these things come to nothing because of the fancies of a lovesick girl whose poor beauty as it chances by favour of the gods can avail to bring them about it seems so father she said seeing that in this matter my duty to myself and to him who loves me and whom i love is higher than my duty to you and to your scheme everything else you who are my father may require of me even to my life but my honour is my own what shall i say to this headstrong girl gasped zibalbay speak white man and tell me that you renounce her for surely your heart is not so wicked that it will lead you to consent to this folly and to your own undoing to stand between her and her destiny now all eyes were fixed upon the seсor who turned pale in the lamplight and answered slowly zibalbay i grieve to vex you but your daughters destiny and mine are one nor can i command her to forsake me and give herself in marriage to a man she hates yet it seems that you could command her to break her plighted troth for your sake o most honourable white man said zibalbay with a bitter laugh hearken friend ignatio for you at least are not in love tell your brother there and this rebellious girl which way their duty lies teach them that we are sent here to dwell upon the earth for higher ends than the satisfying of our own desires stay before you speak remember that with this matter your own fate is interwoven remember how you have suffered and striven for many years remember all you have undergone to win what today lies in your grasp the wealth that shall enable you to carry out your purposes there in those vaults it lies to your hand and if that be not enough i will give you more take it ignatio take it to bribe your enemies and pay your armies and become a king a righteous king crowned by heaven to complete the destinies of our race say such words as shall bend this girl and her lover to our will and triumph or fail to say them and some few days hence meet the end of a thief at the hands of tikal now speak i heard him and my heart stood still within me alas his words were true and now was the turningpoint of my fate if the girl would give herself to tikal who was mad with love of her all would be well and within three years the dream of my race might be fulfilled and the vengeance of generations accomplished upon the spawn of the accursed spaniard there in those vaults useless and forgotten lay the treasures that i needed and yonder in mexico were men in thousands who by their means might be armed and led but between me and them stood the desire of this woman and the folly of my friend oh truly had my heart warned me against her when first i learned to know her lovely face having foreknowledge of the evil that she should bring upon me with her i could do nothing for who can turn a woman from her love or hate but with my friend it was otherwise he would listen to me if i pleaded with him seeing that not only my hopes but my very life hung upon his answer and no true man has the right to bring others to their death in order that he may fulfil the wishes of his heart also it would be better that he should be separated from this girl who was not of his blood and colour and whose love soon or late would be his undoing surely i should do well to pray him to let her go to the man whose affianced she had been and he would do well to hearken to me almost the entreaty was upon my lips when maya reading my thought touched me on the arm and whispered remember your oath ignatio then i called to mind what i had promised yonder in the desert when by her courage she had saved her lovers life and knew that once again a woman must be my ruin since it is better to lose all than to break such vows as this zibalbay i said i cannot plead your cause and mine though not to do so be our destruction seeing that i have sworn that come what may i will not stand between these two today for the second time in my life my plans are brought to nothing by the passion of a woman well so it is fated and so let it be zibalbay did not answer me but turning to the seсor he said white man you have heard from your friend words that should touch you more deeply than any prayer will you still cling to your purpose and take advantage of my daughters madness if so know that your triumph shall be short for when in some few hours tikal comes again i will tell him all and give you over to his keeping to deal with as he wishes then heaven help you wanderer for he is vengeful by nature nor is that life likely to be long which bars the way between a ruler of men and the woman he would wed answer then and for the last time do you choose life or death i choose death he said boldly if the price of life be the breaking of my troth and the surrender of my bride to another man i am sorry for you zibalbay and for you ignatio my friend i am still more sorry but it is fate and not i that has brought these evils on you if ignatio here cannot forget his oath how much less can i forget mine which i have sworn with this lady moreover worse fortune even than todays would come upon us if i did seeing that such cowardice could breed no luck therefore till the lady maya renounces me for good or for evil in death or in life i will cleave to her and in death or in life i will cleave to you beloved she said take such vengeance as you wish upon us my father yes if you wish give over this man to whom my heart drew me across the mountains and the desert to die at the hands of tikal but know that he will hold me faster dead than he did while he was alive for into the valley of death i shall follow him swiftly now at last the rage of zibalbay broke loose and it was terrible rising from his seat he shook his clenched hands above his daughters head and cursed her till in her fear she shrank away from him to her lovers breast as with my last breath he cried i pray that the curse of your gods of your country of your ancestors and of me your father may rest upon you and your children may your desire turn to ashes in your mouth and may death rob you of its fruit may your heart break by inches for remorse and sorrow and your name become a hissing and a shame oh i seem to see the future and i tell you daughter that you shall win him for whose sake you brought your father to death and ruin by fraud shall you win him and for a while he shall lie at your side and this is the price that shall be asked of you and that you shall pay the doom of your race and its destruction at your hands he paused gasping for breath and maya fell at his knees sobbing oh father unsay those words and spare me have you no pity for a womans heart ay he said so much pity as you have for my sorrows and grey hair why should i spare you girl who have not spared me your father my curse is spoken and i will add to it that it shall break your heart at last ay and the heart of that man who has robbed me of your duty and your love then suddenly he ceased speaking his eyes grew empty he stretched out his arms and fell heavily to the floor chapter xviii the plot springing forward but too late to save him the seсor and i lifted zibalbay from the ground and laid him on a couch peeping over our shoulders maya caught sight of his ghastly face and the foam upon his lips oh he is dead she moaned my father is dead and he died cursing me no said the seсor he is not dead for his heart stirs bring water maya she obeyed and for hard upon two hours we struggled to restore his sense but in vain life lingered indeed but we could not stir him from his stupor at length as we were resting wearied with our fruitless labour the gates opened and tikal came again what now he asked seeing the form of zibalbay stretched upon the couch does the old man sleep yes he sleeps answered the seсor and i think that he will wake no more the words he spoke to you today are coming true and that which you took from him by force will soon be yours by right no answered tikal by right it will be the lady mayas yonder though by force it may remain mine unless indeed she gives it to me of her own free will but say how did this come about now i broke in hastily fearing lest the seсor should tell too much and thus bring some swift and awful fate upon himself he was worn out with the fatigue of our journey and the excitement of yesterday after you had left he began to talk of your proposals and suddenly was taken with this fit these matters are not for me to speak of who am but a prisoner in a strange land still lord it will not look well if he who once was cacique of this city dies here and unattended for then people may say that you have murdered him have you no doctors who can be summoned to minister to him for without drugs or even a bleedingknife we have done all we can do murdered him that they will say in any case yes there are doctors here and the best and greatest of them is mattai my fatherinlaw i will send him but maya before i go have you no word for me maya who was seated by the table her face buried in her hands looked up and said is your heart stone that you can trouble me in such an hour when my father is recovered or dead i will answer you and not before so be it lady he said till then i wait and now i must get hence for there may be trouble in the city when this news reaches it a while passed and mattai appeared before us followed by one who carried his scales and medicines without speaking he came to where zibalbay lay and examined him by the light of a lamp then he poured medicine down his throat and waited as though he expected to see him rise but he neither rose nor stirred a bad case he said i fear that he will awake no more how came he thus do you wish to know asked maya speaking for the first time then bid your attendant stand back and i will tell you my father yonder was smitten down while he cursed me in his rage and why did he curse you lady for this reason while we wandered in the wilderness tikal my cousin and my betrothed took a wife your daughter nahua who was crowned with him as lady of the heart but it seems mattai that though he gave your daughter place and power he gave her no love for today this soninlaw of yours came to my father and in the presence of us all offered to set him in his lawful place again and to suffer him to carry out his schemes whatever they might be if i would but consent to become his wife to become his wife said mattai in amazement how could you become his wife when he is married can there then be two ladies of the heart no answered maya quietly but the proposal of tikal my cousin is that he should either put away or kill your daughter and you with her mattai in order that he may set me in her place now when mattai heard this his quick eyes flashed and his very beard seemed to bristle with rage he proposed that he dared to propose that he gasped oh let him have a care i set him up and perchance i can pull him down again continue lady he proposed it and my father agreed to the offer for knowing that you have plotted against him he had little care for the honour and safety of you or of your house mattai but if my father accepted i refused seeing that it is not my wish to have more to do with tikal then my father cursed me and while he cursed was stricken down you say it is not your wish to marry tikal lady is it then your wish to marry any other man yes she answered letting her eyes fall i love this white lord here whom you name son of the sea and i would become his wife i would become his wife she went on after a pause but mattai tikal is very strong and it may be unless i can find help elsewhere that in order to save the life of the man i love of his friend and mine ignatio and my own i shall be forced into the arms of tikal but now tikal has asked me for my answer and i have told him that i will give it when my father is recovered or dead perhaps it will be for you to say what the answer shall be for alone and in prison i am not strong enough to stand against tikal say now do the people love me well enough to depose tikal and set me in my fathers place should he die i cannot say lady he answered shortly but at the least you will scarcely ask me thus to bring about my own and my daughters ruin i will be open with you i gained over the council of the heart to tikals cause and my price was that he should marry my daughter thereby satisfying her love and my ambition yes i have plotted to set nahua on high both for her sake and for my own seeing that after the cacique i sought to be the chief man in the city can i then turn round and depose him and my daughter and myself with him and if i did what would be my fate at your hands in the days to come no i seek to be revenged on tikal indeed who has offered so deadly an affront to me and mine but it must be in some other way than this tell me now lady what is it that you desire most to be cacique of this city by your right of birth or to marry the man you love i desire to marry the man i love she answered and to escape from this place with him back to those lands where white men live i desire also that my friend and my lords friend ignatio should be given as much gold as he needs to enable him to carry out his purposes in the coast country yonder if things can be brought about thus tikal and nahua and their descendants for aught i care may rule in the city of the heart till the worlds end you ask little enough lady said matti and it shall go hard if i cannot get it for you now i will leave you for i must have time to think but if tikal returns say him neither yea nor nay till we have spoken again and as for you strangers remember that your lives depend upon your caution farewell two more days passed or so we reckoned by the number of meals that were brought to us but neither tikal nor mattai returned to visit us other doctors came indeed and saw zibalbay who lay upon his bed like one plunged in a deep sleep but though they tried many remedies they were of no avail on the night of the second day we were gathered round his couch watching him and talking together sadly enough for the solitude and the darkness and the fear of impending death had broken our spirits so that even the seсor ceased to be merry and the presence of her beloved to give comfort to maya alas she said it was an evil day when we met yonder in the land of yucatan and friend no gift could have been more unlucky than that of my love to you for which being worth so little you are doomed to pay so dear fortune has gone hardly with you also ignatio who are fated thus for the second time to see a woman wreck your hopes say now friend and she caught the seсor by the arm would it not be best that we should make an end of all this folly and that i should give myself to tikal then i could bargain for you both that before i pass to him i should with my own eyes see you safe across the mountains taking that with you which would make you rich for life nor need you trouble for me or think that you left me to dishonour for so soon as you were gone i should seek the arms of another lord whose name is death and there take my rest till in some day unborn you came to join me cease to talk thus maya said the seсor drawing her to his breast whatever there is to bear we will undergo together since even if i could be so base as to buy safety at such a price without you my life would be worth nothing to me and indeed i had rather die at your side than live on alone it is my fault that ever we came to this pass seeing that if i had taken your counsel we should not have set foot within the city of the heart but curiosity conquered me for i longed to see the place as now i long to see the last of it also had we turned back i must have left ignatio to go on alone keep your courage sweetheart for though your father is dying and our danger is great i am sure that we shall escape from these dungeons and be happy with each other beneath the sunlight then he kissed her upon the lips and comforted her wiping away the tears that ran from her blue eyes it was at this moment that i looked up and saw mattai standing in the doorway for we were gathered not in the hall but in zibalbays chamber watching the scene curiously and with a softened face greeting he said and forgive me that i come so late but my business is secret and such as is best done at night how goes it with zibalbay he lives i answered i can say no more for he is senseless and without doubt soon must die but come see for yourself mattai walked to the bed and examined the old man lifting the eyelids and feeling his heart he cannot live long he said well death is his best friend now to my business there is trouble in the city and strange rumours pass from mouth to mouth among the people many of whom declare that tikal has murdered zibalbay and demand that you lady should be brought before them that you may be named cacique in his place things being so it has been urged upon tikal by the chiefs of his party that as do what he will he can never clear himself of the death of zibalbay it would be well that he should make away with you also lady and of course with these two strangers your friends seeing that then there will be none to dispute his rights the matter was laid before him strongly at a secret council held this afternoon and once he issued the order for your deaths only to recall it before the messenger left the palace for at the last i saw that his heart overcame his reason and he could not bear thus to divorce himself from you lady though what he said was that he would not stain his hands with the blood of one so innocent and fair still i will not hide from you lady or from you strangers that your danger is very great that you go indeed in jeopardy of your life from one hour to the next now he paused and maya asked in a low voice have you no plan to save us mattai why should i have a plan lady who with my house would benefit so greatly by your death i do not know why you should have a plan old man broke in the seсor but i tell you that you will do well to make one else you do not leave this place alive and as he spoke with a sudden movement he sprang between mattai and the door if we are to be murdered like birds in a cage he went on at least your neck shall be twisted first do you understand i understand son of the sea answered mattai flinching a little before the seсors fierce face and hand outstretched as though to grip him but i would have you understand something also namely that if i do not return presently there are some without who will come to seek me and then and then they will find your carcase broke in the seсor and what will all your plots and schemes advantage you when you are a lump of senseless clay little indeed i confess he answered still my daughter whom i love better than myself will reap some profit and with that in this sad case i must be content but do not be so hasty white man i asked why i should have a plan i did not say that i had none then if you have one let us hear it without more ado said the seсor mattai bowed as he answered your will is mine but i know not how my plan will please the lady maya yonder and therefore before i unfold it i will make it clear to you that there is but one alternative the death of all of you by tomorrows light your lives lie in my hand and if i must do so to save my daughter and myself i shall not hesitate to take them any more than i shall hesitate to take yours old man said the seсor grimly for remember always that if you do not make your plan such as we can accept you will leave this chamber feet first with a broken neck again mattai bowed and continued in one way only has tikal been able to pacify the tumult among the people by declaring that the lady maya shall be produced before the council of the heart in the sanctuary of the nameless god upon the night of rising of waters being the first day when it is lawful for the council to sit in the sanctuary and afterwards at dawn in the eyes of the whole city the words of zibalbay have taken a strange hold of the people although they cried him down as he spoke them and they desire to know what will happen when the prophecy is fulfilled and once more the severed halves of the symbol of the heart are laid side by side in their place upon the altar zibalbay told them that he believed that then the god would reveal his purpose and show what part each of you should play in the fate that is to be and therefore the people aye and many among the nobles and even the council of the heart look to see some sign or wonder when day and night are come together and that which was parted is made one for they begin to hold that the madness of zibalbay is from heaven and that the voice of heaven sent him on his journey now mattai thought for a while and went on lady i am old and for many years i have followed the worship of the gods doing sacrifice to them and importuning them with prayers yet never have i known the gods to make answer to their votaries or heard the voices of the immortals speaking into human ears it seems that gods are many thus perchance these strangers have their own and lady thus it comes that in my age i ask myself if there are any gods other than those that the mind of man has shaped from nothingness or fashioned in the likeness of its own passions i cannot tell but i think that were i in so sore a strait as you find yourselves tonight i should not hesitate to give a voice to these dumb gods what is your meaning asked maya this when the severed halves of the heart are set in their place upon the altar if there be any gods they should give a sign thus as i who am the keeper of the sanctuary know the ancient symbol on the altar is hollow and if it were to chance to open it might be that a writing would be found within it an ancient writing of the gods prepared against the present time that shall be to us as a lantern to one wandering in the dark or it might be that nothing would be found now as it happens in searching through the earliest records of the temple i have discovered a certain writing and it seems to me that your fortune would be great if this writing should lie within the symbol on the night of the rising of waters here it is and from his robe he produced a small plate of dull gold covered over with hieroglyphics read it said maya then mattai read this is the voice of the nameless god that his prophet heard in the year of the building of the sanctuary and graved upon a tablet of gold which he set in a secret place in the symbol of the sanctuary to be declared in that faroff hour when the lost is found and the signs of the day and the night are come together to thee it speaks unborn daughter of a chief to be whose name is the name of a nation when my people have grown old and their numbers are lessened and their heart is faint then maiden take to thyself as a husband a man of the race of the white god a son of the seafoam whom thou shalt lead hither across the desert for so my people shall once more prosper and grow strong and the land shall be to thy child and the child of the god east and west and north and south further than my eagles wing between sunrise and sunset he finished reading and there was silence as we looked on each other amazed at the boldness and cunning of this old priest and plotter it was maya who spoke first you have forged this writing mattai she said coldly and now you desire that i should set it in the symbol for you are mindful of that curse which is written in the ritual opening of the heart against him who shall profane its mysteries and token or who should are to tell a lie within the sanctuary or to swear falsely by the symbol in short if you do not fear the vengeance of the god you fear the vengeance of the order to speak truth lady i fear both for in offering insult to the nameless god who knows what he offends still you must make your choice and swiftly seeing that if you refuse the deed by tomorrow you will have learned or perhaps remembering the words of the white lord i should say we shall have learned what virtue there is in the religions now she turned to us saying advise me friends for i know not what to answer in the faith of my people i have lost faith and it is to yours that i look for comfort and yet the deed seems awful for if we are not worshippers of the nameless god still we are all of us brethren of the ancient mysteries of the heart and to do this thing would be to break our solemn oaths come let us put it to the vote and do you who are the oldest and the wisest among us vote first ignatio so be it i answered for my part i give my vote against the trick of the gods of your people i know nothing and think less but i am the master of our order in my own land and i will not offend against it to do this thing would be to act the greatest of lies and a lie is a sin in the face of heaven all men must die but i wish to pass to doom with my hands unstained by fraud still in this matter your lives are at stake as well as mine therefore if of the three of us two are in favour of the act i will be bound by their decision but if only one is in favour then he must be bound by ours good let it be so said maya and now beloved speak and tell us whether you choose death and a clean conscience or life and my love to gladden it and she looked into his face with her beautiful eyes and half stretched out her arms as though she would clasp him to her breast now although the seсor did not answer at once when i saw this and heard her words i ignatio knew that it was finished since it could not be in the heart of a man in love to resist her pleadings and her witcheries presently he spoke and as he did so his face grew red with a half shame i have no choice he said i do not fear to die if need be but i should be no man were i to choose death while it is your wish that i should live like ignatio i say that the gods of this city are to me nothing more than idols and to deceive that which does not exist is impossible for the rest i became a brother of the heart not by my own wish but by accident therefore on this point my conscience pricks me little only to be a partner in this plot i must speak or act a lie and this i have never done before still it seems to me that a man may choose life and his love in place of a cruel and secret death and keep his hands clean even though he must play a harmless trick as the price of them yet maya in this as in every other matter i will do your wish and if you think it better that we should die why let us die and make an end nay she answered with a flash of reckless passion i think it better that we should live far from this unlucky city and there be happy in each others love for your sake my fathers curse has fallen on me and after it all other maledictions of gods or men will be light as feathers if this be a sin that we are about to work i do it for the sake of you and of our love also because i would live awhile in happiness before i go down to the grave see my father lying there throughout a long life he has served his god and behold how his god has served him in the hour of his trouble let his prayers answer for us both for i will have none of such false gods unless it be to use them for my ends if this be a sin that we are about to do and vengeance should tread upon the heels of sin let it fall upon the heads of my people who would murder me for no crime upon the head of mattai who tempted me for his own advantage and if that be not enough upon my head also little do i care for vengeance to come if for only one short year i may call you husband illomened words muttered mattai shivering a little words that only a woman would utter but so be it as he spoke i thought that i heard a faint groan break from the man upon the couch i glanced anxiously at zibalbay to find that i must have been mistaken or at least that it had not proceeded from his lips for he lay there rigid and senseless as a corpse the vote is taken i said sadly what next mattai follow me he answered and i will show you a secret path from this chamber to the sanctuary beneath nay you need not fear to leave him for if his life still burns within him it is fast asleep but stay where is the talisman that will be necessary to us i have one half i answered the other is about zibalbays neck find it he said sternly to the lady maya nay you must chapter xix the sacrilege now maya bent over the form of her father and took the talisman from his neck i feel like one who robs the dead she said remember that it is to save the living and be comforted answered mattai come let us be going for the night draws on take a lamp each of you he said presently when we had reached the further end of the great hall where he unlocked the copper gates with a key from the bunch that hung at his girdle we passed though and turning he almost closed the gate but not quite why do you leave the gates ajar i asked because there are none to follow us he answered and who knows what may happen should we be forced to fly the sanctuary open doors are easier to pass than those that are shut who or what could force us to fly the sanctuary i asked mattai shrugged his shoulders and went on without answering now we passed down many stairs along passages and through secret doors each of which mattai left open behind us till at length we came to a blank wall of marble on this wall mattai felt with his thumb till he found a spot that being pressed slid back revealing a keyhole into which he inserted a small silver key then again he pressed upon the marble and a panel moved that might have been two feet wide by six in height and we saw that light streamed through the opening beckoning to us he walked through the gap in the wall and one by one we followed him into the sanctuary of the nameless god and stood on the further side of the wall huddled together and clasping each others hands for the place was awesome and its utter silence and solemnity filled us with fear the first thing that caught our eyes as was natural for it was built into the wall opposite to us and through it streamed the light that filled the chamber was the most wonderful and mystic effigy in the city of the heart that effigy was a colossal mask of singular and fearful beauty fashioned from polished jade and similar in design to those which are to be found in the ruins of palenque and other deserted indian cities whereof no man knows the age this huge green mask was placed above the narrow door that gave entrance to the sanctuary and had been carved to represent the countenance of a being that although its features were human resembled neither man nor woman in its unearthly dignity and its stamp of cruel calm the thick lips were curved with a contemptuous smile and between them gleamed teeth made of white enamel the nose was aquiline with widespread nostrils that seemed to inhale the incense of worship and the forehead in whose centre appeared the impress of a womans hand soaked in some scarlet dye was broad low and retreating beneath the solemn and contracted brows were jewelled eyes through these eyes and indeed from the entire surface of the mask streamed light making the face visible as though it were limned in phosphorus for the jade was transparent as the thinnest alabaster and behind it burned two great lamps that were named after the sun and moon such was the effigy of the nameless spirit that we now beheld for the first time who had face but no form the spirit mouth of the heart to whom every lesser god was subject utterer of the thoughts of the heart of heaven lord of power dweller in the darkness behind the sun searcher of the secrets of death without pity was this god of theirs and without wrath who clothed in eternal calm so these people fabled rested in a home of darkness watching the shadow of events celestial and terrestrial in his mirror of the moon and telling of them to the heart which was his soul the seal of the womans bloodstained hand was set upon his brow because woman is a symbol of life renewed the hand is the sign of purpose and the strength to do it and by blood and anguish must every purpose be accomplished but the nameless one executed no purpose that was the work of lesser gods in the beginning the heart thought and the mouth blew with his breath giving life to the earth and causing it to roll forward among the spheres and now the eyes watched ever smiling while it and those upon it work out our doom till at length its primal force grows faint and fails when so said the priests heart and mouth and ears will think and speak and search and at their command a new world shall arise from the corpse of the old and a new life from the lives of those who dwelt upon it therefore it was though now faith waned among them with their waning energies that the people knowing no better creed worshipped the threefold fate without a name whom they held to be master of gods and men therefore also long generations since in this spot which we came to violate to them the most holy on the earth they set up effigies of a heart a mouth and eyes as symbols of his attributes the roof of the sanctuary which was of no great size was vaultshaped in imitation of the arching sky and in it appeared a golden sun a silver crescent moon and the stars of heaven its walls were lined throughout with polished blocks of the beautiful stone known as mexican onyx fretted over to the height of a man with a border of hieroglyphics and effigies of the lesser gods in attitudes of adoration all of them cast in gold and set flush with the face of the wall the furniture was very simple consisting only of stools cut from rich woods heavily gilded in quaint designs and a small table whereon lay sheets of paper made of bark together with brushes of reed fibre and pots of pigment such as were used in the picturewriting of this people lastly at that end by which we had entered the chamber stood an altar of black marble written around with letters shaped in gold and upon this altar lay something covered with a silken cloth for a minute or more we remained silent contemplating these wonders then with a gesture of impatience mattai spoke in a whisper saying let that be done which we have come to do for now the sacrilege is committed and it is too late for doubts speaking thus he stepped to the altar and lifted the silken cloth that lay over the object which was upon it revealing the image of a human heart fashioned in bloodstone and veined with arteries of gold in the centre of this heart appeared a small and shallow hole that had been hollowed in its substance this is the tradition said mattai still speaking in a whisper that when the two halves of a certain talisman are placed in this hollow the symbol will open and reveal that which has been set within it since it was fashioned by cucumatz thousands of years ago and there is this in favour of the truth of the tale that golden hinges appear upon the sides of the symbol now onehalf of the talisman has rested here for many generations till zibalbay took it with him indeed when he went out to seek for the other half and yet the symbol has never opened still i am sure that it will open when the whole talisman is set in its place in this matter however there is something more to fear than the vengeance of the gods for as i can read well it is written in those letters that encircle the altar an ancient tradition tells us that if the symbol be stirred from the place where it has lain for so many ages the floodgate will roll back and the waters of the lake will pour in upon the city destroying it and its inhabitants yet the floodgate cannot roll back when it is not shut nor can the waters flow in during the dry season when they are not on a level with the walls answered maya they cannot lady and yet other things may happen why was the heart set thus was it not that in the utmost need of its worshippers they might choose death rather than defeat and slavery and was this choice given to them in the wet months only be sure that if at this moment any despairing or impious hand tore yonder symbol from its altar either the waters would rush up through the bed of the city or subterranean fires would break loose and burn it still though there is something i think that we have little to fear seeing that the writing says that in order to bring about so terrible a doom the symbol must be torn from its altar with might and now to our task stranger give to the lady maya your half of the ancient talisman that she may set it together with the half she bears in the place prepared in the symbol now with a sigh seeing that it was too late to draw back i undid the emerald from my neck and gave it to maya who laid it side by side with its counterpart upon the palm of her trembling hand and stepped with it to the altar here she stood for a moment then whispered in a faint voice terror has taken hold of me and i fear to do this thing yet it must be done and not by me said mattai or we shall have come on a fools errand and go back some of us to a fools death and he looked towards me i will not do it i said answering his look not because i fear your gods but my own conscience i do fear then i will said the seсor boldly for i fear neither give me that trinket maya she obeyed and presently he had caused the two halves of the talisman to fall into their ancient and appointed bed in the symbol in the great silence i remember the sound they made as they tinkled against the stone struck my ear so sharply that i started for some seconds perhaps twenty we stood still watching the altar with eager eyes but the symbol never stirred then i said it seems mattai that you must hide your lying writing elsewhere since yonder heart will not open or if it will we have not found the key wait a little broke in the seсor perhaps the springs are rusted and before any of us could interfere to stop him he placed his thumb upon the halves of the emerald and pressed so hard that the symbol trembled on its marble stand beware cried mattai and as the echoes of his voice died away all of us started in astonishment for lo the heart was opening like a flower slowly it opened till the severed talisman fell from it and its two halves lay back on the marble of the altar revealing something hidden in its centre that shone like an ember in the lamplight we crept forward and looked then stood silent and half afraid for in the hollow of the heart laid upon a square plate of gold which was covered with picturewriting glared a red jewel shaped like a human eye that seemed to answer stare with stare if we stand like this we shall grow frightened said the seсor roughly glancing round him as he spoke there is nothing to fear in a red stone cut like an eye if you think so white man answered mattai in a voice that shook a little strive as he would to command it lift up the holy thing and give me the writing that is beneath it stay first take this set it in the symbol replacing the eye upon it and he handed him the forged tablet the seсor obeyed nor did any wonder come to pass when he lifted that dreadfullooking jewel and changed the true for the false read it said maya as the tablet was passed to mattai you have knowledge of the ancient writings perhaps it were best left unread he said doubtfully nay she answered let us know the worst read it i bid you then he read these strange words in a slow and solemn voice the eye that has slept and is awakened sees the heart and purpose of the wicked i say that in the hour of the desolation of my city not all the waters of the holy lake shall wash away their sin now the faces of us who heard turned grey in the lamplight for though the gods of this people were false we felt that the voice of a true prophet spoke to us from that accusing tablet and that we had called down upon our heads a vengeance which we could not measure did i not tell you that it were wiser to leave the writing unread gasped mattai letting the tablet fall from his hand as though it were a snake the clatter of it as it struck the marble floor seemed to wake us from our evil dream for the seсor turned on him and said fiercely what does it matter what the thing says rogue seeing that you forged it as you have forged the other ah would that i had answered mattai but when doom overtakes you and all of us then shall you learn whether i forged that ancient writing and he lifted it from the floor and hiding it in his robe added close the heart white man and give back the severed jewel to those who wear it the seсor obeyed replacing the silken cloth over the symbol so that the altar seemed to be as it had been now let us be going said mattai and rejoice that if yonder eye has seen our wickedness at least it is hidden from the sight of man doubtless the vengeance of the gods is sure but that of men is swift as he spoke we turned to leave the sanctuary and of a sudden maya screamed and would have fallen had not the seсor caught her well might she scream for there in the narrow niche of the secret door by which we had entered framed in it as a corpse is framed in its coffin stood a white figure which at first i took to be that of some avenging ghost so ghostlike were the wrappings the snowy beard and hair and the thin fierce face another instant and i saw that indeed it was a ghost the ghost of zibalbay or rather his body come back from the boundaries of death to spy upon our sacrilege before it crossed them forever yes it was zibalbay for while he had seemed to be unconscious upon the bed in the chamber his senses were awake and oh what must he have suffered when he the high priest of the nameless god heard us plan our fraud upon his sanctuary then after we had left him fury and despair unfettered the limbs that had been bound so fast and gave him strength to follow us though they could not unlock his frozen tongue he had followed painfully he had crept down the stairs along the passages and through the open door for the path was known to him even in the dark till at length he came to the secret entrance of the sanctuary here once more his force deserted him here unable to speak or stir he had leaned against the wall and seen and heard all that was done and said oh never shall i forget the rage of his quivering face or the agony and horror of his tormented eyes as they met our own no course could have been so awful as that look which he let fall upon his daughter and no outraged deity or demon could have seemed more terrible to the human sight than was the tall figure of this dying man striving even in death to protect the honour of his gods which we had violated in their most holy of holies never have i seen such a dreadful sight and i pray that never again may i do so either in this world or the next the dying zibalbay saw our fear and with a last effort he staggered forward towards his daughter his clenched hands held above his head for a moment he stood before her as she lay upon her lovers arm staring up at him like a bird at a snake while he swayed to and fro above her like the snake about to strike then of a sudden foam mingled with blood burst from his lips and he sank down at her feet dead dying in a silence that was more awful than any sound of all that followed i need not write indeed i cannot do so for so great was my horror at this scene and so intense the strain which was put upon my vital force during these hours that i have little memory of what chanced after zibalbays death till i found myself lying exhausted upon the bed in my prison cell somehow we calmed and silenced maya somehow we escaped from that hateful sanctuary and by slow degrees brought her and the dead body of her father up the narrow stairs and passages to the hall above where we laid the corpse upon its bed then mattai left us and i remember no more till the next morning when nobles and leeches came to watch by the body of the dead cacique and to embalm it in readiness for the tomb the next two days went heavily for the three of us oppressed as we were by the silent gloom of our prison and the memories of that dreadful night the love between maya and her father had never been deep for they were out of tune with each other still now that he was dead she mourned him the more perhaps because he had died hating and cursing her by degrees she recovered from her superstitious fears born of the writing in the symbol but her fathers maledictions she never could forget and though she was willing to earn and to bear these for the sake of her love for the seсor i think that their memory lay between them like a shadow oh why did i ever love you she would say what have you to do with me whom race and law and fate have set apart from me and yet she went on loving him even more dearly i also was unhappy for though i put little faith in these omens or in the vapourings of dead prophets and the tricks of living charlatans i felt that the illluck which had clung to me in the past was with me still things had gone cross with me zibalbay was dead and woman the inevitable had drawn away the heart of my friend and dragged me and my plans into the whirlpool of her passion whence if at all they must emerge ruined and shapeless still summoning the patience of my race to my aid i bore these secret troubles as i might giving counsel and comfort to the lovers who lost in their own doubts and difficulties thought as was natural little of me and my lost ambitions at length they carried away the corpse of zibalbay to be wrapped in its windingsheet of gold and set with all ancient pomp and ceremony by those of its forefathers in the hall of the dead maya wept indeed but i for my part was glad to see the last of him and so i think was the seсor whose spirits had begun to fail him in the presence of so much remorse and grief that day it was the day previous to the night of the rising of waters on which we were to appear before the council of the heart in the sanctuary tikal came to visit us to maya he bowed low but on the seсor and myself he looked with an angry eye with the eye indeed of one who would have killed us if he dared first with many fine words and empty compliments he offered her his sympathy upon the death of her father for this she returned her thanks quoting however with a flash of her old spirit a certain proverb of her own people of which the meaning is that the death of one man is the breath of another my father was your foe tikal she added and now that he is gone you will be able to sleep and reign in peace not altogether so lady he answered seeing that he has left behind him a more dangerous rival to my power namely yourself i will not hide from you maya what you must soon learn that a large portion of the people and with them many of the nobles accusing me of your fathers murder clamour that i should be deposed and that you should be set in my place as cacique of the city of the heart some few days ago i might have stilled their outcry by commanding you to be put to death but now it is too late for since then time has fought for you and doubtless your end would be followed by my own when last we met cousin i asked you a certain question to which you promised me an answer when your father was dead or recovered and today i have come to hear that answer while zibalbay lived i had much to offer him and you in exchange for your hand and i offered it freely so high a value did i place upon it when it seemed lost to me that i was prepared to lay down my power to suffer your father to violate the laws and to incur the eternal hate and active enmity of mattai his daughter and his party now i must make you a lower bid that of equal power for yourself and for your friends here whatever they may desire should you refuse me this is the alternative civil war in the city till one of us is destroyed and instant death as the portion of these strangers but maya i pray you not to refuse me for i have something more to offer you my undying love from a child i always loved you maya although you have treated me coldly enough and now day by day i love you more indeed i believed that you and your father were dead yonder in the wilderness for then i had faith in mattai whom now i know to be a rogue and mattai swore that it was written in the stars even so i would not have wed another woman for my heart bled at the loss of you had not mattai made this marriage the price of his support without which i could not hope to be anointed cacique seeing that i have many jealous enemies it was ambition that led me to consent and bitterly have i regretted my folly ever since for if she who is called my wife loves me i hate her and by this means or by that i will be rid of her forgive me then my sin against you remembering only that i have loved and served you in the past as i will love and serve you in the future and that it was you who brought about these troubles because though i prayed you to stay and did all in my power to prevent you you determined to accompany your father upon his mad journey into the wilderness now i have spoken and i thank you for the courtesy with which you have listened to me you have spoken cousin she answered and your words have been gentle yet if i understand you right some few days since you were in doubt as to whether it would not be better to murder me here in this darksome hole where you have placed us if policy put any such thought into my mind maya love drove it out again he answered with confusion so you admit that this was so she said well a day may come when policy might breed the thought and love grown weary prove not warm enough to wither it also it seems that even now you threaten these my companions with death should i refuse you your desire if you should refuse me my desire maya perhaps it will be for a secret reason of your own and he scowled at the seсor angrily a reason that the death of these men or of one of them will remove be sure of one thing tikal she broke in sharply that such a wicked deed would put an end for ever to your hopes of making me your wife now listen i have heard your words and they have touched me somewhat for i think that although you have broken your oath to my father and your troth with me at heart you are honest in your love still i can give you no answer now and for this reason that the answer does not lie with me but rather with the gods tomorrow night we appear before the high court of the council of the heart and you yourself shall set the severed portions of the talisman that we have travelled so far to seek in the place prepared to receive it in the symbol that is on the altar of the sanctuary then as my dead father believed and he was gifted with wisdom from above the god shall declare his purpose in this way or in that showing his servants why all these things have come about and what they must do to fulfil his will by that will cousin and not by my own i shall be guided in this and in all other things now tikal thought awhile and answered and if nothing follows this ceremony and the oracles of the god are silent what then then tikal she said softly you may ask me again if i will become your wife and perhaps if the council suffers it i shall not say you nay now farewell for grief still shadows me and i can talk no more chapter xx the council of the heart now when tikal was gone i sat silent for although it might be necessary to save our lives and to bring about the fulfilment of mayas love all this doubledealing did not please me and i could not talk of it with a light heart but the seсor said i hope that yonder rogue mattai may not have repented or been overbribed by tikal and set some other prophecy in the hollow of the symbol for then maya you will be taken at your word and things will be worse than ever they have been i pray not and it is not likely she answered starting then with a quick burst of passion she added but why do you look at me with such reproach ignatio no do not answer for i know why it is because you think me a cheater and a liar and are saying in your heart this is a womans honour thus would any woman act in the hour of temptation ignatio with all your courtesy you hate and despise us women looking on us as lower then yourselves as a snare to your strength and a pitfall for your feet well if so thus we were made and can we quarrel with that which made us also in some ways we are greater than you though you may be pleased to call yourselves more honest you would not have dared for your love what i have dared for mine you would not have offered deadly outrage to the god of your people to the instinct of your blood and the teachings of your youth no you would have sat still and wrung your hands and seen your lover perish before your face and then have turned your eyes to the sky and said it cannot be helped it is well at least i am clean in the sight of heaven so be it i maya am of a different nature i have dared all these things and i joy in them even though you watch me ever with your melancholy eyes why should i not is not my love everything to me and is it shameful that this should be so i believe no more in this unknown god why then should i fear to offend him i will not see my betrothed given up to death and myself to worse than death and how can i harm my people by taking a man nobler than themselves to be my husband cease then to reproach me by your silence or rather learn to pity me for my strait is sore and doubtless vengeance dogs my heels let it fall if it will on me but not on you beloved oh not on you and suddenly her anger left her and she sank into the seсors arms and lay there weeping bitterly then i went to the further end of the hall and sat there reading the ancient writings of this people which we had found in the chamber indeed this was my daily occupation for now i found that these lovers liked to be alone unless it happened that there were plans to be thought out or counsel to be given a shadow grew between me and the seсor in those days for though he said nothing of it he also was angry because i did not approve of the dark plot to which we were parties and mayas outburst spoke his mind with her own nor was this wonderful for now looking back i do not blame her or him or think that they did wrong and i believe that what i really felt was not indignation at a trick which might well be pardoned seeing how much hung to it but superstitious fear lest some force human or infernal should visit that trick with vengeance for as we know even the devils have power against us if we give it to them by fighting the world with their own weapons on the following day the attendants who set our meals brought with them clean robes for each of us scented and wonderfully worked and for maya certain royal ornaments in these we arrayed ourselves before evening and waited the hours passed and at length the copper gates were opened and a band of nobles and guards presented themselves before us saying that they were commanded to lead us to the sanctuary we answered that nothing would please us better who were heartily weary of living like rats in the dark and in a few minutes we found ourselves walking up the stairs towards the crest of the pyramid we reached it and saw the stars shining above us and felt the breath of heaven blowing in our faces and never have the sight of the stars or the taste of the night air seemed more sweet to me leaving the watchhouse we walked to the great stair across the lonely summit of the pyramid and began to descend its side at the foot of the stairway we turned to the right till we came to a double door of copper beautifully worked placed in the centre of the western face of the pyramid and guarded by a small body of soldiers who saluted and admitted us beyond the doors was a great hall not unlike that which had served as our prison lit with lamps lined with polished marble and having on either side of its length doorways leading to the apartments that were used as sleepingplaces for the officers on duty at the threshold of this hall we were met by priests clothed in pure white into whose custody we were given by the company of nobles and soldiers that had escorted us thus far surrounded by the priests who chanted as they walked we passed down the hall till we reached another and a smaller door beyond this lay a labyrinth of steeply sloping passages running in every direction deep into the bowels of the rock beneath the pyramid so intricate and numerous were these tunnels that even with the assistance of the lights which the priests carried it would have been almost impossible for any one not having their secret to find a path through them or even to keep his face in a given direction for more than a few paces along these passages our guides went without faltering turning now to the right now to the left and now seeming to retrace their footsteps till at length they halted to open a third door covered over with plates of beaten gold on the further side of which lay the most sacred spot save one in the city of the heart the chamber that served the threefold purpose of a judgmenthall a church wherein the nobles attended worship and a burialplace of the departed caciques of the city here in this vast and awful vault each of them set in his own niche and companioned by his consort stood the bodies of every kingpriest who had reigned in the holy city enclosed in coffins of solid gold fashioned to the shape and likeness of the corpse within and having the name age date of death and a brief account of the good or evil that the man had done cut in symbols on his breast there they stood eternally men and women made in gold and beneath their brows gleamed false eyes of emeralds numerous as were the niches in the chamber each had its tenants and in the last recess that nearest to the entrance stood a new comer for here in his gilded sheath was placed the corpse of zibalbay by the side of her who had been his wife and mayas mother for a moment maya paused to look upon the bodies of her parents then with a sigh and an obeisance she passed on saying to me see this hall of the dead is full there is no place left for me or for my descendants and surely that is an evil omen well she added with a sigh what does it matter where they set us when we are dead for my part i had sooner sleep in the earth or beneath the waters than stand for ever cased in gold and glaring with jewelled eyes upon the darkness yes if i might i should choose the earth that bore me for it would turn my flesh to flowers then we went on defiling before the silent company of the golden dead who seemed to watch us as we walked till passing round a judgmentseat that was set near the end of the hall we stood in front of a little door over which burned great lamps this door was guarded by two priests with drawn swords which they pointed towards us as a sign that we should halt then the priests who had escorted us so far fell back behind the judgmentseat and we were left alone give the sign keepers of the gate said maya thereupon one of the men with the drawn swords uttered a low and peculiar cry like to the wail of a child when he had made this strange sound thrice at intervals of about half a minute it was answered from within by another and a louder cry pitched upon the same note then of a sudden the door was flung wide and a sternlooking man with a shaven head came through it who are you that seek entrance into the sanctuary he asked are you gods or devils men or women we are two men and a woman answered maya priests and priestess of the heart and we come to take our trial before the council of the heart as is our right do you know the open signs of the heart the signs of brotherhood of unity and of love that you dare to stand upon the threshold of the sanctuary to cross which is death to the ignorant we know them answered maya and one by one we gave those signs do you know the secret signs of the heart that you dare to cross this threshold he asked again otherwise get you back and take your trial in the common judgmenthall i know them answered maya and i vouch for these men who accompany me suffer me then to enter and these with me for i am here by ancient right and i have knowledge both of the outward signs and the inner mysteries now the man withdrew and the door was closed behind him presently he appeared again and said i have reported to the council and it is the will of the council that you should enter follow me said maya to us and when you are spoken to make no answer till i have vouched for you i will answer for you the priests let their swords fall and passing through the doors for there were two of them connected by a short passage once more we found ourselves standing beneath the mask of the unknown god in the sanctuary of the city of the heart but now it was no longer empty behind the little altar were three stools and upon them clad in wonderful apparel and adorned with gold and gems sat tikal mattai and nahua who was the only woman present in front of the altar was an open space and beyond its circle each wearing the orders of his spiritual rank sat the brethren of the heart according to their degree to the number of thirtysix led by maya we advanced into the space before the altar and stood there in silence none of those present took note of us indeed they did not seem to see us but sat with bent heads and with hands folded crosswise on their breasts at length one of the brethren he who was nearest to the door and had questioned us without rose and addressing tikal said keeper of the heart one who claims to be of our company stands before you and with her two for whom she vouches who although they be strangers by your command i have proved to be brethren of the heart though what more they may be i know not be pleased then to prove them also by the voice of their sponsor that their mouths may be opened and their prayer come to the ears of the council at his words two of the brethren rose and blindfolded the seсor and myself lest we should see the sacred signs with all of which indeed i was well acquainted but maya they did not blindfold then we heard tikal asking how are you named who are strange to our eyes we made no reply for a voice in our ears cautioned us to be silent we are named the son of the sea and ignatio the wanderer answered the voice of maya son of the sea and ignatio the wanderer why come you here asked tikal through the gate on which is written death to the stranger and to the uninstructed because we have a prayer to utter an offering to make and because although we dwell in a far land we are the servants of the heart answered maya how come ye here the heart led the mouth whispered and we followed the light of the eyes show me the sign of the light of the eyes or die to this world now there was silence and though we could not see it maya showed the sign on our behalf show me the second sign the sign of the mouth or be cursed by the mouth and die to this world and the next again there was silence show me the sign of the heart the third and greatest sign lest the heart think on you and ye die to this world to the next world and all the worlds that are to be lest ye be cast out between the light and darkness and lost in the gulf of fire that joins heaven to hell now we heard a sound of rustling as though all the company had risen and were prostrating themselves and presently the bandages were lifted from our eyes strangers said tikal your mouths are opened in the sanctuary according to the ancient form and it is lawful for the council to listen to your prayer speak then without fear then i spoke saying brethren for so i will dare to call you seeing that i also though a stranger am of the brotherhood of the heart as i can prove to you if need be ay and higher in rank than any present here unless it be you o keeper of the heart on my own behalf on behalf of my brother who also is of our company and on behalf of maya lady of the heart daughter of him who ruled you and heiress to his power i speak and make my prayer to you it would seem that we three together with zibalbay who is dead and therefore beyond the execution of your judgment have violated the laws of this city we by daring to enter its gates and zibalbay and the lady maya by leading us to those gates for this crime we should have been put to death eight days ago upon the pyramid had not the lady maya here claimed a right to have our cause laid before this high tribunal in her case and in that of her father this was conceded and i pray now that the same clemency may be extended to me and to my brother upon what grounds do you claim this stranger asked tikal upon the ground that we are brethren of the inmost circle of the heart and therefore have committed no crime in visiting this city which is free to us by right of our rank and office now there was a murmur of true from the council behind me and tikal also said true but added if you are brethren from the inmost circle of the heart you are free from offence but first you must prove that this is so which as yet you have not done a brother of the inmost circle knows its mysteries and can answer the secret questions come let us put you to the test but first let the white man be removed from the sanctuary for in this matter each must vouch for himself accordingly the seсor was led away and the doors having been closed and the lamps shaded the oldest and most instructed of the councillors stood forward and put me to the test with many questions all of which i answered readily then they commanded me to stand before the altar and as keeper of the heart to open the heart in the highest degree this i did also though afterwards they told me that my ritual differed in some particulars from their own after that i took up my parable and questioned them till at length none there could answer me no not even the high priest or mattai and they confessed humbly that i was more instructed than any one of them and because of this knowledge from that day forward i was held in veneration in the city of the heart now i was given a seat among the brethren the highest indeed after those of the chief priest and the great officers and the seсor was summoned he entered with a downcast look and while maya and i watched him sadly his examination began it was not long at the second question he became confused used angry language in spanish and english and broke down brethren said tikal and there was joy in his eye as he spoke it seems that we need not trouble further with this impostor by daring to enter our city he has earned the penalty of death moreover he has blackened his crime by claiming to be of our brotherhood whereas he scarcely knows the simplest password is it your will that he should be taken to his fate if so speak the word of doom now maya rose affrighted but motioning to her to be silent i spoke saying hear me before that fatal word is spoken which cannot be recalled this man is of our inmost brotherhood though he has not been formally admitted to the inner circles and has forgotten those of the mysteries which were taught to him at his initiation listen and i will tell you how he came to join the order of the heart and i told them that tale of my rescue by the seсor and told them also all the story of our meeting with zibalbay and of our journey to the city of the heart speaking to them for an hour or more while they hearkened earnestly when i had done they debated as to the fate of the seсor and though by only one vote decided that if i had nothing more to urge on his behalf he must straightway die i have something more to urge before you pass judgment i said in my need and despair speaking and acting a lie to save the life of my beloved friend yes i who had blamed maya for this same deed though it has to do with the mysteries of your religion rather than with those of our order it was the belief of zibalbay who is dead that when the two halves of the ancient talisman the halves night and morning that together make the perfect day are set in their place in the symbol which once they filled before the dividing of peoples then it shall be made clear what part must be played by each of us wanderers in the fate that is to be to this end did zibalbay undertake his journey and lo here is that which he went to seek and i drew the talisman from my breast take it tikal for i resign it and lay it with its fellow in the place that is prepared for them so that we may learn and all your people may learn what truth there is in the visions of zibalbay that is our desire answered tikal taking the severed emerald and its counterpart which maya gave to him let the white man son of the sea be placed without the sanctuary and guarded there awhile for so at least he will gain time to prepare himself for death fear not lady he added noting mayas anxious face no harm shall be done to him till this matter of the prophecy is made clear now for the second time the seсor was removed and when he had gone tikal spoke tracing the history of the prophecy so far as it was known and reciting its substance that when once more the two halves of the symbol of the heart were laid side by side in their place on the altar in the sanctuary then from that hour the people should grow great again in all this he said i have little faith still zibalbay who in his way was wise believed it and the story having gone abroad the people clamour that it should be put to the test is this your will also it is our will answered the councillors good then let it be done and on your heads be it if harm should come of the deed mattai the council commands you to set these fragments in the hollow of the symbol if such is the order of the council i have no choice but to obey said mattai yet though none else have done so i give my voice against it for i hold that this is childishness and never did i know any good to spring from prophecies and he paused as though waiting for an answer obey obey said the council for curiosity had got a hold of them and they craned their necks forward to see what might happen obey repeated tikal but beware how you shake the heart lest the legend prove true and we should perish in the doom of waters then mattai set the two halves of the talisman in their place and as before in the midst of an utter silence lo the symbol opened like a flower leaning forward i saw the eye within its hollow but it seemed to me that the fire had faded from the heart of the jewel for now it gleamed coldly like the eye of a man who is two hours dead i think that mattai noted this also for as the symbol opened he started and his hand shook now when they saw the marvel a gasp of wonder rose from the council then tikal spoke saying it seems that there was wisdom in zibalbays madness for the heart has opened indeed and within it is a stone eye resting upon a plate of gold that is covered with writing read the writing they cried displacing the eye tikal lifted the plate of gold and scanned it i cannot he said shaking his head it is written in a character more ancient than any i have learned take it mattai for you are instructed in such signs now mattai took the tablet and studied it long with an anxious face upon which at length light broke that changed anon to wonder or rather blank amaze so that i watching him began to think not knowing all the cleverness of mattai that the seсor was right and the tablet had been tampered with since we saw it read read cried the council brethren he said the words seem clear and yet so strange is this writing that i fear my learning is at fault and that i had best give it to others to decipher no read read they cried again almost angrily then he read this is the voice of the nameless god that his prophet heard in the year of the building of the sanctuary and graved upon a tablet of gold which he set in a secret place in the symbol of the sanctuary to be declared in that faroff hour when the lost is found and the signs of the day and the night are come together to thee it speaks unborn daughter of a chief to be whose name is the name of a nation when my people have grown old and their numbers are lessened and their heart is faint then maiden take to thyself as a husband a man of the race of the white god a son of the seafoam whom thou shalt lead hither across the desert for so my people shall once more prosper and grow strong and the land shall be to thy child and the child of the god east and west and north and south further than my eagles wing between sunrise and set now as mattai read the face of tikal grew black with rage and before ever the echoes of his voice had died away he sprang from his seat crying whoever it was that wrote this lying prophecy god or man let him be accursed shall the lady maya for her it must be whose name is the name of a nation be given in marriage to the white dog who awaits his doom without that door and shall his son rule over us first i will see her dead and him with her then one of the eldest of the council a man named dimas who as i learned afterwards had been fosterbrother to zibalbay rose and answered wrathily it seems that these things must be so tikal and beware how you utter threats of death lest they should fall upon your own head we have called upon the god and the god has spoken in no uncertain voice the lady maya must become wife to the white man son of the sea and then things shall befall as they are fated what answered tikal is this wandering stranger to be set over me and all of us that i do not know said the councillor the writing does not say so the writing says that his son shall be set over us and as yet he has no son but this is certain that the lady maya must be given to him as wife and in her right he well may rule seeing that she is the lawful heir to her father and not you tikal although you have usurped her place now many voices called upon maya and she stood forward and spoke with downcast eyes what shall i say she began except one thing that my will is the will of the gods and if it is fated that i should be given to the white man in marriage why so let it be for many years i was taught to look elsewhere but he who was to have been my husband and she pointed towards tikal chose himself another wife and now i see that he did this not altogether of his own will but because it was so decreed one thing more i who am but a woman have no desire to rule or to take the place that the lady nahua holds the writing says that in a day to come a faroff day some child of mine if indeed i am that daughter of a chief whose name is the name of a nation shall rule in truth let him then come in his hour and take the glories that await him and meanwhile tikal do you sit in your place and leave me to rest in peace the lady maya speaks you fair tikal and my daughter said mattai and if the people will have it you may do well to accept her offer leaving the future to shape itself she says she is ready to take the white man as a husband but we have not yet heard whether the white man will take her as a wife it may be he added with a smile that he will rather choose to die but at the least we must have an answer from his lips that is if you accept this prophecy as sent from heaven say do you accept it we accept it answered the council almost with one voice then let the white man son of the sea be brought before us said mattai chapter xxi the marriage of maya presently the door opened and the seсor was led into the sanctuary as he thought to his death for i saw that his teeth were set and that his hand was clenched as though to defend himself but as he came the most of the council rose and bowed to him crying hail to you son of the sea favoured of heaven father foreordained of the deliverer to come then he knew that the plot had succeeded and he uttered a great sigh of relief hearken white lord said mattai for tikal sat still and scowled on him in silence the gods have spoken by their oracle as zibalbay thought so it is and your feet have been led for a purpose to the gates of the city of the heart listen to the words of the gods and taking the tablet he read to him the false prophecy now choose white man will you take the lady maya to wife or will you be put to death in that having wandered to the city of the heart you refuse to obey the command of its gods now the seсor thought and answered the man would be foolish who hesitated between death and so fair and sweet a bride still this is a matter that i cannot decide alone what says the lady maya she says answered maya that although this is a marriage for which she did not look and it is a new thing that a daughter of the heart should take a stranger of less ancient blood to husband the will of heaven is her will and the lord that heaven chooses for her shall be her lord and she stretched out her hand to the seсor he took it and bending down kissed her fingers saying may i be worthy of your choice lady now i thought that the ceremonies were finished and was glad for i grew weary of assisting at this farce but the old priest zibalbays fosterbrother rose and said one thing more must be done brethren before we leave this sanctuary and it is to swear in these strangers as members of the council they have wandered here from far and here with us they must live and die seeing that both of them know our secrets and one of them is predestined to become the father of that great lord for whose arising we have looked for many generations and therefore until the child is born he must be watched and guarded as priests watch a sacred fire ay it is well thought of let them be sworn and learn that to break the oath is death was the answer then mattai rose as keeper of the sanctuary and said you white man son of the sea and you ignatio the wanderer a lord of the heart do swear upon the holy symbol of the heart the oath to break which is to die horribly in this world and to be lost everlastingly in the worlds that are to be you swear setting in pledge your souls and bodies for the fulfilment of the oath that neither by word nor sign nor deed will you reveal aught of the mysteries or the councils of this brotherhood whereof you will be the faithful servants till your deaths holding it supreme above every power upon earth you swear that you will not possess yourselves of the treasures of the city of the heart nor without the consent of this high brotherhood attempt to leave its gates or to bring any stranger within its walls these things you swear with your hands upon the altar setting in pledge your souls and bodies for the fulfilment of the oath other clauses there were also which i have forgotten but this was the substance of the vow that was dictated to us we looked at each other helplessly and then there being no escape we swore kneeling before the altar with our hands resting upon it as the solemn words of confirmation passed our lips we heard a sound of the movement of heavy stones behind us arise now said the old priest turn brethren and look upon that which lies behind you we obeyed and the next instant shrank back against the altar in alarm for within six feet of us a massive stone in the floor had been lifted revealing the mouth of a well from the deep recesses of which came the distant sound of rushing waters behold brethren he went on and should the oath which you have sworn be broken in a single letter learn after what fashion you must suffer for your sins into that pit you shall be cast that the water may choke your breath and the demons of the underworld may prey upon your souls through all eternity have you seen and seeing do you understand we have seen and we understand we answered then let the mouth of the pit be sealed again and pray you in your hearts that it may never be opened to receive the living body of you or of any of us son of the sea and you ignatio the wanderer the oaths have been sworn and the ceremony is finished henceforth till your deaths you are of our number sharers in our rights and privileges and to you will be assigned houses attendants and revenues fitted to your station go forth brethren that you may refresh yourselves and prepare to meet the people upon the summit of the pyramid at dawn that is within an hour lead them away with you my lord mattai so we went leaving behind us the talisman of the broken heart for the priests refused to return it to me saying that at length the tokens named day and night had come together in their ancient place and henceforth there they must bide for ever accompanied by maya mattai and the escort of priests we passed through the halls and passages out into the courtyard of the temple and thence to apartments in the palace where we refreshed ourselves with food for we were weary the trick had succeeded the ordeal was past and for the present at least we were no longer in danger of our lives more the power of mattai was confirmed and his daughter was assured in her position as the wife of tikal and the seсor and the lady maya were about to attain to the fulness of their desire and to be declared one in the presence of the people yet never did i partake of a sadder meal or behold faces more oppressed by care and the fear of the future for though nothing was said in our hearts each of us knew that we had become parties to a crime and that sooner or later in this way or in that our evildoing would find us out putting this matter aside i myself had good reason to mourn seeing that whatever the others had gained i had won nothing moreover i found myself bound by a solemn oath not even to attempt to leave this city whither i had journeyed with such high hopes well the thing was done and it was useless to regret it or to think of the future so turning to mattai i asked him what was to happen on the pyramid there will be a great gathering of the people he answered as is customary at dawn after the night of the rising of waters and there they will be told all that has happened in the sanctuary and then if it is their will tikal will be confirmed as cacique according to the bargain and either today or tomorrow the white man here will become the husband of the lady maya in order he added with a sneer that of their union may be born the deliverer who is to be now if you are ready it is time for us to go for the multitude is gathered and an escort waits us without leaving the palace we placed ourselves in the centre of a party of nobles and guards who were in attendance and marched across the courtyard and up the steps of the pyramid the night was growing grey with the breaking of the dawn and in the pearly light through which the stars shone faintly we perceived that bands of priests and nobles wrapped in their broidered serapes for the morning air was chilly stood in their appointed places round the altar in front of them were ranged the dense masses of the people drawn here to make their prayers upon this feast day and also by desire to learn the truth as to the death of zibalbay the fate of the strangers who had accompanied him from the unknown lands the decision of the council as to the successor to the place and power of cacique and lastly whether or no the oracle of the god had spoken to his priests upon this or any other matter when the lost talisman was set in its place in the sanctuary on reaching the altar seats were given to us among the nobles of the heart those of maya and the seсor being placed in such fashion that they would be visible to the whole multitude then followed a silence till at length a priest who was stationed upon the roof of the watchhouse blew a silver trumpet and proclaimed that the dawn was broken whereon bands of singers who were in readiness began to chant a very beautiful hymn of which the refrain was caught up by the audience as they sang a beam from the rising sun struck upon the fire that burned above the altar and again the trumpet sounded then in the silence that followed the priest who stood by the fire clothed in white robes prayed in a loud voice saying o god our god let our sins die with the dying year o god our god strengthen us with thy strength comfort us with thy comfort during the day that is to be o god our god have pity upon us lift us from the darkness of the past and give us light in the coming time hear us heart of heaven hear us he ceased and from the surrounding gloom many voices made response saying hear us heart of heaven hear us then for a space the old priest stood still the firelight flickering on his tall form and rapt countenance as he gazed towards the east greyer and more grey grew the gloom till of a sudden a ray from the unrisen sun shot through the shadows like a spear and fell athwart the summit of the pyramid paling the holy fire that seemed to shrink before it at the coming of the sunbeam the multitude of worshippers men and women together rose from the marble pavement whereon they had been kneeling in prayer and casting off the dark cloaks which covered their white robes they turned extending their arms towards the east and cried with one accord hail to thee o sun bringer of all good things hail to thee newborn child of god now the light grew fast and soon the city appeared rising white and beautiful from its veil of mist and as the glory of the daylight fell upon it other priests who stood by the altar uttered prayers appointed to be offered upon this day of the beginning of the rising of waters to the people of the heart the occasion was a great one seeing that but little rain falls in their country and thus they depend for a bountiful harvest upon the inundation of the island and of the low shores that lay around the lake by its waters swollen with the melted snow of the great mountains on the mainland when the waters retreated then they planted their grain in rich land made fertile by the mud without labour to themselves whence before the lake rose again they gathered their corn and other crops when they had ended their praying and gifts of fresh flowers had been laid upon the altar by beautiful children chosen for that purpose tikal blessed the multitude as high priest and the simple ceremony came to an end then mattai rose to speak telling the people all things that had happened or so much of them as it was expedient that they should know he told them of the death of zibalbay of the setting of the lost talisman in the symbol and of the writing which was found therein which he read aloud to them amidst a dead silence then he told them how the lady maya and the white man had consented to be married in obedience to the voice of the oracle and lastly how she the lady maya had desired that her cousin tikal should continue to be cacique of the city of the heart that she might have more leisure to attend upon her heavensent husband and to be at rest until that child was become a man whose wisdom and power should make them even greater than their forefathers had been when he had finished his address there was much applause and other expressions of joy and a spokesman from among the people asked when the marriage of the white man son of the sea to the lady maya would take place this question she answered in person saying modestly that it was her lords will that it should take place that very night in the banquetinghall of the palace and that a great feast should be celebrated in honour of it after this the talking came to an end tikal having said no word good or bad beyond such as the duties of his office required and according to the custom of the country many people noble and simple came forward to congratulate her who was about to be made a bride weary of watching them and of hearing their pretty speeches i took advantage of the escort of a friendly noble and went to see the ceremony of the closing of the floodgate a huge block of marble that slid down a groove into a niche prepared to receive it where it was fastened with great bars of copper and sealed by certain officers although so i was told the rising water would not reach it for another eight or ten days even though the flood should prove to be a low one it was death to break those seals for a space of four full months and during all this time any who would leave the city must do so by means of ladders reaching from the wall to little wooden jetties where boats were moored afterwards we walked round the walls and through some of the main streets and i marvelled at the greatness of this halfdeserted place for the most of it was in ruins and at the many strange sights that i saw in it indeed i think that mexico in the time of montezuma my forefather was not more powerful or populous than this town must have been in the days of its prosperity about midday i returned to the apartments that had been assigned to me in the palace and hearing that the seсor was still in attendance upon the lady maya i ate my dinner alone with such appetite as i could find and lay down to sleep awhile i was awakened from my rest by the seсor who arrived looking merry as he used to be before ever molas came to lead us to the old indian doctor and his daughter and full of talk about the preparations for his wedding that night i listened to all he had to say and strove earnestly to fall into his mood but as i suppose without effect for in the end he fell into mine which was but a sad one and began to talk regretfully of the past and doubtfully of the future now i did my best to cheer him but with little avail for he shook his head and said indian as she is i love maya and no other woman has been or can be so much to me and yet i am afraid ignatio for this marriage is illomened and i pray that what was begun in trickery may not end in desolation also the future is black both for you and for me you came here from a certain purpose and will desire to leave again to follow your purpose nor although i take this lady to wife do i wish to spend my days in the city of the heart and yet it would seem that unless we can escape this is what we must do let us hope that we shall be able to escape i answered i doubt it he said for already i have discovered that though we be treated with all honour yet we shall be closely watched or at least i shall for certain reasons still come what may i trust that this marriage will make no breach in our friendship ignatio i do not know seсor i answered though i think that for weeks its shadow has laid between us and i fear lest that shadow should deepen also it has been fated that women and their loves should come between me my ambitions and my friends from the moment that my eyes fell upon the lady maya bound to the altar in the chapel of the hacienda i felt that her great beauty would bring trouble upon us and it would seem that my heart did not lie to me now under her guidance we have entered upon a dark and doubtful path whereof no man can see the end yes he answered but we took that path in order to save our lives she took it not to save her life on which i think she sets little store but to win a husband whom she desires for my part i hold that it would have been better for us to die if god so willed it than to live on with hearts fouled by deceit seeing that in the end die we must but no years of added life can wear away that stain well this must seem sad talk to the ears of a bridegroom forget it friend and rest awhile that you may do credit to the marriagefeast without answering the seсor lay down upon the bed where he remained whether sleeping or awake i do not know till the hour of sunset when he was aroused by the arrival of several lords and attendants who came to lead him to the bath on his return other messengers entered bearing magnificent robes and jewels the gift of the lady maya to be worn by him and by me at the ceremony then barbers having trimmed and scented his fair hair and beard according to the fashion of this people he was decked out like a victim for the sacrifice so soon as all was prepared the doors were flung wide and six officers of the palace came through them bearing wands of office in their hands accompanied by a troop of singinggirls chosen for their loveliness which to speak truth was not small in the midst of these officers and ladies the seсor was placed and followed by myself who walked behind with a heavy heart he set out for the banquetinghall as we reached it the doors were thrown open and the singers set up a love song pretty enough but so foolish that i have forgotten it we passed the threshold and found that the great hall was crowded with guests arrayed in their most brilliant attire whereon the lamplight shone bravely through this company we walked till we reached an open space at the far end of the hall around which in a semicircle sat the members of the council of the heart tikal and his wife being placed in the centre of them having mattai on their right and on their left that old priest dimas the fosterbrother of zibalbay who had administered the oath to us as we advanced with one exception all the council rose and bowed to the seсor that exception was tikal who stared straight before him and did not move scarcely had they resumed their seats when the sound of singing was heard again mingled with that of music and far away at the foot of the long hall appeared a band of musicians playing upon pipes of reeds clad in the royal livery of green and crowned with oakleaves after the musicians marched or rather danced a number of young girls robed in white only and carrying white lilies in their hands which they threw upon the floor to be trodden by the feet of the bride next came maya herself a sight of beauty such as stirred even my cold heart and caused me to think more gently of the seсor who had become party to a trick to win her she also was arrayed in white embroidered with gold and having the symbol of the heart blazoned on her breast about her waist and neck were a girdle and collar of priceless emeralds on her head was set a tiara of perfect pearls taken in past ages from the shellfish of the lake and round her wrists and ankles were bangles of dead gold her waving hair hung loose almost to her sandalled feet and in her hand as a token of her rank she bore a little golden sceptre having at one end a great pearl and at the other a heartshaped emerald on she came or rather floated her delicate head held high and so strange and beautiful was the aspect of her face that for my part from the instant that i beheld it till she stood before me by the bridegroom i seemed to see naught else it was very pale and somewhat set indeed at that moment maya looked more like a white woman than one of indian blood and her curved lips were parted as though they waited for some forgotten words to pass them her deepblue eyes also were set wide and beneath the shadow of their lashes seemed full of mystery and wonder like the eyes of one who walks in her sleep and beholds things invisible to the waking sight presently they fell upon the eyes of the seсor and of a sudden grew human while the red blood mantled on her breast and arms and brow then for me the spell was broken and i glanced at tikal and saw that on his face was that same look with which he had greeted maya when on the night of his own weddingfeast he beheld her whom he believed to be dead standing before him clothed in life and beauty eagerly despairingly he watched her and i noticed that tears stood in his angry eyes and that a gust of jealous rage shook him from head to foot when he saw her flush with joy at the sight of his white rival from tikal my glance travelled to the dark beauty at his side nahua his wife and became aware that in this instant she grew certain of what perhaps before she only guessed that in his heart her husband loathed her as with all his soul and strength he loved the affianced of his youth who stood before him the bride of another man doubt fear rage looked out in turn from her ominous eyes as the knowledge went home to be succeeded by a possessing misery the misery of one who knows that all which makes life good to her is for ever lost then pressing her hands to her heart for a moment she turned aside to hide her shame and wretchedness and when she looked up again her face was calm as the face of a statue but on it was frozen a mask of unchanging hate hate of the woman who had robbed her now the bridegroom and the bride stood together in the open space surrounded by the half circle of the council of the heart among whom i was given a seat while behind them were arranged the musicians and singinggirls and behind these again pressed the glittering audience of marriageguests when all were in their places a herald rose and cried out the names and titles of the pair reciting briefly that they were to be wed by the direct command of the guardian god of the city by the wish of the council of the heart and because of the love that they bore one another next reading from a written roll he published the text of the agreement whereby maya renounced her right as ruler in favour of her cousin tikal and i noticed that this agreement was received by the company in cold silence and with some few expressions of disapproval lastly from another roll he read the list of the honours prerogatives offices wealth houses and servants which were thereby assigned to the lady maya and her consort and also to myself their friend for the maintenance of their rank and dignity and of my comfort having finished his task he asked the seсor and maya whether they had heard all that he had read by command of the council and if so whether they approved thereof they bowed their heads in assent whereupon the herald turned and addressing tikal by all his titles called upon him in virtue of his priestly office and of his position as chief of the state to make these two one in the face of the people according to the ancient custom of the land tikal heard him and rose from his seat as though to commence the service then sank down again saying seek some other priest herald for this thing i will not do chapter xxii mattai prophesies evil at tikals words the company murmured in astonishment and mattai bending forward began to whisper in his ear tikal listened for a moment then turned upon him fiercely and said aloud so that all could hear him i tell you mattai that i will be no party to this iniquity has such a thing been heard of before that the lady of the heart the highest lady in the land should be given in marriage to a stranger who like some lost dog has wandered to our gate the prophecy began mattai the prophecy i put no faith in prophecies why should i obey a prophecy written how when or by whom i do not know this lady was my affianced bride and now i am asked to unite her to a nameless man who is not even of our blood or faith well i will not surely lord you blaspheme answered mattai growing wrath seeing that it is not for the high priest to speak against the oracle of the god also he added with meaning what can it be to you who are not ten days wed to the lady at your side that she to whom once you were affianced should choose another as her husband what is it to me said tikal furiously if you desire to know i will tell you it is everything how did i come to break my troth and to take your daughter as a wife through you mattai through you the liar and the false prophet did you not swear to me that maya was dead yonder in the wilderness and did you not to satisfy your own ambitions force me on to take your daughter to wife ay and is not this marriage between the lady of the heart and the white man a plot of yours devised for the furthering of your ends now while all stood astonished of a sudden nahua who hitherto had listened in stony silence rose and said the lord tikal my husband forgets that common courtesy should protect even an unwelcome wife from public insult then she turned and left the hall by the door which was behind her now a murmur of pity for the lady and indignation at the man ran through the company and as it died away tikal said evil will come of this nights work and in it i will have no hand do what you will and abide the issue and before any could speak in answer he also had left the hall followed by his guards for a while there was silence then men began to talk confusedly and some of the members of the brotherhood of the heart rising from their chairs took hurried counsel together at length they reseated themselves and holding up his hand to secure silence mattai spoke thus forgive me he said addressing the audience if my words seem few and rough but it is hard for me to be calm in face of the open insult which has been put upon my daughter and myself before you all i will not stoop to answer the charge that the lord tikal has brought against me in his rage surely some evil power must have afflicted him with madness that forgetting his honour as a man and his duty as a prince and priest he should dare to utter such calumnies against the god we worship the white man whom the god has chosen to be a husband to the lady maya and myself the keeper of the sanctuary there were many among you who held me foolish when after much prayer and thought to further what i believed to be the true interests of the whole people i gave my voice in favour of the lifting up of tikal to fill the place and honour of cacique in room of our late prince zibalbay whom we thought dead with his daughter in the wilderness today i see that they were right and that i was foolish indeed but enough of regrets and bitter talk that make ill music at a marriagefeast tikal the head of our hierarchy has gone but other priests are left nor is his will the will of the council or of the people of the heart for whom the council speaks their will it is that this marriage should go forward and dimas my brother as the oldest among us i call upon you to celebrate it now the company shouted in applause for they were set upon this strange union of a white man with their lady if only because it was a new thing and touched their imagination and even those of them who were of his party were wrath with tikal on account of his ill behaviour and the cruel affront that he had offered to his newmade wife so soon as the tumult had died away the old priest dimas rose and taking the hands of maya and the seсor he joined them and said a very touching and beautiful prayer over them blessing them and entreating the spirit heart of heaven and other gods to give them increase and to make them happy in a mutual love lastly he laid a white silken cloth which had been prepared upon their heads as they knelt before him and loosing the emerald girdle from about the waist of the bride he took her right hand and placed it upon the arm of the seсor then he bound the girdle round wrist and arm buckled it and in a few solemn words declared these twain to be man and wife in the face of heaven and earth till death undid them now the cloth was lifted and the girdle loosed and standing upon their feet the newwed pair kissed each other before the people a shout of joy went up that shook the panelled roof and one by one in order of their rank the guests pressed forward to wish happiness to the bride and bridegroom most of them bringing some costly and beautiful gift which they gave into the charge of the waitingladies last of all came the old priest dimas and said sweet bride the gift that i am commanded by the council to make to you though of little value in itself is yet one of the most precious to be found within the walls of this ancient city being nothing less than the holy symbol of the allseeing eye of the heart of heaven which through you men behold today for the first time for many generations wear it always lady and remember that though this jewel has no sight yet that eye whereof it is a token from hour to hour reads your most secret soul and purpose make your thoughts then as fair as is your body and let your breast harbour neither guile nor evil for of all these things in a day to come you must surely give account as he spoke he drew from the case that hid it nothing less than that awful eye which we had seen within the hollow of the heart when with unhallowed hands we robbed it substituting the false for the true now it had been set in a band of gold and hung to a golden chain which he placed about the neck of the bride so that the red and cruellooking gem lay gleaming on her naked breast maya bowed and muttered some words of thanks but i saw that her spirit failed her at the touch of the ominous thing for she turned faint and would have fallen had not her husband caught her by the arm while the seсor and his wife were receiving gifts and listening to pretty speeches a number of attendants had brought tables laden with every kind of food from behind the pillars where they had been prepared and at a signal the feast began it was long and joyous though joy seemed to have faded from the face of maya who sat neither eating nor drinking but from time to time lifting the red eye from her breast as though it scorched her skin at length she rose and accompanied by her husband walked bowing down the hall to the courtyard where bearers waited for them with carryingchairs in these they seated themselves and a procession having been formed very long and splendid though i will not stay to describe it we started to march round the great square to the sound of music and singing our path being lit by the light of the moon and with hundreds of torches here in this square were gathered all the population of the city of the heart men women and children to greet the bride each of them bearing flowers and a flaming torch and never have i seen any sight more beautiful than this of their welcome the circuit of the square being accomplished the procession halted at the palace gates and many hands were stretched out to help the bride and bridegroom from their litters it was at this moment that i who was standing near felt a man wrapped in a large feather cloak push past me and saw that he held something which gleamed like a knife by instinct as it were i cried beware my friend in spanish and in so piercing a voice that it caught the seсors ear he swung round for already he was standing on his feet and as he turned the man in the cloak rushed at him and stabbed with the knife but being warned the seсor was too quick for him springing to one side with the same movement he dealt his wouldbe murderer a great buffet that caused him to drop the dagger and sent him staggering into the dense shadow of the archway for some seconds no one seemed to understand what had happened and when they did and began to search for the man he was not to be found who he was or why he had attempted this cowardly deed was never discovered but for my part i have little doubt that either tikal himself or some creature of his was wrapped in the dark feather cloak and sought thus to rid him of his rival indeed as time went on this belief took firm hold of the mind of the people and was one of the causes that led to the sapping of tikals power and popularity very hastily the seсor assured the lords in attendance who crowded round him that he had received no manner of hurt and then after speaking a few brief words of thanks he withdrew into the palace with his wife and i saw him no more that night the day of this marriage was to me the beginning of the longest and most weary year that ever i have spent in a long and weary life very soon i understood how it came about that maya had learned to hate the city of the heart in which she was born its people and its ways and ardently to desire a new life in new lands here there was no change and little work here enervated by a cloying luxury the poor remnant of a great civilisation rotted slowly to its fall and none lifted a hand to save it since men must do something the priests and nobles plotted for place and power indeed and the common people listlessly followed this trade or that providing food and raiment for the community not for themselves but there was little heart in what they did and they took no pleasure in it basking in the eternal sunshine they loitered from the cradle to the grave hoping nothing suffering nothing fearing nothing content to feast amid their crumbling palaces and when they were weary to sleep till it was time to feast again satisfying their souls the while with the husks of a faith whereof they had lost the meaning such were the people of whom zibalbay hoped to fashion a race of conquerors still to this life they were born and it became them indeed they could have endured no other for the breath of hardship must have melted them away as my indian forefathers melted beneath the iron rule of the spaniard but to me it was a daily torment often i have beheld some wild creature pine and die in its prison though food was given to it in greater abundance than it could find in its native woods and like that wild creature was i in this soft city of the heart the wealth i came to seek was round me in abundance useless and unproductive as the dead hands that had stored it and yonder in mexico were men who by aid of that wealth might become free and great but alas i could not bring them together i could not even escape from my gaol for my every movement was watched yet i would have tried to do so had it not been for the seсor who when i spoke of it said i should be no true friend of his if i went and left him alone in this house of strangers indeed his plight was worse than mine for he too soon grew utterly weary of this dreadful city of eternal summer and of everything in it except his wife for whole hours we would sit gazing on the wide waters of the lake and make plan after plan whereby we might gain the mountains and freedom only to abandon each in turn for they were hopeless day and night he was watched since here alone this people forgot to be indolent they knew that their race was dying and lifting no hand to save themselves they preferred to pin their faith upon the prophecy which promised that from this white man should spring a saviour meanwhile false though it may have been the prophecy or one part of it was in the way of fulfilment which in itself was a wonder to this people among whom the births of children were so rare at length that child was born a son and the rejoicing knew no bounds strangely enough upon the same day nahua also gave birth to a son and great was her anger when she learned that it was not on her account or on that of her offspring that the people were so glad within a few days of the seсors marriage we heard that mattai had been seized with sickness a kind of palsy together with a leprous condition of the arms that baffled all skill for months he lay in his house growing gradually worse so said the physicians but one night i remember that it was three days previous to the birth of mayas child he appeared before maya the seсor and myself as we sat together in the palace looking out upon the moonlit garden at first we did not know him for never before had i seen a sight so dreadful his body was bloated one arm his left was swathed in bandages his head shook incessantly and the leprosy had seized his face which was of a livid hue do not shrink from me he began in a low and quavering voice as he gazed upon us with his whitening eyes surely you should not shrink seeing that all of you are partners in the crime that has made of me the loathsome thing i am ay deny it if you will but i know it the vengeance of the god has fallen upon me his false servant and it has fallen justly moreover be assured that on you also shall that vengeance fall for the eye has seen the mouth has told and the heart has thought upon your doom look upon me and learn how rich are the wages of him who works iniquity and by my sufferings strive to count the measure of your own perchance your cup is not yet full perchance you have still greater sins to work but vengeance shall come i tell you that vengeance shall come here and hereafter i did this thing for my daughters sake yes for love of her my only child she was ambitious and she desired this man and i thought to assure greatness to her and to her children after her but see how her wine has been turned to vinegar and her pleasant fruits to ashes her husband hates her with an evergrowing hate now they scarcely speak or speak only to shower bitter words upon each others head more not for long will tikal be cacique of the city of the heart for his jealous rage has soured all his mind his deeds are deeds of oppression and injustice already he is detested by the people and even those who loved him turn from him and plot against him do you know what they plot they plot to make that child that shall be born of you maya cacique in his room and to set up you and your outland husband as regents till it shall be of an age to govern oh you have planned cunningly and things look well for you but i say that they shall not prosper the curse is on you ignatio lord of the heart for all your highbuilt hopes shall fall like a rotted roof and never shall the eagles of that empire you have dreamed of be broidered on your banners slaves are the people you have toiled for and slaves they shall remain for by the crime to which you gave consent ignatio you have riveted their fetters the curse is on your child maya never shall it live to become a man the curse is on your husband his hair shall not grow grey but heaviest of all does the curse rest upon you false lady of the heart you whose life is one long lie you who forsook your faith and broke your oath you who turned you from your people and from the law of your high and ancient house that you might win a wandering white man to your arms woman we shall meet no more but in the hour of your last misery and in the long long ages of the eternal punishment remember the words that i speak to you today and shaking his withered arm in our faces mattai turned and limped from the chamber he went and we sat gazing at each other in horror for though we none of us had any faith in the god he worshipped in our hearts we felt that this man spoke truth and that evil would overtake us for a moment maya hid her face in her hands and wept then she sprang up and a fire in her eyes had dried her tears so let it be she cried i care nothing at the least i won you my love and for some months through all our troubles i have been happy at your side and come good come ill nothing can rob me of my memories but for you i fear husband i fear for you then her passion past she flung herself into his arms and again began to weep in due course the child was born a beautiful boy almost white in colour with his mothers starlike eyes and on this same night we learned that mattai had died in much torment and that nahua was delivered of a son eighteen days went by and maya newrisen from her bed was seated with her husband and myself while behind us stood a waitinglady holding the sleeping infant in her arms when it was announced to us that an embassy of the great lords of the council sought speech with her presently they entered and the spokesman the lord dimas bowed before her and set out his mission saying we have come to you lady of the heart on behalf of the council and of the people to rejoice with you in your great happiness and to lay certain matters of the state before you for some months the people have grown weary of the oppressions and cruelties of tikal who in defiance of the laws of the land has put many to death on suspicion of their being concerned in plots against his power further but yesterday it came to the ears of the council through the confession of one whom he had employed to execute his wickedness that a plan was laid to murder your husband your child and the lord ignatio here indeed said maya and why was my name omitted from this list lady we do not know he answered but it seems that the assassins had orders to take you living and to hide you away in a secret part of tikals house now the seсor sprang to his feet and swore a great oath to be avenged upon tikal nay lord said dimas his person is holy and must not be touched nor need you have any further fear of him for those whom he corrupted await their trial and he himself is watched day and night also not for long will tikal remain cacique of the city of the heart for the council have met in a secret session to which you were not summoned and have decreed that he shall be deposed because of his iniquities and in accordance with the desire of the people can a cacique be deposed asked maya yes lady if he has broken the law for was not your father to be deposed for this same reason also tikal holds his place not by right of birth but by treaty you are the true heir to zibalbay lady of the heart it may be so she answered coldly but i have renounced my claim and i do not desire to go back upon my word if you have renounced it said dimas there is one to whom it passes and he pointed to the sleeping infant yonder is the child of prophecy hope of the people and he it is whom we purpose to crown as our ruler setting you and your husband up to act for him till he reaches his full age nay said maya for thus shall he become the mark of tikals rage and be put to death openly or in secret as it may chance not so lady for in that hour when he is proclaimed tikal will be taken into safe keeping where he shall abide for so long as his life lasts and when is this to be asked the seсor tomorrow at noon upon the pyramid that the child may be solemnly anointed three days hence in the sanctuary on the night of the rising of waters it is foolish to crown a babe and neither i nor my husband seek this greatness said maya if tikal is to be deposed because of his crimes let one of the great lords be set in his place until the child is old enough to rule although you and your husband are to command us in the future answered dimas sternly till then you must obey lady for the voice of the council is supreme and it carries out the will of its founder and invisible president the heart of heaven the council has determined that the heavensent child of whom you are the earthly parents must take his own as you will said maya with a sigh and presently they went that evening the seсor and i attended a feast at the house of one of the great nobles whence we returned somewhat late having dismissed those who had escorted us i walked with him as far as the door of his private chambers purposing to leave him there but he bade me enter for he wished to talk with me about the events of the day and this forthcoming ceremony of the anointing of the child accordingly i did so and passing through the first chamber we came to the second beyond which lay his sleepingrooms here we halted by the open window and i approached a lamp for i wished to smoke and had no light as i bent over it something caught my ear and i listened since it seemed to me that through the massive doors of the bedchamber i heard the sound of a womans voice crying for help instantly i flung them open and rushed thither by way of an anteroom calling to the seсor as i went i did not arrive too soon for in the bedchamber itself a strange sight met my eyes at the foot of the bed stood a cradle in which lay the child and near to it two women struggled one of these in whom i knew nahua the wife of tikal held a copper knife in her hand and the other maya gripped her round the body and arms from behind so that strive as she would she could not free herself to use it still of the two women nahua was the heavier and the more strong and though slowly she dragged the other closer to the cradle indeed as i reached the room she wrenched her right arm loose and raised it to strike at the infant with the knife but here the matter ended for at that moment i caught her round the waist and threw her back so that she fell heavily on the floor letting drop the knife in her effort to save herself she sprang to her feet and ran towards the door there to be met by the seсor who seized her and held her fast chapter xxiii our flight and how it ended how came this lady here maya and what does she seek the seсor asked i do not know how she came gasped his wife my waitingwomen were gone and i had begun to prepare myself for sleep when looking into yonder mirror i saw her behind me having in her hand a naked knife and searching the room with her eyes presently they fell upon the cradle and lifting the knife she took a step towards it then i turned and gripped her holding her as well as i was able but she was too strong for me and dragged me forward so that had it not been for ignatio here by now she would have made an end of our son is this true said the seсor to nahua it is true white man she answered why do you desire to kill one so innocent he asked again is it not natural that i should wish to destroy the child who is to supplant my child and to break the heart of the woman who has broken my heart nahua answered sullenly amongst many other things i have learned white man of that ceremony which is to take place tomorrow whereat my husband is to be deposed and my child dishonoured that they may make room for you and for your child you the whitewanderer and your son the heavenborn the foreordained what have we to do with these things o woman with the heart of a puma he asked if tikal is to be driven from his place it is because of his crimes and if you and yours are to be set in it white man without doubt it is because of your virtues and yet o blackhearted knave that you are i tell you that i know all the truth i know how you forged the writing setting the false for the true within the holy symbol of the heart i know also that my father helped you to the deed for although he is dead he wrote down that tale before he died and gave it to me together with the ancient prophecy that you dared to steal from the holy sanctuary yes i have the proofs and when needful i will show them i did not come here to do murder at least not upon the infant but the sight of it sleeping in its cradle overcame me and of a sudden i determined to wreak my wrongs upon it and upon its mother in this i have failed but when i denounce you to the council then i shall not fail then you will be known for what you are and die the death that you deserve it comes into my mind husband said maya coldly that if we would save our own lives we must rob this woman of hers such a doom she has richly earned nor will any blame us when they learn what was her errand here now when she heard these words nahua struggled in the seсors grasp and opened her mouth as though to scream be silent he said if you wish to keep your soul in you ignatio close those doors and give me yonder shawl i did so and with the shawl we bound nahuas arms behind her fastening it over her mouth so that she could make no sound then we took a leather girdle and strapped it about her knees so that she could not move but lay helpless on the floor glaring at us with her fierce eyes now let us take counsel i said yes answered the seсor let us take counsel for we need it one of two things we must do kill that woman or fly the city for if she leaves this place alive we are certainly doomed to death before the altar ay and the child also fly said maya how can we fly when i am still weak and the babe is so young and tender should we succeed in escaping from the city and across the lake certainly we must perish among the snows of the mountains or in the deserts beyond also we should be missed and overtaken then nahua must die said the seсor could we not swear her to silence if we released her i asked for i shrank from such a dreadful deed however just and necessary it might be swear her to silence said maya contemptuously as easily might you swear a snake not to use its fangs if one should chance to tread on it do you not understand that this woman hates me bitterly who she thinks has robbed her of her husbands love that she would gladly die herself if thereby she could bring about my death and that of those who are dear to me so soon as she could leave her bed of sickness she came here to taunt me with the doom she had prepared knowing that i was alone then she saw the child and so great was her desire for revenge that she could not even wait till the law should wreak it for her no the issue is plain if we cannot fly either she must die or we must is it not so ignatio it seems that it is so i answered sadly and yet the thing is awful it is awful but it must be done said the seсor and it falls on me to do it for the sake of my wife and child alas that i was ever born that i should live to stand face to face with such necessity could not another hand be found no for then we should confess ourselves as murderers give me a knife nay my hands will serve and this end will seem more natural for i can say that when i found her in the act of murder i seized her and killed her suddenly by my strength alone not meaning it in my wrath now he stepped to where nahua lay and knelt beside her and we two drew away sick at heart and hid our faces in our hands presently he was with us again is it done asked maya hoarsely no nor will be by me he answered in a fierce voice sooner would i choke the breath out of my own body than strangle this defenceless woman cruelhearted murderess though she is if she is to be killed some other man must do the deed then it will remain undone said maya and now since we have thus determined let us think of flight for the night draws on and in flight is our only hope what then is to be done with this woman i asked we cannot take her with us no but we can leave her here gagged and bound till they chance to find her answered the seсor hearken nahua we spare you and to do it go forth to our own deaths may your fierce heart learn a lesson of mercy from the deed farewell two hours had gone by and three figures wrapped in rough serapes such as the common people wore one of whom a woman carried an infant in her arms might have been seen cautiously descending the city wall by means of a wooden ladder that ran from its summit to a jetty built upon piers at the foot of it which was used as a mooringplace for boats during the months of inundation as was common at this season of the year the lake was already rising and floating in the shallow water at the end of the jetty lay a pleasureskiff which the seсor and i were accustomed to use for the purpose of fishing whenever we could escape for a few hours from our wearisome life in the city into this skiff we entered and having hoisted the sail set our course by the stars steering for that village whence a year before we had embarked for the city of the heart the wind being favourable to us our progress was rapid and by the first grey light of dawn we caught sight of the village not a mile away here however we did not dare to land for we should be seen and recognised therefore we beached our boat behind the shelter of some dwarf waterpalms three furlongs or more below the village and having hidden it as well as we were able set out at once towards the mountains passing round the back of the village without being seen for as yet folk were scarcely astir we began our dreadful journey for a while maya bore up well but as the heat of the day increased she showed signs of tiring which was little to be wondered at seeing that she carried in her arms a child not three weeks old at midday we halted that she might rest hiding ourselves beneath a tree by the banks of a brook and eating of such food as we had brought with us in the early afternoon we started on again and for the rest of that dreary day struggled forward as best we could the seсor and i carrying the infant alternately in addition to our other burdens at length the evening fell and we camped for the night if camping it can be called to sleep beneath the shadow of a cedartree without fire and with little food having no covering except our serapes towards morning the air grew cold for already we were at some height above the lake and the tender infant began to wail piteously a wail that wrung our hearts still we rose with the sun and went on our way for it seemed that there was nothing else to do throughout that day with everwearying footsteps we journeyed till at sunset we reached the snowline and saw before us the hunters resthouse where we had slept when first we entered the country of the heart let us go in said maya and find food and shelter for the night now our plan had been to avoid this house and gain the pass where we proposed to stay till daybreak and then to travel down the mountain slopes into the wilderness if we enter there maya we shall be trapped said the seсor our only safety lies in travelling through the pass before we are overtaken for it is against the law that any of your people should follow us into the wilderness if we do not enter my child will die in the cold she answered you were too tender to secure our safety by putting that wouldbe murderess to death have you then the heart husband to kill your own child now at these words i saw the seсors eyes fill with tears but he said only be it as you will by now indeed we understood all three of us that if we would save ourselves we must suffer the child to die and however great our necessity this we could not do so we went up to the house and entered and there by the fire sat that same man and his wife whom we had found in this room a year ago who are you he cried springing up pardon lady but in that garb i did not know you it is best that you should not know us said maya we are wanderers who have lost our way out hunting give us food as you are bound to do then the man and his wife who were kindly people made obeisance to us and set of the best they had before us we ate and after eating slept for we were very weary bidding the man watch and tell us if he saw any stranger approaching the house before dawn he woke us and we rose a little later he came into my room and told me that a large body of men were in sight of the house then i knew that it was finished and called the others now there are three things that we can do i said fly towards the pass defend this house or surrender ourselves there is no time to fly answered the seсor therefore it is my counsel that we fight it is your counsel that two men armed with bows for our firearms had been taken from us on the pyramid and we had never been able to recover them should engage with fifty well friend we can try it if you wish and perhaps it will be as good a way of meeting our deaths as any other this is folly broke in maya there is but one thing to do yield ourselves and trust to fortune if indeed fortune has any good in store for us only i wish that we had done it before we undertook this weary journey as she spoke by the light of the rising sun we saw a great number of men forming a circle round the house with them were several captains and lords and among these i recognised dimas and tikal let us put a bold face on it said maya so we opened the door walked out and came into the presence of tikal dimas and the other lords whom do you seek that you come with an armed force asked maya whom should i seek but your fair self cousin answered tikal and i saw that his eye was wild as though with drink if nahua my wife had her way she would have let you go for she desires to see the last of you but her will is not my will nor her desire my desire and as it chances we have come up with you in time maya turned from him with a scornful gesture and addressed herself to dimas saying tell us of what we are charged that you follow us as though we were evildoers lady the old priest answered gravely it would seem that you have earned this name you and your companions together listen two days since you were missing and the lady nahua was also missing search was made and at last your private apartments were broken open and there she was discovered bound and gagged from her we learned the secret of your flight and followed after you did she then tell you why we fled asked maya did she tell you that she crept to my chamber like a thief in the night and there was found in the act of doing murder on my child no lady she told us nothing of all this indeed her manner was strange for so soon as she was recovered somewhat she took back her words and said that she knew naught of you or of your plans and that if you had fled we should do well to let you go before worse things happened but knowing that for all this she had reasons easy to be guessed we followed and found you and now we arrest you to answer before the council for your great sins in that you have broken your solemn oaths by attempting to leave the land without the consent of the council and have added to your crimes by taking with you this child the heavensent deliverer on whom rest the hopes of our race if we have broken our oaths said maya we broke them to save our lives were we then to stop in the city till the knife of the assassin found us out on the very night of my marriage a murderer was set upon my husband and perhaps one stands there and she pointed to tikal who could tell us who he was and whence he came three days ago another murderer sought the life of our child and that murderer the wife of the lord tikal is it then a sin that we should take from the land one whose life is not safe within it all these matters you can lay before the council lady answered dimas and if nahua is what you say without a doubt she must suffer for her crime yet her evildoing cannot pay for yours for when you found yourself in danger you should have claimed protection from those who could give it and not have betaken yourselves to flight like thieves in terror of the watch come enter the litter that is prepared for you and let us be going as you will she said but one thing i pray of you let this man my cousin tikal the cacique be kept away from me for the sight of him is hateful to me seeing that not content with plotting to kill my husband and my child he puts me to shame continually by the offer of his love it shall be as you wish lady your husband and your friend can travel by your side and guards shall surround your litter to see that none molest you then we started of our journey back there is nothing to tell unless it be to say that after its own fashion it was even more wretched than that which we had just accomplished then indeed we were footsore hungry and racked with fears but at least the hope of freedom shone before us like a guidingstar whereas now although we travelled in comfort it was to find shame exposure and death awaiting us at last for my part indeed this thought did not move me very much seeing that hope had left me and without hope i no longer wished to live you my friend for whom i write this history may think my saying strange but had you stood where i stood that day you would not wonder at it even now i sometimes dream that i am back in the city of the heart and wake cold with fear as a man wakes from some haunted sleep true there i had place and power and luxury but oh sooner would i have earned my livelihood herding cattle in the wilderness than fret away my life within that golden cage what to me were their banquets and their empty pleasures or their petty strivings for rank and title to me who all my days had followed the star of my high aim that star which now was setting maya and the seсor had each other and their child to console them but i had nothing except such friendship as they chose to spare me the memory of my many failures the clinging bitterness of conscience the fear of vengeance to be wreaked and the hope of peace beyond the end therefore i an outworn and disappointed man was prepared to welcome the doom that awaited me but how would it be with the others who were still full of love and youth late that night we reached the city and were led not to the palace where we lived but towards the enclosure of the pyramid how is this asked maya of the captain of the guard our road lies yonder no lady he answered my orders are to take you up the stairway of the pyramid now maya pressed her face against the face of her child and sobbed for she knew that once more we must inhabit the darksome vault where her father had been taken to die they led us up the stair and down the narrow way till we stood in the lamplit hall and heard our prison gates clash behind us then they gave us food and left us alone never did i pass a more evil night for strive as i would to win it sleep fled from me and i tossed upon my couch wondering where my bed would be on the morrow after we had stood before the council in the sanctuary of the heart and nahua had borne witness against us i remembered that shaft before the altar and seemed to hear the murmur of the water in its depths well as i have said i did not fear to die for god is merciful to sinners but oh it was dreadful to meet this liars doom and to remember that it was i who brought the seсor here to share it as i mused thus even through the massive walls of the vault i heard a woman scream and springing from my bed i ran into the central hall where the lamps burned always here i met maya clad in her nightdress only and speeding down the hall her wide eyes filled with terror what has happened i said stopping her and as i spoke the seсor came up oh i have dreamed she gasped i have dreamed a fearful dream i dreamed that my father came to me and i cannot tell it the child the child and she broke down utterly and could say no more this place is full of evil memories and her strength is shattered said the seсor when we had calmed her somewhat come back wife and sleep sleep she answered i do not think that i shall ever sleep again and yet unless i sleep i shall go mad oh that vision truly the curse of mattai has taken hold of me some few hours later we met again in the great hall but maya said nothing of her dream nor did i ask her to tell it though i could see from her face that it was not forgotten we ate or made pretence to eat and sat for a while in silence till at length the gates opened and through them came dimas and some companion priests bidding these to stand back he advanced alone and greeted us kindly i am grieved he said that you should again be called upon to occupy this gloomy lodging but i had no choice in the matter since i am but the servant of the council and its commands were strict it was feared lest the infant might be spirited away were you left at liberty it will soon be spirited away indeed dimas said maya if it be kept here in the darkness already the child pines within a week he will be dead have no fear lady your imprisonment is not for long for this very night the night of the rising of waters you will all of you be put upon your trial before the council in the sanctuary and charged with the crime of attempting to escape the land is there no other charge asked maya none lady that i have heard of what other charge should there be and what will be the verdict of the council i cannot say lady but i know that none wish to deal harshly with you and if that charge which you bring against the lady nahua can be proved it will go in your favour the crime you have attempted is a great one both in our eyes and still more in the eyes of the people for now they talk day and night of this deliverer who has been born to them and they will not easily forgive those who strove to take him from them still i think that upon certain terms the anger of your judges may be appeased what terms asked maya now dimas hesitated and answered by the strict letter of the law if your offence is proved against you you are worthy of death every one unless you yourself are held inviolate because of your hereditary rank as lady of the heart but it may be that the council will not exact the extreme penalty it may be that it will satisfy itself with driving these strangers from our borders instead of driving them from the land of life yet one of them is my husband dimas true lady but the child is born i cannot be parted from my husband better that we should die together than that we should be parted if the people have no need of him neither have they any need of me let us bid them farewell and go free together i am weary of this land dimas for here murder dogs our steps and i am in terror of my life i desire nothing from my people save liberty to leave them but lady your people desire something from you they desire the child of these strangers they would be rid by death or otherwise and you though of this i am not sure they may allow to accompany them but with your child they will never part for he is their heavensent king the son of prophecy it comes to this then that if the council should exercise its prerogative of mercy as it will do if i and my party have sufficient weight at the best you must choose between the loss of your husband or of your son now the face of maya became drawn with pain so that she looked as though age had overtaken her then she answered go tell those that sent you dimas that these are the words of maya lady of the heart my child is dear to me for he is flesh of my flesh but my husband is yet dearer for he is both flesh of my flesh and soul of my soul therefore if i must choose between the two i choose him who is nearest for i may have another child but never another husband chapter xxiv nahua bears witness some hours passed and again the gates were opened and through them came tikal and a guard of five men the guard he left by the gates advancing alone to where we were seated at the far end of the hall what would you of us asked maya can you not leave me in peace even here in my dungeon i desire to speak with you alone maya then tikal i tell you now what i have told you before that i will not listen to your words alone if you have anything to say say it in the presence of my husband and my friend or go and leave it unsaid you speak roughly to one who comes here in the hope of saving the lives of all of you he answered still i will bear with you in this as i have borne with you in much else listen all your crimes are known to me for nahua my wife has revealed them to me i know how you and that dead rogue mattai on whom the curse of heaven has most justly fallen forged the prophecy and violated the sanctuary for i have held the proofs of it in my hand do you know that we did this to save our lives asked maya for if we had not done it mattai would have murdered us in order that by removing me he might assure his daughter in her place i do not know why you did it nor do i care seeing that nothing can lighten such a crime but i think that you did it in order that you might win yonder white man as a husband at the least the thing is done and vengeance waits you vengeance from which there is but one escape what escape asked maya quickly for when she learned that tikal knew everything all hope had faded from her heart as from ours maya two people live and two alone who know this tale nahua my wife and i myself till this morning there was but one for nahua only told me of it when she found that you had not escaped and this she has done that she may be rid of you whom she hates as her rival therefore it was that she would have held me back from pursuing you and therefore it is that she will appear before the council of the heart this night so that her evidence may ensure your instant death in the pit of waters but as it chances least of anything on the earth do i desire that my eyes should lose sight of you whom now as ever i love better than anything on the earth now the seсor grew white with rage and he broke in you will do well to keep such words to yourself tikal for of this be sure if you do not i will add to my crimes and you shall not leave this place alive no need to look at your guards what do i care for your guards who have but one life to lose speak thus again and before they reach you you shall be dead let him go on husband said maya what can a few insults more or less matter to us now continue most noble tikal but for your own sake restrain yourself and say nothing that a husband should not hear it is for this reason he went on taking no notice of the seсors anger that i have come here with a plan to save you all yes even this braggart white man who has robbed me of you if nahua and i are silent who will know of your crimes and if the evidence of them is destroyed before your eyes who is there that can prove them now i will be silent at a price i will even bring the true tablet of the prophecy and the roll of mattais confession and destroy them with fire before you you will be silent said maya but what of nahua will she be silent also now tikals dark face grew evil with some purpose of his own though whether it were of murder or of what i do not know leave nahua to me he said withdraw the charge you made against her of attempting to kill yonder child and free her thus of the need of appearing this night in the sanctuary and i swear to you that no word of her dreadful secret shall ever pass her lips then you will be tried upon one issue only that of having broken your oaths by flying the city a crime that is not beyond forgiveness you spoke of a price tikal tell us what is this price that we must pay the price is yourself maya nay hear me out and you white man keep silent if you will swear upon the heart to become my wife within six months from this day then i on my part will swear that the white man your husband who is not your husband for he won the consent of the council to his marriage by a trick shall be suffered to escape the land unharmed taking with him his friend and so much of our treasure and things needful for their journey as he may desire i will swear also and by this you may see how deep and honest is my love for you that your son shall not be dispossessed of the place and rank which he holds in the eyes of the people as a heavensent deliverer whose coming was foretold by prophecy my child shall give place to yours maya once before i held out the hand of peace to you but you refused it and tricked me and from that refusal has sprung the death of your father and many other sorrows do not refuse me again maya lest these sorrows should be increased and multiplied upon you and upon us all it is no strange or unnatural thing i ask of you that you should wed the man to whom for so many years you were affianced and take your place as the first lady in this city instead of giving yourself over with your accomplices to the most infamous of deaths yet it is most strange and unnatural tikal that a wife should be asked to part thus from her husband but stay it is for him to speak not me for he may be glad to buy safety at this cost first what do you say ignatio tell me though i fear your answer for it is easy to guess seeing that tikal offers all that you can desire freedom and treasure to enable you to execute your plans it is true lady i replied that he offers me these things though whether or no he is able to give them i cannot say and it is true also that i have no wife here whom i must leave and no prospect save that of a traitors death still lady i remember a certain promise that i made to you yonder in the wilderness when by your courage you saved your husbands life and i remember also that it was through me that he my friend came to visit this accursed city therefore i say let our fate be one fate those are very noble words friend she said such as could have come only from your noble heart now husband do you speak i have nothing to say maya replied the seсor with a little laugh except that i wonder why you waste time which we might spend happily together in listening to this fellows insults if you bid me to go to save you perhaps i might think about it but certainly i will not stir one pace from your side to save myself from any death it seems that i have got my answer said tikal may none of you regret it tonight when you come to look down into the pit of waters well time presses and i have much to do before we meet again and he turned to leave us now as he went despair took hold of maya for a moment she struggled with it and with herself then she cried come back tikal he came and stood before her in cold silence and she spoke addressing her husband in a slow voice you are overhasty my answer is not yet spoken husband tikal i accept your offer prevent nahua from giving testimony against us destroy the evidences she holds and set these men safe with all that they may desire on the further side of yonder mountain and within six months i will become your wife now the seсor and i stared at each other aghast are you mad he said or do you speak so in the hope of saving us would it be wonderful husband she answered if i should wish to save myself and my child that i have loved you and love you you know yet is there any love in the grave while i live at least i have my memories if i die even these may be taken from me go back husband go back wealthy to your own people and your old life and choose some other woman to be your companion do not forget me indeed but let me become as a dream to you seeing that for all our sakes this is the best to you also ignatio i say go our fellowship has brought you little luck may its severing be more fortunate and may you at last attain your ends tikal give me your hand and let us swear the oath he stepped towards her his eyes glowing with triumph but as their fingers touched she glanced sideways and upwards and saw the doubt and agony written on her husbands face with a little scream she sprang to him and threw herself into his arms saying forgive me i have tried my best but this is more than i can do oh weak and foolish that i am i cannot part from you no not even to save your life surely you did not think that i should have fulfilled this oath and given myself to him in marriage no no it is to death that i should have given myself when you were gone but i cannot part with you i cannot part with you though my selfishness is your doom i rejoice to hear it said the seсor listen you tikal if you are a man give me a sword and let us settle this matter face to face so shall one of us at least be rid of his doubts and troubles surely white man answered tikal you must be a fool as well as a rogue otherwise you would scarcely ask me to risk my life against yours which is already forfeit to the law farewell maya long have you fooled and tormented me tonight i will repay you all and he went it might be thought that after tikal was gone we should have spoken together of what had passed and of the dangers before us but this was not so i think we felt all of us that there was nothing more to be said it is useless to fight against fate and it is still more useless to be afraid of him seeing that whatever we do or leave undone he has his will of us at last so we sat and chatted on different things of our life at the mine at cumarvo of that night which we spent in the hacienda at santa cruz of the death of our brave companion molas and i know not what besides presently the child awoke and its parents occupied themselves with it finding resemblance to each other in its tiny features while i walked up and down the hall counting the lamps smoking and wondering where i should be by this time on the morrow at length the gates opened for now it was almost the middle of the night and there came through them dimas and a guard of priests the old man bowed before us and said that the time had come to lead us before the council in the sanctuary but that we were to have no fear seeing that from all that he had been able to learn our offence would be leniently dealt with maya asked what was to become of the infant which could not be left alone and he replied that she must bring it with her whereon she began to wrap it in a serape your care is needless said dimas there is a secret way to the sanctuary from this place by which i propose to lead you in order that the child our lord shall not be exposed to the raw cold of the night then he took a bunch of keys from his girdle and handing them to one who accompanied him a fellowpriest and a member of the council he commanded him to go forward with several of the escort to open the doors and light lamps in the passages that lay between us and the sanctuary the priest went and having waited awhile we followed him to find him standing by the marble wall which separated the passages from the sanctuary on seeing us approach he gave the signs which were answered from within next he opened the false door with a silver key leaving the key and the bunch to which it was attached fixed in the lock for dimas to take as he passed this however the old priest did not do for he thought that we should all return by this passage and as we stepped into the sanctuary he contented himself with closing the door without locking it now once more we stood within the dim and holy place there to take our trial for offences committed against the laws of the city of the heart there was a full gathering of the council and tikal its highpriest and president sat in his seat behind the altar but i noted with a thrill of hope that nahua his wife was not by his side nor was she to be found among the members of the council we took seats that had been prepared for us in the open space before the altar maya being placed in the centre and the seсor and myself on either side of her next the priest of the records rose and announced that the first business before the council was the trial of three of its members namely maya lady of the heart her husband the white man son of the sea and ignatio the wanderer a lord of the heart from beyond the mountains upon the charge of having broken their oaths which they took as members of the council having read this formal accusation the priest set out the case against us clearly but briefly on this very night of the festival of the rising of waters a year ago he began you strangers amongst other things swore upon the altar setting in pledge your souls and bodies for the fulfilment of the oath that without the consent of this high brotherhood you would not attempt to leave the gates of the city of the heart yet but the other day you were overtaken and seized in the act of flying across the mountains to the wilderness beyond nor is this all your crime for with you was that infant born of the white man and the lady of the heart the heavensent child of prophecy of whom you wickedly sought to rob us and the people say now how do you plead to these charges we plead guilty answered maya but we ask to be heard in our own defence listen lords since that night when we were married by your command my husband and i myself have been dogged by murder and yonder as highpriest of the heart and president of your councils he sits who would have murdered us i see among you this night some of those who waited on me upon the day of our escape having the lord dimas at the head of them what did they tell me that a plot had been discovered made by tikal my cousin to murder my husband my child and my friend ignatio the wanderer they told me also that tikal would be deposed because of this and his other crimes and that the infant in my arms would tonight be anointed cacique of the people of the heart is it not so dimas it is so lady he answered and learn that you are not the only ones who are on trial this night though your case is taken first that of tikal the highpriest and others will follow but till then in virtue of his rank and office he sits as president of our council now tikal sprang from his seat but dimas turned upon him and said sternly keep silent lord or speak only to fulfil the duties of your place your judging shall be just but know that there is no hope of escape for you till it is done seeing that your guards are disarmed and all the paths are watched tikal seated himself again and maya went on on that very night of the coming of the lord dimas when i was alone in my chamber the lady nahua the wife of tikal crept upon me and strove to murder this my child and she set out the story telling how the seсor and i hearing her cries for help had entered the chamber and seized and bound nahua then it was brethren that sudden terror took us and we fled seeking to escape a land where we could not live in safety from one hour to another this is our sin and we leave our punishment in your hands surely it was better that we should strive to save the child so that he might live to play his part whatever that may be than that he should be kept here to be butchered by those whom you have raised up to rule you when maya had finished her speech the seсor and i addressed the council in turn confirming all that she had said and submitting ourselves to the judgment of the brotherhood now we were commanded to fall back and took our stand beneath the mask of the nameless god while the council consulted together and there we awaited our doom presently we were brought forward again and tikal spoke to us saying that our sentence was postponed till the charge against nahua the daughter of mattai and against himself tikal the cacique and highpriest of the city of the heart had been considered adding in a slow and triumphant voice let nahua the daughter of mattai who waits without be brought into the presence of the heart we heard and gathered up our courage to meet the advancing fate for we knew that death was on us and that for us there was no more pity or escape the door was opened and nahua came through it dressed in the robes of her rank and wearing the green diadem that could be carried only by the wife or mother of the cacique what is your pleasure with me lords she said proudly after she had made her obeisance to the altar then the priest of the records rose and read the charge namely that she had attempted with her own hand to do murder upon the body of the infant child of maya lady of the heart and her husband the white man also that she had aided and abetted tikal her husband in various acts of cruelty and misgovernment that were alleged against him asking her what she pleaded in answer to the last charge not guilty she said let tikal defend his own sins to the first guilty i did attempt to put an end to yonder brat but maya discovered me and i was caught and bound surely brethren said dimas rising we need carry this matter no further we have heard the evidence of the lady maya and the others and now nahua confesses to her crime she confesses that she attempted to take the life of him whom she knew to be the sacred child the hope of the people of the heart and for such a sin it seems to me that there is but one punishment though it is terrible and she who must suffer it is a woman and of high rank stay broke in nahua you have not heard me out and i have the right to speak before i am condemned to die you charge me with having attempted to take the life of the sacred child the hope of the people of the heart and had i done this doubtless i should be worthy of your doom whereas in truth i am worthy of your praise lords of the heart this child whom you adore the heavensent child of prophecy whom tonight you would anoint as your cacique deposing tikal my husband and who as you believe shall be the star to light our race to greatness and to victory is a living lie a fraud and a bastard now a confusion broke out among the council and angry voices called to her to cease her blasphemies but she won silence and went on hear me out i pray you for even if i wished it i should not dare to speak thus at random but am prepared with proof of every word i utter you think that i would have killed this child to wring the heart of my rival maya and indeed i desire to wring it and that i would set my own son in his place and indeed i wish to set him there yet these were not my reasons for the deed lords of the council listen to a tale the strangest that ever you have heard and judge between me and tikal my husband and maya my rival and her friends mattai my father was known to you all seeing that at the time of his death and indeed since tikal was anointed cacique he stood next to him in place and power among the people of the heart holding those offices in the brotherhood which now are filled by dimas and among them that of keeper of the sanctuary yet lords mattai my father was no true man alas that i should have to say it seeing that it was more for my own sake that he sinned than for his own since he loved me and desired my welfare above everything on earth it was this love of his that ruined him making him false to his god to his oaths and to his country thus in the beginning he knew that since i was a child i had set my heart upon the lord tikal who was affianced to the lady maya also that i was ambitious and yearned to be great therefore it was that he deceived tikal pretending that it had been revealed to him by heaven that the lady maya and her father were dead in the wilderness therefore it was also that when he had persuaded him that she was lost to him forever he pressed it upon the lord tikal that he should marry me in place of maya his affianced who was dead promising him in return that he would bring it about that he should be anointed cacique of the people of the heart all these things and others he did though at that time i knew nothing of them and thought in my folly that tikal married me because he loved me and sought me as the companion of his life and power then zibalbay returned on the night of our marriagefeast and with him came maya and the strangers and from that hour my husband began to hate me because i was his wife in place of maya whom he loved more as i have learned since he went to zibalbay while he lay in prison and offered to resign his place as cacique in his favour for so long as he should live and no more to oppose his schemes if he would give him maya in marriage after i had been put away either by death or by divorce this zibalbay would have done and gladly but as it chanced maya here had her heart set upon the white man during their journeyings together through the wilderness and refused to be separated from him that she might be palmed off in marriage upon tikal yet he might have won his way for their case was desperate and the alternative was death had not mattai my father found a plan whereby they could be saved and i remain the wife of the cacique this was the plan lords that a prophecy should be set in the symbol of the heart yonder such as would deceive the council of the heart and bring it about that maya should be given in marriage to the white man whom she loved lords this was done at the dead of night they crept to the sanctuary and opening the heart they placed within it that tablet which you have seen the tablet that foreshadowed the birth of a deliverer the rest you know it is false cried many voices such sacrilege is not possible it is not false answered nahua and i will prove to you that the sacrilege was possible the heart was opened and the false prophecy forged by my father was placed within it where it was found by you on the night of the festival of the rising of waters this day a year ago but when the holy heart was opened behold it was not empty for in it lay another prophecy a true prophecy which was removed from it that the lie which has deceived you might be set in its place where then is that writing asked dimas here she answered drawing the tablet from her breast listen and she read the eye that has slept and is awakened sees the heart and purpose of the wicked i say that in the hour of the desolation of my city not all the waters of the holy lake shall wash away their sin take it lords and see for yourselves she continued laying the tablet on the altar now listen again and learn how it chanced that this relic came into my keeping after he had wrought this great sin the curse of the nameless god fell upon my father and as you know he was smitten with a sore disease then it came about that when he lay dying remorse took him and he wrote a certain paper which he caused to be witnessed and given to me together with this tablet in my hand i hold that paper lords hear it and judge for yourselves whether i have spoken truth or falsehood and she read aloud the confession of mattai that set out every detail of our plot and the manner of its execution now lords she added when the reading was finished and the signatures had been examined you will understand how it happened that in my rage at this tidings i strove to kill yonder infant who has been palmed off upon you as the seed of the god and i leave it to you to deal with those who planned the fraud chapter xxv farewell nahua ceased and sat down and so great was the astonishment or rather the awe of the council at the tale that she had told that for a while none of them spoke at length dimas rose and said maya lady of the heart and you strangers you have heard the awful charge that is brought against you what do you say in answer to it we say that it is true answered maya calmly we were forced to choose between the loss of our lives and the doing of this deed and we chose to live it was mattai who hatched the fraud and executed the forgery and now it seems that we must suffer for his sin as well as for our own one word more ignatio here did not enter into this plot willingly but was forced into it by my husband and myself and chiefly by myself dimas made no answer but at a sign the two priests who guarded the altar with drawn swords came forward and drove us into the passage that led from the sanctuary to the hall of the dead where they shut us in between the double doors leaving us in darkness here as all was finished i knelt down to offer my last prayers to heaven while maya wept in her husbands arms taking farewell of him and of her child which wailed upon her breast truly he said you were wise wife when you urged us not to enter this country of the heart still what is done cannot be undone and having been happy together for a little space let us die together as bravely as we may hoping that still together we may awake presently in some new world of peace while he spoke the door was opened and the priests with drawn swords led us back into the sanctuary as maya crossed the threshold first of the three of us she was met by tikal who with a sudden movement but without roughness took the child from her arms now we saw what was prepared for us for the stone in front of the altar had been lifted and at our feet yawned the black shaft from which ascended the sound of waters they placed us with our backs resting against the altar but tikal stood in front and between him and us lay the mouth of the pit maya daughter of zibalbay the cacique lady of the heart white man son of the sea ignatio the wanderer and mattai the priest whom being dead in the body we summon in the spirit began dimas in a cold and terrible voice you by your own confession are proved guilty of the greatest crimes that can be dreamed of in the wicked brain of man and executed by his impious hands you have broken your solemn oaths taken in the presence of heaven and your brethren you have offered insult to the god we worship and violated his sanctuary and you have palmed off as their godsent prince upon the people who trusted you a bastard and a child of sin for all these and other crimes which you have committed why we know not it is not in our power to mete out to you a just reward that must be measured to you elsewhere when you have passed our judgmentseat and your names are long forgotten upon the earth this is the sentence of the council of the heart that your name mattai be erased from the list of the officers of the heart that your memory be proclaimed accursed that your dwellingplace be burned with fire and the site of it strewn with salt that your corpse be torn from its grave and laid upon the summit of the pyramid till the birds of the air devour it and that your soul be handed over to the tormentors of the lower world to deal with according to their pleasure for ever and for aye this is the sentence of the council of the heart upon you maya daughter of zibalbay the cacique lady of the heart white man son of the sea and ignatio the wanderer that your names be erased from the roll of the brethren of the heart and proclaimed accursed in the streets of the city that you be gagged bound hand and foot and chained living to the walls of the sanctuary and there left before the altar of the god which you have violated till death from thirst and hunger shall overtake you that your corpses be laid upon the pyramid as a prey to the birds of the air and that your souls be handed over to the tormentors of the underworld to deal with according to their pleasure for ever and for aye it is spoken let the sentence of the council be done but first since this bastard babe is too young to sin and suffer punishment let him be handed into the keeping of the god that the god may deal with him according to his pleasure as the words passed his lips and before we fully understood them dazed as we were with the horror of our awful doom tikal stepped forward and even now i shudder when i write of it holding the poor infant which at this instant began to wail again as though with pain or fear over the mouth of the pit suddenly he let it fall into the depths beneath the shriek of the agonized mother ran round the walls of the holy place and before it had died away the seсor had leaped forward leaped like a puma across the gulf of the open well and gripped tikal by the throat and waist he gripped him and rage giving him strength he lifted him high above his head and hurled him down the dreadful place whither the child had gone before with a hoarse scream tikal vanished and for a moment there was silence it was broken by the voice of maya crying aloud in accents of madness and despair not all the waters of the holy lake shall wash away our sin yet may they serve to avenge us upon you o you murderers of a helpless child as she spoke followed by the seсor and myself who i think alone of all the company guessed her dreadful purpose maya ran round the altar and with both her hands grasped the symbol of the heart which lay upon it forbear cried the voice of dimas but she did not heed him before he or any of us could reach her dragging at it with desperate strength she tore the ancient symbol from its bed and with a loud and mocking laugh had cast it down upon the marble floor where it shattered into fragments for one second all was still then from the altar there came a sudden twang as of harpstrings breaking that was followed instantly by another and more awful sound the sound of the roar of many waters fly fly cried a voice the floods are loosed and destruction is upon us and upon the people of the heart now the council rushed one and all towards the door of the sanctuary but i ignatio by the grace of heaven remembered the outer door the secret door through which we had entered that the priest had left ajar this way i cried in spanish to the seсor and seizing maya by the arm i dragged her with me into the passage when all three of us were through i turned to close the door and as i did so i saw an awful sight out of the mouth of the pit before the altar sprang a vast column of water which struck the roof of the sanctuary with such fearful force that already the massive marble blocks began to rain down upon the crowd of fugitives who struggled and in vain to open the door and escape into the hall of the dead one other thing i saw it was the corpse of tikal vomited from the depth into which the seсor had hurled him a shapeless mass ascending and descending with the column of water as alternately it struck and rebounded from the roof then before the flood could reach it i closed the door and possessing myself of the bunch of keys that still hung in the lock we fled up the passages and stairs till we came to the hall where we had been imprisoned here however we dared not stay for already strange gurgling sounds struck upon our ears and we felt the mighty fabric of the pyramid shake and quiver beneath the blows of the imprisoned waters as they burst their way upward and outward seizing lamps we ran to the copper gates at the head of the hall and not without trouble found the key that opened them we had no time to spare for as we left it the water rushed in at the further end of the chamber a solid wave that in some few seconds filled it to the depth of six or eight feet on we fled before the advancing flood and well was it for us that our course lay upwards for otherwise we must have been drowned as we searched for the keys to open the different gates and doors but now fortune which for so long had been our foe befriended us and the end of it was that we reached the summit of the pyramid just as the dawn began to break the dawn was breaking and seldom perhaps has the light of day revealed a more wonderful or terrible sight to the eyes of man outside the gates of the courtyard of the pyramid were gathered a great multitude of people waiting to be admitted to celebrate the feast that on this day of the year was to be held according to the custom upon the summit of the pyramid indeed they should have already been assembled there but it was the rule that the gates could not be opened until the council had left the sanctuary and this night the council sat late as we looked at them a cry of fear and wonder rose from the multitude and this was the cause of it along that street which ran from the landingplace to the great square rushed a vast foamtopped wall of water twenty feet or more in depth by a hundred broad now we learned the truth the symbol on the altar i know not how was connected with secret and subterranean sluicegates which for many generations had protected the city of the heart from flood when it was torn from its bed these sluicegates were opened and the waters rushing in sought their natural level which at this season of the year was higher than the housetops of the city on the summit of the pyramid were two priests who tended the sacred fire and made ready for the service to be celebrated seeing us emerge from the watchhouse they ran towards us wringing their hands and asking what dreadful thing had come to pass i replied that we did not know but that seeing the water gather in our prison we had fled from it how we had fled they never stopped to ask but ran down the stairway of the pyramid only to return again presently for before they reached its base their escape was cut off meanwhile the terror thickened and the doom began everywhere the waters spread and gathered replenished from the inexhaustible reservoir of the vast lake whole streets went down before them to vanish suddenly beneath their foaming face while from the crowd below rose one continuous shriek of agony maya heard it and casting herself face downward upon the surface of the pyramid that she might not see her handiwork she thrust her fingers into her ears to stop them while the seсor and i watched fascinated now the flood struck the people some thousands of them who were gathered on the rising ground at the gates of the enclosure of the temple and lo in an instant they were gone borne away as withered leaves are borne before a gale ere a man might count ten the most of the population of the city of the heart had perished for a little while some of the more massive houses stood only to vanish one by one in silence as it seemed for now the roar of the advancing waters mastered all other sounds before the sun was well up it was finished and of that ancient and beautiful city heart of the world there remained nothing to be seen except the tops of trees and the upper parts of the pyramids of worship rising above the level of the lake the golden city was no more it was gone and with it all its hoarded treasures its learning and its ancient faith and that which for many generations had been held to be a myth had now become a myth indeed one short hour had sufficed to sweep out of existence the ripe fruit of the labour of centuries and with it the dwindling remnant of the last pure race of indians who followed the customs and the creeds of my forefathers doubtless their day was done and the power above us had decreed their fall still so vast and sudden a ruin was a thing awful to behold or even to think upon what i wondered would the founders of this great city and the fashioners of its solemn pyramids and sanctuary have thought and felt could they have foreseen the manner of its end would they then have set the holy symbol so cunningly upon its altar that the strength of a maddened woman by tearing it away could bury altar temple town and all who lived therein for ever beneath the surface of the lake this they did to protect their homes and fanes against the foe so that if need were they could prefer destruction to dishonour but they did not foresee indeed they never dreamed that this foe might be of their own race and that the hand of one of her children would bring disaster utter and irredeemable upon the proud head of their holy stronghold the city heart of the world now foot by foot the waters found their level filling up the cup in which the town had stood and the bright sunlight shone upon their placid surface as they rippled round the sides of the pyramid and over the flat roofs of the submerged houses here and there floated a mass of wreckage and here and there a human corpse over which already the watereagles began to gather and that was all presently maya rose to her knees and looked out from beneath the hollow of her hand for the light was dazzling there upon the white summit of the pyramid then she flung her arms above her head and uttered and great and bitter cry behold my handiwork she said and the harvest of my sin oh my father that dream which you sent to haunt my sleep was dreadful but it did not touch the truth oh my father the people whom you would have saved are dead lost is the city that you loved and it is i who have destroyed them oh my father my father your curse has found me out indeed and i am accursed some such words as these she spoke then began to laugh and turning to the seсor she said where is the child husband he could not answer her but she took no note of it only she bent her arms rocking them and crooning as though the infant lay upon her breast then came first to him and next to me saying look is he not a pretty boy am i not happy to be the mother of such a boy i made pretence to look but the sight of her pitiful face and of the empty arms as she swayed them was so dreadful that i was forced to turn away to hide my tears now i saw the truth weariness sorrow and shock had turned her brain and she was mad we led her to the watchhouse where there was shelter and the priests who had returned gave us food so soon as we could make them understand that we needed it for they too were almost mad here her last illness seized the lady maya it began with a hardening of the breast which changed presently to fever two days and nights with breaking hearts we nursed her there upon the pyramid striving not to listen to her sick ravings and piteous talk about the child and at dawn upon the third day she died before she died her senses returned to her and she spoke to her husband beautiful and tender words which seem almost too holy to set down alas she ended as my heart foretold me i have brought you nothing but evil and now the time has come for me to go away from you ignatio was right and we were wrong or rather i was wrong we should have died together a year ago if that were needful sooner than commit the sin we worked in the sanctuary for then at least our hands would have been clean nor would the blood of the people have rested on my head yet believe me husband that when i did the deed of death i was mad for i had seen our child murdered before my eyes and i heard a voice within me bidding me to be avenged well it is done and i have suffered for it and perhaps shall suffer more yet i think that i was but the hand or the instrument of fate predestined to bring destruction upon a race already doomed and on a faith outworn that faith i no longer believe in for you have taught me another worship therefore i do not fear the vengeance of the god of my people may my other sins find forgiveness if they are sins for it was my love of you that led me to them husband i trust that you may escape from this illomened place and live on for many years in happiness but most of all i trust that in the land which you will reach at last you may find us waiting for you the child and i together farewell to you this is a sad parting and my life has been short and sorrowful yet i am glad to have lived it since it brought me to your arms and however little i may have deserved it i think that you loved me truly and will love my memory even when i am dead to you also ignatio farewell you have been a true friend to me though i brought you no good luck and at times i was jealous of you think kindly of me if you can though had it not been for me you might have attained your ends and as in the old days before we met comfort my husband with your friendship then once more she turned to the seсor and in a gasping and broken voice prayed of him not to forget her or her child i heard him answer that this she need not fear as his happiness died with her and even if he should escape he thought that they would not be parted for very long nor could any other woman take her place within his heart she blessed him and thanked him caressing his face with her dying hands and unable to bear more of such a sight i left them together an hour later the seсor came from the watchhouse and though he did not speak one glance at him was enough to tell me that all was over so died maya lady of the heart the last of the ancient royal blood of the indian princes myself alone excepted a very sweet and beautiful woman though at times headstrong passionate and capricious now while maya lay dying we learned that some indians still lived on the mainland men and women who had been sent there to tend the crops for we saw a canoe hovering round what once had been the island of the heart the two priests who were with us on the pyramid tried to signal to it to come to our rescue but either those in the boat did not see us or they were terrorstricken and feared to approach the pyramid still we kept the body all that day hoping that help might reach us so that we could take it ashore for burial towards night however when none came we made another plan on the roof of the watchhouse the sacred fire still burned for the two priests had tended it more from custom i think than for any other reason hither we brought some of the gilded stools that were used by the nobles of the heart on days of festival and all the fuel that had been stored to replenish the fire building the whole into a funeral pyre around and above the brazier then as it caught we carried out the body of maya wrapped in her white robes and laid it upon the pyre and left it presently the great pile was alight and burning so fiercely that it lit up the whole summit of the pyramid and the darkness which surrounded it all that night we watched it while the two priests lamented and beat their breasts after their fashion till at length it flared itself away and the holy fire that had burned for more than a thousand years died down and was extinguished it seemed very fitting that the latest office of this ancient and consecrated flame should be to consume the body of the last of the royal race who had tended it for so many generations towards dawn a wind sprang up with drizzling rain and when we approached the place at daybreak it was to find it cold and blackened no spark remained alight and no ash or fragment could be seen of her who was once the beautiful and gracious lady of the heart now we set ourselves sadly enough to find a means of escape to the mainland which indeed it was time to do for the waters working in its centre were sapping the foundations of the great pyramid portions of which had already fallen away our plan was to form a raft by lashing together some benches that were at hand and on it to float or paddle ourselves to the shore this however we were spared the pains of doing for when our task was half completed we saw a large canoe manned by three indians advancing towards us and signalled to them to paddle round to the steps of the pyramid they did so and taking with us all the food and such few articles of value as were to be found in the watchhouse the four of us embarked though not without difficulty for the current ran so strongly round the crumbling edges of the pyramid that it was hard to bring the canoe up to the stairs from the indians we learned that those on shore were so overwhelmed with horror at the catastrophe which had fallen upon their holy city that they did not dare to approach the place where it had stood but when on the previous night they saw the great flame of mayas funeral pyre they knew that men still lived upon the pyramid who as they thought were signalling to them for help and ventured out to save them they asked us how it came about that the waters had overwhelmed the city which had stood among them safely from the beginning of time we replied that we did not know and the priests with us now that they had escaped with their lives seemed too prostrated to tell our deliverers that we had been imprisoned in the hollow of the pyramid even if they knew that this was so on reaching the shore we found a little gathering of awestricken indians perhaps there may have been a hundred and fifty of them the sole survivors of the people of the heart unless indeed a few still lived on the high land of those portions of the island of the heart that as yet had not been submerged openmouthed and almost without comment they listened to the terrible tale of the sudden and utter destruction of their city when it was done one among them suggested that the white man should be killed as without doubt he had brought misfortune and the vengeance of heaven upon their race but this proposal seemed to find no favour with the rest of them indeed had they known the part which we played in the disaster i doubt if they would have found the spirit to make an end of us on the other hand they gave us what food and clothing we required and even weapons such as machetes bows and arrows and blowpipes and left us to go our way often i have wondered what became of them and if any of their number or of their children still survive so we turned our faces to the mountains and on the second day we crossed them safely for maya had told us the secret of the passage through the rocks which under her guidance we had passed blindfolded thus at length having looked our last upon the blue waters of the holy lake sparkling in the sunshine above the palaces of the city and the bones of its inhabitants did we leave that accursed country of the heart where so much loss and evil had befallen us envoi my friend now i ignatio have finished writing that story of how i came to visit the golden city of the indians which so many have believed to be fabulous and that today exists no more it is a strange story and i trust that it may interest you to read it when i am dead and buried perhaps you would like to know the details of our homeward journey but in truth i have neither the strength nor the patience to set them down it was a terrible journey and once we both of us fell ill with fever from which i thought that we should not recover but recover we did by the help of some wandering indians who nursed us and at length reached this place from which we had fled for our lives nearly two years before we found the hacienda deserted for it had the reputation of being haunted though some of the indian dependents or rather slaves of that great villain don pedro moreno still worked patches of the land well the seсor took a fancy to stay in the place for it was here that he had first seen his wife and so we sold that girdle of emeralds which maya took from the chest of ornaments and gave to me when we were imprisoned for the first time in the hall of the pyramid do not lose the clasp friend for it is the only remaining relic of the people of the heart and with the proceeds we bought at a cheap rate from the government of the day who had entered into possession of them this house and the wide lands round it that i have cultivated ever since for my friend now my ambitions were finished i had played my last card and it had failed me and albeit with a sorrowful mind i abandoned my hopes for the regeneration of the indians which i had no longer the means or the health and vigour to attempt also i was no more lord of the heart for with its counterpart it was lost in the sanctuary yonder beneath the waters of the holy lake and with the ancient symbol went much of my power for five years the seсor and i lived here together but i think that during all this time he was dying he who used to be so strong in body and merry in mind never regained his health or spirits from that hour when maya passed upon the pyramid and though he seldom spoke of her i know that night and day she was always present in his thoughts twice in the spring seasons he suffered from calenturas as we call the fever of the country which left him sallow in face and shrunken in body and when the spring came round for the third time i begged him to go to mexico for change returning to the hacienda in the summer in vain he would not do it indeed i do not think that he cared whether he lived or died so the end of it was that the calentura took him again and die he did in my arms happily as a child that falls asleep now my days are accomplished also and having failed in all things and known much sorrow and disappointment i go to join him my friend farewell perhaps you will think of me from time to time and though you are a heretic send up a prayer to heaven for the welfare of the soul of the old indian ignatio
