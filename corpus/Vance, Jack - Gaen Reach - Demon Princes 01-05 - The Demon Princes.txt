the star kins what a paradox what a fearful reproach when the dis tinction of a few hundred miles nay as many feet or even inches can transform heinous crime to simple unqualified circumstance hm balder bashin in the ecclesiarchic nuncia mento of year at foresse on the planet kroki nole law cannot reach where enforcement will not follow popular aphorism excerpts from smade of smades planet feature ar ticle in cosmopolis october q do you ever get lonesome mr smade a not with three wives and eleven children q whatever impelled you to settle here a rather dis mal world on the whole isnt it a beauty is in the eye of the beholder i dont care to run a vacation resort q what kind of people patronize the tavern a people who want quiet and a chance to rest oc casionally a traveler from inside the pale or an ex plorer q ive heard that some of your clientele is pretty rough in fact not to mince words its the gen eral belief that smades tavern is frequented by the demon princes the most notorious pirates and freebooters of the beyond a i suppose they occasionally need rest too q dont you have difficulty with these people main taining order so to speak a no they know my rules i say gentlemen please desist your differences are your own they are fu gitive the harmonious atmosphere of the tavern is mine and i intend it to be permanent q so then they desist a usually q and if not a i pitch them into the sea smade was a reticent man his origins and early life were known only to himself in the year he acquired a cargo of fine timber which for a whole set of obscure reasons he took to a small stony world in the middle beyond and there with the help of ten in dentured artisans and as many slaves he built smades tavern the site was a long narrow shelf of heath between the smade mountains and sinade ocean precisely on the planets equator he built to a plan as old as construction itself using stone for the walls timber beams and plates of schist for the roof completed the tav ern clung to the landscape as integral as an outcrop of rock a long twostoried structure with a high gable a double row of windows in front and rear chimneys at either end venting smoke from fires of fossil moss at the rear stood a group of cypress trees their shape and foliage completely appropriate to the landscape smade introduced other new features into the ecology in a sheltered valley behind the tavern he planted fodder and garden truck in another he kept a small herd of cattle and a flock of poul try all did moderately well but showed no disposition to overrun the planet smades dominion extended as far as he cared to claim there was no other habitation on the planet but he chose to assert con trol only over an area of perhaps three acres within the bounds of a whitewashed stone fence from occurrences beyond the fence smade held aloof unless he had reason to consider his own interests threatened a contingency which had never arisen smades planet was the single companion of smades star an the star king undistinguished white dwarf in a relatively empty region of space the native flora was sparse lichen moss primitive vines and pal odendron pelagic algae which tinctured the sea black the fauna was even simpler white worms in the seabottom muck a few ge latinous creatures which gathered and ingested the black algae in a ludicrously inept fashion an assortment of simple protozoa smades alterations of the planets ecology could hardly therefore be considered detrimental smade himself was tall broad and stout with bonewhite skin and jetblack hair his antecedents as has been mentioned were vague and he never had been heard to reminisce the tavern how ever was managed with the utmost decorum the three wives lived in harmony the children were handsome and wellmannered smade himself was unfailingly polite his rates were high but his hospitality was generous and he made no difficulties about collect ing his bill a sign hung above the bar eat and drink without stint he who can and does pay is a customer he who cannot and does not pay is a guest of the establishment smades patrons were diverse explorers locators jarnell tech nicians private agents in search of lost men or stolen treasure more rarely an ipcc representative or weasel in the argot of the beyond others were folk more dire and these were of as many sorts as there were crimes to be named making a virtue of neces sity smade presented the same face to all to smades tavern in the july of came kirth gersen representing himself as a locater his boat was the standard model leased by the estate houses within the oikumene a thirtyfoot cyl inder equipped with no more than bare necessities in the bow the monitorautopilot duplex a starfinder chronometer macroscope and manual controls midships the living quarters with air machine organic reconverter information bank and storage aft the energy block the jarnell intersplit and further storage the boat was as scarred and dented as any gersens personal disguise was no more than wellworn clothes and natural taciturnity smade accepted him on his own terms will you stay awhile mr gersen two or three days perhaps i have things to think over smade nodded in profound understanding were slack just now just you and the star king youll find all the quiet you need ill be pleased for that said gersen which was quite true his the demon princes justcompleted affairs had left him with a set of unresolved qualms he turned awav then halted and looked back as smades words penetrated his consciousness theres a star king here at the tav i he has presented himself so ive never seen a star king not that i know of smade nodded politely to indicate that the gossip had reached to the allowable limits of particularity he indicated the tavern clock our local time better set your watch supper at seven oclock just half an hour gersen climbed stone stairs to his room an austere cubicle con taining bed chair and table he looked through the window along the verge of heath between mountain and ocean two spacecraft occupied the landing field his own and another ship larger and heavier evidently the property of the star king gersen washed in a hall bathroom then returned to the down stairs hall where he dined on the produce of smades own gardens and herd two other guests made their appearance the first was the star king who strode to the far end of the room in a flutter of rich garments an individual with skin dyed jet black eyes like ebony cabochons as black as his skin he was taller than average height and carried himself with consummate arrogance lusterless as charcoal the skin dve blurred the contrast of bis features made his face a protean mask his garments were dramatically fanciful breeches of orange silk a loose scarlet robe with white sash a loose striped gray and black coif which hung rakishly down the right side of his head gersen inspected him with open curiosity this was the first star king he had observed as such though popular belief had hundreds moving incognito through the worlds of man cosmic mysteries since the first human visit to lambda grus the second of the guests apparently had just arrived a thin middleaged man of indefinite racial background gersen had seen many like him miscellaneous uncategorized vagabonds of the be yond he had short coarse white hair a sallow undyed skin an air of diffident uncertainty he ate without appetite looking back and forth between gersen and the star king in furtive speculation but it seemed as if presently his most searching glances were directed toward gersen gersen tried to avoid the increasingly insistent gaze the least of his desires was involvement in the affairs of a stranger the star king after dinner as gersen sat watching the play of lightning over the ocean the man sidled close wincing and grimacing in sheer nervousness he spoke in a voice which he tried to keep even but which trembled nevertheless i assume that you are here from brinktown from childhood gersen had concealed his emotions behind a careful if somewhat saturnine imperturbability but the mans question jangling upon his own alarms and tensions startled him he paused before replying gave a mild assent as a matter of fact i am i expected to see someone else but no matter ive decided that i cant fulfill my obligation your journey is pointless thats all he stood back teeth showing in a humorless grin obviously braced against an expected dire reaction gersen smiled politely shook his head you mistake me for someone else the other peered down in disbelief but you are here from brinktown what of that the man made a forlorn gesture no matter i expected but no matter after a moment he said i noticed your ship model b youre a locater then correct the man refused to be discouraged by gersens terseness youre on your way out or in out then deciding that it was as well to circumstantiace his role he added i cant say that ive had luck the other mans tension suddenly gave way his shoulders sagged i own to the same line of business as to luck he heaved a forlorn sigh and gersen smelled smades homedistilled whiskey if its bad no doubt i have myself to blame gersens suspicion was not completely lulled the mans voice was wellmodulated his accent educated in itself indicating noth ing he might be precisely as he represented himself a locater in some sort of trouble at brinktown or he might be otherwise a situation entailing a set of hairraising corollaries gersen would vastly have preferred the company of his own thoughts but it was an act of elementary precaution to look more deeply into the mat ter he drew a deep sigh and feeling faintly sorry for himself made a courteous if wry gesture the demon princes do you care to join me thank you the man seated himself gratefully and with a new air of bravado seemed to dismiss all of his worries and appre hensions my name is teehalt lugo teehalt will you drink without waiting for assent he signaled one of smades young daughters a girl of nine or ten wearing a modest white blouse and long black skirt ill use whiskey lass and serve this gentleman whatever he decides for himself teehalt appeared to derive strength either from the drink or from the prospect of conversation his voice became firmer his eyes clearer and brighter how long have you been out four or five months said gersen in his role oflocater ive seen nothing but rock and mud and sulfar i dont know whether its worth the toil teehalt smiled nodded slowly but still isnt there always excitement the star gleams and lights up its circlet of planets and you ask yourself will it be now and time after dme the smoke and ammonia the weird crystals the winds of monoxide the rains of acid but you go on and on and on perhaps in the region ahead the elements coalesce into nobler forms of course its the same slime and black trap and methane snow and then suddenly there it is utter beauty gersen sipped his whiskey without comment teehalt appar ently was a gentleman wellmannered and educated sadly come down in the world teehalt continued half talking to himself where the luck lies that i dont know im sure of nothing good luck looks to be bad luck disappointment seems happier than success but then bad luck i would never have recognized as good luck and called it bad luck still and who can confuse disappointment with success not i so its all one and life proceeds regardless gersen began to relax this sort of incoherence at once en gaging and suggestive of a deeper wisdom could not be imagined among his enemies unless they hired a madman gersen made a cautious contribution uncertainty hurts more than ignorance teehalt inspected him with respect as if the statement had been one of profound wisdom you cant believe that a man is the better for ignorance cases vary said gersen in as easy and light a manner as was natural to him its clear that uncertainty breeds indecision which the star king is a dead halt an ignorant man can act as for right or wrong each man to his own answer there never has been a true consen sus teehalt smiled sadly you espouse a very popular doctrine ethical pragmatism which always turns out to be the doctrine of selfinterest still i understand you where you speak of uncertainty for i am an uncertain man he shook his thin sharpfeatured head i know im in a bad way but why should i not ive had a peculiar experience he finished the whiskey leaned forward to gaze into gersens face you are perhaps more sensitive than first impression would suggest perhaps more agile and possibly younger than you seem i was born in teehalt made a sign which could mean anything searched ger sens face once more can you understand me if i say that i have known overmuch beauty i probably could understand said gersen if you made your self clear teehalt blinked thoughtfully i will try he considered as i have admitted to you i am a locater it is a poor trade with apologies to you for eventually it involves the degradation of beauty sometimes only to a small extent which is what a person such as myself hopes for sometimes there is only small beauty to corrupt and sometimes the beauty is incorruptible he made a gesture of his hand toward the ocean the tavern harms nothing the tavern allows the beauty of this terrible little planet to reveal itself he leaned forward licking his lips the name malagate is known to you attel malagate for a second time gersen was startled for a second time the reaction failed to reach his face after another slight pause he asked casually malagate the woe socalled yes malagate the woe you are acquainted with him and lugo teehalt peered at gersen through eyes which had suddenly gone leaden as if the mere act of naming the possibility had re newed his suspicion only by reputation said gersen with a bleak twitch of a smile teehalt leaned forward with great earnestness whatever you may have heard i assure you it is flattery but you dont know what i have heard the demon princes i doubt if you have heard the worst but nevertheless and the astounding paradox teehalt closed his eyes i am locating for attel malagate he owns my ship i have taken his money it is a difficult position when i found out what could i do teehalt threw up his hands in an excited extravagant gesture reflecting either emotional turmoil or the effects ofsmades whiskey i have asked myself this over and over i did not make this choice i had my ship and my money not from an estate house but from an institution of dignity i did not think of myself as a common locater i was lugo teehalt a man of parts who had been appointed to the post of chief ex plorer for the institution or some such folly so i assured myself but they sent me out in a b boat and i could no longer delude myself i was lugo teehalt common locater where is your boat asked gersen idly curious there is only my own and the star kings out on the landing field teehalt pursed his lips in another onset of wariness i have good reason for caution teehalt glanced right and left would it surprise you to learn that i expect to meet he hesitated thought better of what he had planned to say and sat silently a moment looking into his empty glass gersen signaled and young araminta smade brought whiskey on a white jade tray upon which she herself had painted a red and blue floral border but this is inconsequential said teehalt suddenly i bore you with my problems not at all said gersen quite truthfully the affairs of attel malagate interest me i can understand this said teehalt after another pause he is a peculiar combination of qualities from whom did you have your boat gersen asked ingenu ously teehalt shook his head i will not say for all i know you may be malagates man i hope not for your own sake why should i be malagates man circumstances suggest as much but circumstances only and in fact i know that you are not he would not send someone here whom i have not met you have a rendezvous then one i dont care to keep but i dont know what else to do return to the oikumene the star king ii what does malagate care tor that he comes and goes as he pleases why should he concern himself with you locators are twenty to the dozen i am unique said teehalt i am a locater who has found a prize too precious to sell gersen was impressed in spite of himself it is a world too beautiful for degradation said teehalt an innocent world full of light and air and color to give this world to malagate for his palaces and whirligigs and casinos it would be like giving a child to a squad of sarcoy soldiers worse possibly worse and malagate knows of this it is my unfortunate habit to drink rashly and talk wildly as you do now suggested gersen teehalt smiled his wincing morose smile you could tell mal agate nothing he does not already know the damage was done at brinktown tell me more of this world is it inhabited teehalt smiled again but made no answer ciersen felt no re sentment teehalt beckoning to araminta smade ordered fraze a heavy soursweet liquor reputed to include among its constituents a subtle hallucinizer gersen signified that he would drink no more night had long settled over the planet lightning crashed back and forth a sudden downpour began to drum on the roof teehalt lulled by the liquor perhaps seeing visions among the flames said you could never find this world i am resolved that it shall not be violated what of your contract teehalt made a contemptuous motion i would honor it for an ordinary world the information is on the monitor filament gersen pointed out the property of your sponsor teehalt was silent so long that gersen wondered if he were awake finally teehalt said i am afraid to die otherwise i would drop myself and boat and monitor and all into a star gersen had no comment to make i do not know what to do teehalts voice became soft as the drink soothed his brain and showed him visions this is a remarkable world beautiful yes i wonder if the beauty does not the demon princes conceal another quality which i cant fathom just as a womans beauty camouflages her more abstract virtues or vices in any event the world is beautiful and serene beyond words there are mountains washed by rain over the valleys float clouds as soft and bright as snow the sky is a deep dark sapphire blue the air is sweet and cool so fresh that it seems a lens there are flowers though not very many they grow in little clumps so that to find them is like coming on a treasure but there are many trees and most magnificent are the great kings with gray bark which seem to have lived forever you asked if the world were inhabited i am forced to answer yes though the creatures who live there are strange i call them dryads i saw only a few hundred and they seem a race ages old as old as the trees as old as the mountains teehalt shut his eyes the day is twice the length of ours the mornings are long and bright the noons are quiet the afternoons are golden like honey the dryads bathe in the river or stand in the dark forest tee halts voice dwindled he appeared to be half asleep gersen prompted him dryads teehalt stirred raised in his chair its as good a name as any theyre at least half plant i made no real examination i dared not why i dont know i was there oh i suppose two or three weeks this is what i saw teehalt landed the battered old b on a meadow beside a river he waited while the analyzer made environmental tests though a land scape so fair could not fail to be hospitable or so thought teehalt who was scholar poet wastrel in equal parts he was not wrong the atmosphere proved salubrious allergensensitive cultures tested negative microorganisms of air and soil quickly died upon contact with the standard antibiotic with which teehalt now dosed himself there seemed no reason why he should not immediately go forth upon this world and he did so on the turf in front of the ship teehalt stood entranced the air was clear and clean and fresh like the air of a spring dawn and utterly silent as if just after a bird call teehalt wandered up the valley stopping to admire a grove of trees he saw the dryads who stood gathered in the shade they were bipeds with a peculiarly human torso and head structure though it was clear that they resembled man in only the most su the star king perfcial style their skin was silver brown green in sheens and splotches the head showed no features other than purplishgreen bruises which seemed to be eye spots from the shoulders rose members like arms which branched into twigs and then leaves of dark and pale green burnished red bronzeorange golden ocher the dryads saw teehalt and moved forward with almost human interest then paused about fifty feet distant swaying on supple limbs the crests of colored leaves shimmering in the sunlight they examined teehalt and he examined them in a mutual absence of fear and teehalt thought them the most entrancing creatures of his experience he remembered the days which followed as idyllic utterly calm there was a majesty a clarity a transcendental quality to the planet which affected him with an almost religious awe and pres ently he came to understand that he must leave shortly or succumb psychically give himself completely to the world the knowledge afflicted him with an almost unbearable sadness for he knew that he would never return during this time he watched the dryads as they moved through the valley idly curious as to their nature and habits were they intelligent teehalt never answered that question to his own sat isfaction they were wise certainly he made this particular dis tinction their metabolism puzzled him and also the nature of their life cycle though gradually he acquired at least a glimmer of en lightenment he assumed to begin with that they derived a certain degree of energy from some sort of photosynthetic process then one morning as teehalt contemplated a group of dryads standing immobile in the marshy meadow a large winged hawklike creature swooped down buffeted one of the dryads to the side as it toppled teehalt glimpsed two white shafts or prongs extending from the supple gray legs into the ground the shafts at once re tracted when the dryad fell the hawk creature ignored the toppled dryad but scratched and tore at the marsh and unearthed an enor mous white grub teehalt watched with great interest the dryad apparently had located the grub in its subterranean burrow and had pierced it with a sort of proboscis presumably for the ingestion of sustenance teehalt felt a small pang of shame and disillusionment the dryads were evidently not quite as innocent and ethereal as he had thought them to be the hawk thing lumbered up from the pit croaked coughed the demon princes flapped away teehalt went curiously forward stared down at the mangled worm there was little to be seen but shreds of pallid flesh yellow ooze and a hard black ball the size of teehalts two fists as he stared down the dryads came slowly fonvard and teehalt withdrew from a distance he watched as they clustered about the torn worm and it seemed to teehalt that they mourned the man gled crearure but presently with their supple lower limbs they brought up the black pod and one of them carried it away high in its branches teehalt followed at a distance watched in fascinated wonder as close beside a grove of slender whitebranched trees the dryads buried the black pod in retrospect he wondered why he had attempted no commu nication with the dryads once or twice during the time of his stay he had toyed with the idea then let the thought drift away per haps because he felt himself an intruder a creature gross and un pleasant the dryads in their turn treated him with what might be courteous disinterest three days after the black pod had been buried teehalt had occasion to return to the grove and to his astonishment saw a pallid shoot rising from the ground above the pod at the tip pale green leaves already were unfolding into the sunlight teehalt stood back examined the grove with new interest had each of these trees grown from a pod originated in the body of a subterranean grub he examined the foliage limbs and bark and found nothing to suggest such an origin he looked across the valley to the great darkleaved giants surely the two varieties were similar the giants were majestic serene with trunks rising two or three hundred feet to the first branching the trees grown from the black pods were frail their foliage was a more tender green the limbs were more flexible and branched close to the ground but the species were clearly related leaf shape and structure were almost identical as was the general appearance of the bark supple yet roughtexture d though the bark of the giants was darker and coarser teehalts head swarmed with speculations later the same day he climbed the mountain across the valley and crossing the ridge came down upon a glen with precipitous rocky walls a stream rushed and splashed through mossy boulders and low fernlikc plants falling from pool to pool approaching the brink teehalt found himself on a level with the foliage ot the giant the star king trees which here grew close beside the cliff he noted dull green sacs like fruit growing among the leaves straining risking a fall teehalt was able to pluck one of these sacs he carried it down the mountainside and across the meadow toward the boat he passed a group of dryads who fixing their purplegreen eye bruises on the sac became rigid teehalt observed them with puz zlement now they approached their gorgeous fans quivering and shimmering in agitation teehalt felt embarrassed and guilty evi dently by plucking the sac he had offended the dryads why or how he could not fathom but he hastily sought the concealment of his ship where he cut the sac the husk was pithy and dry down the center ran a stalk from which depended white peasized seeds of great complexity teehalt inspected the seeds closely under a mag nifier they bore a remarkable resemblance to small underdevel oped beetles or wasps with tweezers and knife he opened one out on a sheet of paper noting wings thorax mandibles clearly an insect for a long while he sat contemplating the insects which grew on a tree a curious analogue so teehalt reflected to the sapling which sprouted from a pod taken from the body of a worm sunset colored the sky the distant parts of the valley grew in distinct dusk came and evening with the stars blurring large as lamps the long night passed at dawn when teehalt emerged from his boat he knew that the time of his departure was close at hand how why he had no answer the compulsion nevertheless was real he must leave and he knew he would never return as he considered the motherofpearl sky the curve and swell of the hills the groves and forests the gentle river his eyes went damp the world was too beautiful to leave far too beautiful to remain upon it worked on something deep inside him aroused a queer tumult which he could not understand there was a constant force from somewhere to run from the ship to discard his clothes his weapons to merge to envelope and become enveloped to immolate himself in an ecstasy of identification with beauty and grandeur today he must go if im here any longer thought teehalt ill be carrying leaves over my head with the dryads he wandered up the valley turning to watch the sun swell into the sky he climbed to the ridge of the hill looked east over a succession of rolling crests and valleys rising gradually to a single hie demon princes great mountain to west and south he caught the glimmer of water to the north spread green parkland with a crumble of gray boulders like the ruins of an ancient city returning into the valley teehalt passed below the giant trees looking up he noticed that all the pods had split and now hung limp and withered even as he watched he heard a drone of wings a hard heavy pellet struck his cheek where it clung and bit in shock and pain teehalt crushed the insect or wasp looking aloft he saw others a multitude darting and veering hastily he returned to the ship and dressed in a coverall of tough film his face and head were protected by transparent mesh he was unrea sonably angry the wasps attack had marred his last day in the valley and in fact had caused him the first pain of his stay it was too much to expect he reflected bitterly that paradise could exist without the serpent and he dropped a can of compressed insect repellent into his pouch though it might or might not be efficacious against these halfvegetable insects leaving the ship he marched up the valley with the insects bite paining him still approaching the forest he came upon a strange scene a group of dryads surrounded by a buzzing swarm of wasps teehalt approached curiously the dryads he saw were under attack but lacked any efficient means of defense as the wasps darted in to settle on the silver skin the dryads flapped their branches rubbed against each other scraped with their legs dis lodging the insects as best they could teehalt approached filled with horrified anger one of the dry ads near him seemed to weaken several of the insects gnawed through its skin drawing gouts of ichor the entire swarm suddenly condensed upon the unfortunate dryad which tottered and fell while the remaining dryads moved sedately away teehalt impelled to disgust and loathing stepped forward turned the can of repellent upon the nearly solid mass of wasps it acted with dramatic effectiveness the wasps turning white with ering dropping to the ground in a single minute the entire swarm was a scatter of small white husks the dryad under attack also lay dead having been almost instantly stripped of its flesh the dryads who had escaped were now returning and so teehalt thought in a state of anguish and even fury their branches quivered and flashed they marched down upon him with every indication of an tagonism teehalt took to his heels and returned to his ship the star kixg with binoculars he watched the dryads they stood about their dead comrade in a state of anxiety and irresolution apparently or at least it seemed so to teehalt their anguish was as much for the withered insects as the dead dryad they clustered over the fallen body teehalt could not observe exactly what they did but presently they arose with a glossy black ball he watched them carry it across the valley toward the grove of giant trees i have examined the native life forms of over two thousand planets i have noted many examples of convergent evolu tion but many more of divergence life volume ii by unspiek baron bodissey it is first of all essential that we understand exactly what we mean by the wellused term convergent evolution especially we must not confuse statistical probability with some transcendental and utterly compelling force consider the class of all possible objects the number of which is naturally very large infinite indeed unless we impose an upper and lower limit of mass and certain other physical qualifications thus imposing and so qualifying we find that still only an infinitesimal fraction of this class of objects can be considered life forms before we have even started the investigation we have exercised a very stringent selection of objects which by their very definition will show basic similarities to particularize there are a limited number of meth ods of locomotion if we find a quadruped on planet a and a quadruped likewise on planet b does this imply conver gent evolution no it merely implies evolution or perhaps no more than the fact that a fourlegged creature can ef fectively stand without toppling and walk without stum bling in my opinion therefore the expression convergent evolution is tautological ibid the star king from the wages of sin by stridenko article in cos mopous may brinktown what a city once the jumpingoff place the last outpost the portal into infinity now just another set tlement of the north east middle beyond but just an other is this a fair description decidedly not brinktown must be seen to be believed and even then the hard of belief depart incredulous the houses are set far apart along shaded avenues still they rise like watchtowers thrusting up into and through the palms virebols scalmettos and it is a mean house which does not soar above the treetops the ground level is no more than an entry a raised pavilion where the clothes must be changed for local habit ordains the use of paper house capes and paper slippers then above what an explosion of architectural conceits what tur rets and spires belfries and cupolas what elaborate magnificence what inspired scrimshaw what intricate in ventive farcical wonderful applications and misapplications of likely and unlikely materials where else can one find balustrades of tortoiseshell studded with goldplated fish heads where else do ivory nymphs hang suspended by their hair from the roof gutters their faces expressing only bland benediction wtiere else can a mans success be gauged by the sumptuousness of the tombstone he designs for himself and erects in his front yard complete with pan egyrical epitaph and in fact where but in brinktown is success such an ambiguous recommendation few indeed of the inhabitants dare show themselves within the oiku mene the magistrates are assassins the civil guard arson ists extortioners and rapists the elders of the council bordello owners but civic affairs proceed with a punctilio and gravity worthy of the grand sessions at borugstone or a coronation at the tower of london the brinktown jail is one of the most ingenious ever propounded by civic au thorities it must be remembered that brinktown occupies the surface of a volcanic butte overlooking a trackless jun gle of quagmire thorn eelvine skiver tussock a single road leads from city down to jungle the prisoner is merely locked out of the city escape is at his option he may flee the demon princes as far through the jungle as he sees fit the entire continent is at his disposal but no prisoner ever ventures far from the gate and when his presence is required it is only nec essary to unlock the gate and call his name teehalt sat looking into the fire gersen vastly touched won dered if he intended to say more at last teehalt spoke so i left the planet i could stay no longer to live there a person must either forget himself give way completely to the beauty drown his identity in it or else he must master it break it reduce it to a background for his own construc tions i could do neither so i can never go back but the mem ory of the place haunts me in spite of the wasps teehalt nodded somberly yes indeed i did wrong to inter fere there is a rhythm to the planet an equilibrium which i blun dered into and disturbed ive speculated for days but i still dont understand the process completely wasps are born as fruit of the tree the worms yield the seed to one kind of tree this much i know i suspect that the dryads produce the seed to the great giants the process of life becomes a great circle or perhaps a series of incarnations with the great trees as the end result the dryads seem to tap the worms for part of their sustenance the wasps devour the dryads where do the worms come from are the wasps their first phase flying larva so to speak do the worms eventually metamorphose into dryads i feel this must be the case though i dont know if so the cycle is beautiful in a fashion i cant find words to describe something ordained stately ancient like the tides or the rotation of the galaxy if the pattern were disturbed if one link were broken the whole process would collapse this would be a great crime so therefore you dont want to reveal the location of the world to your sponsor whom you believe to be malagate the woe i know to be malagate said teehalt stiffly how did you find out teehalt looked at him sidewise you are very interested in malagate gersen wondering if after all he were so transparent shrugged one hears many strange tales the star king true but i do not care to document them and do you know why no i have changed my thoughts about you now i suspect you of weaselry if i were a weasel said gersen smiling id hardly admit it the ipcc has few friends beyond i am unconcerned said teehalt but i hope for better days if when i return home i do not care to incur malagates ani mosity by identifying him to a weasel if i were a weasel said gersen you have already compro mised yourself you know of truth drugs and hypnotic rays yes i also know how to avoid them but no matter its not important you asked how i learned that malagate was my sponsor i have no objection to telling you this it was through my own drunken prolixity i put into brinktown in sinsans tavern i spoke at length much as i spoke to you tonight to a dozen en thralled listeners yes i held their attention teehalt laughed bit terly presently i was called to the telephone the man at the other end said his name was hildemar dasce do you know him no odd said teehalt since you are so interested in attel mal agate but in any event dasce spoke to me told me to report to smades he said id meet malagate here what demanded gersen unable to control the sharpness of his voice here here at smades i asked whats this to me i had no dealings with malagate and wished none he convinced me otherwise so im here i am not a brave man he made a small helpless gesture picked up his empty glass looked into it i dont know what to do if i remain beyond teehalt shrugged gersen considered a moment destroy the monitor filament teehalt shook his head regretfully its the surety i carry for my life indeed id rather he stopped short did you hear anything gersen jerked around in his chair no use denying his ner vousness at least not to himself rain thunder i thought i heard tubes blowing teehalt rose to his feet peered from the window someone is coming gersen also went to the window i see nothing i hi df pri cfs a ship dropped down into the field said teehalt he thought for a moment i here are or w ere only two ships there ours and the star kings where is your ship t set down in a valley to the north i want no one meddling with my monitor he seemed to listen then looking into gersens eyes he said you are not a locator no teehalt nodded locators are by and large a vile lot you are not of the ipcc think of me as an explorer will you help me the harsh precepts of gersens training contended with his impulses he muttered ungraciously within limits ver narrow limits teehalt smiled thinly what are these limits my own business is urgent i cant allow myself to be di verted feehalt was neither disappointed nor resentful he could expect no more from a stranger odd he said once more that you do not know hildemar dascc sometimes known as beauty dasce but he will come in presently liou ask how do i know bv the logic of plain ordinary tear youll he sate so long as you stay inside the tavern said ger sen shortly smade has his rules teehalt nodded politely acknowledging the discomfiture he had caused gersen a minute passed the star kmg rose to his feet his pink and red garment glowing in the firelight he walked slowly up the stairs looking neither to right nor left i eehalt followed him with his eves impressive creature i understand that only the handsome ones are allowed to leave their planet sol have heard teehatt sat looking into the tire gersen started to speak then restrained himself he felt exasperation with teehalt tor a clear and simple reason teehalt had aroused his sympathy eehalt had entered his mind i eehalt had burdened him with new troubles he also relt dissatisfaction with himself tor reasons by no means so simple in fact for no rational reason whatever beyond argu ment his own affairs were oi paramount importance he could not the sfar k g permit himself to be diverted if emotion and sentiment could sway him so easily where would such things stop the dissatisfaction far from being appeased grew more insis tent there was a connection too tenuous to be defined with the world teehalt had described a sense of loss and longing of some indefinable inadequacy gersen made a sudden angry motion swept all the irritating doubts and questions from his mind they could only decrease his effectiveness five minutes passed teehalt reached into his jacket brought forth an envelope here are photographs you might be pleased to inspect at your leisure gersen took them without comment the door slid back three dark shapes stood in the gap looking into the room smade roared from behind the bar come in or stay out must i warm the whole cursed planet into the hall stepped the strangest human being of gersens experience and there said teehalt with a sick titter you see beauty dasce dasce was about six feet tall his torso was a tube the same gauge from knee to shoulder his arms were thin and long ter minating in great bony wrists enormous hands his head was also tall and round with a ruff of red hair and a chin seeming almost to rest on the clavicle dasce had stained his neck and face bright red excepting only his cheeks which were balls of bright chalk blue like a pair of mildewed oranges at some stage of his career his nose had been cleft into a pair of cartilaginous prongs and his eyelids had been cut away to moisten his corneas he wore two nozzles connected to a tank of fluid which every few seconds dis charged a film of mist into his eyes there was also a pair of shut ters now raised which could be lowered to cover his eyes from the light and which were painted to represent staring white and blue eyes similar to dasces own the two men at his back by contrast appeared ordinary run ofthemill human beings both dark hard competentseeming with quick clever eyes dasce made a brusque signal to smade who stood impassively watching from behind the bar three rooms if you please we will eat presently very well the name is hildemar dasce the dkmon princes very well mr dasce dasce now sauntered across the room to where teehalt and gersen sat his glance shifted from one to the other since we are fellow travelers houseguests of mr smade let us introduce our selves he said politely my name is hildemar dasce may in quire yours i am kirth gersen i am keelen tannas dasces lips pale purplegray against the red of his skin moved in a smile to an amazing degree you resemble a certain lugo teehalt whom i expected to find here think of me as you like said teehalt in a reedy voice i have spoken my name but what a pity i have business to transact with lugo tee halt it is pointless then to approach me as you wish though i suspect that the business with lugo teehalt might interest keelen tannas will you step aside for a moments private conversation no i am not interested my friend knows my name it is kee len tannas your friend dasce turned his attention to gersen do you know this man well as well as i know anyone and his name is keelen tannas if this is the name he offers you i suggest that you accept it without further remark dasce turned away he and his men went to a table at the end of the hall where they ate teehalt spoke in a hollow voice he knows me well enough gersen felt a new spasm of irritation why should teehalt feel impelled to embroil a stranger in his troubles if his identity were already known teehalt explained his act in the next breath since i fight the hook he thinks he has me trapped and he amuses himself what of malagate i thought you had come here to meet him better that i return to alphanor and confront him there i will return his money but i will not lead him to the planet at the end of the hall dasce and his two companions were the star king served with platters from smades kitchen gersen watched them for a moment they seem unconcerned teehalt sniffed they think that i will deal with malagate but not with them i will try to escape dasce does not know that i landed over the hill perhaps he thinks that your ship is mine who are the other two men assassins they know me well enough from the tavern at brinktown tristano is an earthman he kills by touches of his hand the other is a sarkoy venefice he can brew stuff to kill from sand and water all three are madmen but dasce is the worst he knows every horror there is to be known at this moment dasce looked at his watch wiping his mouth with the back of his hand he rose crossed the room bent over teehalt in a husky whisper he said attel malagate waits you outside he will see you now teehalt stared at him with sagging jaw dasce swaggered back to his table teehalt rubbed his face with quivering fingers turned to ger sen i can still evade them if i can lose myself in the dark when i run out the door will you detain these three how do you suggest do this asked gersen sardonically teehalt was silent a moment i dont know nor do i with the best will in the world teehalt gave a sad nod very well then i will fend for myself goodbye mr gersen he rose to his feet walked to the bar dasce slanted his eyes at him but otherwise seemed uninterested beside the bar teehalt stood beyond the reach of his vision whereupon he darted into the kitchen out of sight smade looked after him with wonder then returned to business dasce and the two assassins stolidly continued their meal gersen watched covertly why did they sit with such uncon cern teehalts ruse had been pitifully obvious gersens skin began to prickle he drummed his fingers on the table in spite of his resolve he rose to his feet went to the doorway pushing open the timber panels he stepped out on the veranda the night was dark lit only by stars the wind for a wonder was still but the sea swirling and flowing sent up a muffled sad sound a short sharp scream a whimper from behind the tav ern gersen abandoned his resolve and started forward a grip like i he demon princes the pinch of steel seized his arm tweaked nerves at the back of his elbow another hand clamped at his neck gersen let himself fall broke the grip suddenly all his doubts and exasperations were gone he was a whole man he rolled over bounced to his feet stood m a half crouch shuffled slowly forward facing him with an easy smile stood tnstano the earthman careful friend said tnstano in the clipped flat earth accent give me trouble and smade pitches you into the sea dasce came out the door followed by the sarcoy poisoner tnstano omed them and the three walked to the spaceport gersen remained on the terrace breathing heavily crawling internally with his frustrated need for action ten minutes later two ships rose into the night the first was a squat armored vessel with weapons fore and aft the second was a battered old locators ship model b gersen stared in wonder the second ship was his own the ships disappeared the sky once more was empty gersen returned into the tavern and sat before the fire presently he brought forth the envelope given him by lugo teehalt opened it and extracted three photographs which he examined for the better part of an hour the fire burnt low smade took himself off to bed leaving a son dozing behind the bar outside the night rams began to thrash down lightning crackled the ocean groaned gersen sat m deep thought presently from his pocket he brought a sheet of paper which listed five names attel malagate howard alan treesong viole falushe kokor hekkus lens larque from his pocket he brought a pencil but still he deliberated if he continually added names to his list he would never finish of course there was no real need to write there was no real need for a list gersen knew the five names as well as he knew his own he com promised to the right and below the last name of the original list he appended a sixth hildemar dasce for a space he sat looking at the names with two sides to his mind the one so alive and the star king passionate that the other the cerebral detached observer felt a trace of amusement the flames settled low chunks of fossilized moss glowed scar let the sea sound was slower and lower m pitch gersen rose to his feet climbed the stone stairs to his room during his life gersen had known little other than a succession of strange beds nevertheless sleep came slowly and he lay staring into the dark visions passed before him from as early as he could remember first there was a landscape which as he recalled it was wonderfully pleasant and bright there were tawnv mountains a village painted in faded pastel colors along the banks of a wide tawny river but this picture as always was followed by another even more vivid the same landscape littered with hacked and bleeding bodies men and women and children shuffled into the holds of five long ships under the weapons of two score men in strange grim cos tumes with an old man who was his grandfather kirth gersen watched horrified from across the river concealed from the slavers by the bulk of an old barge when the ships had lifted they re turned across the river to the silence of death then his grandfather told him many fine things your father had planned for you learn ing and useful work and a life of satisfaction and peace do you recall this yes grandfather the learning you shall have you will learn patience and re source the ability of your hands and your mind you will have useful work the destruction of evil men wtiat work could be more usefup this is beyond you will find that your work is never done so therefore you may never know a life of peace however i guar antee you ample satisfaction for i will teach you to crave the blood of these men more than the flesh of woman the old man had been as good as his word eventually they made their way to earth the ultimate repository of every sort of knowledge young kirth learned many things from a succession of strange teachers which it would be tedious to detail he killed his first man at the age of fourteen a footpad who had the illluck to accost them in a back alley of rotterdam wtiile his grandfather stood by in the manner of an old fox teaching a cub to hunt young kirth the demon princes gasping and sobbing broke first the ankle then the neck of the astonished assailant from earth they moved to alphanor capitol planet of the rigel concourse and here kirth gersen gained more conventional knowledge when he was nineteen his grandfather died bequeath ing him a comfortable sum of money and a letter which read my dear kirth i have seldom told of my affection and high regard for you i take this occasion to do so you have come to mean more to me than ever did my own son i will not say i am sorry that i have set your feet in the path they now must take even though you will be denied many ordinary pleas ures and luxuries have i been presumptuous in so shaping your life i think not for several years you have been self motivated and have showed no inclination to point yourself in any other direction in any event can think of no more useful service for a man to perform than that which i have ordained for you the law of man is bounded by the limits of the oikumene good and evil however are ideas which encompass the universe unluckily beyond the pale there are few to ensure the triumph of good over evil actually the triumph consists of two processes first evil must be extinguished then good must be introduced to fill the gap it is impossible that a man should be equally effi cacious in both functions good and evil in spite of a tra ditional fallacy are not polarities nor mirror images nor is one merely the absence of the other in order to minimize confusion your work will be the destruction of evil men what is an evil man the man is evil who coerces obe dience to his private ends destroys beauty produces pain extinguishes life it must be remembered that killing evil men is not equivalent to expunging evil which is a rela tionship between a situation and an individual a poisonous spore will grow only in a nutrient soil in this case the nu trient soil is beyond and since no human effort can alter the beyond you must devote your efforts to destroying the poisonous spores which are evil men it is a task of which you will never see the end our sharpest and first motivation in this matter agreed the star king is no more than a primitive ache for revenge five pirate captains destroyed certain lives and enslaved others who were precious to us revenge is not an ignoble motive when it works to a productive end the names of these five pirate captains i do not know my best attempts have brought me no information one man an underling i rec ognized his name is parsifal pankarow and he is no less baneful than the five captains though his potentialities for harm are less you must seek him beyond and learn from him the names of the five then you must kill the five and it will do no harm if they suffer pain in the process for they have brought an immeasurable amount of pain and grief to others there is still much for you to learn i would advise you to join the institute except i fear that the disciplines of this body would not set well with you do as you think best in my youth i thought to become a catechumen but destiny ruled otherwise if i were friends with a fellow i would send you to him for counsel but i have no such friend perhaps you will be less constricted outside the institute stringent conditions are imposed upon the catechumen through the first fourteen degrees in any event i advise you to devote a time to the study of sarkoy poisons and hand techniques preferably on sar kovy itself there is room for improvement in your marks manship and knifeplay though you need fear few men at hand fighting your intuitive judgments are exact your self control economy of action and versatility are to be com mended but you still have much to learn for the next ten years study train and be cautious there are many other capable men do not rashly waste yourself against any such until you are more than ready in short do not make an overvirtue of courage or heroism a goodly amount of cau tion call it fear or even cowardice is a highly desirable adjunct for a man such as yourself whose one fault might be said to be a mystical almost superstitious faith in the success of your destiny do not be fooled we are all mortal as i now attest so my grandson i am dead i have trained you to know good from evil i feel only pride in my accomplishment hi dfmon prinos and hope that you will remember me with affection and respect your loving grandfather rolf marr gersen for eleven years kirth gersen obeyed the dictates of his grandfa ther or exceeded them meanwhile seeking both uthm the oiku mene and beyond for parsifal pankarow but fruitlessly few occupations offered more challenge more hazard more chilling rebuffs to incompetence than weaselmg for the ipcc ger sen undertook two assignments on pharode and blue planet dur ing the term of this latter he submitted a preemptive requisition for information regarding parsifal pankarow and felt himself well rewarded to learn that parsifal pankarow currently resided at brink town where he was ita bugloss operator of a prosperous import business gersen found ira bugloss or pankarow to be a burly hearty man eggbald his skin dyed lemonyellow his mustachios wide black and luxuriant bnnktown occupied a plateau which stood like an island in a blackandorange ungle gersen scrutinized pankarows move ments for two weeks and learned his routine which was that of a man without a care then one evening he hired a cab rendered the operator unconscious and waited outside the jodisei conversation and flower arranging club until pankarow tired of sporting with the inmates and emerged into the humid bnnktown night well pleased with himself humming a tune he had only ust learned he staggered into the cab and was conveyed not to his sumptuous home but to a remote clearing in the ungle here gersen put questions which pankarow had no wish to answer pankarow made an effort to hold his tongue to no avail finally five names were wrung from his memory now what will you do with me croaked the erstwhile ira bugloss i will kill you said gersen pale and quivering after exercise he did not enoy i have made you my enemy furthermore you deserve to die a hundred times over at one time ves cried the sweating pankarow now i lead a blameless life i mure no one gersen wondered it every such occasion would cause him such nausea misgivings and misery he responded in a voice held crisp the star ki g and even by enormous effort what you say perhaps is true but your wealth stinks of pain and certainly you will make a report to the first agent of any of the five you meet no i swear not and my wealth take it all where is your wealth pankarow tried to make conditions i will lead you to it gersen shook his head sadly accept my excuses you are about to die it comes to all men you had best feel that you are requiting the evil you have done under my tombstone screamed pankarow under the stone tombstone before my house gersen touched a tube to pankarows neck which spat a sarkoy poison into the skin i will go to look he said you will sleep until you see me again gersen spoke no more than the truth pankarow relaxed thankfully and was dead in seconds gersen returned to bnnktown a deceptively placid settlement of tall ornate three four and fivestory houses embowered among green purple and black trees at twilight he sauntered along a quiet back lane to pankarows house the stone tombstone stood plain to see a massive monument of marble spheres and cubes sur mounted by a sculptured image of parsifal pankarow in a noble pose head thrown back to the sky arms outspread as gersen stood appraising it a boy thirteen or fourteen years old stepped down from the porch and approached gersen are you from my father is he with the fat women gersen steeled his heart to the inevitable pangs and put aside all thought of confiscating pankarows wealth i bring a message from your father will you come m inquired the boy tremulously anxious ill call my mother no please dont i have no time listen carefully your father has been called away he is not sure when he can return perhaps never the boy listened roundeyed did he run away gersen nodded yes some old enemies found him and he does not dare show himself he said to tell you or your mother that money is hidden under the tombstone the boy stared at gersen who are you a messenger no more tell your mother exactly what i have told you one more thing when you look beneath the tombstone i hf df mon princfs be careful there may he a trap to guard the money do you un derstand what im saying yes a booby trap thats right be careful get the help of someone you can trust gersen departed bnnktown he thought of smades planet with its elemental quiet and isolation precisely the antidote to his fretful conscience where he asked himself as the locater boat skidded down a fracture in the continuum did the balance lie he had by no means reached the tipping point parsifal pankarow de served the callous execution he had received but what of wife and son they must bear the pain but why to protect the women and children of more deserving men from worse so gersen re assured himself but the haunted dark look of the boys eyes would not leave his memory destiny led him the first at smades tavern engaged him with malagate the woe the first name parsifal pankarow had blurted forth in his bed gersen heaved a deep sigh pankarow was dead poor miserable lugo teehalt was probably dead all men must die let there be an end to brooding he grinned into the dark thinking of malagate and beauty dasce examining the monitor of his ship to begin with they would be unable to open the monitor with their key a formidable difficult even worse if they suspected thief proofing of explosive poison gas or acid when after great travail they eventually extracted the filament it would show blank ger sens monitor was no more than window dressing he had never bothered to activate it malagate would look questiomngly at beauty dasce who would mutter some sort of objurgation perhaps then they would think to check the serial number of the ship only to find that it was different from that issued to lugo teehalt and then swiftly back to smades planet but gersen would be gone question put to eale maurmath chief quaestor of tnplanetary police system during a roundtable tele vision discussion broadcast from conover cuthbert vega may i know your problems are tremendous quaestor maurmath in fact i dont really comprehend how you get on top of them for instance how can you possibly locate some one particular man or trace his background among ninetyodd inhabited planets and billions of people of all varieties of political complexion local habit doctrines of belief answer usually we cant message of lord jaiko jaikoska chairman of the ex ecutive board to the valhalla general legislative as sembly valhalla tau gemini august i urge you not to endorse this sinister measure humanity many times has had sad experience ofsuperpow erful police forces as soon as slip out from under the firm thumb of a suspicious local tribune they become arbitrary merciless a law unto themselves they think no more of justice but only of establishing themselves as a privileged and envied elite they mistake the attitude of natural caution and uncertainty of the civilian population as admiration and respect and presently they start to swag ger back and forth inglmg their weapons in megalomaniac euphoria people thereupon become not masters but ser tiif dkmon princfs vants such a police force becomes merely an aggregate of uniformed criminals the more baneful in that their position is unchallenged and sanctioned by law the police mentality cannot regard a human being in terms other than as an item or object to be processed as expeditiously as possible public convenience or dignity means nothing police prerogatives assume the status of divine law submissiveness is de manded if a police officer kills a civilian it is a regrettable circumstance the officer was possibly overzealous if a ci vilian kills a police officer all hell breaks loose the police foam at the mouth all other business comes to a standstill until the perpetrator of this most dastardly act is found out inevitably when apprehended he is beaten or otherwise tortured for his intolerable presumption the police com plain that they cannot function efficiently that criminals escape them better a hundred unchecked criminals than the despotism of one unbridled police force again i warn you do not endorse this measure if you do i shall surely veto it excerpt from address of richard parnell commis sioner of public weal northern territory xion rigel concourse to the association of police officers civil guards and crime detection agencies at parilia pil gham rigel december it is not enough to say that our problems are unique they have become catastrophic we are held responsible for the efficient conduct of our jobs but are refused the necessary tools and powers to do man can mur der and rob anywhere within the oikumene jump into a waiting spaceship and he light years away before his crime is discovered if he passes beyond the pale our jurisdiction ends at least officially although all of us know of coura geous officers who have put justice ahead of expediency and caution and have gone beyond the pale to make their ar rests this of course they have a right to do since every human law becomes invalid bcvond but the risk is their own more often the criminal who goes beyond escapes scot free when he chooses to return into the oikumene he may the star king have changed his appearance his losi coordinates and his fingerprints and is safe unless he has the misfortune to be arrested for a new infraction in the community where he committed his original crime and was there genified essentially in this day of the jarnell intersplit any criminal who takes a few elementary precautions can go unpunished this association many times has sought to establish a more satisfactory basis for crime detection and prevention our main problem is the diversity of local police organi zations with their totally disparate standards goals and range of problems and the consequent chaos of information files and retrieval systems an obvious solution exists and the associations standing recommendation is the formation of a single official police system to maintain law and order throughout the oikumene the advantages of such a system are obvious standard ization of procedure use of new equipment and ideas uni fied control a central office for the filing indexing and crossindexing of information and perhaps of highest im portance the creation and maintenance of an esprit a pride of profession to attract and hold men and women of the highest abilities as we all know this centralized agency has been denied us no matter how urgently we plead its virtues the osten sible motive behind this refusal is known to us all and i will not dignify it by mentioning it i will say that police morale is sinking to an ever lower level and soon may van ish unless something is done today i wish to put before the convention a proposal for the something our association is the private organization of a group of private individuals it has no official status or connection with any governmental office whatever in short we are free to do what we please enter into any kind of busi ness we please so long as we contravene no laws i propose that this association go into business that we found a private crimedetection agency the new company will be strictly a commercial proposition financed by as the noun is geneclassification thence to adjective geneclassified abbreviated to seinfied the dfmon princes sociation money and by private subscription headquarters will be established at some central and convenient location but there will be branches on every planet our staff will le recruited from among members of this association and any other qualified persons they will be well paid from fees and profits where will these fees and profits derive primarily from local police organizations who will use cer tain of the facilities of this new interplanetary agency in stead of expending large sums to maintain redundant facilities of the same sort since the proposed agency will be a private business organization subject to all local and interplanetary laws the critics of our former schemes must be silenced eventually the intelworld police coordination company would automatically be called upon to handle all problems of crime detection and prevention other than those that are purely local and even here the ipcc may function usefully in due course the ipcc will certainly dwarf in scope all present and future official police groups we will have our own laboratories research programs ab solutely complete files and an absolutely highclass staff recruited as i say from members of the association and others are there any questions question from the floor is there any reason why police officers of a municipality or a state should not simultane ously be members of the ipcc staff ansuer this is a very important point no there is no reason i see no conflict between the two agencies and there is even reason to hope that local police officials will automatically wish to become affiliated with the ipcc this would be to the advantage of the ipcc the local po lice group and the individual himself in other words the local police officer would have nothing to lose and every thing to gain by referring cases to the ipcc and author izing the subsequent fee if he himself were a staff member from chapter iii the ipcc men and methods by raoul past nominally an intraoikumene organ the ipcc has been forced by the dynamics of its basic rationale to operate the star king beyond here where the only laws are local ordinances and taboos the ipcc finds little cooperation indeed the very opposite the ipcc operative is known as a weasel his life is constantly balanced on a knife edge the central agency shrouds in secrecy the exact number of weasels and also the percentage of casualties the first figure is suspected to be low through difficulties of recruitment the second high through both the exigencies of the work and the efforts of that most fantastic of human constructions the deweasel mg corps the universe is infinite worlds without end exist but certainly one must travel far to find a situation so par adoxical whimsical and grim as this that the single disci plined organization of the beyond exists only to extirpate the nominal forces of law and order gersen awoke in the strange bed the sky through the small square window only vaguely gray he dressed and xlescended the stone steps to the hall where he found one of smades sons a dour dark lad of twelve fanning the coals in the fireplace to life he bade gersen a gruff good morning but seemed indisposed for further conversation gersen stepped outside to the terrace predawn mist concealed the ocean rolling in sheets and curls across the heath a dreary monochromatic scene the sense of isolation was suddenly oppressive gersen returned inside went to warm himself at the new fire the boy was sweeping the hearth killing last night he told gersen in gloomy satisfaction little thin man got it right behind the moss shed is the body there gersen asked no no body they took it with them three bad ones maybe four father is black mad they did their dirt inside the fence gersen grunted displeased with every aspect of the situation he asked for breakfast which was presently forthcoming as he ate the dwarf sun lifted above the mountains a brittle white wafer barely visible through the mist an onshore wind came up the mist dissipated and when gersen once more went outside the sky was clear though fog wisps still blew in from the oily sea gersen walked north along the shelf between ocean cliffs and the demon princes mountains underfoot was a carpet of spongy gray moss redolent with a musty resinous odor the sunlight streamed over his head out to sea the black water giving back no glint or reflection pie went to the edge of the cliff looked down two hundred feet to the rise and fall of the water he tossed a stone watched the splash the ripples quickly absorbed in the larger motion what would it be like he wondered to sail a boat on this ocean out across the horizons with the whole world to explore barren coasts bleak headlands tall stern islands with no sight of human being or dwell ing until the return to smades tavern gersen turned away from the cliff continued north fie passed the mouth of a valley fenced in against smades cattle teehalt certainly had not left his boat here a quarter mile ahead a spur of the mountains humped down almost to the sea in the shadow of the ridge gersen found tee halts boat he made a quick inspection the vessel was indeed a model b identical to his own the gear and machinery seemed in good order in a housing under the bow bulge hung the monitor which had cost teehalt his life gersen returned to the tavern his original plan to spend sev eral days must be altered malagate might discover his mistake and return with hildemar dasce and the two assassins they would wish to take teehalts monitor and this gersen was resolved they should not do though he did not care to risk his life in the effort to keep it returning to the tavern he noted that the landing field was empty the star king had departed this morning or during the night gersen had no idea he settled his score and moved by some obscure impulse paid lugo teehalts bill smade made no com ment he was clearly consumed by cold fury his eyes showed white around the drab irises his nostrils were distended his chin jutted forward the rage was not on lugo teehalts behalf gersen re alized the murderer whoever he might be dasce had mentioned attel malagate had flouted smades law he had disturbed the se renity of smades tavern he had wronged smade gersen felt a twinge of sad amusement which he took pains to conceal politely he inquired when did the star king leave smade merely glared silently back at him like an angry black angus bull gersen gathered his small packet of belongings and departed the tavern declining the twelveyearold boys proffer of assistance the star king once more he walked north across the gray heath crossing the ridge he looked back toward the tavern staunch and secure it stood facing the black windwhipped sea utterly alone gersen shook his head dubiously and turned away everyone is the same he told himself anxious to arrive and when they leave wondering why they came a few minutes later he took teehalts boat aloft on its boosters then pointed it back toward the oikumene and cut in the oversplit smades planet dwindled astern and with its white dwarf sun pres ently became lost a single spark among a million stars slid by like fireflies blown on a dark wind the light reaching gersen by back splash or backcurl wherein the doppler effect played no role per spective was lost the eye was fooled stars moved astern the near slipping across the far within hand reach a hundred yards dis tant ten miles the eye had no tool by which to judge gersen set the star finder to the index of rigel engaged the autopilot made himself as comfortable as the spartan facilities of the model b permitted the visit to smades tavern had served him well though the occasion had been bought by lugo teehalts death malagate wanted lugo teehalts monitor this was the premise which con trolled the shape of the future malagate would be willing to enter negotiations and with equal certainty he would act through an agent although thought gersen he had seen fit to kill lugo tee halt at first hand there was something puzzling here why need lugo teehalt die sheer malice on the part of malagate not impossible but malagate had killed and ravaged so extensively that taking the life of one thin miserable man could provide him only paltry gratification more likely the motive was habit sheer offhanded casual habit to sever relations with a man who might be inconvenient you killed him a third possibility had teehalt penetrated the an onymity which malagate among all the demon princes held of supreme importance gersen reviewed his conversation with tee halt for all his ravaged and woebegone appearance teehalt had used educated intonations he had seen better days why had he turned to the disreputable profession of locating the question of course had no real answer why did a man set himself in any specific direction why and how did a man presumably born of ordinary parents become attel malagate the woe the demon princes teehalt had hinted or implied that malagate was somehow in volved in the leasing of the locater ship with this thought in mind gersen made a careful inspection of the ship he tound the tradi tional brass plate naming the place of manufacture liverstone on fiame a planet of the rigel concourse the monitor likewise car ried a bronze flake detailing its serial number and the manufacturer the feritse precision instruments company at sansontiana on olliphane also of the concourse but there was no indication of the owner no evidence of registration it would be necessary then to trace ownership of the boat indirectly gersen set himself to consider the problem estate houses maintained twothirds of all locater ships their stock in trade consisting of worlds with specific attributes planets highly mineralized planets suitable for colonization by dissident groups planets pleasant enough to serve as a millionaires reserve planets distinguished by a sufficiently interesting flora and fauna to attract curio dealers or biologists most rarely planets supporting intelli gent or semiintelligent life of interest to sociologists cultural tax onomists linguists and the like the estate houses were concentrated in the cosmopolitan cen ters of the oikumene three or four worlds of the concourse chief among them alphanor vegas cuthbert boniface aloysius noval pi cassiopetas copus and orpo quantique old earth the con course would be the logical starting place if in fact lugo teehalt worked for an estate house but this was by no means certain in fact as gersen seemed to recall teehalt had implied otherwise if so the investigation was narrowed considerably next to the estate houses universities and research institutes were the chief employers of locaters and gersen had a new thought if teehalt had been either a student or a faculty member at some specific lyceum col lege or university he would probably apply to this same institution for employment gersen corrected his thinking the conjecture was not neces sarily probable a proud man with friends and associates who might remember him would use his old school in this fashion only as a last resort was lugo teehalt proud not in this way or so it seemed to gersen teehalt had seemed a man who might easily turn to his old haven for security there was another obvious source of information the feritse precision instrument company at sansontiana where the monitor the star king would be registered in the name of its purchaser and another rea son for visiting the feritse precision instrument company gersen wanted to open the monitor and remove the filament to this end he needed a key monitors were often tamperproofed with explosive capsules or corrosives violent extraction of the filament seldom yielded useful information the officials of the feritse company might or might not prove accommodating sansontiana was a city of braichis one of olli phanes nineteen independent nations the braichish were a head strong involute altogether peculiar people concourse law however repudiated private claims beyond the pale and discour aged the use of explosive traps hence in an ordinance detailing the equipment required aboard spacecraft the manufacturers of such devices are thereupon enjoined and required to furnish keys switching devices code sticks number se quences or any other tool appliance or information necessary to the safe opening of the instrument in question

suspect that gersen might come to sansontiana with such a purpose in mind and take steps to preclude the contingency the thought opened a set of new vistas gersen frowned had his temperament been other than careful and orderly these various options and possibilities might not occur to him he would be saved a great deal of difficulty but he probably would die sooner he shook his head in resignation reached for the star charts not far off his line of fission was the star cygnus t and its planet euville where an unpleasant and psychotic population lived in five cities oni me che dun and ve each compulsively built in pentagonal patterns from a central fivesided citadel the spaceport on a remote island was opprobriously named orifice everything gersen needed could be found at the

the late renaissance explorers upon return to earth members of his crews imposed upon themselves or had imposed a strict rule of discretion and secrecy details nev ertheless leaked out sir julian hove was to use the most comprehensive term a martinet he was likewise a man utterly without humor his eye was bleak he spoke without moving his lips his hair was combed day after day in pho tographically identical furrows while he did not actually require that the personnel wear dinner jackets to meals certain of his rules imposed an almost equivalent punctilio the use of rirst names was eschewed salutes were ex changed at the beginning and termination of each watch even though the personnel was by and large civilian tech nicians whose specialties were without scientific pertinence were forbidden to set foot on the fascinating new worlds an order which came close to fomenting mutiny until sir julians second in command howard coke prevailed upon sir julian to ameliorate this regulation the rigel concourse is sir julians most noteworthy discovery twentysix magnificent planets most of them not only habitable but salubrious though only two display even quasiintelligent autochthones sir julian exercising his prerogatives named the planets for boyhood heroes lord kitchener william gladstone archbishop rollo gore edythe the demon princes macdevott rudyard kipling thomas carlyle william kirk cudbright samuel b gorsham sir robert peel and the like but sir julian was to be deprived of his privilege he telegraphed ahead the news of his return to maudley space station together with a description of the concourse and the names he had bestowed upon the members of this mag nificent group the list passed through the hands of an obscure young clerk one roger pilgham who rejected sir julians nominations in disgust to each of the twentysix planets he assigned a letter of the alphabet and hurriedly supplied new names alphanor barleycorn chrysanthe diogenes elfland flame goshen hardacres image jez ebel krokinole lyonnesse madagascar nowhere olli phane pilgham quinine raratonga somewhere tan tamount unicorn valisande walpurgis xion ys and zacaranda the names derived from legend myth ro mance his own whimsey one of the worlds was accom panied by a satellite described in the dispatch as an eccentric tumbling oddshaped fragment of chondritic pumice and this roger pilgham named sir julian the press received and published the list and rigels planets became so known though sir julians acquaintances wondered about the sudden extravagance of his imagina tion and who or what was pilgham sir julian presum ably would explain upon his arrival the clerk roger pilgham presently returns to the ob scurity from which he sprang and there is no record of his conduct or state of mind as sir julians return became im minent did he feel apprehension uneasiness indiffer ence beyond all doubt he had become resigned to the prospect of discharge from his position in due course sir julian made a triumphant return and in due course used the phrase most impressive perhaps are the new grampian mountains on the north continent of lord bulwerlytton a member of the audience po litely asked the whereabouts of lord bulwerlytton and the substitution was revealed sir julians reaction to the deed was one of extraordi nary fury the clerk prudently went into seclusion sirjul the star king ian was encouraged to reintroduce his own nominations but the damage had been done roger pilghams brash deed caught the fancy of the public and sir julians cfrmmology gradually faded from memory from popular handbook of the planets rd edition published alphanor a planet considered the administrative node and cultural center of the rigel concourse it is eighth in orbital order planetary constants diameter miles mass mean day hours minutes seconds etc general remarks alphanor is a large bright sea world with a generally bracing climate ocean occupies three quarters of the total surface including the polar ice floes the land mass is divided into seven nearly contiguous con tinents phrygia umbria lusitania scythia etruria lydia and lycia in a configuration suggesting seven petals of a bower there are uncounted islands autochthonous life is complex and vigorous the flora has in no way yielded to terrestrial imports which must be carefully tended and nurtured the fauna is likewise com plex and on occasion actively savage to cite the clever hyr can major of upper phrygia and the invisible eel of the thaumaturge ocean the political structure of alphanor is a pyramidal de mocracy simple in theory intricate in practice the con tinents are divided into provinces thence prefectures districts and wards these latter defined as population blocs of five thousand persons each ward committee sends a rep resentative to the district council which elects a delegate to the prefectural diet which sends a member to the pro vincial congress which does likewise for the continental parliament each parliament elects seven rectors to the the demon princes grand council at avente in the sea province of umbria which thereupon chooses a chairman from preface to peoples of the concourse by strick and chernitz the concourse populations are far from homogeneous during the migrations from earth racial groups tended to follow their own and in the new environments under the influence of interbreeding and new behavior patterns such groups specialized even further the folk of alphanor eneral are fair brownhaired of medium stature in though an hours walk along the grand esplanade at avente will show the observer every conceivable style of human being the alphanor psychology is more difficult to express every inhabited world is different in this regard and though the differences are real and distinct enough it is hard to present them accurately without discursiveness especially since each planetwide generalization is com pounded vitiated or contradicted by regional differences rigel dead ahead was a bright bluewhite point from which every other star seemed to flee gersen had little to do but contemplate his destination fight restlessness and tension speculate regarding attel malagates probable intentions and formulate his own set of responses the first problem where to land one hundred and eightythree spaceports on twentytwo of the twentysix worlds were convenient to his lawful use as well as unlimited desert and wasteland should he choose to risk arrest for violation of the quar antine laws how intensely did malagate want teehalts monitor would he arrange a watch at every spaceport theoretically this could be done by the suborning of port officials the cheapest and perhaps most effective system would be to offer a resounding reward to the man who reported gersens arrival gersen of course might choose to set down at another star system it would be difficult to mount guard over every space port of the oikumene but it was by no means gersens purpose to go into hiding in the next phase of proceedings he must necessarily expose himself the star king this next phase was the identification of malagate two methods to this end suggested themselves he could either trace the registry of the monitor or await the approach of some member of mala gates organization and then try to trace the nerve of authority back to its source malagate would take for granted gersens intent to investigate the monitor and would presumably concentrate his vigilance at the kindune spaceport which served sansontiana nevertheless for a series of indefinite reasons little more than hunches gersen decided to land at the grand interplanetary spaceport at avente he approached alphanor coasted down into landing orbit locked his autopilot into the official landing program and once more sat back the boat settled bumped in a roar of expiring jets upon the scorched red earth the jets died there was silence au tomatically the pressureequalizing valve began to hiss the portofficials approached in a slide car gersen answered questions submitted to a brief medical inspection received an entry permit the officials departed a mobile crane trundled up lifted the boat carried it to a bay in the storage line at one side of the field gersen descended to the ground feeling exposed and vulner able he started to detach the monitor keeping a careful lookout in all directions two men sauntered along the storage line casually or so it seemed gersen recognized one of them instantly the sarcoy who had followed hildemar dasce into smades tavern as they approached gersen gave them no overt heed but they made no twitch or move that he did not observe the sarkoy wore a modest suit of dark gray with epaulettes embroidered with opals his companion a thin sandyhatred man with dancing whitegray eyes wore a laborers loose blue coverall the two stopped a few feet from gersen stood watching as if in casual interest gersen after a glance ignored them though his skin crawled and his pulse pounded the sarkoy muttered some thing to his associate came a little forward i think weve met his voice was soft sardonic your name evades me said gersen politely i am suthiro sivij suthiro thk demon princks gersen examined him carefully seeing a man of middle weight with the curious flat head of the sarkoy steppeman the face wider than high suthiros eyes were soft dead olivedrab the nose snub and dark of nostril the mouth wide thicklipped a face shaped by more than a thousand years of specialization and inbreeding gersen could not detect the breath of death an accomplishment forced upon indentured assassins which shortened their lives gave the skin a yellowish glaze and caused the hair to stiffen suthiros skin was untoned pallid ivory his hair was a glossy black pelt and he wore tattooed on his right cheek the small maltese cross of the sarkoy hetman gersen said my apologies scop suthiro i dont remember the occasion you mention ah suthiros eyes widened at gersens use of the honorific you have visited sarkovy dear green sarkovy its boundless steppes its merry festivals merry so long as the harikap last then what will you tor ture suthiro of a race inured to insult took no offense we always have each other i see you know my planet well fairly well perhaps you remember me from sarkovy no said suthiro wryly elsewhere and more recently gersen shook his head impossible i have just come in from beyond exactly we met beyond at smades tavern indeed yes with certain others i came to meet my friend lugo tee halt in the confusion and excitement lugo left smades planet in your spaceship surely you are aware of this the sarkoy were held in low esteem by other peoples of the oikumene by virtue of repugnant eating habits and gross and exhibitionistic sexual conduct also despised was the popular sarkov sport known as harbite or the baiting of a harikap a large bristle furred semiintelligent biped of the north forests the wretched creature brought to a state of tension by hunger would be thrust into a circle of men armed with pitchforks and torches stimulated to wild activity by being set on fire thrust deftly with pitchforks back into the center of the circle as it sought to escape sarkovy the single planet of phi ophiuchi was a dim world of steppes swamps black forests morasses the sarkoy lived in tall wooden houses behind timber palisades not even the largest of the towns was secure from the attack of bandits and nomads from the wastelands by practice and tradition the sarkoy were accomplished poisoners a mas ter venefice reportedly could kill a man merely by walking past him the star king gersen laughed ifteehalt has either apologies or complaints im sure he will seek me out exactly said suthiro lugo teehalt sent me to make ad justment he begs forgiveness for his mistake and wishes only that i recover his monitor gersen shook his head you cant have it no suthiro moved closer lugo offers a thousand svu to indemnify you for his mistake i accept with thanks give me the money and the monitor i will return it when he comes for it the thinfaced man made an irritable clicking sound but su thiro grinned this is not exactly feasible you will have the money but we will not have the monitor there is no reason why you should have the monitor lugo teehalt is one principal in the matter i will give him his monitor i am the other principal in the matter it is perfectly legitimate for you to give me the money unless of course you distrust my hon esty by no means since we do not intend to put it to the test we propose in fact to take the monitor at this moment i think not said gersen i plan to take possession of the filament this is out of the question said suthiro gently try to stop me gersen returned to work disengaged the seals from the monitor housing suthiro watched placidly he made a signal to the thinfaced man who backed away and kept lookout i could stop you so suddenly youd become a marble statue he looked over his shoul der to the thinfaced man who nodded suthiro exhibited a weapon he carried in his hand i can provide you a heart spasm a brain hemorrhage or a convulsion of the small intestine whichever you prefer gersen paused in his work drew a deep sigh your arguments are impressive pay me five thousand svu i need pay you nothing but here is the thousand i men tioned he tossed gersen a packet of notes then motioned to the thinfaced man who came forward took gersens tools and ex svu standard value unit of the oikumene the demon princes pertly detached the monitor gersen counted the money moved to the side the two dropped the monitor into a bag and without another word departed gersen laughed quietly this was the mon itor he had bought and installed at euville at a cost of four hundred svu teehalts monitor was safe inside the ship gersen returned into the ship closed the ports time now was of the essence suthiro would require about ten minutes to com municate his success either to dasce or conceivably to malagate himself messages would then go out to various other spaceports of the concourse calling off the alert malagate would not receive the monitor if gersen were in luck for several hours perhaps not for days depending upon his whereabouts there would be an addi tional delay while the deception was discovered and then mala gates organization would once again be mobilized the focus now upon the feritse precision instrument company at sansontiana on olliphane by this time gersen hoped to have been there and gone cer tainly he would have no time to spare without further delay he started the jets rose into the blue alphanor sky pointed the boat toward olliphane from popular handbook of the planets olliphane nineteenth planet of the rigel concourse planetary constants diameter miles mass etc general remarks olliphane is the most dense of the rigel planets and orbits close at the outer edge of the hab itable zone it has been speculated that when the proto planet of the third group disintegrated olliphane received an unduly large share of core materials in any event until recent astronomic times olliphane was subject to intense plutonic activity and even today boasts ninetytwo active volcanoes olliphane is highly mineralized an imposing relief provides vast hydroelectric potential furnishing cheaper energy than is possible from traditional sources a diligent disciplined population utilizing these advantages has made olliphane the most highly industrialized world of the con course rivaled only by tantamount with its shipyards and lyonnesse with its monumental gnome iron works olliphane is relatively cool and wet with the population concentrated in the equatorial zone notably around the shores of lake clare here the visitor will find the ten larg est cities of the planet led by kindune sansontiana and new ossining the demon princes olliphane is likewise nutritionally selfsufficient few other than natural foods are consumed of which per capita consumption is highest in the concourse third highest among major worlds of the oikumene the alpine valleys surrounding the lake are devoted to dairying and the pro duction of greenstuffs the olphs are a mingled stock derived primarily from a colony of hyperborean skaters they are typically blond to brown of hair largeboned often inclined to corpulence with fair undyed skins they are respectful of orthodoxy sedate in personal lives but notoriously enthusiastic during the public fetes and celebrations which serve as emotional release to an otherwise conventional and reserved folk a caste system though without legal status permeates every phase of the social structure prerogatives are care fully denned jealously observed the language has expanded and loosened to provide at least a dozen styles of address from a study of interclass accommodations by frerb hankbert in journal of the anthropicene vol mcxm it is a remarkable experience for a visitor to watch a pair of olphs strange to each other appraising each other for caste the operation requires no more than an instant and appears almost intuitive for the persons concerned may well be wearing standard garments i have questioned many olphs in this matter and can still make no definite assertions in the first place most olphs blandly deny the existence of caste structure and consider their society completely egalitarian in the second place the olphs themselves are not quite sure how they divine the caste of a stranger he either has more of the quality known as haute than oneself or less i have theorized that rapid unconscious and almost un detectable eye movements are the key to the assessment of haute with characteristic shifts or steadiness indicative of each caste hands and hand morions may play a similar function as might be expected high officials of the bureaucracy the star ki g enjoy the most exalted caste and especially the civic tu telars as the olphs name their police gersen landed at the kmdune spaceport and with tcehalts mon itor in a suitcase boarded a subway for sansontiana to the best of his knowledge no one had heeded his arrival no one had followed him but now time was growing short at any moment malagate must realize he had been duped and would seek to reestablish con tact for the moment gersen considered himself safe nevertheless he performed a few classic maneuvers to disengage himself from sticktight or tracker finding nothing to disconcert him he de posited the monitor in a public locker at the subway interchange under the rapunzel hotel retaining only the brass serial plate then boarding an express car he was delivered in fifteen minutes to sansontiana eighty miles south he consulted a directory trans ferred to a local for the ferristoun district and presently was dis charged into a station only a few hundred yards from the feritse precision instrument company ferristoun was a dismal district of industrial structures ware houses an occasional tavern these latter cheerful little nooks lavish with ornament colored glass carved wood in emulation of the grand pleasure arcades along the lake shore the time was middle morning rain had darkened the black cobblestone pavement sixwheel drays lumbered along the streets the entire district sounded to a subdued hum of engines as gersen walked a short sharp bleat of whistle signaled a change of shift the sidewalks at once became crowded with workers they were pale people blank and humorless of face wearing warm wellmade cov eralls in one of three colors gray dark blue or mustard yellow a sticktight these come in at least five varieties suitable to various applications the bervoopticai a spy cell supported on rotary vings remotely guided h an oper ator the automatic a similar cell o follow radioactive or monochromatic lag fixed to ur smeared upon a man or vehicle the gulp spy master a semiinteiligenr flying crearure trained to follow any suhect of interest clever cooptrative ichahle hue relatively large and nodceable the minv spy bird a smaller less obnusive creirure trained to perform smularlv less docile and intelligent more aggressive the manx sp bird modification similar to the above equipped with control devices the demon princes contrasting belt either black or white black roundtopped kaftans all were standard issue the government being an elaborate syndi calism as thoroughgoing careful and humorless as its constituency two further bleats of the whistle sounded as if by magic the streets cleared the workers ducking into buildings like cockroaches exposed to the light a moment later gersen came to a stained concrete facade on which large bronze letters read feritse and below in the hooked olph script precision instruments again it had become necessary to expose himself to his enemies the prospect was far from comfort able well there was no help for it a single small door led into the building gersen entered to find himself in a long dim hallway a concrete tunnel which after a hundred feet brought him to the administration offices he went to stand at a counter and was ap proached by an elderly woman of pleasant appearance and manner by local custom she wore masculine garments while at work a dark blue suit with a black belt recognizing gersen as an offworlder of unguessable caste she bowed with unctuous courtesy and asked in a low reverent voice how sir may we serve you gersen tendered the brass plate i have lost the key to my monitor and i want a duplicate the woman blinked her manner underwent an instant if un conscious change she reached hesitantly for the plate held it be tween thumb and forefinger as if it were tainted looked over her shoulder well asked gersen in a voice made suddenly harsh by ten sion is there any difficulty there are new regulations the woman muttered i have had instructions to i must consult directorcontroller masensen excuse me sir she went almost at a trot to a side door disappeared gersen waited the subconscious perceptors in his brain ticking and prick ling he was more nervous than he cared to be nervousness clouded the judgment affected the accuracy of observation the woman slowly returned to the counter looking to right and left evading gersens eyes just a moment sir if you will wait there are records to be inspected isnt this the way always when a person wishes haste where is the serial plate asked gersen directorcontroller masensen has taken it into charge the star king in that case ill speak to directorcontroller masensen at once i will inquire said the woman please dont bother said gersen ignoring her startled squeak of protest he let himself through a swinging door passed ahead of her into the inner chamber a portly thickfaced man in faddish special issue blue and dove gray sat at a desk talking into a telephone he looked at the brass serial plate as he spoke at the sight of gersen his eyebrows rose his mouth sagged in irritation and dismay quickly he laid down the telephone there was an instant while his eyes nicked up and down gersens clothes before he shouted who are you sir why do you come into my room gersen reached across the desk took possession of the serial plate whom do you telephone in connection with this matter masensen became fiercely haughty none of your concern whatsoever impudence here in my office gersen spoke in a soft even voice the tutelars will be inoer ested in your illegal actions i am puzzled that you choose to defy the law masensen sat back in puffcheeked alarm the tutelars of a caste so elevated that the distinction between masensen and his office clerk would seem insignificant were not to be trifled with they were no respecters of persons they tended to believe the accusation rather than the protestation of innocence they wore uniforms of a sumptuous thick pile which showed various sheens according to the light plum dark green gold not so much arro gant as intensely serious they conducted themselves to the full implications of their caste on olliphane penal torture was admin istered as a cheaper if not more effective deterrent than fines of imprisonment the threat of a police accusation could therefore bring consternation to the most innocent directorcontroller masensen cried out i have never defied the law do i refuse your request no indeed then furnish my key immediately as the law requires softly then said masensen we cannot go so fast there are records to inspect dont forget we have more important affairs than leaping to serve every raggletaggle vagabond of a locator who marches into our room to insult us gersen stared into the round pale face which gave back hos the dkmon princes tility and defiance very well said gersen i will go to complain before the board oftutelars now then be reasonable blurted masensen in heavy affa bility all things do not come at once where is my key do you still plan to defy the law naturally no such thing is possible i will see to the matter come be patient take a chair and compose yourself for just these few minutes i do not care to wait go then bellowed masensen i have done exactly as the law requires his lips were pushing in and out his face was pink with fury he hammered the desk with his fists the clerk standing horrified in the doorway emitted a low wail of terror bring the tutelars raged masensen i will accuse you of molestation and threats i will see you whipped gersen dared delay no longer furiously he turned departed he passed through the outer office and out into the concrete tun nel he paused turned a quick look behind him the receptionist fluttering in excitement paid him no heed grinning like a wolf gersen walked up the hall away from the entrance and presently came to an arched opening giving upon the production chambers standing to the side inconspicuous in the shadow of a pilaster he made a careful appraisal of the rooms tracing the various pro duction lines certain phases were under biomechanical control others were performed by debtors moral deviants vagrants or drunks leased by the dozen from the city they sat chained to their benches guarded by an old warden and worked with apathetic ef ficiency the room supervisor sat on an elevated platform which could swing on a boom to any area of the room gersen located the process where monitors were constructed identified the area where locks were installed an alcove two hun dred feet along the wall beside a cubicle where a clerical worker perhaps a timekeeper sat on a high chair he made a final survey of the room no one had showed the slightest interest in him the supervisors attention was turned else where he walked quickly along the wall to the cubicle where the clerk sat a harassed hollowcheeked youngold man with sardonic black eyebrows a wrinkled sallow skin a cynical hook of nose and curl of mouth a man not necessarily a pessimist but apparently one the star king without optimism gersen stepped to the back of the cubicle where there were shadows the clerk looked around in astonishment well sir wtiat do you wish this is not permitted you must know that gersen asked would you care to earn a hundred svu very quickly the clerk grimaced sadly of course wtio must i kill my wants are less demanding said gersen he displayed the brass plate get me the key for this instrument and fifty svu is yours he placed five purple notes on the table find out to whom the serial number is registered fifty svu more he counted down the notes the clerk looked at the money then turned a speculative glance over his shoulder out across the shop wtiy not go to the front office the directorcontroller usually handles such things i have irritated directorcontroller masensen said gersen he makes difficulties and i am in a hurry in other words directorcontroller masensen would not ap prove of my helping you which is why i offer you the hundred svu to perform an entirely legal errand for me is it worth my job if i leave by the back way no one need know and masensen will never know the difference the clerk considered very well he said i can do it but ill need another fifty svu for the keymaker gersen shrugged brought forth an orange fifty svu note i will appreciate haste the clerk laughed from my viewpoint the sooner you are gone the better ill have to look through two sets of records were not too efficient here meanwhile keep to the back out of sight he noted the serial number left the cubicle disappeared behind a partition time passed gersen noticed that the back wall was paneled with painted glass bending he put his eye to a scratch and obtained a blurred view of the room behind the partition the clerk stood at an oldfashioned filing case nipping cards he found the file made a set of notes but now from a side door masensen lumbered into the room the clerk closed the file walked away masensen stopped short fired a question at the clerk who thp demon princes responded with an indifferent word or two gersen paid silent trib ute to his sangfroid masensen glared after him then wheeled and went to the files with one eye on masensens burly back the clerk bent over the keymaker whispered in his ear departed masensen looked around suspiciously but the clerk had left the room the machinist dropped a key blank into the machine consulted a paper punched a set of buttons to control the notches twists conductivities and magnetic nodes of the key masensen rummaged through the files extracted a card marched from the room the clerk at once returned the machinist tossed him the key the clerk came back to the cubicle he handed the key to gersen took five purple notes from the table and the registration asked gersen i cant help you masensen got to the files ahead of me and removed the card gersen glumly considered the key his main purpose had been to learn the registered owner of the monitor the key of course was better than nothing the record filament was easier to hide than the monitor itself but time was short he dared delay no longer keep the other fifty he said the money after all had come from malagate buy your children a present the clerk shook his head i accept pay only for what i achieve i need no gift as you wish gersen returned the money to his pocket tell me how to leave inconspicuously you had better go the way you came said the clerk if you try to go out the back way you will be stopped by the patrol thank you said gersen you are not olph no but ive lived here so long ive forgotten anything better gersen looked cautiously from the cubicle the situation was as before he slipped out walked quickly along the wall to the arch slipped through into the concrete tunnel passing the door which led into the administration offices he looked through saw masen sen pacing back and forth evidently in a vicious mood gersen stepped past hurried down the hall toward the outside door but now this door opened a man entered his features dark against the outside light gersen continued forward briskly confi dently as if his business were the most legitimate in the world the star king the man approached their eyes met the newcomer stopped it was tristano the earthman luck declared tristano in a voice of hushed pleasure luck indeed gersen made no reply slowly carefully he sought to sidle past too nervous and tense to feel fear tristano took a step blocked his way gersen halted appraised him tristano was shorter than him self by an inch but thick in the neck and shoulders flat but rather wide at the hips an attribute indicating agility and good muscular leverage his head was small almost hairless his features were neat the ears were surgically cropped the nose flat the area around the mouth thick with muscle his expression was calm with a serene secret halfsmile twisting up the corners of his mouth he seemed reckless rather than vicious a man who would fee neither hate nor pity a man driven only by the need to fulfill the extremes of his capabilities a highly dangerous man thought gersen he said qui etly stand aside tristano extended his left hand almost affably whatever your name is be wise come with me flicking and weaving the ex tended hand he leaned forward gersen watched tristanos eyes ignoring the distracting left hand wtien the right hand darted forth he knocked it aside drove his fist into tristanos face tristano reeled back as if in desperate pain and gersen pre tended to be deceived he rushed forward arm cocked back to administer another blow then halted abruptly as with incredible agility tristano swung up his leg a kick intended to cripple or kill as the foot swung by gersen seized toe and heel twisted hard tristano relaxing instantly turned in midair pulled himself into a ball used the momentum of his turn and fall to wrench the foot harmlessly from gersens grasp he caught himself catlike on hands and feet started to bounce away but gersen caught the back of tristanos head yanked tristanos face down against his knee car tilage crushed teeth broke tristano fell back now startled for an instant he sat laxly asprawl gersen caught tristanos leg and ankle in a lock threw over his weight and felt the bone snap tristano sucked in his breath snatching for his knife he left his throat exposed gersen hacked backhand at the larynx tristanos throat was wellmuscled and he retained consciousness but fell back feebly waving his knife the demon princes gersen kicked it away but edged forward carefully for tristano might be equipped with one or a dozen secret builtin weapons leave me be croaked tristano leave me be go vour way he dragged himself to the wall gersen cautiously reached forth giving tristano the option to counter tristano refused gersen made contact with the massive shoulders gripped tristano suffered this the two stared eye to eye tristano made a sudden grab for an armlock simultaneously bringing up his good leg gersen avoided the armlock seized the leg prepared to break the other ankle behind him there was out cry a flurry of movement directorcontroller masensen face con torted came running awkwardly down the hall behind him trotted two or three underlings stop this cried masensen what do you do here in this building lie fairly spat in gersens face you are a devil a crim inal of the worst sort you insult me you attack my customer i will have the tutelars attend to you by all means panted gersen suddenly brimming with vin dictiveness call the tutelars masensen raised his eyebrows what you have this insolence too no insolence is intended said gersen a good citizen assists the police in apprehending criminals what do you mean there is a certain name which i need speak only once to the tutelars i need only hint that you and this person are in collusion for proof this man he looked down at the halfsmiling half dazed tristano do you know him no of course i do not know him but you identified him as a customer so ithought him he is a notorious murderer waning my agile friend croaked tristano no murderer i lugo teehalt is not alive to contradict you tristano essayed a grimace of outraged innocence we spoke you and i while the old man died in this case neither dasce nor the sarkoy killed teehalt who came with you to smades planet we came alone the star kwg gersen stared in puzzlement i find this hard to believe hil demar dasce told teehalt that malagate awaited him outside tristanos response was a faint shrug gersen stood looking down at him i respect the tutelars and their scourges i dare not kill you but i can break more bones and you will walk sideways like a crab i can spread apart your eyes and you will look in two different directions the rest of your life the lines bracketing tristanos mouth became deep and mel ancholy he slumped heavily back against the wall uninterested sodden with pain he mumbled since when is killing beyond the pale called murder who killed teehalt i saw nothing i stood with you by the door but the three of you came together to smades tristano made no response gersen leaned forward performed a quick vicious act masensen made an inarticulate sound stumbled away then halting as if caught by a wire he slowly turned to stare tristano looked numbly at his dangling hand who killed teehalt tristano shook his head i will say no more i would rather limp and squint than die of the sarkoys cluthe i can infect you with cluthe i will say no more gersen leaned forward but masensen uttered a short quavering cry this is intolerable i will not allow it must you give me nightmares i do not sleep well gersen examined him without friendliness you would do well not to interfere i will call in the tutelars your acts are grossly illegal you have broken laws of the state gersen laughed call the tutelars we will learn who has broken laws and who will be punished masensen rubbed his pallid cheeks go then never return and i will say no more not so fast said gersen in high good spirits you are in serious difficulties i came here on a legal errand you telephone for a murderer who attacks me this conduct no one should ignore masensen licked his lips you are making false charges i will add this to my particulars it was a poor effort gersen laughed he went to tristano turned him over on his face pulled the jacket thk demon princes down the broad back to constrict the arms tied it in place with tristanos sash with his broken bones tristano was now immo bilized gersen stepped down the hall motioned to masensen let us go to your office gersen led the way with masensen stumping reluctantly be hind once within the inner office masensen sank on nerveless legs into his chair now then said gersen call the tutelars masensen shook his head it it is better to make no difficul ties the tutelars are sometimes unreasonable in that case you must tell me what i want to know masensen bowed his head ask who did you telephone when i appeared masensen showed extreme agitation i cannot tell you he said huskily do you insist that i be killed the tutelars will ask the same question as well as many oth ers masensen looked in anguish to right left up at the ceiling a man he said at the grand pomador hotel his name spock i know better said gersen you are lying i give you one more chance who did you call masensen shook his head desperately i do not lie have you seen the man yes he is tall he has short pink hair a long big head and no neck his face is a peculiar red color and he wears dark spec tacles and a nose guard very unusual he has no more feeling than a fish gersen nodded masensen was telling the truth this would be hildemar dasce he turned now then this is most important i wish to know to whom the monitor is registered masensen started to shake his head then gave a fatalistic shrug and rose to his feet i will go for the record no said gersen we will go together and if we cannot find the record i swear to you i will lodge the strongest possible charges masensen rubbed his forehead wearily i remember now the record is here he brought forth a card from his desk sea prov ince university avente alphanor beneficial grant no name the star king no and there is no value to you in the key the university uses a coder in each of its monitors we have sold them several indeed the use of a coder to thwart the doubledealing of an unscrupulous locater was common enough masensens voice became heavily ironic the university has evidently sold you a coded monitor without the descrambling strip if i were you i would complain to the avente authorities gersen considered the implications of the information they were farreaching indeed if one certain condition were met why did you telephone the man spock did he offer you money masensen nodded miserably money and he made threats an indiscretion in my past he made a vague gesture tell me did spock realize that the monitor was coded certainly i mentioned this to him but he was already aware of it gersen nodded the condition had been met attel malagate must necessarily have access to the descrambling strip at the sea province university he reflected for a moment information was accumulating malagate himself had killed teehalt if hildemar dasce were to be believed tristano indirectly had verified this he had conveyed more information than he meant to he had also confused the sit uation if dasce the sarkoy poisoner and tristano had come to gether with no fourth person how was the presence of malagate to be explained had he arrived simultaneously in another ship possible but unlikely masensen was staring at him anxiously miserably im going now said gersen do you plan to tell this spock that i was here masensen nodded all his bluster departed i must but you will wait one hour masensen made no protest he might or might not respect gersens wishes most likely not but there was no help for this gersen turned departed the office leaving masensen utterly de flated walking down the hall gersen overtook tristano who some how had managed to squirm and writhe himself erect now he hopped down the hall one foot dragging at a queer angle he looked over his shoulder at gersen still wearing the quiet half the demon princes smile though the muscles around his mouth were tight gersen stopped to consider the man it would be wise and desirable to kill him except for the possibility of police interference so contenting himself with a polite nod and stepping past tristano he went his way preface to men of the oikumene by jan holberk vaenz lxii there is a stifling quality to this age which has been observed remarked on and lamented by a number of the contemporary anthropologists an oddity for never before have such variegated opportunities and possible channels of life existed it is profitable to consider this situation for it will recur many times in the pages to follow the most important fact of human life is the infinity of space the bounds which can never be reached the worlds without number still unseen in short the beyond it is my belief that the awareness of these awesome possibilities has somehow clotted at the core of human consciousness and has diminished or dampened human enterprise an instant qualification is necessary men of enterprise indeed exist though sadly enough most of them work be yond and their enterprise is not entirely constructive the statement is not completely ironical many of the most nox ious forms of life exert some sort of useful side effect but in general ambition is turned inward rather than out toward the obvious goals why does infinity as an object of experience instead of a mathematical abstraction daunt the human mind are we complacent and secure knowing that the riches of the galaxy are always there for the taking is contemporary life already sated by too rich a diet or novelty is it conceivable that the institute wields more control over the human psyche than we suspect or thk demon princes is there current a feeling of frustration ant staleness the conviction that all glory has been won that all the mean ingful goals have been achieved undoubtedly there is no single answer but several points are noteworthy first to be mentioned without com ment is the peculiar situation where the most influential and effective systems of the day are the private or at best semipublic associations the ipcc the institute thejarnell corporation second is the decline of the general level of education the extremes are certainly farther apart the savants of the institute on the one hand and say the serfs of a tertullian estate on the other if we consider the condition of men beyond the pale the polarity is even more pronounced there are obvious sources to the decline pioneers settling in strange and often hostile environments have sheer sur vival for their first concern possibly even more daunting is the unmanageable mass of accumulated knowledge the trend toward specialization began with modern times but after the breakout into space and the consequent new am plitude of information specialization has become even more narrowly focused it is perhaps pertinent to consider the manner of man who has become the new specialist he lives in a materi alistic age where comparatively small interest is given to absolutes he is a man of charm wit sophistication but no profundity his ideals are not abstract his field of en deavor if he is a scholar may be mathematics or one of the physical sciences but it is a hundred times more likely to be a phase of what loosely are called humanistic studies history sociology comparatives symbology esthetics an thropology the varieties of experience penology educa tion communication administration and coercion not to mention the morass of psychology already trampled by gen erations of incompetents and the still unexplored wilder ness of psionics there are also those who like the author ensconce themselves on a thunderous

termed the quest for pleasure this is a large statement possibly of no startling novelty neverthe less as a generality it affords a rich resonance of implica tions the author suggests as a lively topic for a dissertation a survey of various environmentsurvival situations and the special types of pleasure goals deriving therefrom it seems probable from a moments reflection that every particular the dfmon princfs scarcity or compulsion or danger generates a corresponding psychic tension demanding a particular gratification gersen returned to the subway terminal at sansontiana he re co ered the monitor immediately made a trial of the key to his gratification the lock moved smoothly the case slid open there was neither explosive nor acid present he extracted the little cylinder containing the filament weighed it m his hand then he stepped into a postoffice booth and mailed the cylinder to him self at the hotel credenza avente alphanor he rode the subway back to kindune and the spaceport and with no untoward incident took his ship aloft the blue crescent of alphanor presently bulged across the sky with riel dazzling beyond when the seven continents began to emerge from the dark gersen engaged his autopilot into the av ente landing program and so was guided down to the spaceport the crane lifted the boat earned it to a storage bay gersen emerged made a cautious reconnaissance finding no evidence of his enemies he proceeded down the ranks of stored spacecraft to the terminal building here he breakfasted and considered his plans they were he decided completely straightforward deriving from a progression of logical steps in which he could see no flaw a lugo teehalts monitor was registered to the sea province university b the information on the monitor filament was coded acces sible only upon application of the decoding or descramblmg strip c the decoding strip was in possession of the sea province university at avente d according to lugo teehalt attel malagate had been his original sponsor a fact he had apparently understood for the first time at brmktown indiscretions by hildemar dasce everything considered malagate probably still regarded his incognito secure malagate vigorously sought possession of the monitor and its filament and hence must have access to the de coding strip e gersens course of action would therefore be the star k g identify the persons who had access to the decoding strip learn which of these fulfilled a set of conditions consis tent with the identity and activities of malagate which for example had been gone long enough for a visit to smades planet a straightforward and logical line of attack indeed but gersen reflected the implementation of his logic might not be quite so easy he dare not arouse malagates apprehensions to a certain extent possession ofteehalts filament provided security however if malagate felt a personal threat he would find little difficulty and no qualms in arranging an assassination to this moment malagate had no reason to fear exposure and it would be foolhardy to con vince him otherwise the initiative for the present was gersens there was no occasion for breakneck haste his attention be came distracted in a booth nearby sat a pair of pretty girls who evidently had come to the terminal to welcome a friend or to see one off gersen contemplated them wistfully aware not for the first time of an empty area in his life and feeling a dissatisfaction not unlike the indefinable emotion he had known at smades planet frivolity the two girls evidently had very little else on their minds one had dyed her hair forest green and toned her skin a delicate lettuce green the other wore a wig of lavender metal shav ings with deadwhite skin toning an elaborate cloche of silver leaves and tendrils clung to her forehead clasped her cheeks gersen drew a deep breath undoubtedly he had lived a grim cheerless existence thinking back across the years scenes came crowding into his mind all of which were variations on a single theme other children occupied with irresponsible pleasure while he a rather thin boy with a grave face watched from a distance he had felt only interest and wonder at the easy gaiety so he recalled never relating the scenes to himself his grandfather had seen to that one of the girls at the nearby booth had noticed his attention she whispered to her friend both glanced across the aisle then ostentatiously ignored him gersen smiled ruefully he felt no con fidence in his dealings with women he had known few intimately he frowned turned the two a wary side glance not impossibly malagate had sent these girls to beguile him ridiculous why twoi the dfmon princes they rose and departed the restaurant each turning on him one swift covert glance gersen watched their retreat resisting the sudden urge to run after them to introduce himself to make them his friends ri diculous again doubly ridiculous what would he say he pictured the two pretty faces at first puzzled then embarrassed while he stood making lame efforts to ingratiate himself the girls were gone just as well thought gersen half amused half angry with himself still why deceive himself living the life of half a man was difficult a source of dissatisfaction the circumstances of his life had given him small command of the social graces still what of that he knew his mission in life and he was superbly prepared to fulfill this mission he had no doubts no un certainties his goals were exactly defined a sudden idea disturbed the flow of his selfreassurances where would he be without this clear purpose if he were less artificially motivated he might not show so well in comparison with the easy men around him with their pleasant manners and fluent talk turning the thought over back and forth gersen began to feel spiritually deficient no phase of his life had occurred by his own free choice he felt no slightest tremor in his dedication this was not the point at issue but he thought a mans goals should not be imposed upon him until he knew enough of the world to make his own survey to weigh his own decisions he had not been given this option the decision had been made he had accepted it after all what matter more to the point what would he do when and if he succeeded in his aims the chances were small of course but assuming the death of five men what then would he do with his life once or twice before he had reached this point in his reflections warned by some subconscious signal he had never gone beyond it nor did he do so now his breakfast was finished the girls who had prompted him to his brooding had taken themselves off evidently they were not agents ofmalagate the woe gersen sat a few minutes longer considering the best approach to his problem and again decided upon simple directness he went to a communication booth and was connected to the information bureau at the sea province university in the suburb of remo ten miles south the telescreen flickered first with the university seal then a conventional reception presentation printed with the words please the star king speak clearly simultaneously a recorded voice asked how may we serve you gersen spoke to the still unseen receptionist i want infor mation regarding the universitys exploration program which de partment is directly concerned the screen clarified through a decorative crosshatching to show the goldtoned face of a young woman with blonde hair in flamboyant puffs at each ear that depends on the type of explo ration it would be connected with beneficial grant just a moment sir and ill inquire the scene retreated be hind the crosshatching presently the girls face reappeared ill connect you with the department of galactic morphology sir gersen looked into another pale receptionist face this young woman had arch piquant features toned nacreous silver and wore her hair in a dark nimbus of ten thousand tiny varnished spikes galactic morph i want to inquire about beneficial grant said gersen the girl considered for a moment you mean the grant itself sir the grant how it operates who administers it the arch young face pursed its mouth dubiously theres not much i can tell you sir its the fund which finances our exploration program im particularly interested in a locater named lugo teehalt who worked under the grant she shook her head i wouldnt know anything about him mr detteras could tell you but hes not available for appointments today mr detteras hires the locators the girl twisted her eyebrows squinted she had a mobile ex pression a wide mouth with a merry upward twitch at the corners gersen watched her in fascination i dont know too much about things like that sir we have our part in the master exploration program of course thats not under grant though mr det teras is director of exploration he could tell you whatever you wanted to know is there anyone else in the department who might sponsor a locater on grant the dfmon princes the girl looked speculatively sidewise at gersen wondering as to the nature of his interest are vou a police official she asked timidly gersen laughed no im a friend of mr teehalts trying to finish up some business for him oh well theres mr kelle who is chairman of the research planning committee and mr warweave the honorary provost who made the donation for grant mr kelle is gone for the morning his daughter is marrying tomorrow and hes very busy what about mr warweave can i see him well the girl pursed her lips bent her head over an ap pointment panel hes busy until three and then he keeps an open hour for students or persons without appointments that would suit me very well if youd care to leave your name said the girl demurely ill put it at the head of the list then you wont have to wait in case there are lots of others gersen was startled by her solicitude he searched her face and was further surprised to find her smiling at him thats very kind of you my name is kirth gersen he watched her write she seemed in no hurry to terminate the conversation he asked what does an honorary provost do what are his duties she shrugged i dont know really he comes and goes i think he does just what he wants anyone who is rich does just what he wants wait till im rich one more thing gersen said are you familiar with the routine of the department why yes i should say so the girl laughed in so far as there is a routine the recording filament of the monitor in a locater boat is coded youre aware of this so i have been told the girl was definitely speaking to ger sen as an individual rather than a face on a screen gersen thought her deliciously pretty in spite of her rather extravagant hair style definitely he had been in space too long he kept his voice even with an effort wtio unscrambles the filaments wtio is in charge of the code again the girl was doubtful mr detteras for one perhaps mr kelle the star king can you find out definitely the girl hesitated examining gersens face it was always wise to refuse to answer questions whose motives she could not fathom still where could be the harm the man who inquired seemed interesting wistful and sad so she thought and a trifle mysterious and definitely not unattractive in a hardbitten fashion i can ask mr detteras secretary she said brightly will you wait the screen dimmed and a minute or two later brightened again the girl smiled back at gersen i was right mr detteras mr kelle and mr warweave these are the only people who have access to the decoding strip i see mr detteras is director of exploration mr kelle is chairman of the research planning committee and mr war weave is what honorary provost they gave him the title when he endowed the department with grant hes a very wealthy man and very interested in space exploration he frequently goes beyond have you ever been beyond ive just returned she leaned forward her face alive with interest is it really as wild and dangerous as everyone says gersen threw caution to the winds with a bravado that startled even himself come out with me and see for yourself the girl did not appear unduly perturbed but she shook her head id be alarmed ive been taught never to trust strange men from the beyond you might be a slaver and sell me such things have happened said gersen dampened youre probably safer where you are still she said coquettishly who wants to be safe gersen hesitated started to speak stopped short the girl watched him with an expression of bland innocence well why not he asked himself his grandfather had been old and parched in that case if youre willing to risk it perhaps youd spend the evening with me for what purpose the girl was suddenly demure slavery no just the usual whatever youd like to do this is very abrupt after all i havent even seen you face to face yes youre right said gersen once more abashed im not very gallant hie dkmon princes and still what could be the harm im impulsive myself or so ive been told i suppose it depends on circumstances youre just in from beyond the girl said magnanimously so i guess you can be excused then youll do it she pretended to consider very well ill take a chance where will i meet you ill be out at three oclock to see mr warweave we can make arrangements then im off duty at four youre sure youre not a slaver im not even a pirate rather an unenterprising sort id say but im just as pleased until i know you a little better a wide sandy beach extended a hundred miles south of avente around the entire concavity of ard hook as far as remo and a few miles beyond villas built of glaring white coquina lined the crest of the sandy bluffs which overlooked the ocean gersen hired a car a small surface slider and skidded south over the broad white turnpike the inevitable dust puffing up behind him for a space the road followed the shore sand dazzled under the brilliant rigel light blue water under a collar of white foam sparkled and rolled calmly up and down the sand creating a sound invariable on every wwld in every galaxy where surf meets shore the road presently climbed the bluffs to the left spread sand dunes overgrown with black and purple iron bush punctuated by tall white balloon flower the inflated pod floating at the end of a long stem other white villas looked forth from groves of cool green deodars native feathertree hybrid palm ahead the ground rose and the sandy bluffs became a range of low hills presenting a steep face to the ocean remo occupied the flat land at the foot of one of these hills a pair of piers terminating in highdomed casinos reached forth to create a harbor filled with small boats the university occupied the crest of the hill a series of low flatrooted structures connected by arcades gersen arrived at the campus parking area lowered the slide car alighted a slideway took him through a commemorative arch into a wide mall where he inquired directions from a student the star king the college of galactic morphology into the next quad sir the building at the far corner ruefully pondering the respectful sir from a man no more than seven years his junior gersen walked to the end of the mall threading a manyvoiced manycostumed multitude of students he crossed the quadrangle approached the building at the far cor ner at the portal he paused aware of an emotion strangely like diffidence or shyness which had gradually been asserting itself dur ing the entire trip out to the university he jeered at himself was he a schoolboy that the prospect of an evening with a strange girl should give him tremors and more remarkable the emotion seemed to take precedence over the basic goal ot his existence he shrugged irritated and amused together then entered the foyer at a desk a girl looked up with an uncertainty gersen identified as equivalent to his own she was smaller and more slender than he had thought her to be but by no means less appealing mr gersen gersen put on what he hoped was a reassuring smile it occurs to me that i dont know your name she relaxed a trifle pallis atwrode that takes care of the formalities said gersen i hope that our arrangement is still working she nodded unless youve changed your mind no i act far bolder than i actually am said pallis atwrode she gave an embarrassed laugh ive simply decided to ignore my up bringing my mother is a bluestocking perhaps its time i began to overcompensate you begin to alarm me said gersen im not very bold ei ther and if i have to cope with overcompensation not really formidable overcompensation wont become in toxicated or pick a fight or she stopped or oh just or gersen looked at his watch id better see mr warweave his offices are down that corridor and mr gersen gersen looked down into the upturned face yes today i told you something which it seems i shouldnt have about the code its supposed to be secret would you please not mention it to mr warweave id get in trouble he demon princes ill say nothing about it thank you he turned went off down the corridor she had indicated the floor was resilient black and gray tesserae the walls and ceiling were plastered white devoid of decoration or relief except for the various doors and identificators these in various muted tones of maroon mauve dark green indigo three doors along the corridor gersen came upon a free floating identificator of luminous blue letters which read gyle warweave and below provost he paused struck by the incongruity of malagate the woe in such surroundings was there a break in his chain of reasoning the monitor was coded registered to the university hildemar dasce malagates lieutenant had sought possession of the filament which was useless without the decoder gyle warweave detteras and kelle were the three men who had access to the decoder one of the three must be malagate so then which warweave detteras or kelle conjecture without facts was useless he must deal with events as they occurred he stepped forward the door slipped aside quick as a camera shutter the identificator broke into individual letters which scattered like frightened fish to regroup after he had passed in the outer office a tall thin middleaged woman with keen unsympathetic gray eyes stood listening to an obviously unhappy young man shaking her head slowly continually as he spoke im sorry she said finally m a clear brittle voice these ar rangements are all made on a formal basis of student achievement i cant allow you to bother the provost with your complaints wtiat is he there for then shouted the young man he had open office hours why cant he listen to my side of the story the woman shook her head im sorry she turned away are you mr gersen she asked gersen came forward mr warweave is expecting you please go through that door gersen went as directed gyle warweave sitting at a desk rose to his feet as gersen entered a tall handsome man strong and fit looking of an age not immediately obvious perhaps ten or fifteen years older than gersen his hair was a cushion of black curls shaped close to his skull his skin dye a conservative pale umber his face was emphatically marked the eyes narrow deepset black the star king and brooding the nose and chin harsh he saluted gersen with a measured courtesy mr gersen sit down if you will im glad to make your acquaintance thank you gersen looked about him the room was larger than the usual office the desk occupying an unconventional posi tion by the left of the door with the greater part of room beyond tall windows at the right overlooked the quadrangle the opposite wall was papered with hundreds of maps mercator proections of many worlds the center of the room was empty giving it the semblance of a conference chamber from which the table had been removed at the far end on a pedestal of polished wood stood a construction of stone and metal spires the provenance of which gersen was ignorant he seated himself returned his attention to the man behind the desk gyle warweave hardly conformed to gersens picture of the typical university administrator this of course would well be true thought gersen if warweave were malagate contradicting the evidence of his conservative skin dye warweave wore a rich bright blue suit with a white sash white leather greaves pale blue sandals garments which might be affected by a young buck of the sailmaker beach district north of avente gersen groped at an elusive fa miliarity a tantalizing wisp of recollection which fled completely from view warweave inspected gersen uth a similar frank curiosity in which there was a trace of condescension gersen definitely was no dandy he wore the neutral garments of a person either uninter ested m current modes or unaware of them his skin was undyed walking along the streets of avente gersen had felt almost un dressed his thick dark hair was cropped into an undistinguished ruff warweave waited with attentive politeness gersen said im here mr warweave in connection with a rather complex matter my motives are beside the point so ill ask you to listen without troubling about them warweave nodded rather difficult but ill try first of all are you acquainted with mr lugo teehalt no i am not the answer as immediate and decisive may i ask who has the responsibility for the universitys space exploration program the demon princes warweave considered do you refer to major expeditions shotgun surveys or what in particular whatever program makes use of locators in leased boats hm said warweave he turned a quizzical look toward gersen by any chance are you a locater in search of a post if so gersen smiled politely no im not after a job warweave smiled in his turn a quick humorless grimace no of course not im inept in my judgments for instance your voice tells me very little youre not a native of the concourse if you were of a different physiognomy id place you from mizars third during most of my youth i lived on earth indeed warweave raised his eyebrows in manufactured astonishment out here you know we think ofearthmen in terms of stereotypes cultists mystics hypercivilized eptcenes sinister old men in institute black decadent aristocrats i claim no particular niche said gersen incidentally you puzzle me no less than i puzzle you warweave put on an expression of rueful whimsey very well mr gersen you were asking about our policy in connection with locators first of all we cooperate with a number of other institu tions in the master space exploration program secondly there is a small fund which may be drawn upon to expedite some special project that is beneficial grant warweave inclined his head in curt assent very odd said gersen odd how so lugo teehalt was a locater the monitor in his boat was char tered to sea province university under grant warweave pursed his lips its quite possible that mr teehalt might be working for one of the department heads on some special project the monitor was coded that should narrow the possibilities warweave pierced gersen with a hard glance of black eyes if i knew what you wanted to learn i could answer more to the point there was nothing to lose by telling at least part of the truth thought gersen if gyle warweave were malagate he would know the star king what had happened if he were not no harm could be done the name attel malagate is familiar to you malagate the woe one of the socalled demon princes lugo teehalt located a world of apparently idyllic condi tions a world literally beyond value more earthlike than earth malagate learned of the discovery how i dont know in any event at least four ofmalagates men hunted teehalt to smades tavern teehalt arrived ust after i did he landed in a hidden valley and walked to the tavern during the evening malagates men ar rived teehalt tried to escape but they caught him in the dark killed him then they took off in my ship apparently assuming that it was teehalts both were the same old model b gersen laughed when they checked my monitor they had a sorry sur prise the next day i left in teehalts boat naturally i took pos session of his monitor i plan to sell the filament for as much as the market will bear warweave nodded briskly moved a sheet of paper on his desk an inch to the right gersen watched him studying the immaculate hands the glossy fingernails looking up he caught the stare of warweaves gaze less affable than his tone of voice and from whom do you propose to collect gersen shrugged ill give teehalts sponsor the first oppor tunity as i mentioned the filament is coded and is valueless with out the decoding strip warweave leaned back in his chair offhand i dont know who might have contracted with this man teehalt whoever it is natu rally would not buy a pig in a poke naturally not gersen placed a photograph on the desk warweave glanced at it dropped it into a projection slot a screen on the far wall burst into color teehalt had taken the picture from a rise of ground to one side of a valley on either hand hills rolled back over away and beyond the rounded tips could be seen re ceding into the distance groves of tall dark trees stood to the side of the valley a river wandered through the meadows the banks lined with rushes at the far side of the meadow almost in the shade of the forest stood what appeared to be a bank of flowering shrubs the sun could not be seen but the sunlight was goldenwhite warm languid and the time was evidently noon warweave studied the picture at length then made a gruff non the demon princes committal sound gersen provided another photograph the screen shifted to display the view down the valley the river meandering and twisting finally disappearing into the far distance trees stand ing tall at either side formed a sort of aisle diminishing until all faded into haze warweave heaved a sigh beyond question a beautiful world a hospitable world what of atmosphere and biogens completely compatible according to teehalt if it is as you say undiscovered uninhabited an indepen dent locater could name his own price still not being born yes terday i wonder could not this photograph have been made elsewhere even on earth where the vegetation is similar to this for answer gersen brought forth a third photograph war weave dropped it into the slot the screen depicted as if from a distance of twenty feet one of the objects which in the first pho tograph had appeared as a flowering shrub it was revealed as a perambulatory being semihumanoid graceful slender gray legs supported a gray silver blue green torso purplegreen eyes looked forth from a perfect ovoid head which was otherwise featureless from the shoulders armlike members reached three feet into the air branching and webbing to support the peacocks tail fan of fronds the creature whatever it is teehalt called it a dryad certainly it is unique ive never seen its like before if the picture is not faked and i do not believe that it is then the planet is what you claim it to be i claim nothing teehalt made the claims it is a world so he told me so beautiful that he could neither bear to stay nor bear to leave and you have teehalts filament in your possession yes i want to sell it the market is presumably limited to those persons who have access to the decoding strip of these the man who sponsored lugo teehalts operation should have the first option warweave gave gersen a long steady inspection a quixotic attitude which puzzles me you do not seem a quixotic man why not judge from deeds rather than impressions warweave merely raised his eyebrows in something like dis dain then he said conceivably i could make you an offer for the the star king filament say two thousand svu now another ten thousand after inspection of the world possibly a trifle more naturally i will take the best price can get said gersen but i would like to interview mr kelle and mr detteras first one of them must be teehalts sponsor if neither is interested in the filament then warweave interrupted sharply wtiy do you specify these two men other than yourself they are the only persons who have access to the decoding strips may i ask how you are aware of this remembering pallis atwrodes request gersen felt a pang of guilt i asked a young man in the quadrangle apparently its com mon knowledge altogether too much loose talk said warweave his mouth in a hard angry line gersen wanted to inquire how warweave had spent the pre vious month but the occasion was clearly inopportune it could not be a wise question if posed directly if warweave were malagate his suspicion would instantly be reinforced warweave now tapped fingers on his desk rose to his feet if you will give me half an hour i will ask mr detteras and mr kelle to step into my office and you can make your inquiry will that be satisfactory no no barked warweave why not gersen also rose to his feet since the matter does not concern you i would prefer to interview mr kelle and mr detteras alone on my own terms this is at your option said warweave coldly he considered a moment wtiat you are after i cant guess i put little faith in your candor but i will make a bargain with you gersen waited kelle and detteras are busy men said warweave they are not as accessible as i am i will arrange that you see them at once today if you like possibly one or the other will admit to an ar rangement with lugo teehalt in any case after your interview with kelle and detteras you will report to me what offers if any they have made and so give me the opportunity of meeting or exceeding the offer thf demon princes in other words said gersen youd keep this world for your private use why not the filament is no longer the property of the uni versity you have taken possession of it and if the truth be known my money has gone to endow grant thats reasonable enough you agree to my bargain then yes so long as you understand that the first refusal goes to teehalts sponsor warweaves eyelids drooped he inspected gersen with a rather cynical twist of the lips i wonder why you insist on this perhaps i am a quixotic man after all mr warweave warweave swung about spoke into the desk screen listened turned back to gersen very well mr kelle will see you first then mr detteras after that you will report back to me i agree good you will find kelles office at the opposite end of the building gersen went out into the corridor past warweaves glinteyed secretary returned to the foyer pallis atwrode looked up with an eager expectancy gersen found very appealing did you learn what you wanted to no hes sending me to see kelle and detteras today right now she looked at him with new interest youd be surprised at the people both mr kelle and mr detteras have refused to see today gersen grinned i dont know how long ill be if youre off duty at four ill wait said palhs atwrode and then she laughed i mean you wont be very much longer than four and id have to walk home and explain where i live its ust easier waiting ill be as fast as i can said gersen deeming the unsubstantiated dogma of a locali ed religious cult to be an undignified and unsuitable base on which to erect the chronology of galactic man the members of this convention hereby declare that time shall now be reckoned from the year a d which becomes the year the revolution offarth about sol remains the stan dard annual unit declaration at the oikumemcal convention for the standardization of units and meters everything of which we are conscious has for us a deeper meaning still a final meaning and the one and only means ot rendering this incomprehensible comprehensible must be a kind of metaphysics which regards everything whatsoever as having significance as a symbol oswald spengler who are our basic enemies this is a secret unknown even to those basic enemies xaviar skolcamp overcentennul fellon ot the institute indulgently in response to a ournahsts too searching question kagge kelle was a small compact man with a large solid well arranged head his skin was only faintly dyed to a waxv bisque pallor he wore a severe costume of dark brown and purple his eyes were clear and remote his nose short and blunt his mouth prim held firmly as if in compensation for its overfullness the demon princes kelle seemed to make a virtue of inscrutability he greeted gersen with austere courtesy listened to his story without com ment saw the photographs without perceptible show of interest choosing his words with care he said i am sorry that i cannot help you i did not sponsor mr teehalts expedition i know noth ing about this man in that case will you allow me the use of the decoding strip kelle sat motionless for a moment then he said in an even voice unfortunately this is contrary to the rules of the depart ment i would encounter not a little criticism still he picked up the photographs examined them once more this is beyond question a world of interesting characteristics what is its name i dont have that information mr kelle i cannot conceive why you seek teehalts sponsor are you a representative of the ipcc i am a private individual though naturally i cant demonstrate this kelle was skeptical everyone works to his own interests if i understood what you were trying to achieve i could possibly act with more flexibility that is more or less what mr warweave told me said ger sen kelle turned on him a sharp look neither warweave nor my self are what might be called innocent men he thought for a moment then said grudgingly on behalf of the department i can go so far as to make you an offer for the filament though as you tell the story it actually is the property of the department to begin with gersen nodded in full agreement that is exactly the point i am trying to establish does the filament actually belong to the university or can i feel free to do as i like with it if i could find lugo teehalts sponsor or determine whether the sponsor actu ally exists then any number of new possibilities would appear kelle was not to be moved by gersens ingenuousness it is an extraordinary situation as i say i might be able to make you an attractive offer for the filament even as a private party if that would expedite matters although i would naturally insist on a prior inspection of the planet you know my qualms in the matter mr kelle kelles response was only a small incredulous smile once more the star king he studied the photographs these er dryads i must say they are creatures of considerable interest well i can help you to this extent i will consult university records for information regard ing lugo teehalt but in exchange i would like you to assure me an opportunity to consider the purchase of this world in the event that you do not find the socalled sponsor gersen could not restrain a mild gibe you gave me to un derstand that you werent particularly interested your assumptions are of no consequence said kelle evenly this should not injure your sensibilities for you clearly are not concerned as to my opinion of you you approach me as if i were mentally deficient with a tale which would not impress a child gersen shrugged the tale as it stands is substantially ac curate naturally i havent told you everything i know kelle smiled again rather more generously well lets see what the records have to tell us he spoke into the microphone confidential information authority of kagge kelle the nonhuman voice of the information bank responded confidential information ready the file on lugo teehalt he spelled out the name there was a series of subdued mutterings a quiet eerie whis tling the voice spoke once more reading off the information it had gathered lugo teehalt his file contents application for admission verification and appended comment april pass said kelle application for admission to advanced regimen verification and appended comment july pass thesis for degree in college of symbology title the mean ingful elements in the eye motion of the tunkers of mizar six december pass application for post as associate instructor verification and comment march discharge of lugo teehalt associate instructor for conduct prejudicial to morale of student corpus october pass contract between lugo teehalt and department of galactic morphology january the demon princes gersen exhaled a small sigh at the relaxation of tension of whose existence he had barely been aware it was definite lugo teehalt had been employed as locater by someone within the department quote in resume kelle ordered lugo teehalt and department of galactic morphology agree and covenant to the following department will furnish teehalt a suitable space vessel provisioned equipped found in typical and useful manner in order that teehalt shall conduct as agent of de partment assiduous exploration of certain areas of galaxy depart ment advances teehalt sum of five thousand svu and guarantees a bonus of graduated values for degrees of successful exploration teehalt agrees to devote best efforts to successful pursuit of explo ration to preserve results of said exploration secure and secret from all persons groups and agencies other than those authorized by department signatures lugo teehalt for lugo teehalt ominah bazerman for department no further information mmf said kagge kelle he spoke to the screen ominah bazerman a click a voice spoke ominah bazerman chief clerk kelle speaking two years ago a certain lugo teehalt was despatched as a locater you signed his contract do you remember the circumstances there was a moments silence no mr kelle i cant say that i do the contract probably came to me in a set of other papers you dont remember who would have initiated this contract who sponsored this particular exploration no sir it must have been either yourself or mr detteras or perhaps mr warweave no one else would order out such an ex ploration i see thank you kelle turned to gersen his eyes mild almost bovine and there you have it if it wasnt warweave it must be detteras as a matter of fact detteras is former dean of the college of symbology perhaps he and teehalt were acquain i tances rundle detteras director of exploration seemed a man com pletely at his ease at peace with himself his job the world at large when gersen entered his office detteras held up his hand in easy the star king salute he was a large man surprisingly ugly for this age when a pointed nose or an overloose mouth could be repaired in a matter of hours he had made no attempt to camouflage his ugliness in deed it seemed as if his rather harsh bluegreen skin dye almost the color of verdigris accentuated the coarseness of his features the rather gauche brusqueness of his motions his head was the shape of a gourd the heavy chin rested on his breast with no per ceptible intervention of neck the hair was a bristle dyed the color of wet moss from knee to shoulder he seemed of uniform thick ness with a torso like a log he wore the quasimilitary uniform of a baron of the order of archangels black boots loose scarlet breeches and a splendid blouse striped green blue and scarlet with gold epaulettes and filigreed breast plates rundle detteras was of sufficient presence to command both the uniform and his odd phys iognomy a man with the slightest dubiety or selfconsciousness would instantly have seemed eccentric well well mr gersen said detteras is it too early for a taste of arrack im out of bed detteras stared in brief puzzlement then laughed heartily ex cellent this is when i usually hoist the hospitality flag tint tang or white white please detteras poured from the tall slender flask he raised his glass detteras au pouvoir and drank with gusto first of the day like a visit home to mother he poured himself a second tot settled back turned upon gersen a glance of leisurely appraisal gersen asked himself which one warweave kelle detteras one of these exteriors hid the ferocious soul of attel malagate the woe warweave kelle detteras gersen had inclined toward war weave now he was once more dubious detteras had undeniable force a rude harshtextured energy almost palpable detteras apparently felt no urgency about coming to grips with gersens business for all the reputed press of his affairs it was not unlikely that he and warweave had been in communication and possibly kelle likewise a neverending puzzle said detteras rather pompously the modes of why and how men differ if detteras were in no hurry thought gersen neither was he no doubt youre right he said although i dont understand the immediate relevance the demon princes detteras laughed a heavy booming sound quite as it should be i would be surprised if you professed otherwise he held up his hand to forestall gersens response presumption on my part no hear me out you are a somber man a pragmatic man you carry a heavy load of secrets and dark resolves gersen sipped suspiciously at the arrack the verbal pyrotech nics might be intended as a distraction a device to diminish his wariness he concentrated on the arrack senses keen for the faintest off flavor detteras had poured both drinks from the same flask he had offered gersen a choice of three distillations he had taken up glasses without seeming calculation there existed none theless enormous scope for ruse which no normal vigilance could prevent the drink was innocent so gersens tongue and nasal passages trained on sarkovy assured him he focused his attention upon detteras and the previous remark your opinions regarding me are exaggerated detteras grinned a great gaplipped grimace but nevertheless essentially accurate possibly detteras nodded complacently as if gersen had given him the most emphatic of corroborations it is a skill or habit of obser vation born of long years of study i formerly specialized in sym bology until i decided that id cropped the pasture as short as my teeth were long and as far as my tether would reach so here i am in galactic morphology a less complicated field descriptive rather than analytic objective rather than humanistic still i occasionally find application for my previous field now is a case in point you come into my office an utter stranger i assess your overt symbolic presentation skin color shape condition color of your hair fea tures clothes your general style you will say this is common prac tice i reply true everyone eats but a skilled taster is rare i read these symbols with minute exactitude and they provide me with information about your personality i on the other hand deny sim ilar knowledge to you how i bedizen myself with random and contradictory symbols i am in constant camouflage behind which the real rundle detteras watches as calm and cool as an impresario at the hundredth performance of a glittering carnival extravaganza gersen smiled my nature might be as flamboyant as your symbols and i might dissemble it for reasons similar to your own whatever they are a second point your presentation if it can be the star king believed illuminated you almost as clearly as the set of your natural symbols third why bother in the first place detteras seemed much amused aha you show me for the fraud and charlatan i am still i cannot avoid the conviction that your symbols tell me more about you than mine do about me gersen leaned back in his seat to little practical effect not so fast exclaimed detteras you occupy yourself exclu sively with positivity consider negativity for a moment some peo ple fret regarding the cryptic mannerisms of their colleagues you protest that the symbols tell you nothing of importance you dismiss them these others worry because they cannot integrate a prolif eration of information gersen started to demur detteras held up his hand consider the tunkers ofmizar six you are acquainted with them a religious sect i heard them mentioned a few minutes ago as i say detteras continued they are a religious group ascetic austere devout to an astonishing extreme the men and women dress identically shave their heads usea language of eight hundred and twelve words eat identical meals at identical hours all this to protect themselves from the perplexity of wondering about each others motivations true this is the basic purpose of the tunker mode and not too far from mizar is sirene where for a similar reason men wear highly conventionalized masks from birth to death their faces are their dearest secrets he proffered the arrack flask gersen held out his glass detteras continued the practice here on alphanor is more complicated we gird ourselves for offense and defense or sheer playfulness with a thousand ambiguous symbols the business of living is enormously complicated artificial tensions are established uncertainty and suspicion become normality and in the process suggested gersen sensitivities are de veloped unknown to either the tunkers or the sirenese detteras held up his hand again not so fast i know a great deal about both these peoples insensitivity is a word which cannot be applied to either the sirenese will detect the most remote nu ance of uneasiness when a man masks himself above his status and the tunkers i know less of them but i believe that their personal differentiations are as refined and varied as our own if not more so i quote an analogous esthetic doctrine the tighter the discipline of an art form the more subjective the criteria of taste in another thf demon princes category becoming ever more didactic consider the star kings nonmen driven by their psyches to literally superhuman excellences they must enter the field cold as it were without even the human racial unconscious as a matrix for their symbolic education re turning to alphanor it must be remembered that the folk thrust an enormous amount of perfectly valid information at each other as well as ambiguities confusing said gersen dryly if one allows himself to be distracted detteras laughed quietly evidently well pleased with himself youve led a different life than i have mr gersen on alphanor the issues arent life and death everyone is fairly sophisticated its easier than not to accept people at their own valuation indeed its often impractical not to do so he looked sidelong at gersen why do you smile it dawns upon me that the dossier on kirth gersen requested from the ipcc is slow in arriving in the meantime you find it impractical to accept me at my own valuation or even your own detteras laughed in his turn you do both me and the ipcc an injustice the dossier came promptly several minutes before your arrival he pointed to a photostat sheet on his desk i or dered the dossier incidentally in my role as a responsible officer of the institution i think i can make a case for my caution what did you learn asked gersen i havent seen the dos sier recently its marvelously blank he picked up the paper you were born in where not on one of the major worlds at the age of ten you registered into galileo spaceport on earth in the com pany of your grandfather whose antecedents perhaps we should likewise check you attended the usual schools were accepted by the institute as a catechumen reached the eleventh phase at the age of twentyfour when you withdrew from now on there is no record suggesting that either you re mained permanently on earth or departed illegally without reg istration since you now sit before me the latter seems to have been the case remarkable said detteras that a person could live to your age in a society as complex as the oikumene with no small impingement upon the official record long years of silence while you were occupied where how to what purpose and to what effect he glanced questioningly at gersen the star king if its not there said gersen i dont want it there naturally there is very little more he tossed down the dos sier now you are anxious to make your inquiries i will anticipate you i knew lugo teehalt far back indeed in my undergraduate days he involved himself in some sort of unsavory mess and dropped from sight a year or so ago he came to me asking for a locators contract gersen stared at him fascinated so here was malagate and you sent him out i chose not to do so i did not want him dependent upon me for the rest of his life i was willing to help him but not on a personal basis i told him to apply either to the honorary provost gyle warweave or the chairman of the research planning com mittee kagge kelle to mention my name that very likely they could assist him this was the last i heard of him gersen took a deep breath detteras spoke with the assurance of truth but which of them had not detteras at least had con firmed that one of the three either himself warweave or kelle was lying which today he had seen artel malagate looked into his eyes listened to his voice he was suddenly uneasy wtly was deterras so relaxed presumably a busy man how could he spare so much time gersen abruptly sat up in his chair i will get to the point of my call upon you he told the story he had already related to war weave and kelle while detteras listened with a faint smile playing over his coarse mouth gersen displayed the photographs and det teras looked at them negligently a beautiful world said detteras if i were wealthy i would ask you to sell it to me to be my personal estate i am not wealthy on the contrary in any event you seem not so much anxious to sell your rights to this world as you do to locate poor old teehalts sponsor gersen was somewhat taken aback ill sell to the sponsor for a reasonable price detteras smiled skeptically sorry i cant admit to a falsehood warweave or kelle is your man they deny it strange so then the demon princes the filament is useless to me in its present condition will you furnish me the decoding strip im afraid thats out of the question i thought as much so i must sell to one or the other of you or to the university or destroy the filament hm detteras judiciously nodded his head this demands careful thought if your demands were not excessive id be inter ested or perhaps the three of us in concert could come to some agreement with you hm let me speak to warweave and kelle and then if you can come back tomorrow say at ten i might have a definite proposition to put before you gersen rose to his feet very well tomorrow at ten yes we are a reactionary secretive pessimistic organiza tion we have agents everywhere we know a thousand tricks to discourage research sabotage experiments distort data even in the institutes own laboratories we proceed with deliberation and discretion but now let me answer some of the questions and ac cusations we often jiear do the members of the institute enjoy wealth privilege power freedom from the law hon esty compels the answer yes in varying degree depending upon phase achievement then the institute is an inbred restricted centripetal group by no means we consider ourselves an intellectual elite certainly why should we not membership is open to anyone although few of our catechumens achieve even so far as the fifth phase our policy simple enough space drive has given a terrible weapon to any megalomaniacs who happen to occur in our midst there is other knowledge which if equally free could ensure them tyrannical power we therefore control the dissemination of knowledge we are scathed as selfanointed divinities we are ac cused of pedantry conspiracy condescension smugness ar rogance obstinate selfrighteousness these are the mildest of the objurgations we hear we are accused of intolerable paternalism and in the same breath reproached for disen gagement from ordinary human affairs vhy do we not use our lore to lighten toil alleviate pain prolong life wtiy do thp demon princes we stand aloof why do we not transform the human estate into a utopia a task well within our power tk the answer is simple perhaps deceptively so we feel these are false boons that peace and satiety are akin to death for all its rawness and cruel excess we envy archaic humanity its ardent experience we hold that gain after toil triumph after adversity achievement to a goal long sought is a greater beneficence than prebendary nutrient from the teat of an indulgent government from the television address by madian carbuke centennial of the institute december conversation between two centennials of the institute in connection with a third not present i would gladly come to your house for a chat if i did not suspect that ramus were likewise invited but what is so wrong with ramus he often amuses me he is a fungus a flatulence a pompous old toad and he irritates me vastly question occasionally put to fellows of the institute are star kings included among the fellowship the customary answer we certainly hope not motto of the institute a little knowledge if a dangerous thing a great deal of knowledge is disaster which detractors of the institute scornfully paraphrase to somebody elses ig norame is hlivs pallis atwrode lived with two other girls in a seaside apartment tower to the south of remo gersen waited in the lobby while she ran up to change clothes and retint her skin he went out on the deck overlooking the ocean leaned against the rail great blazing rigel hung low over the ocean laying a molten road from shore to horizon near at hand in the harbor enclosed by twin piers a hundred boats were moored power yachts sailing catamarans glasshulled submarines a shoal of jetpowered the star ki g aquaplanes to be ridden at maniacal speed over through and across the waves gersens mood was complex and puzzled even himself there was the heartbumping anticipation of an evening with a pretty girl a sensation he had not known for years there was the melancholy normally induced by sunset and now the sunset was beautiful in deed the sky glowed mauve and greenblue around a green bank of persimmonorange clouds stranded with magenta it was not the beauty which brought on melancholy mused gersen but rather the quiet halcyon light and its fading and there was another melancholy different yet somehow similar which came to ger sen as he watched the debonair folk about him they were all graceful and easy untouched by the toil and pain and terror that existed on remote worlds gersen envied them their detachment their social skills still would he change places with any of them hardly pallis atwrode came to om him by the rail she had tinted herself a beautiful soft olivegreen with a subtle patina of gold she now wore her hair in a loose dark curly cap she laughed at ger sens obvious approval i feel like a wharf rat said gersen i should have changed into new clothes please dont worry she said its completely unimportant now what shall we do youll have to make suggestions very we lets go into avente and sit on the esplanade i never tire of watching people walk past then we can decide whats next gersen acceded they walked to the slide car and drove north paths chattering with ingenuous candor about herself her job her opinions plans and hopes she was so gersen learned a native of singhal island on the planet ys her parents were prosperous owning the only coldstorage warehouse of the lantango peninsula wtien they retired to the palmetto islands her oldest brother took control of the warehouse and likewise the family home the brother next older had wished to marry her this form of union being coun tenanced on ys which had been settled originally by a group of reformed rationalists the brother was stout redfaced arrogant without a trade other than driving the warehouse van and the pros pect held no charm for pallis the dfmon princes at this point pallis hesitated and her candor seemed to slip gears for she changed the subject gersen guessed at the dramatic confrontations fierce reproaches and countering accusations which had taken place pallis had now lived in avente for two years and though sometimes homesick for the sights and sounds of ys she felt herself happy and lucky gersen who had never known anyone so artless was charmed by her talk they parked the slider walked out along the esplanade selected a table in front of one of the numerous cafes and sat watching the crowds stroll by beyond spread the dark ocean with the sky now plum and indigogray with only the faintest tinge of lemon to mark the passage of rigel the night was warm folk from all the worlds of the oikumene sauntered past the waiter brought goblets of punch gersen sipped and his tensions began to relax neither spoke for a period then pallis suddenly turned to face him youre so silent so guarded is it because youre in from beyond gersen had no ready reply finally he gave a rueful laugh i hoped youd think me easy and suave like everyone else oh come now said pallis teasingly nobodys like everyone else im not altogether sure said gersen i suppose its a matter of relativity how near you are even bacteria have individuality if theyre examined closely enough so now im a bacterium said pallis well im another and im probably boring you no no of course not im enjoying myself so am i too much its enervating pallis scented a compliment how do you mean i cant allow myself the luxury of emotional commitments even if i should like to youre much much much too sober for a young man im not young anymore she made a gay gesture but you admit youre sober i suppose so but be careful dont push me too far a woman likes to think herself a temptress again gersen had no response he studied pallis across the table for the moment she seemed content to watch the passersby what a gay warmhearted creature he thought without a trace of malice or acerbity the star king pallis turned her attention back to him youre really such a quiet man she told him everyone else i know refuses to stop talking and i listen to continual floods of nonsense im sure you know hundreds of interesting things and you refuse to tell me any of them gersen grinned theyre probably less interesting than you think still id like to make sure so tell me about the beyond is life really so dangerous sometimes yes sometimes no it depends on whom you meet and why but perhaps youd rather i didnt ask what do you do youre not a pirate or a slaver do i look like a pirate or a slaver you know that i dont know what a pirate or a slaver look like but im curious are you a well criminal not that its nec essarily a disgrace she added hastily affairs which are perfectly acceptable on one planet are absolutely tabooon another for in stance i told one of my friends that all my life id planned to marry my oldest brother and her hair uncurled im sorry to disappoint you said gersen but im not a crim inal i dont fit into any category he considered there could be no indiscretion in telling her what he had told warweave kelle and detteras ive come to avente for a particular purpose natu rally lets have dinner said pallis and you can tell me while we eat where shall we go theres an exciting new restaurant only just opened every ones talking about it and ive never been there she jumped to her feet took his hand with an easy intimacy pulled him upright he caught her under the arms bent forward but his daring waned he laughed and released her she said archly youre more impul sive than you look gersen grinned half shamefacedly well where is the exciting new restaurant not far we can walk its rather expensive but i plan to pay half the account thats not necessary said gersen money is no particular ti if demon princes problem to a pirate if i run short ill rob someone you per haps its hardly worth the trouble come along then she took his hand and they walked north along the esplanade like any of the thousand other couples abroad this fine alphanor evening she led him to a kiosk circled by large luminous green letters reading nautilus an escalator dropped them two hundred feet into a tall octagonal lobby paneled with rattan screens a major domo escorted them along a glassvaulted tunnel out upon the floor of the sea dining rooms of various sizes opened off the pas sage into one of which they were conducted and seated at a table close beside the sloping glass dome the sea lay beyond with bea cons illuminating the sand rocks seaweed coral the passing sub marine creatures now said pallis leaning forward tell me about the beyond and dont worry about alarming me because i love an occasional shudder or better tell me about yourself smades tavern on smades planet is a good place to start said gersen youve been there of course not but ive heard it mentioned its a small barely habitable planet out in the middle of no where all mountains wind thunderstorms an ocean black as ink the tavern is the only building on the planet sometimes its crowded sometimes therell be no one but smade and his family for weeks on end when i arrived the only other guest was a star king a star king i thought they were always disguised as men its not a matter of disguise said gersen they are men almost t never have understood about the star kings just what are they gersen shrugged youll get a different answer every time you ask the general speculation goes like this a million years ago more or less the planet lambda grus iii or ghnarumen you have to cough through your nose to get it even approximately right was inhabited by a rather frightening assortment of crea tures among them was a small amphibious biped without any particular tools for survival except awareness and an ability to hide in the mud he probably looked a little like a lizard or a hairless seal the species faced extinction half a dozen times but a few the star king always managed to hang on and somehow scavenge an existence among creatures who were more savage more cunning more agile better swimmers better climbers even better scavengers than themselves the protostar kings had only physical advantages selfconsciousness competitiveness a desire to stay alive by any means whatever they sound rather like the protohumans on ancient earth said pallis no one knows for sure at least no men what the star kings know theyre not telling these bipeds differed from protoman in several respects first they are biologically much more flexible able to transmit acquired characteristics second they are not bi sexual there is crossfertilization by means of spores emitted on the breath but each individual is male and female at once and the young develop as pods in the armpits perhaps from this lack of sexual differentiation the star kings have no natural physical vanity their basic drive is the urge to outdo to outfunction to outsurvive the biological flexibility coupled to a rudimentary intelligence pro vided the means to implement their ambitions they consciously began to breed themselves into a creature which could outperform their less resourceful competitors this is all speculation of course and what follows is specu lation on an even more tenuous basis but just lets assume that some race able to traverse space visited earth it might have been the people which left ruins on the fomalhaut planets or the hex adelts or whoever carved monument cliff on xi puppis x we assume that such a spacetraveling people came by earth a hundred thousand years ago assume that they captured a tribe of mousterian neanderthals and for some reason conveyed them to ghnarumen world of the protostar kings here is a challeng ing situation for both parties the men are far more dangerous opponents to the star kings than the nowdefeated natural ene mies the men are intelligent patient crafty ruthless aggressive under pressure of the environment the men themselves evolve into a different type more agile faster of body and mind than their neanderthal predecessors the protostar kings suffer setbacks but they have their hereditary patience as well as important weapons the competitive urge the biological flexibility men have proved superior to them the demon princes selves to compete with men they shape themselves into human semblance the war continues and the star kings admit very guardedly that certain of their myths describe these wars another assumption now becomes necessary about fifty thou sand years ago the space travelers return and convey the evolved earthmen back to earth and perhaps a few star kings who knows and so the cromagnons appear in europe on their own planet the star kings are at last more manlike than men and prevail the true men are destroyed the star kings are supreme and remain so until five hundred years ago the men of earth discover the intersplit when they chance upon ghna rumen they are astonished to find creatures exactly resembling themselves the star kings it sounds farfetched said pallis dubiously not as farfetched as convergent evolution it is a fact that star kings exist a race not antagonistic but not friendly either men are not allowed to visit ghnarumen or however the name is pronounced the star kings tell us only as much about them selves as they care to and they send observers spies if you like everywhere throughout the oikumene there are probably a dozen star kings in avente right now pallis grimaced how can you tell them from men sometimes even a doctor cant after they finish disguising and faking themselves there are differences of course they have no genital organs their pubic region is blank their protoplasm blood hormones have a different composition their breath has a distinc tive odor but the spies or whatever they are are altered so that even an xray shows the same as that of a man how did you know the the creature at smades tavern was a star king smade told me how did smade know gersen shook his head i never thought to ask he sat silent preoccupied with a new notion there had been three guests at smades tavern himself teehalt and the star king iftristano were to he believed and why not he had ar rived in company only with dasce and suthiro if uasces statement to teehalt were to be credited attel malagate must be reckoned the star king teehalts murderer gersen had certainly heard teehaks scream while suthiro dasce and tristano stood within his range of vision unless smade were malagate unless another ship had surrep titiously arrived which were both unlikely then malagate and the star king must be one thinking back gersen recalled that the star king had left the dining hall in ample time to allow a conference outside with dasce pallis atwrode lightly touched his cheek you were telling me of smades tavern yes said gersen so i was he looked at her speculatively she must certainly know a great deal about the comings and goings of warweave kelle and detteras pallis misunderstanding the na ture of his gaze flushed prettily under her palegreen skin toning gersen laughed uneasily back to smades tavern he described the events of the evening pallis listened with interest almost forgetting to eat so now you have lugo teehalts filament and the university has the de coder correct and neither one is valuable without the other they finished dinner gersen with no credit account on al phanor paid the bill in cash they returned to the surface now what would you like i dont care said pallis lets go back along the esplanade to a table for a while anyway the night was now dark the moonless blackvelvet night of alphanor the facade of every building at the back of the esplanade glowed faintly blue or green or pink the pavement gave off a silver effulgence the balustrade emitted a pleasant almost unseen amber beige radiance everywhere was soft shadowless light rich with muted ghost color up in the dark sky stars floated big vague pale a waiter brought coffee and liqueur they settled back to watch the passing crowds pallis said in a reflective voice youre not telling me every thing of course not said gersen in fact he paused grap pling with a disturbing new thought attel malagate might mistake the nature of his interest in pallis especially if malagate were a star king sexless unable to understand the malefemale relation ship in fact said gersen in a bleak voice i really have no right involving you in my troubles the demon princes i dont feel involved said pallis stretching her arms lazily and if i were what of it this is avente on alphanor a civilized city on a civilized planet gersen gave a sardonic chuckle i told you that others were interested in my planet well these others are pirates and slavers as depraved as your romantic heart could desire have you ever heard ofattel malagate malagate the woe yes gersen resisted the temptation of telling her that she took mes sages and ran errands daily for malagate its almost certain he said that sticktights are watching us now this very minute and the other end of the circuit is possibly malagate himself pallis moved uneasily scanned the sky do you mean that malagate is watching me thats a creepy feeling gersen looked to right to left then stared two tables away sat suthiro the sarkoy venefice gersen felt a sinking at the pit of his stomach meeting gersens eye suthiro nodded politely smiled he rose to his feet sauntered to the table good evening mr gersen good evening said gersen may i join you id prefer not suthiro laughed softly seated himself inclined his fox face to ward pallis and this young lady do you plan to introduce me you already know who she is but she does not know me gersen turned to pallis here you see scop suthiro master venence of sarkovy you expressed an interest in evil men here you have as completely evil a man as youre likely to meet suthiro laughed in easy glee mr gersen judiciously uses the word likely certain of my friends surpass me as grandly as i sur pass you i hope indeed that you do not meet them hildemar dasce for instance who boasts of his ability to paralyze dogs with a glance pallis voice was troubled id just as soon not meet him she stared at suthiro in fascination you really admit that youre evil suthiro laughed once more a subtle muffled sound i am a man i am a sarkoy gersen said ive just been describing our encounter at the star king smades tavern to miss atwrode tell me something who killed lugo teehalt suthiro seemed surprised who else but malagate we three sat within does it make any difference it might as easily have been myself or beauty or tristano tristano by the way is quite ill he suffered a dreadful accident but hopes to see you on his recovery he can consider himself lucky said gersen he is ashamed said suthiro he thinks himself skillful i have told him he is not so skillful as i now perhaps he will believe it speaking of skill said gersen can you do the paper trick suthiro cocked his head sidewise yes of course where did you learn of the paper trick at kalvaing and what wrought you at kalvaing a visit with coudirou the venefice suthiro pursed his heavy red lips he wore a yellow skin tone his brown pelt was glossy and smooth with oil coudirou is as wise as any but as for the paper trick gersen handed him a nap kin suthiro suspended it from left thumb and forefinger stroked it lightly with his right hand it fell to the table in five ribbons well done said gersen and to pallis his fingernails are hardened sharp as razors naturally he would waste no poison on the paper but each of his fingers is like the head of a serpent suthiro made complacent acquiescence gersen turned back to him wtiere is your friend fancy dasce not too far distant red face and all suthiro shook his head sadly at dasces poor taste in skin ton ing a very able a very strange man have you ever wondered about his face wtien i could bear to look at it you are not my friend you tricked me beautifully neverthe less i will warn you never cross fancy dasce twenty years ago he was thwarted in some small escapade it was a matter of col lecting money from an obstinate man hildemar by chance found himself at a disadvantage he was knocked down and strapped hand and foot so his creditor had the poor taste to cleave poor hilde the demon princes mars nose and cut off his eyelids hildemar eventually escaped and now is known as beauty dasce or fancy dasce how awful muttered pallis exactly suthiros voice became contemptuous a year later hildemar allowed himself the luxury of capturing this man he conveyed him to a private place where he lives to this day and occasionally hildemar remembering the outrage which cost him his features returns to this private place to remonstrate with the man pallis turned glazed eyes at gersen these people are your friends no we are associated only through lugo teehalt suthiro was looking along the esplanade gersen asked idly you and dasce and tristano work together and train together as a team often though i for one prefer a singular scope and lugo teehalt had the misfortune to blunder upon you at brinktown he died quickly godogma takes all men is this misfortune one never likes to hasten godogma true suthiro inspected his strong agile hands agreed he looked toward pallis on sarkovy we have a thousand popular aphorisms to this effect who is godogma the great god of destiny who carries a flower and a flail and walks on wheels gersen put on an air of studious concentration i will ask you a question you need not answer in fact perhaps you do not know but i am puzzled why should malagate a star king so vehe mently desire this particular world suthiro shrugged that is a matter with which i have never concerned myself apparently the world is valuable i am paid i kill only when i must or when it profits me so you see he told pallis parenthetically i am not really so evil a man am i now presently i will return to sarkovy and live out my days roaming the goro bundur steppe ah now there is the life when i think of those times to come wonder why i sit here now beside this odious wetness he grimaced toward the sea and rose to his feet it is a presumption to advise you but why not be sensible you can never defeat malagate therefore relinquish the filament gersen thought for a moment then said i will also presume the star king in the same spirit which prompts you my advice is this kill hil demar dasce the next moment you see him or even before suthiro knit his furry brown eyebrows in puzzlement glanced for the most fleeting instant upward gersen continued there is a sticktight watching us although i have not located it its microphone probably registers our con versation until you told me i had no idea that the star king at smades tavern was malagate i am interested i do not think this is common knowledge quiet hissed suthiro eyes blazing with sudden red wrath gersen lowered his voice hildemar dasce quite possibly will be asked to punish you if you wish to forestall godogma if you wish to take your wagon across gorobundur steppe kill dasce and go suthiro hissed something below his breath jerked up his hand as if to throw then backed away turned melted into the crowd pallis relaxed slumped into her chair in an uncertain voice she said im not as adventurous as i supposed myself im sorry said gersen genuinely contrite i should never have asked you out no no i just cant accustom myself to that kind of talk here on the esplanade in peaceful avente but i suppose im actually enjoying it if youre not a criminal who or what are you kirth gersen you must work for the ipcc no then you must be on the institutes special committee im just kirth gersen private individual he rose to his feet lets walk for a bit they went north along the esplanade to the left lay dark sea to the right the edifices glowing in various soft colors and beyond the skyline of avente luminous spires against the black alphanor night pallis presently took gersens arm tell me what if malagate is a star king what does that mean ive been wondering myself indeed gersen had been trying to remember the look of the star king had it been warweave kelle or detteras the lusterless black skin tone had blurred the features the striped coif had covered the hair gersen had an im pression that the star king had been taller than kelle but not quite tiif demon princes so tall as warweave but would even the black skin tone have cam ouflaged detteras rude rough features pallis was speaking will they really kill that man gersen glanced up to see if he could locate the sticktight with out success i dont know hes useful incidentally gersen hesitated wondering anew as to the ethics of involving pallis in the sordid affair if only remotely incidentally what nothing for fear of the stickrights microphone gersen dare not inquire as to the movements ofkelle detteras and war weave malagate so far had no reason to suspect his interest pallis said in an injured voice i still dont understand how all of this affects you once more gersen chose to be discreet the sticktight might hear pallis atwrode herself might be an agent of malagates though gersen considered this unlikely so he said not at all except in the abstract but any of these people she nodded at the passersby they might be star kings how could we separate them from men its hard on their home planet i wont attempt to pro nounce it they come in many approximations to man those who travel the known worlds as observers spies if you prefer although i cant imagine what they hope to learn theyre almost exact fac similes of true men pallis suddenly seemed subdued she opened her mouth to speak then closed it again and finally gave a gay fling other hands lets forget about them nightmares you have me seeing star kings everywhere even at the university gersen looked down into her upturned face do you know what id like to do she smiled provocatively no what first id like to shake off the sticktight which is no great problem and then and then id like to go somewhere quiet where we could be alone she looked away i dont mind theres a place down the coast les sirenes its called ive never been there she laughed in em barrassment but ive heard people talking gersen took her arm first to shake off the sticktight pallis entered into the maneuvers with childlike abandon the star king looking into the merry face gersen wondered about his resolve to avoid emotional involvements if they went to les sirenes if the night brought them to closer intimacy what then gersen thrust aside his qualms he could cope with problems as they arose the sticktight if it had existed was confounded and lost they returned to the parking area there was little light the ranked round shapes glimmered with silky dull highlights they came to the slide car gersen hesitated then put his arms around the swaying girl kissed her upturned face behind him was the loom of movement ahead a furtive shifting gersen turned in time to look into a horrid bloodred face with poisonous blue cheeks hildemar dasces arm descended a great weight curled over gersens head lightning exploded inside his skull he tottered and fell to his knees dasce leaned over him gersen tried to dodge the world reeled and toppled he saw su thiro grinning like a sick hyena with his hand to the girls neck dasce struck again and the world went dim gersen had time for an instant of bitter selfreproach before another thunderous buffet extinguished his consciousness excerpt from when is a man not a man by podd hachinsky article in cosmopolis june as men have traveled from star to star they have encountered many forms of life intelligent and nonintelli gent to emphasize a perfectly arbitrary and possibly an thropomorphic parameter no more than half a dozen of these life forms merit the adjective humanoid of these half dozen a single species closely resembles man the star kings of ghnarumen ever since our initial astounded contact with the race the question has recurred are they of the family of man the bifurcate bibrachiate monocephaloid polygamtte as tallier chantron waggishly puts it or are they not the answer of course depends on definitions one point can instantly be settled the star kings are not homo sapiens but if what is meant is a creature which can talk a human language walk into a haberdashery and dress himself off a rack play an excellent game of tennis or fight a bout of chess attend the regal functions of stock holm or the lawn fetes of strylvania without occasioning a lift of autocratic eyebrow then that creature is a man man or not man the typical star king is a courteous eventempered fellow even if suspicious and humorless do him a favor and he will thank you but feel no obligation injure him and he will explode in tigerish fury and kill you if he is in a situation where human law cannot restrain him if such action will cause legal trouble he will instantly the star king dismiss the injury and hold no grudge he is ruthless but not cruel and is puzzled by such perverse human manifes tations as sadism masochism religious fervor flagellation suicide on the other hand he will demonstrate a whole battery of peculiar habits and attitudes no less inexplicable from our point of view arising from the twists and quirks of his own psyche to say that his origin is in dispute is like a remark to the effect that croesus was well off at least a dozen the ories to explain the remarkable similarity between star king and man exist none completely convincing if the star kings themselves know they will admit nothing since they bar all anthropological and archaeological research teams from their planet we are afforded neither verification nor refutal of any of these theories on human planets they punctiliously model their con duct after the best human examples but their innate be havior patterns are unique to the race perhaps to oversimplify one can say that their dominant trait is a pas sion to excel to outdo a competitor at his own game since man is the dominant creature of the oikumene the star kings accept him as a cynosure a champion to be chal lenged and outdone and so they strive to outdo man in every aspect of the human capacity if this ambition at which they are often successful seems unreal and artificial to us no less so does our sexual drive seem to them for the star kings are parthenogenetic reproducing in a man ner which is beyond the scope of this article to describe knowing nothing of vanity setting no store by either beauty or ugliness they strive for physical perfection only to score points in their semiamicable contest with true men what of their achievements they are fine builders daring engineers excellent technicians they are a prag matic race not particularly apt at mathematics or the spec ulative sciences it is hard to conceive of their giving birth to a jarnell who discovered the space splitter by sheer ac cident their cities are impressive sights rising from the flatlands like a growth of metallic crystals each adult star king builds for himself a spire or tower the more fervent the demon princes his ambition and the more exalted his rank the higher and more splendid his tower which he seems to enjoy only as a monument upon his demise the tower may be tempo rarily occupied by some junior individual during the period in which he accumulates sufficient wealth to build his own tower inspirational as the cities seem from a distance they lack the most obvious municipal utilities and the areas be tween the towers are unpaved dusty littered factories in dustrial plants and the like are housed in low utilitarian domes and manned by the least aggressive and least evolved of the species for the race is by no means homogeneous it is as if every human gathering included proconsuls pithecanthropi sinanthropus giganticus neanderthals mag dalentans solutreans grimaldi cromagnon and all the races of modern man at midnight a group of young folk came laughing and singing into the parking area they had dined with unaccustomed amplitude at the halls they had visited llanfelfair lost star inn haluce the casino plageale they were intoxicated but as much by exuberance as by the wines smokes perfusions subliminal whirligigs chants voltes and other exaltments purveyed by the houses which they had visited the youth who stumbled over gersens body uttered first a jocular malediction then an exclamation of shocked concern the group gathered one ran to his vehicle pressed the emergency call button two minutes later a police craft dropped down from the sky and shortly afterward an ambulance gersen was conveyed to a hospital where he was treated for concussion and shock with appropriate irradiation massage and vi talizing medicines he presently returned to consciousness and for a moment lay thinking then he gave a sudden lurch and tried to rise from the bed the attending interns cautioned him but ger sen paying no heed struggled erect and stood swaying my clothes he croaked give me my clothes theyre safe in the closet sir relax recline if you please here is the police officer who will take your evidence gersen lay back sick with apprehension the police investi gator approached a keenfaced young man wearing the yellow brown jacket and black breeches of the sea province constabulary the sjar king he addressed himself to gersen politely seated himself opened the flap of the recorder lens now sir what happened i was out for the evening with a young woman miss pallis atwrode of remo when we came back to the car i was slugged and i dont know what happened to miss atwrode the last thing i remember she was struggling to escape from one of the men there were how many two i recognized them their names are hildemar dasce and a man i know only as suthiro a sarkoy both are notorious men beyond i see the young ladys name and address pallis atwrode merioneth apartments remo well check at once to make sure she hasnt arrived home now mr gersen lets go over this again in a dull voice gersen gave a detailed account of the attack described hildemar dasce and suthiro as he spoke a report came in from constabulary control pallis atwrode had not returned to her apartment roads airways and space terminals were under ob servation the ipcc had been called into the case now sir said the investigator in a neutral voice may i in quire your business i am a locater what is the nature of your association with these two men none i saw them at work once before on smades planet apparently they regard me as an enemy i believe that they are part ofattel malagates organization very strange that they should commit an actionable offense so brazenly in fact why did they not kill you i dont know gersen once more staggered to his feet the investigator watched with professional attentiveness what are your plans mr gersen i want to find pallis atwrode understandable sir but best that you do not interfere the police are more effective than a single man we should have news for you at any time i dont think so said gersen by now theyre in space the investigator rising to his feet made tacit admission that such was the case we will naturally keep you informed he bowed departed the demon princes gersen immediately dressed with the disapproving help of an orderly his knees were weak his head floated in a kind of gener alized allembracing pain there was a faint singing in his ears from the drugs an elevator dropped him directly to a subway station gersen stood on an exchange platform straining to formulate a coherent plan of action a phrase kept repeating itself compulsively like an inchworm traversing the inner surface of his skull poor pallis poor pallis with no better plan in mind he stepped into a capsule and sent himself to a station under the esplanade he emerged but instead of going to the car took a seat in a brasserie and drank coffee by now shes in space he told himself once more and its my fault my fault because he should have foreseen this sort of outcome pallis atwrode knew warweave kelle and detteras well she saw them daily heard whatever gossip there was to be heard malagate the star king malagate the woe was one of three men and pallis atwrode evidently had knowledge which coupled to suthiros in discretions made malagates incognito insecure hence she must be removed killed sold into slavery taken by dasce for his per sonal use poor pallis poor pallis gersen looked out over the ocean a rim of lavender was form ing at the horizon presaging dawn the stars were fading ive got to face up to it gersen told himself its my re sponsibility if she is harmed but no ill kill hildemar dasce in any event suthiro treacherous foxfaced suthiro was already as good as dead and there was malagate himself the architect of the entire evil construction as a star king he somehow seemed less hateful a dire beast which might be expunged without emo tion surfeited with hate and grief and misery gersen went to the car in the now empty parking area there was the spot where dasce had stood there where he had lain unconscious what a wretched careless fool how the spirit of his grandfather must writhe in shame he started the car returned to his hotel there were no mes sages dawn had come to avente rigel threw wide horizontal fans of light between the distant catiline hills and a darkling bank of the star king clouds gersen set the alarm dial dosed himself with a twohour soporific threw himself down on the bed he awoke to gloom and depression even more intense than before time had passed whatever had been in store for pallis at wrode was now fact gersen ordered coffee he could not bring himself to eat he considered what he must do the ipcc he would be forced to tell everything he knew could the ipcc act more effi ciently if he laid his information before them he could tell them that he suspected an administrator of the sea province university to be one of the socalled demon princes what then the ipcc an elite police force with the vices and virtues characteristic of such an organization might or might not be trustworthy star kings had possibly infiltrated the group in that case malagate would certainly be warned and how could the information help rescue pallis at wrode hildemar dasce was the kidnaper gersen had reported this and no information could be more explicit another possibility the exchange of teehalts world for pallis atwrode gersen would gladly accept the trade but whom to trade with he still could not identify malagate the ipcc no doubt would have means to detect him then what the exchange would no longer be conceivable there might be a quiet execu tion though the ipcc generally acted only upon the formal re quest of some authorized governmental agency and in the meantime what of pallis atwrode she would be lost a small de lightful spark of life extinguished forgotten but if gersen knew malagates identity he would have vastly more leverage he could make his offer with assurance the logic of the situation seemed to be that gersen proceed as before but how slow think of pallis poor pallis nevertheless hildemar dasce had gone beyond and no effort of gersen or of the ipcc could avail against this hard fact artel malagate alone had the power to order his return if pallis atwrode still lived the situation had not changed as before his first urgency was identify malagate then bargain or extort with his course of action once more clear gersens spirits lifted more accurately his resolve and dedication burned at a fer vent new heat hate gave him a heady almost drunken sense of omnipotence no one nothing could withstand emotion so in tense the demon princes the hour of his appointment with detteras warweave and kelle was approaching gersen dressed descended to the garage slid his car out upon the avenue and headed south arriving at the university he parked rode the slideway to the mall crossed the quadrangle to the college of galactic morphol ogy hoping against hope with a sudden quick jerking of the heart he looked toward the reception desk a different girl was on duty he asked politely where is miss atwrode this morning i dont know sir she hasnt arrived perhaps shes not feeling well perhaps indeed thought gersen he mentioned his appoint ment and proceeded to the office of rundle detteras warweave and kelle were there before him the three un doubtedly had reached a common decision a common course of action gersen looked from face to face detteras to warweave to kelle one of these creatures was human only in similitude at smades tavern he had glimpsed him and he tried to think back to visualize to remember no image came blackdyed skin and exotic costume were a disguise beyond his penetration furtively he assessed each which warweave aquiline coldeyed arrogant kelle precise humorless austere or detteras whose geniality now seemed insincere and counterfeit he could not decide he forced himself into a pose of studious courtesy and made his primary gambit lets simplify the whole matter said gersen ill pay you by this i naturally mean the college for the decoding strip i imagine the college could use a thousand svu in any event thats the offer i wish to make his adversaries each in his own style seemed taken aback warweave raised his brows kelle stared fixedly detteras put on a puzzled half smile warweave said but we understood that you intended to sell what you conceived to be your interest in this matter i dont mind selling said gersen if youll offer me enough and how much is enough a million svu perhaps two or perhaps three if youll go that high kelle snorted detteras shook his big ugly head fees of that sort are not paid to locaters said warweave the star king has it been established which of you sent out teehalt asked gersen what does it matter asked warweave your interest in the affair money has become clear enough he looked from kelle to detteras whoever it is has either forgotten or does not care to disclose himself doubtless that is the way the situation will re main detteras said its certainly inconsequential come now mr gersen we have decided to make you a joint offer certainly not as grandiose as the figure you name how much possibly as much as svu ridiculous this is an exceptional world you do not know this warweave pointed out you have not been there or so you claim more to the point said kelle dryly neither have we you have seen the photographs said gersen exactly said kelle we have seen no more photographs can be faked without difficulty i for one do not propose to pay out a large sum on the strength of three photographs understandable said gersen but for my part i dont intend to make a move without a guarantee dont forget i have suffered a loss and this is my opportunity to make it good be reasonable detteras urged bluffly without the decoder the filament is just another spool of wire not completely fourier analysis eventually can break the code in theory it is a long expensive process not as expensive as giving the filament away for next to noth in the discussion continued for an hour gersen gritting his teeth in impatience a price of svu to be deposited in escrow was eventually arranged the sale conditional upon a list of provisos relating to the physical characteristics of the world in question agreement having been reached telescreen contact with the bureau of deeds and contracts at avente was made the four men identified themselves formally represented their interests the con tract was read into the records a second call to the bank of alphanor established the escrow account the demon princes the three administrators now sat back and inspected gersen who in his turn looked from one to the other so much is settled which of you goes with me to inspect this world the three exchanged glances ill go said watweave ill be very much interested to go i was about to volunteer my own services said detteras in that case said kelle i might as well come along too im very much overdue for a change gersen seethed m frustration he had expected malagate whoever he might be to volunteer his services in fact to assert them gersen could then take this individual aside and offer a new set of conditions the filament for pallis atwrode wtiat after all was the world to him his single goal was malagates identity and after that his life but now this plan had gone by the boards if all three went out to teehalts planet the identification of malagate must depend upon new circumstances meanwhile the fate ofpalhs atwrode bore no thinking about gersen made a lastditch protest my boat is small for four better if only one went out with me no difficulty there detteras stated we will go out in the departmental ship plenty of room aboard another matter said gersen gruffly t have urgent business i must see to in the near future i am sorry to inconvenience you but i insist that we leave today there was vigorous and general protest all three declared themselves tied up for at least a week by engagements appoint ments and commitments gersen put on a show of temper gentlemen you have wasted enough of my time we leave today or ill take the filament else where or destroy it he watched the three faces hoping to sur prise malagate in dismay warweave gave him a glance of metallic dislike kelle examined him as if he were an insubordinate child detteras shook his head ruefully there was a moment of silence who would be the first to agree no matter how reluctantly to the conditions warweave said in a colorless voice i consider that you are taking a very arbitrary and highhanded position confound it grumbled detteras i cant simply ditch every thing m five minutes the tar ki g one of you should be able to tear yourself loose gersen suggested hopefully we can make a preliminary survey suffi cient so i can take my money and be off about mv business humph grunted detteras kelle said slowly i suppose that i would be able to go out warweave nodded my engagements with considerable in convenience can be postponed detteras threw his hands into the air turned to the screen called his secretary cancel all my appointments urgent business is taking me out of town for how long sir i dont know said detteras with a hard glance for gersen indefinitely gersen continued his inspection of the three men detteras alone had displayed irritation kelle obviously regarded the trip as an unexpected outing warweave maintained a cool detachment so much for that particular ploy thought gersen he went to stand by the door well meet at the spaceport agreed at let us say seven oclock i will bring the filament one of you must bring the decoding strip the three acquiesced and gersen departed returning to avente gersen pondered the future what chal lenges would he face from these three men one of whom was attel malagate it would be foolhardy not to make preparations to ar range safeguards this was the training imposed upon him by his grandfather a methodical man who had labored diligently to dis cipline gersens innate tendency to rely upon improvisation at the hotel gersen examined his belongings and made certain selections then packed and checked out after painstaking precau tions against sticktights and human trackers he went to a branch office of the amalgamated distribution service another of the monster semipublic utility companies with agencies throughout the oikumene in a booth he consulted catalogues which offered him a choice of a million products produced by thousands of fabricators making his choice he punched the requisite buttons went to the sen ice counter there was a wait of three minutes while automatic machinery ranged the shel es of the enormous underground warehouse then the mechanism gersen had ordered appeared on a belt he exam ined it paid the clerk departed and rode the subway to the space the demon princes port he inquired the location of the university ship from an attendant who took him out on a terrace and pointed down the long line of spacecraft large and small each in its bay notice sir the red and yellow yacht with side platform well count down three first the cd then the old parabola and then the green and blue ship with the big observation dome thats the job shes going out today eh yes about seven how did you know one of the crew is already aboard i had to let him on i see gersen went down to the field walked along the way which led past the ranked spacecraft from the shadow of the ship in the next bay he inspected the university ship the contours were distinctive as was the rather elaborate emblem at the bow recol lection stirred at the back of his mind somewhere before he had seen this ship where at smades planet on the landing field be tween mountains and black ocean it was the ship used by the star king the shape of a man passed in front of one of the observation windows when he moved out of sight gersen crossed the space between the two ships cautiously he tried the outer entry port it eased ajar he stepped into the transition chamber peered through the panel into the ships main saloon suthiro the sarkoy worked at an object which he apparently had attached to the underside of a shelf inside gersen something more ferocious than gladness a pe culiar exaltation of hate swelled and burst suffusing his enure body he tried the inner portal it was locked from within there was however an emergency disengagement which would unlock the door if pressure were equalized between cabin and outer atmo sphere gersen touched the emergency switch there was an au dible click within the ship all was silent not daring to glance through the panel gersen pressed his ear to the port useless no sound could pass through the laminated structure he waited a min ute then carefully eased himself up to look into the cabin once more suthiro had heard nothing he had gone forward and now appeared to be adjusting the padding around a stanchion his heavy flatskulled head was bent forward his lips were pursed out gersen slid back the port and stepped into the cabin a projac pointed at the big square buckle of suthiros stepperider harness the star kfng skop suthiro said gersen this is a pleasure for which i had not dared hope suthiros dogbrown eyes opened and shut he grinned broadly i was waiting for your arrival indeed and why i wanted to continue our discussion of last night we were speaking of godogma the longlegged walker with wheels on his feet plainly he has wheeled across the path of your life and you will never drive your wagon over the gorobundur suthiro became very still his eyes measuring gersen what happened to the girl asked gersen gently suthiro considered then rejected the feasibility of feigning in nocence she was taken by fancy dasce with your connivance where is she now suthiro shrugged he had orders to kill her why i dont know i am told very little dasce will not kill her not till he has the full use of her he is a khet suthiro sneered the epithet a metaphor linking dasce to the obscenely fecund sarkovy mink he has left alphanor certainly suthiro seemed surprised at gersens naivete probably for his little planet he made a fretful uncomfortable motion which brought him an imperceptible four inches closer to gersen where is this planet ha do you think he would tell me or anyone else in that case but i must ask you to stand back pah whispered suthiro in a childish display of petulance i can poison you any time i choose gersen allowed a faint smile to cross his lips i have already poisoned you suthiro raised his eyebrows when you have never closed with me last night i touched you when i handed you paper look at the back of your right hand suthiro stared in slow horror at the red weal cluthe gersen nodded cluthe but why should you do this to me you merit such an end suthiro launched himself like a leopard the projector in ger sens hand discharged a stalk of bluewhite energy suthiro fell to the demon princes the deck lay staring up at gersen better plasma than cluthe he whispered huskily youll die by cluthe said gersen suthiro shook his head not while i carry my poisons godogma calls you so now speak truth do you hate hilde mar dasce i hate dasce indeed suthiro seemed surprised as if there were anyone who did not hate dasce i would kill dasce most people would do no less where is his planet beyond i know no more when are you to see him next never i am dying and dasce is bound for a deeper hell than mine if you lived never i was to return to sarkovy who knows of this planet malagate perhaps is there no one else tristano no dasce tells little the world is airless suthiro carefully hunched himself together already the skin begins to itch listen suthiro you hate dasce yes and you hate me for i have poisoned you think you a sarkoy poisoned by me and so easily suthiro muttered i hate you indeed tell me how to find dasce then one of us must kill the other the death will be your doing suthiro rocked his furry head in desolation but i cannot tell you what i do not know what has he said of his world does he talk he boasts dasce is a vile braggart his world is harsh only a man like himself could master this world he lives in the crater of a dead volcano what of the sun suthiro hunched himself together it is dim yes it must be red they asked dasce about his face in a tavern why had he dyed himself red to match his sun said dasce which was the same color and not much larger a red dwarf mused gersen the star ki g so it might be think what else which direction which constellation which sector he says nothing and now i do not care i think only of godogma go away so that i may kill myself decently gersen surveyed the huddled form without emotion what are you doing here in the ship suthiro looked at his hand curiously then rubbed his chest i feel it moving he examined gersen well then since you would look on my death watch he put hands to his neck convulsed his knuckles the brown eyes stared in thirty seconds now who would know of dasces planet has he friends friends suthiro even in his last seconds took occasion to sneer where does he lodge in avente north of sailmaker beach in an old hut on melnoy heights who is malagate what is his name suthiro spoke in a whisper a star king has no name what name does he use on alphanor the thick lips opened and closed words rattled in the pale throat you killed me should dasce fail let malagate kill you the eyelids jerked quivered suthiro lay back seemed to stiffen made no further movement gersen looked down at the body he walked around behind it studied it the sarkoy were notoriously treacherous and revengeful with his toe he attempted to turn the body over on its face quick as the strike of a serpent the arm flashed around poison prongs ready gersen jerked back the projac ejected a second dazzling line of energy this time suthiro the sarkoy lay truly dead gersen searched the corpse in the pouch he found a sum of money wich he tucked into his own wallet there was a kit of poisons which gersen examined then unable to comprehend su thiros cryptic nomenclature discarded also a device no larger than his thumb intended to project crystalline needles of poison or virus on a jet of compressed air a man could be infected from a distance of fifty feet and know nothing save a faint tingle suthiro carried a projac similar to his own three stilettos a packet of fruit lozenges undoubtedly lethal gersen dropped the weapons back into suthiros pouch dragged the body to a waste ejection locker and crammed it away the demon princes out of sight once in space the touch of a button would dispose of sivij suthiro the sarkoy next he looked to discover what suthiro while alive had so earnestly been trying to achieve under the shelf he found a small toggle switch controlling a set of wires which led to a concealed relay which in turn activated the valves on four reservoirs of gas at various secret spots around the cabin death gas or anaesthetic he detached one of the reservoirs and found a label printed in the crabbed sarkoy syllabary tironviraskos instantaneous narcoleptic an odorless sleep inducent with minimal post redacts it seemed that malagate no less methodical than gersen was taking his own precautions gersen took each of the four reservoirs to the entry port re leased their contents replaced them where he had found them he left suthiros switch in place but changed its function this accomplished gersen brought out his own device the timer he had purchased at amalgamated and a grenade from his armament after a moments reflection he secured it inside the reactor housing where it would do maximum damage and yet be conven ient in case of need he glanced at his watch one oclock time was growing short far too short to accomplish all that must be done he departed locking the ship behind him and returning to the terminal took the subway for sailmaker beach at a stand beside the station gersen selected a selfservice cab a singleseat scooter gyroscopically balanced with a transparent canopy two svu in the slot gave him possession for an hour stepping aboard he drove north through the noisy streets of sail maker beach the district had a unique flavor avente a suave cosmopolitan city was almost indistinguishable from fifty other polities of the oikumene sailmaker beach resembled no other locale in the known universe the buildings were low thickwalled constructed for the most part of crushed coquina concrete white or color washed in the blazing light of rigel even pastels seemed intense for some reason lavender and pale blue along with white were the most popular tints the district was home to scores of offworld nationalities each forming an enclave each with its characteristic food shops restaurants specialty houses though widely disparate of origin habit and physiognomy the inhabitants of the district the star king were uniformly voluble half suspicious half naive contemptuous of outsiders equally contemptuous of each other they earned their living from tourists as domestic servants or day laborers as pro prietors of small shops and craft studios as entertainers or musi cians in the innumerable taverns bistros bordellos restaurants at the north rose melnoy heights and here the architecture changed to tall narrow apartment buildings of almost gothic elon gation each seeming to peer over the others shoulder across sail maker beach to the more conventional districts in melnoy heights hildemar dasce reputedly had lodgings as methodically as short ness of time and anxiety allowed gersen sought information re garding him there was no hildemar dasce listed in the melnoy heights directory nor had gersen expected to find one dasce undoubt edly would desire privacy the pose of normality gersen began to visit the taverns describing the tall man with the split nose the red skin the chalkblue cheeks he soon en countered folk who had noticed dasce but not until the fourth tavern did he find anyone who had spoken with him you must mean beauty said the bartender a stubby orange skinned man with russet hair arranged in fine glossy festoons and curls gersen stared in fascination at the chain carved from tur quoise which looped from a hole in his left nostril to a hole in the lobe of his left ear beauty comes in often to drink a spaceman he claims himself but as to this i cant be certain i have often declared myself a great lover all of us lie as much or more than necessary what is truth asks pons pilarus in the fable and i answer a commodity as cheap as air which we hide as if it were as precious as yewl stone the bartender was disposed to further philosophy gersen hauled him back to the issue at hand where does beauty dasce house himself up the hill up back the bartender made a vague gesture i can tell you no more because i know no more gersen rode his scooter up the steep lanes and switchbacks of melnoy heights inquiry at another tavern a tiresome series of questions at various shops lobbies and street corners finally re sulted in explicit directions to dasces lodgings riding a little un paved road which left the area of tall apartments gersen circled a steep rocky hillside where gangs of children scrambled like goats at the end of the road stood an isolated rectangular cottage rudely the demon princes if substantially constructed it commanded a magnificent view over the ocean over sailmaker beach the grand esplanade dwindling far to the south and only just perceptible through the haze the apartment towers of remo gersen approached the cottage with care though it exuded the indefinable but unmistakable feeling of vacancy he walked around peering through the windows seeing nothing of interest after a quick glance to right and left he broke in the sash of an incon spicuous window and cautiously in the event that dasce had set out mantraps climbed into the cottage the house was strong with the feel of dasces habitancy a faintly acrid odor together with an aura more subtle than odor of crudeness dark pompous magnificent strength there were four rooms encompassing the usual functions gersen made a quick general investigation then concentrated his attention upon the par lor the ceiling was scrolled plaster painted pale yellow the floor was covered by a carpet of greenishyellow fiber the walls were a checkerboard of maroon and dark brown hardwood tiles at the far end dasce had placed a desk and a heavy chair the wall over the desk was hung with dozens of photographs dasce in all poses against every variety of background there was dasce in startling closeup revealing every pore of his skin the split cartilage of his nose the lidless blue eyes there was dasce in the costume of a bernal flame fighter varnished black plates and horns and cusps and prongs like a titanic stag beetle there was dasce in a palanquin of yellow rattan hung with persimmon silk borne on the shoulders of six blackhaired maidens the angle of the wall displayed a set of photographs of a man who was not dasce apparently they had been taken over a period of years the first showed the face of a man thirty years old a sturdy confident bulldog face serene even complacent the face had changed alarmingly in the second of the photographs the cheeks were sunken the eyes started from their sockets the nerves at the temples showed in an intricate mesh in each succeeding photo graph the face became ever more haggard gersen glanced along a row of books pornography of a childishly obscene nature weapon manuals an index to sarkoy poisons a late edition of hand hook to the planets an index to dasces microbook library a star directory the desk itself was extremely handsome side panels of dark the star king wood carved to represent griffins and winged serpents in a jungle the surface an exquisite inlay of opals polished flat gersen checked the drawers and pigeonholes they were barren of information completely empty in fact gersen stood back a tide of grim despair rising within him he looked at his watch in four hours he must meet detteras warweave and kelle at the spaceport he stood in the center of the room carefully scrutinized every article some where must be a link with dasces secret planet how to recognize it he went to the bookshelf took down the star directory ex amined the lay of the binding if dasces red dwarf were listed he certainly must have located it in the directory if he had done so several times there might be a crease a smear a discoloration no such mark was visible gersen held the book by its two covers let it hang a third through the book the pages separated a hairbreadth gersen carefully opened the book at this spot looked down the listing each star and on this page there were two hundred was described under eleven headings index number constellation place ment as viewed from earth star type planetary information mass vector of velocity diameter density location coordinates distance from the center of the oikumene remarks twentythree red dwarfs were listed eight of these were dou ble eleven hung solitary in space forlorn feeble sparks four were accompanied by planets eight planets in all these four gersen scrutinized with especial care reluctantly he was forced to con clude that none of these planets could conceivably be considered habitable five of the planets were too hot one was completely awash in liquid methane two were too massive to allow human toleration of the gravity gersens mouth drooped in disappoint ment nothing still the page at one time had been earnestly con sulted there must be information here which dasce needed or valued gersen tore the page from the book the front door opened gersen whirled in the opening stood a middleaged man no larger than a boy often his head was round his eyes brimmed with curiosity flicking over gersen around the room he had large features long pointed ears a heavy protuberant mouth a highland imp from the highlands of krokinole one of the more specialized races of the concourse he came forward fearlessly swaggering who are you thats the demon princes in mr spocks house looking through mr spocks things a bur glar i think gersen replaced the book and the imp said thats one of his precious volumes that bit of stuff not likely he wants your fingers all over it id better go for the constable come back here said gersen who are you im the byyourleave caretaker thats who i am also this is my land and my house and my freehold mr spock is the man i let to and why should i give every burglar north of swansea leave to pillage and loot mr spock is a criminal said gersen and if he is its proof then that theres no honor among thieves im no thief said gersen mildly the ipcc is after your tenant mr spock the imp bent his big head forward be you ipcc show me your blazer on the assumption that a krokinole imp would not recognize an ipcc blazer when he saw one gersen displayed a transparent tablet with his photograph under a gold sevenpointed star he touched it to his forehead and it glowed into light a factitious dis play which impressed the imp he instantly became effusive in his cordiality never did think that mr spock was up to good hell come to a bad end mark my words whats he done now kidnap murder bad deeds both ill have to caution mr spock he is a wicked man how long has he lived here donkeys years you know him well then well indeed who drinks with him when everyone else turns their heads as if mr spock smelt poorly me i drink with him and frequently its no treat to look like mr spock and i have my compassion so youre spocks friend the big features twisted and moved in successive displays of tolerance crafty speculation virtuous indignation i certainly not do i look the sort who consorts with criminals but let us say you have heard spock talking the star king that i have and oh the tales he tells the imps eyes rolled ludicrously upward do i believe him no has he ever spoken of a secret world where he has a hide away again and again he calls it thumbnail gulch why he al ways shakes his head when hes asked a tightmouthed man mr spock for all his loose braggadocio what more has he said of his world the imp shrugged the suns bloodred hardly enough to keep him warm and where is this world aha thats where hes sly no word of this will he speak manys the time ive wondered thinking that suppose poor mr spock took sick on this lonesome world whod know to tell his friends gersen smiled grimly and this argument never induced him to confide in you never why do you wish to know hes kidnaped an innocent young woman and taken her to this world the rogue what a raffish creature the imp shook his head in distress from which a certain measure of wistful envy was not absent ill never let my land and house to him again think wtiat has spock said regarding the world the imp screwed up his eyes thumbnail gulch the world is bigger than the sun astonishing no if the sun is a red dwarf not too astonishing volcanos there are live volcanos on this world volcanos thats odd a red dwarfs planet shouldnt have volcanos its too old old or young the volcanos thrive mr spock lives in a dead crater and he sees a whole line of volcanos smoking up along the horizon what else nought how long does it take to get to his planet that i cant say youve never met any of his friends tosspots at the tavern no more but yes one less than a year ago an earthman a heavy cruel man the demon princes tristano i know nothing of his name mr spock had just returned from a business trip beyond to a planet called new hope do you know it ive never been there nor i though ive wandered far but the very day of his re turn while we sit in gelperinos saloon the earthman comes in where have you been he asks ten days ive been here and we left new hope together mr spock gives him his haughty look if you must know i looked in on my little hideaway for half a day i have obligations there you know and the earthman said no more gersen thought a moment and suddenly was in a hurry to leave what more do you know nothing more gersen made a last survey of the house under the inquisitive scrutiny of the imp then departed ignoring the imps sudden harsh demands for damages when he discovered the broken window sash hastily now gersen rode down through the winding avenues across sailmaker beach back into central avente he went to an office of the universal technical consultative service and gained the attention of an operator set up this problem said gersen twx ships leave the planet new hope one proceeds directly here to avente the other goes to a red dwarf star spends half a day then comes to avente arriving ten days later i want a list of the red dwarf stars which this second ship might have visited the operator considered there is obviously an ellipsoid shell here the foci being new hope and alphanor we must take into account the accelerations and decelerations the probable coast pe riods and landing times there will necessarily be a locus of most probability and areas of diminishing probability set up the problem so that the machine lists these stars in order of probability to what limits oh one chance in fifty include also the constants of these stars as given in the directory very well sir the fee will be svu gersen brought forth money the operator translated the prob lem into precise language spoke into a microphone thirty seconds the star king later a sheet of paper dropped from a slot the operator glanced at it signed his name handed it without a word to gersen fortythree stars were listed gersen compared the list with the page he had torn from dasces directory a single star occurred on both lists gersen frowned in puzzlement the star was a member of a binary without planets the couple was naturally thought gersen illumination flooding his mind how else could volcanos exist on the companion of a red dwarf dasces world was not a planet but a dark star a dead surface perhaps still faintly warm gersen had heard of such worlds usually they were too dense too massive for human occupancy but if a small star in the course of two or three billion years happened to sweep up enough detritus to build a thick shell of light material the surface gravity might well be reduced to a tolerable level at ten minutes to seven kelle warweave and detteras appeared at the spaceport wearing spacemens harness their skins washed the bluebrown tone which originally in popular credence was thought to protect the human organism from certain mysterious jarnell effluviae and which by usage had become a normal adjunct to the space travelers accoutrements they halted in the middle of the lobby looked about spied gersen turned to face him as he approached gersen surveyed them with a dour smile we seem to be ready all of us i thank you gentlemen for your promptness achieved necessarily at great inconvenience to all of us stated kelle in due course the reason for haste will become clear said gersen your luggage on its way to the ship said detteras then we will leave we have clearance everything has been arranged said warweave the group proceeded from the lobby and walked around to the docking area toward which a crane was already trundling the luggage four large cases and as many smaller packets was stacked beside the ship warweave unlocked the entry ports gersen and kelle passed the cases into the cabin detteras made a bluff attempt to assert command we have four compartments aboard ill take forward starboard kelle youll have starboard aft war the demon princes weave port forward gersen port aft we might as well move our luggage out of the cabin one moment said gersen there is a situation that we must resolve before we proceed any further detteras big face creased in a scowl what sort of situation we are two parties of interest here at least two parties nei ther trusts the other we are going beyond past the edge of law all of us recognizing this fact have brought weapons i propose that we lock all weapons in the security cabinet that we open the luggage and if necessary strip ourselves naked to assure each other that all the weapons have been declared since you are three to my one if any advantage lies to either side it is to yours a highly undignified process grumbled detteras kelle more equable now than gersen could have believed said come now rundle gersen is merely verbalizing reality in short i agree with him the more so since i carry no weapons warweave made a careless gesture search me search my lug gage but lets get under way detteras shook his head opened his case withdrew a projac of great power tossed it upon the table i have my doubts about the wisdom of this i have nothing against mr gersen personally but suppose he takes us to a far planet where he has accomplices wait ing who capture us and hold us for ransom stranger crimes have occurred gersen laughed if you consider this a real danger you need only remain here i dont care whether one goes or all go wtiat of your own weapons asked warweave dryly gersen brought forth his projac a pair of stilettos a dagger four grenades the size of walnuts mv word said detteras you maintain quite an armament i occasionally have need for it said gersen now the lug gage the accumulated arms were placed in a cabinet which was secured with four locks each man retaining a key to one of the locks the crane trundled up to the ship the boom swung around hooks engaged in trammels the ship jerked hung free was carried out on the field detteras went to the main console and touched a button which flashed a row of green lights everything ready to go he said tanks full machinery in order the star king kelle cleared his throat and brought forth a handsomely mounted wooden case bound in red leather this is one of the departmental rationalizers you have mr teehalts filament i as sume yes said gersen i have the filament with me but there is no hurry before we engage the monitor we must reach zero base point which is far distant very well said detteras wtiat are the coordinates gersen brought forward a slip of paper if you will allow me he said politely i will make the settings on the autopilot with ill grace detteras rose to his feet it seems to me that there is no longer reason for distrust we have stripped ourselves of our weapons all the issues have been settled so let us all relax and behave amicably with pleasure said gersen the ship was lowered to the launching pad the crane disen gaged and rolled away the group settled themselves into takeoff seats detteras started the automatic launchingsequence there was a jar a sense of acceleration and alphanor retreated below from the chapter malagate the woe in the book the demon princes by caril carphen published by eluci darian press new wexford aloysius vega in our cursory summary we have seen how each demon prince is unique and highly individuated each dis playing his characteristic style this is all the more remarkable in that the basic variety of possible crimes is limited and can be numbered on the fingers there is crime for gain extortion robbery which includes piracy and raids on settled communities swindling in its infinite guises there is slavery with its various man ifestations procuring selling and using slaves murder co ercion and torture are merely adjuncts to these activities the personal depravities are equally limited and can be classified under sexual debauchery sadism violent acts prompted by pique vmdictiveness revenge or vandalism doubtless the catalogue is incomplete perhaps even il logical but this is beside the point i merely wish to display the basic paucity in order to illustrate this point that each of the demon princes in inflicting one or another atrocity impresses the act with his own style and seems to create a new crime in the previous chapters we have examined the maniacal kokor hekkus and his theories of absolute frightfulness the devious viole falushe voluptuary sybarite and amateur of kinaesthetics completely distinctive is artel malagate the woe in the star king style and mannerism rather than enlarging himself pro jecting a macroscopic delineation of his person and deeds to mesmerize his victims and intimidate his enemies mal agate prefers the possibly equally chilling device of silence invisibility dispassionate impersonality there is no reliable description of malagate certainly malagate is a cognomen derived from a folk epic of old quantique he acts with implacable viciousness although his cruelties are never wanton and if he maintains a pleasure palace after the style of viole falushe or howard alan treesong it is a well guarded secret malagates activities are primarily extortion and slavery in the conclave of at smades planet where five de mon princes and a score of lesser operators met to define and circumscribe their activities malagate was allotted that sector of the beyond centered on ferriers cluster it in cludes over a hundred settlements towns and vicinities upon all of which malagate levies assessments he rarely encounters protest or complaint for he need merely cite the example of mount pleasant a town of persons which declined to meet his demands in the year mal agate invited four other princes to join him the junta swept down upon the town captured and enslaved the en tire population on the planet grabhorne he maintains a plantation of about ten thousand square miles with a slave population estimated at twenty thousand here are carefully tilled farms and factories which build exquisite furniture musical instruments and electronic mechanisms the slaves are not overtly ill treated but working hours are long the dormi tories are drab social opportunities are restricted punish ment is a term in the mines which few survive attel malagates attention is usually wide and dispas sionate but he sometimes focuses upon some individual the planet caro lies in an area which none of the demon princes claim mayor janous paragiglia of the city desde espoused and advocated a militia and space navy sufficient to protect caro and to seek out and destroy malagate or any other of the demon princes who dared to attack caro malagate kidnaped janous paragiglia and tortured him for the demon princes thirtynine days telecasting the entire process to the cities of caro to all the planets in his own sector and in one of his rare acts of bravado to the rigel concourse as mentioned his personal appetites are unknown a rumor frequently encountered runs to the effect that mal agate enjoys engaging in personal gladiatorial duels with ablebodied enemies with swords for weapons malagate is said to exhibit superhuman strength and dexterity and seems to derive satisfaction from slowly hewing his oppo nent to bits like certain other demon princes malagate maintains a discrete and respectable identity within the oikumene and if whispers are correct occupies a prestigious position on one of the major worlds alphanor became a misty pale disk mingled with the stars within the ship the four men settled into an uneasy accommodation kelle and warweave startled a quiet conversation detteras stared for ward into starspattered emptiness gersen lounged to the side watching the three men one of them not completely a man or better a simulated man was malagate the woe which gersen thought he knew there was still no certainty in his mind his conjecture was based on indications probabilities suppositions malagate for his part must still feel secure in his incognito he had no reason to suspect gersens objective he must still consider gersen no more than an aquisitive locater out to drive as hard a bargain as he could so much the better thought gersen if it would help him to a sure identification he wanted two things only the freedom of pallis atwrode and the death of malagate and of course of hildemar dasce if pallis atwrode were dead so much the worse for dasce surreptitiously gersen watched his suspect was this man mal agate frustrating to be so close to his goal malagate of course had his own plans behind the human skull worked thought patterns incommensurable to his own moving toward a goal still obscure gersen could define at least three areas of uncertainty in the situation first did malagate still carry weapons or have access to weapons previously concealed aboard the ship a possibility al the star king though he might be relying entirely on the hidden tanks of anaes thetic gas second were either or both of the other men his accomplices again a possibility but distinctly less strong third and a less simple set of circumstances what would hap pen when the ship reached dasces dead star here again variables piled on variables did malagate know of dasces hideaway if so would he recognize it on sight the answers here were both prob ably yes the question then would be how to surprise and either capture or kill hildemar dasce without hindrance from malagate gersen reached a decision detteras had urged the need for amicability one thing was sure amicability would be sternly tested before long time passed a wary routine was established gersen chose a propitious time and gave the body of suthiro to space the ship slid effortlessly past shining stars at astounding speed by means only vaguely comprehensible to the men who controlled it the pale of human civilization and law came to an end at some precise instant the ship passed beyond and struck up and out toward the dwindling fringes of the galaxy gersen kept steady if discreet surveillance over his three shipmates wondering who would first show concern anxiety or suspicion as to the immediate destination this person was kelle though any of the three might have been muttering together out of gersens hearing where the devil are we headed kelle inquired peevishly this is no area to attract a locater were practically in intergalactic space gersen took up a relaxed position i have not been altogether candid with you three gentlemen three faces turned swiftly three pairs of eyes bored in at him what do you mean grated detteras it is not a serious matter i have been compelled to make a detour after i perform a certain errand we will proceed with our original plans he raised his hand as detteras took a deep breath it serves no purpose to admonish me the situation is unavoidable warweave spoke in an icy voice what is this situation ill be glad to explain and im sure all of you will appreciate my predicament first of all i seem to have made an enemy of a wellknown criminal he is known as malagate the woe gersen glanced from face to face doubtless you all have heard of him i he demon princes he is one of the demon princes the day before we left one of his lieutenants a creature named hildemar dasce kidnaped a young woman i happen to be interested in and conveyed her to a private world i feel obligated to this young woman she is suffering through no fault other own but merely from malagates desire to punish or intimidate me i believe i have located dasces planet i plan to rescue this young woman and i hope for your cooperation detteras spoke in a voice thick with rage why could you not have told us of your plans before we left you insisted on leav ing you forced us to break our engagements at great inconve nience gersen said mildly you have some cause for resentment but since mv own time is limited i thought it best to combine the two projects he grinned as detteras neck swelled in new fury with luck this business will not take long and e will be on our way without delay kelle said meditatively the kidnaper has conveyed the young woman to a world in this vicinity i think so i hope so and you expect our help in rescuing this young woman only in a passive sense i merely ask that you dont interfere with my plans suppose that the kidnaper resents your intrusion suppose that he kills you the possibility exists but i have the advantage of surprise he must feel completely secure and probably i will have no great trou ble overpowering him overpowering him inquired wanveave delicately sardonic overpowering or killing him at this moment the jarnell kicked out the ship whined down into ordinary velocities ahead glowed a dim red star if it were double its companion was yet invisible gersen said as i say surprise is my most important asset so therefore i must ask that none of you through inadvertence or mal ice use the radio gersen already had disabled the radio but he saw no reason to put malagate on his guard ill explain my plans so that there can be no misunderstanding first ill bring the ship close enough to inspect the surface of the planet but far enough out to avoid radar detection if my theories are correct and i locate dasces habitation ill go to the far side of the world approach the the star king surface and land as close to dasces dwelling as feasible then ill take the platform flyer and do what must be done the three of you need only wait till i return then we shall be once more on our way to teehalts planet i know i can count on your cooperation because i naturally shall take the monitor filament with me and hide it somewhere before i confront hildemar dasce if i am killed the filament will be lost naturally i will need the weapons which are now in the security locker but i see no reason for objection on your part no one spoke gersen looking from one to another studying most intently the face of his suspect laughed inwardly malagate was posed with a maddening dilemma if he should interfere and by some means warn dasce then gersen might well be killed and malagates hopes of acquiring teehalts planet dashed would he trade dasce for the planet gersen was certain of his decision mal agate was notoriously callous detteras heaved a deep sigh gersen youre a subtle man youve put us in a position where for motives of sweet reason we are forced to do your bidding i assure you that my motives are irreproachable yes yes the damsel in distress all very well we ourselves would be criminals to deny her the chance of rescue my exasper ation is not at your goals if you have told us the truth but at your lack of candor with nothing to lose gersen became humble yes perhaps i should have explained more carefully but i am accustomed to working by myself in any event the situation is now as i have described it do i have the cooperation of you all humph said wanveave we have little choice as you are perfectly well aware mr kelle asked gersen kelle inclined his head mr detteras as wanveave points out we have no choice in that case i will proceed with my plans the world on which we are to land incidentally is a dead star rather than a planet does not excessive gravity make habitation inconvenient asked kelle well know very shortly wanveave turned away went to look out at the red dwarf the i hp demon princes dark companion had now become visible a large browngray disk three times the diameter of alphanor mottled and reticulated in black and umber gersen was pleased to find surrounding space rich in detritus the radar screen indicated dozens of minuscule plane toids and moonlets in orbits about each star he could approach the dead star boldly with small fear of detection a momentary shift into mtersplit braked the ship another brought it to a state of lazy drifting a quartermillion miles above the now looming mass the surface seemed dim and featureless with vast areas covered by what looked like oceans of chocolatecolored dust the outline of the world was sharp and stark against the black of space indi cating a sparse atmosphere gersen went to the macroscope in spected the surface the worlds relief leapt into perspective though the terrain still was hardly rugged chains of volcanic mountains netted the surface there was a mesh of rifts and cre vasses a number of ancient isolated plutonic buttes hundreds of volcanos some active others dead or quiescent gersen set crossbars on a short sharp peak at the demarcation between day and night the obect seemed not to move nor to alter its position in relation to the line of darkness apparently the world held a constant face to its companion in such case dasces dwelling would almost certainly be on the bright face probably near the equator at the longitude directly under the sun he scrutinized the region carefully under high magnification the area was large there were dozens of volcanic craters large and small gersen searched for an hour warweave kelle and detteras stood watching him with varying degrees of impatience and sar donic dislike gersen reviewed his logic it seemed to hang together the red dwarf had been listed on a wellused page in dasces directory it was found within the requisite ellipsoidal shell it had a dark star companion this must be the star and by every likelihood dasces crater must be located somewhere within the warm sunlit area be low an odd formation attracted his attention a square plateau with five mountain ranges radiating like the fingers of a hand a phrase of the melnoy heights imp occurred to him thumbnail gulch at fullest magnification gersen examined the area corresponding to the thumbnail certainly there was a small crater here certainly it seemed to show a slightly different color a slightly different tex the dirking ture than the others and there where the sunlight struck glancingly on the inside wall a glint and below the faint shine of white gersen reduced the magnification studied the surrounding ter rain even though dasce might not detect approaching ships at planetary distances his radar might wrn him of ships approaching for a landing if he dropped down on the far side of the world and then slanted in behind the hon on to land behind the plateau which formed the palm of the hand he might well be able to sur prise dasce he fed the necessary information into the course computer engaged the autopilot the ship veered and began its descent kelle unable to contain his curiosity asked well have you found what you were looking for i think so said gersen i cant be certain if you are careless enough to be killed said kelle you put us to enormous inconvenience gersen nodded this is essentially what i meant to convey to you a short while ago i am sure that youll help me at least pas sively we have already agreed to this the dark star loomed below and the ship landed on a shelf of naked brown stone a quarter mile from a heave of low black hills the stone was the texture of brick the surrounding plain displayed a surface resembling dried brown mud overhead the red dwarf bulked large the ship cast a dense black shadow a thin wind blew small curls of dust across the plain sifting a greenishblue powder into long herringbone drifts detteras said thoughtfully you know i think it only fair that you leave the filament here why victimize us i dont plan to be killed mr detteras your plans might go awry if so your troubles will seem very trivial in comparison to mine may i have my weapons the locker was opened the three watched warily while gersen armed himself he looked from face to face in the mind of one of these men feverish plots were hatching would he act as gersen anticipated which was to say not act here was a chance gersen must take suppose he were wrong suppose this were not dasces planet and malagate knew it suppose malagate through some in tuition suspected gersens goal he might be ready to sacrifice his the demon princes hopes of acquiring teehalts world in order to maroon gersen out here on this dark star there was a precaution gersen could take it would be foolish for him not to do so he stepped back into the engine room and detached a small but vital component from the energy reactor one which could be refabricated if necessary with ingenuity and patience he tucked it into his pouch along with the filament warweave standing in the doorway observed the act but made no comment gersen dressed himself in an airsuit left the ship opening the forward hatch he winched down the little platform flyer loaded aboard a spare airsuit and spare tanks of oxygen and without fur ther ceremony set out for thumbnail gulch skimming low to the ground the thin atmosphere keening over the windshield the landscape was odd even to one accustomed to the terrain of strange planets a dark spongy surface in varying shades of ma roon brown and gray marred here and there by volcanic cones and low wallowing black hills this might be true star stuff clinker remaining after the fires had died or it might be sediment swept up from space most likely both gersen wondered did the aware ness that he was traversing the surface of a dead star contribute to the sense of weirdness and unreality the thin atmosphere allowed absolute clarity of vision the horizons were far the panorama seemed endless and overhead there was the glowering sphere of the red dwarf rilling an eighth of the sky the ground shouldered up to become the plareau which com prised the palm of the hand a titanic flow of lava gersen swerved to the right far ahead he could see a line of black hills lying across the landscape like the back of a monstrous petrified triceratops this was the thumb at the end of which rose dasces volcano gersen flew low to the ground taking advantage of all possible cover swerving in and out close to the wall of the plateau and so approached the line of jagged black peaks slowly cautiously he eased up the tumbled slope jets muffled by the thin air to no more than a mutter dasce might have installed detectors along these slopes but on second thought it seemed hardly likely he would consider the effort superfluous why attack by land when a torpedo from space would be easier gersen gained the ridge there two miles ahead was the vol cano which he hoped would be dasces hideaway off to the side down on the plain which continued on and on indefinitely was the the star king most welcome sight of gersens experience a sight which brought tears of sheer savage heartrending joy to his eyes a small space boat his hypothesis had been correct here was thumbnail gulch in all certainty here would be found hildemar dasce and pallis atwrode gersen landed the platform and continued on foot taking ad vantage of all possible cover avoiding approaches where detectors would be most likely even though caution seemed no more than a formality destiny could not bring him this far only to deal him failure he mounted the slopes mingled basalt obsidian and tuff reaching the lip of the crater he peered over out on a webbed dome constructed of thin cables and transparent film held dis tended by air pressure the crater was not large fifty yards in di ameter and almost perfectly cylindrical the walls being formed of striated volcanic glass at the bottom of the crater dasce had made a careless attempt at landscaping there were a pond of brackish water a clump of palm trees a tangle of rank vines gersen looked an implacable god a god of vengeance in the center of the crater was a cage and in the cage sat a naked man tall haggard his face a ghastly wreck his body crooked marked with a hundred welts gersen remembered suthiros expla nation of how dasce lost his eyelids looking again he remem bered the photographs in dasces parlor this man was the subject of the photographs gersen looked elsewhere directly below was a pavilion of black cloth a series of connected tents there was no sign of hildemar dasce entrance to the crater was apparently by way of a tunnel leading through the wall of the volcano gersen moved carefully around the lip looked down over the slope the porous brownblack plain extended limitlessly off in three directions nearby rested the spaceboat seeming no larger than a toy in the clarity of the atmosphere on the endlessness of the plain gersen turned his attention back to the dome with a knife he cut a small slit in the film then settled himself to watch ten minutes passed before the pressure drop activated a warn ing signal out from one of the tents charged hildemar dasce gersen saw him with savage delight he wore loose white panta loons and no more his torso stained a faded purple was ribbed the demon princes with muscle he stared up with lidless eyes the blue cheeks bloom ing from the vermilion face dasce marched across the crater floor the prisoner within the cage followed him attentively with his gaze dasce vanished from sight gersen hid in a crevice dasce pres ently emerged on the plain in an airsuit carrying a case he mounted the crater wall with strong easy strides passing close by gersen dasce put down the case brought forth a projector swept a beam of radiation over the surface of the dome the escaping air evidently dosed with a fluorescent agent glowed yellow dasce went to the cut and bent over it and gersen felt his instant sus picion he straightened up and looked all around gersen crouched back out of sight when he looked once more dasce was at work mending the rip with cement and a new strip of film the entire operation re quired but a minute then dasce replaced the unused material and the projector into the case straightened up he made another care ful scrutiny of rim slope and plain then suspicion blunted he started back down the slope gersen rose from his hiding place and followed not fifty feet behind dasce jumping from rock to rock down the slope failed to look back until gersen dislodged a rock which bounded ahead and past dasce stopped turned sharply gersen was out of sight behind a jut of rock grinning in a kind of mad glee dasce proceeded gersen followed close behind at the base of the slope a sound a vibration alarmed dasce once more he turned to look upslope directly at the figure leaping down on him ger sen laughed to see the loose pale mouth open in startlement and then he struck dasce toppled rolled bounded to his feet started to run awkwardly for the airlock gersen fired at the back of one of the rangy thighs dasce fell gersen seized him by the ankles dragged him into the airlock slammed the outer door dasce struggled and kicked the red and blue face hideously contorted gersen pointed the projac but dasce merely tried to kick it from his grasp gersen fired again numbing dasces other leg dasce lay still glaring like a boar at bay with a roll of tape brought hopefully for such a purpose gersen lashed dasces ankles then warily he seized the right arm bent it back the star king and around dasce was forced over on his face presently after a struggle his arms were taped behind his back the lock mechanism automatically had filled the space with air gersen now removed the vitrine globe from dasces head we renew our acquaintance said gersen in a voice of hushed reverent joy dasce said nothing gersen dragged him out into the floor of the crater the pris oner jumped to his feet pressed himself to the bars of the cage stared at gersen as if he were an archangel with wings trumpet and aureole gersen assured himself as to the security of dasces bonds ran over to the tent projac ready for an unexpected servitor or com radeinarms of dasces the prisoner looked after him with astounded unbelieving eyes pallis atwrode lay huddled under a limp dirty sheet face to the wall there was no one else gersen touched her on the shoulder and fascinatedly watched her flesh crawl hisexultation became mingled with horror to produce a queer stomachtwisting emotion such as he had never before even imagined pallis he said pal lis its kirth gersen the words reached her muffled by the globe which gersen still wore she only crouched and huddled more tightly gerson rolled her over she lay with her eyes shut her face once so gay and impudent and charming was bleak and aus tere pallis called gersen open your eyes its kirth gersen youre safe she shook her head slightly held her eyes tight shut gersen turned away at the door to the tent he looked back her eyes were wide open staring in wonder but she instantly closed them again gersen left her investigated the entire crater reassured himself that no one else was present and returned to dasce nice place youve got here dasce said gersen in a conver sational tone a little hard to find when your friends want to drop in how did you find me said dasce in a guttural voice no one knows of this place except your boss he doesnt know how do you think i found out the demon princes dasce was silent gersen went to the cage unbarred the door motioned to the prisoner wondering whether the mans mind had also failed him come out the prisoner limped haltingly forward who are you no matter you are free free the man worked his loose jaws over the word turned to look toward dasce he spoke in a reverent voice what of himr i shall kill him presently the man said softly this must be a dream gersen returned to pallis she was sitting on the bed the sheet clutched around her her eyes were open she looked at gersen rose to her feet fainted gersen lifted her carried her out to the crater floor the erstwhile captive stood looking at dasce from a respectful distance gersen spoke to him wtiat is your name the man looked momentarily bewildered he knit his brows as if trying to remember i am robin rampold he said at last in a soft hushed voice and you you are his enemy i am his executioner his nemesis it is a marvel breathed rampold after so long that i cannot remember the beginning tears began to course down his cheeks he looked at the cage walked over to it studied it then looked back at gersen i know this place well each crack each crevice each fleck and crystal of the metal his voice faded sud denly he asked what is the year rampold seemed to become smaller i did not know it was so long i have forgotten so much he looked up toward the dome there is no day or night here nothing but the red sun when he is gone there are no events seventeen years i have stood in that cage and now i am out he walked over to dasce stood looking down at him gersen followed rampold said long long ago we were two different people i taught him a lesson i made him suffer the memory is all that has kept me alive dasce laughed a harsh cackle i have sought to repay you he glanced up toward gersen best kill me while you can or i will do the same to you gersen stood reflecting dasce must die there would be no compunction when the time came but behind the red forehead was knowledge which gersen needed how to extract this knowledge the star king torture gersen suspected that dasce would laugh while being torn limb from limb trickery subtlety he looked speculatively down into the coarse red and blue face dasce did not flinch gersen turned to rampold can you navigate dasces space boat rampold sadly shook his head then i suppose you must come with me rampold spoke in a tremulous voice wtiat of ww eventually ill kill him rampold said in a low voice give him to me no gersen returned to the inspection of dasce somehow he must be made to reveal the identity of malagate a direct ques tion would be worse than useless dasce he asked why did you bring pallis atwrode out here she was too beautiful to kill said dasce easily and why should you kill her i enjoy killing beautiful women gersen grinned dasce possibly hoped to provoke him you may or may not live to regret your sins who sent you here asked dasce someone who knew dasce slowly shook his head there is only one and he never sent you so much for that ploy thought gersen dasce would not easily be deceived well then he would take dasce aboard the ship the situation was certain to produce some sort of reaction now a new problem he did not dare leave robin rampold alone with dasce not even for long enough to fetch the platform rampold might kill dasce or dasce might command rampold to release him after seventeen years of degradation rampold might be sufficiently under dasces influence to obey and pallis at wrode what of her he turned to find her standing in the doorway the sheet clutched around her watching him with a wide troubled gaze he approached her and she shrank back gersen was uncertain whether or not she recognized him pallis its kirth gersen she nodded somberly i know she looked at the prone form of hildemar dasce youve tied him up she said in a voice of troubled wonder thats the least of his worries the demon princ es she looked at him wanly gersen found himself unable to fathom her thoughts youre youre not his friend gersen felt an entirely new type of sickness no im not his friend of course not did he say so he said he said she turned to stare m perplexity at dasce dont believe anything he told you he looked into her face wondering as to the extent of her confusion and shock are you all right she refused to meet his eyes gersen said gently im taking you back to avente youre safe now she nodded stonily if she would only evince some emotion relief tears even reproaches gersen sighed turned away the problem still remained how to convey all of them to the platform he dared leave neither pallas nor rampold alone with dasce he had enoyed domination over them both too long gersen replaced the vitrme globe over dasces head and dragged him through the tunnel out upon the plain where the two within could not see him jets roaring at full power the overloaded platform lurched slug gishly around the plateau blowing up a fan of dust which settled with startling rapidity in the thin atmosphere ahead stood the spaceship minute against the sweep of the vast horizon gersen landed close beside the entrance port hand weapon within easy reach he climbed the accommodation ladder inside attel mala gate had watched his approach had seen the cargo malagate could not know what dasce had told gersen he must be taut with in decision dasce who would recognize the ship must suspect but could not be sure that malagate was aboard the airiock thudded shut the pumps throbbed the inner door swung open gersen stepped forward kelle detteras warweave sat at various quarters of the room they looked at him without friendliness no one made a move gersen unfastened the head globe im back so we see said detteras ive been successful said gersen ive got a captive with me hildemar dasce a word of warning to you this man is a brutal murderer he is desperate i intend to hold him under rigid con ditions i ask that none of you interfere or have anything to do with the starki g this man the other two persons are a man dasce has kept penned in a cage for seventeen years and a young woman whom dasce recently kidnaped and whose mind may ha e suffered in conse quence she shall use my cabin i shall keep dasce in the cargo hold the other man robin rampold will no doubt be happy for the use of a settee this voyage becomes stranger by the hour said warweave detteras rose impatiently to his feet why do you bring this man dasce aboard im surprised you havent killed him consider me squeamish if you like detteras gave a bark of sour laughter let us proceed we are anxious to get this trip over as fast as possible gersen sent rampold into the ship with pallis atwrode then slid the platform under the winch lifted the platform with dasce aboard into the cargo hold where he removed dasces head globe dasce glared at him wordlessly you may see someone aboard you recognize said gersen he doesnt want his identity made known to his two colleagues as it would interfere with his plans you will be wise to keep a still tongue in your head dasce said nothing gersen secured him with exceeding care at the center of a long cable he made a loop which he knotted and clamped tightly around dasces neck i he ends of the cable he made fast at opposite sides of the hold stretching the cable taut dasce was now constricted in the middle of the hold the cable extending past him to right and left the ends ten feet out of his reach to either side even with hands free dasce could not work himself loose gersen now cut the tapes binding dasces arms and legs dasce instantly struck out gersen dodged aside clubbed dasce with the butt of his weapon dasce reeled over senseless gersen slipped off dasces airsuit searched the pockets ot the white pantaloons found nothing he made a final check of the bonds then returned to the main saloon bolting the hatch behind him rampold had divested himself of his airsuit and sat quietly in a corner detteras and kelle had done the same for pallis atwrode and had helped her into spare clothing she sat now to the side of the cabin drinking coffee her face wan and pinched her eyes dark and musing kelle cast a glance of disapprobation toward gersen ihis is miss atwrode the receptionist at the department wtiat in the name of heaven is your connection with her s ti ie dfmon princes the answer is perfectly simple said gersen i met her the first day i visited the university and asked her out for the evening for reasons of sheer spite or malice or so i suppose hildemar dasce struck me down and kidnaped her i felt it was my duty to rescue her and ive done so kelle smiled thinly i suppose we cant fault you for this warweave spoke in the driest of voices presumably we will now make for our original destination that is certainly my intention i suggest then that we proceed yes grumbled detteras the sooner we put a term to this fantastic voyage the better the dark star and its feeble red companion became one with space in the hold hildemar dasce recovering consciousness swore in a low vile mutter testing his bonds with insensate ferocity he tore and twisted at the clamps till the skin peeled from his fingers he plucked at the metal strands in the cable till his fingernails broke then he tried a new procedure thrusting against the floor lunging from side to side he tried to pull the cable loose from where it was fastened at the walls first to the right then to the left he suc ceeded only in bruising his neck assured that he was in fact help less though hands and feet were free he relaxed panting his mind seethed with emotion how had gersen located the dark star no one alive knew the location but himself and malagate dasce re viewed the occasions on which he had circumvented cheated or failed malagate and wondered if one of these occasions might not have come home to roost in the saloon gersen sat brooding on a settee the three men from the university one of whom was not a man stood together far forward there was kelle suave fastidious compact in phy sique warweave ectomorphic saturnine detteras largebodied restless moody gersen eyed his suspect probing his every act word and gesture for corroboration for some sign to provide the absolute assurance he needed pallis atwrode sat quietly nearby lost in reverie from time to time her face twitched her fingers clenched into her palms there would be no qualms about the kill ing of hildemar dasce robin rampold stood listlessly at the mi crofilm library looking at the index stroking his long bony chin he turned glanced toward gersen sidled across the room wolf hi s a c ishly in a voice so polite as to seem servile he asked he is he alive for the moment rampold hesitated opened his mouth closed it again finally he asked diffidently what do you plan for him i dont know said gersen i want to make use of him rampold became very earnest he spoke in a low voice as if afraid that the other occupants of the saloon would hear why not put him into my charge then you would be relieved of the effort of guarding and tending him no said gersen i think not rampolds face became even more haggard and desperate but i must you must rampold nodded you cannot understand for seventeen years he has been he could not find words finally he said he has been the center of my existence he has been like a personal god he has provided food and dnnk and pain once he brought me a kitten a beautiful black kitten he watched as i touched it smiling as if benign this time i thwarted him i killed the little creature at once because i knew his plan he wanted to wait until i came to love it then he would kill it torture it where i could watch of course he made me pay gersen drew a deep breath he has too much power over you i cant trust you with him tears began to form m rampolds eyes he spoke in a series ofdisomted sentences it is strange i feel grief now what i feel for him i cannot put into words it goes to an extreme and beyond and becomes almost tenderness substances can be so sweet that they taste bitter so sour that they taste salt yes i would care for him with great pains i would devote the rest of my life to him he held out his hands give him to me i have nothing or i would repay you gersen could only shake his head we will talk of this later rampold nodded heavily returned across the room gersen looked forward to where detteras kelle and warweave continued a desultory conversation apparently they were agreed tacitly or otherwise on a policy of disinterest toward the new passengers gersen smiled grimly he who was malagate would not care to confront hildemar dascc dasces temperament was not a subtle the dkmon princes one he was as likely as not to blurt out some damaging disclosure malagate would certainly try for a few quiet words of warning and reassurance or conceivably an opportunity to murder dasce dis creetly the situation was unstable sooner or later it was bound to collapse into more truthful relationships gersen toyed with the idea of precipitating the climax perhaps by bringing dasce into the saloon or taking kelle detteras and warweave into the cargo hold he decided to bide his time he still carried his weapons the three from the university apparently assured of his good intentions had not required that he restore them to the locker amazing thought gersen even now malagate could have no cause to suspect that gersen stalked him he would be less wary than he might be and using the pretext of curiosity might well seek to look in on dasce vigilance thought gersen it occurred to him that robin ram pold would be a useful ally in this situation no matter what dis tortions and sublimations seventeen years had produced he would be no less alert than gersen himself in any matter relating to hil demar dasce gersen rose to his feet and went aft through the engine room into the cargo hold dasce making no pretense of stoic resignation glared at him gersen noted dasces bleeding fingers and putting his projac on a shelf to void the possibility of dasces wresting it away from him stepped close to check dasces bonds dasce kicked savagely gersen hacked him behind the ear with the side of his hand and dasce fell back gersen assured himself as to the clamps which constricted the cable around dasces neck then moved back out of his reach it seems said gersen that troubles are catching up with you dasce spat at him gersen jumped back youre in a poor case for such offensiveness fah what more can you do to me do you think i fear death i live only out of hate rampold has asked that i give you into his care dasce sneered he fears me until he reeks and crawls he is soft as honey it was no longer gratifying to hurt him i wonder how long it will take to make the same sort of man out of you the star king dasce spat once more then he said tell me how you found my star i had information from whom what difference does it make said gersen he thought to insert an idea into dasces mind youll never have the opportunity of paying him off dasce pulled back his mouth in a hideous grin who is aboard this ship gersen made no reply standing back in the shadows he watched dasce he must suspect to the point of certainty that malagate was aboard dasce could be no less uncertain than mal agate himself gersen framed and discarded a halfdozen questions calculated to trick malagates name from dasce the best were either too clumsy or too subtle the worst would apprise dasce that gersen wanted information and so put him on his guard dasce tried to wheedle come as you say i am helpless at your mercy i am interested in learning who betrayed me who do you think it might be dasce grinned ingenuously i have a number of enemies for instance the sarkoy was it he the sarkoy is dead dead he helped you kidnap the young woman i poisoned him fah spat dasce women are everywhere why become ex cited release me i have wealth and i will pay you half if you tell me who betrayed me it was not suthiro the sarkoy tristano surely not tristano how could he know when i met tristano he had little to say who then gersen said very well ill tell you why not one of the administrators at the sea province university gave me the infor mation dasce rubbed his hand over his mouth looked sidewise at ger sen in suspicion and doubt why should he do so he muttered i cant understand any of this gersen had hoped to surprise an exclamation from dasce he asked do you know to whom i refer the demon princes but dasce only looked at him blankly gersen picked up his projac left the hold returning to the saloon he found conditions as before he signaled robin rampold back into the engine room you asked that dasce might be put into your charge rampold eyed him in tremulous excitement yes i cannot do this but i need your help in guarding him of course dasce is tricky you must never enter the cargo hold rampold winced in disappointment equally important you must not allow anyone else near the cargo hold these men are dasces enemies they might kill him no no exclaimed rampold dasce must not die gersen had a new thought malagate had ordained the death of pallis atwrode for fear that unwittingly she might reveal his identity in her present state she posed no threat nevertheless she might recover malagate might well wish to destroy her if he could do so without risk gersen said also you must try to guard pallis atwrode and make sure that no one disturbs her rampold was less interested i will do what you ask from the avatars apprentice in scroll from the ninth dimension intelligence asked marmaduke at one of the permitted intervals as he attended the eminence upon the parapet what is intelligence why responded the eminence it is no more than a human occupation an activity which men put their brains to as a frog kicks his legs to swim it is a standard which men in their egotism use to measure other and perhaps nobler races who are thereby dumfounded do you mean reverend gray that no living creature other than man can share the quality of intelligence but ha and why should i not ask what is life what is living but a disease of the primordial slime a purulence in the original candid mud which culminates through cy cles and degrees by distillations and sediments in the hu man manifestation but rf trend it is known that other worlds dem onstrate this fact of life i allude to the jewels of olam as well as the folk of the chthonian bog witling how have you glanced off the exact stroke of the essence reverend i crave your indulgence the way along the parapet is not to the forwardfooted reverend cray i pray that my direction be denned eight tones of the gong have sounded be content for the nonce and fetch the morning wine fhe demon princes the filament from lugo teehalts monitor fed impulses into the computer which digested the information combined it with the equations describing the ships previous position and despatched instructions to the autopilot which swerved the ship off and away on a course roughly parallel to the line between alphanor and smades planet time passed life within the ship fell into a rou tine gersen assisted by robin rampold guarded the cargo hold though gersen forbade rampold entry into the hold itself for the first few days hildemar dasce evinced a brassy jocularity alternat ing with earnest threats of vengeance at the hands of an agent he refused to identify ask rampold what he thinks said dasce leering from his bright blue hdless eyes do you want this happening to you no said gersen i dont think its going to happen occasionally dasce demanded that gersen answer his ques tions where are you taking me he would ask back to al phanor no where then youll see answer me or by here dasce swore obscene oaths ill do you worse than youve ever imagined its a chance we have to take said gersen we asked dasce softly who is we dont you know why doesnt he come in here tell him i want to talk to him any time he wants he can come in at which dasce fell silent goad prod pry as he might gersen never could induce dasce to utter a name nor did any of the three from the university show interest in dasce as for pallis atwrode her detachment at first was profound for hours she sat looking out at the passing stars she ate slowly hesitantly without hunger she slept for hours on end curled into as tight a ball as possible then gradually she returned to the present and at times became something like the carefree pallis atwrode of old the overcrowded confines of the ship made it impossible for gersen to talk to her in private which in his estimation was as well the situation with dasce in the hold and artel malagate in the forward cabin was already strained to an almost unbearable degree of taucness the star ki g more time passed the ship traversed new regions and regions after regions where no man had passed but one lugo teehalt to all sides hung stars by the thousand by the million streaming swarming flowing glaring glittering shirting silently one across the other and the other across another still worlds of infinite va riety populated by who knows whom each drawing the eye fixing the imagination evoking wonder each world an urge a temptation a mystery each a promise of unseen sights unknown knowledge unsensed beauty eventually a warm goldenwhite star showed dead ahead the monitor panel blinked alternately green red green red ihe au topilot choked down the energy output the split began to collapse the ship set up a weird subsound as eddies and disturbances and backdrafts of a substance which could only be called space sucked at the ships fabric the split collapsed with a slight shock the ship slid serenely like a boat drifting on a pond the goldenwhite sun hung close at hand controlling three planets one was orange small and near a fuming cinder another swung in a far orbit a gloomy dismal world the color of tears the third sparkling green and blue and white revolved close below the ship gersen warweave detteras and kelle antagonisms temporar ily set aside bent over the macroscope the world was clearly beau tiful with a thick moist atmosphere ample oceans a varied topography gersen was the first to stand away from the screen the time had come to hone his vigilance to its sharpest edge warweave stood back next im completely satisfied the planet is nonpareil mr gersen has not deceived us kelle looked at him in surprise you think it unnecessary to land i think it unnecessary but i am willing to land he moved across the cabin stood near the shelf to which was affixed suthiros switch gersen tensed is it to be warweave but warweave passed on gersen released his pent breath of course the time was not yet to profit from the gas malagate must somehow protect him self from its influence kelle said i certainly believe that we should land at least to make biometrics in spite of its appearance the world may be com pletely unfriendly the demon princes detteras said doubtfully its rather awkward with captives and invalids and passengers the sooner back to alphanor the better kelle snapped in a voice as sharp as any gersen had heard him use you talk like a jackass all this way merely to turn tail and run home obviously we must land if only to walk out on the planet for five minutes yes said uetteras glumly no doubt youre right very well said warweave down we go gersen wordlessly swung the autopilot toggle over into the landing program the horizons extended the landscape became distinct green parkland low rolling hills a chain of lakes to the north a range of snowclad crags to the south the ship settled to the ground the roar of exhaled energy ceased there was now so lidity underfoot utter quiet except for the ticking of the automatic environment analyser which presently flashed three green lights the optimum verdict there was a short wait for pressure equalization gersen and the three men from the university donned exterior clothing rubbed allergen inhibitor on face hands and neck adjusted inhalators against bacteria and spores pallis atwrode looked from the observation ports in innocent wonder robin rampold sidled uneasily along the back bulkhead like a lean old gray rat making tentative motions as if he wished to alight but did not dare leave the security of the saloon air from outside flooded the boat smelling fresh damp clean gersen went to the port swung it open made a polite if ironic gesture gentlemen your planet warweave was the first to step down to the ground with det teras close behind then kelle gersen followed more slowly the monitor had brought them to a spot hardly a hundred yards from lugo teehalts landing gersen thought the landscape even more entrancing than the photographs had suggested the air was cool scented with a vaguely herbaceous freshness across the valley beyond a stand of tall dark trees the hills rose massive yet gentle marked by outcrops of worn gray rock the hollows holding copses of soft foliage beyond rose a single great billowing cloud castle bright in the noon sunlight across the meadow on the far side of the river gersen saw wat appeared to be a growth of flowering plants and knew them to be the dryads they stood at the edge of the forest swaying on the star king supple gray limbs their movements easy and graceful magnificent creatures thought gersen beyond a doubt but somehow they were a well a discordant element a perverse notion but there it was on their own planet they seemed out of place exotic ele ments in a scene as dear and beloved as as what earth gersen felt no conscious emotional attachment for earth still the world most nearly like this was earth or more accurately those occa sional areas of earth which somehow had evaded the artifices and modifications wrought by generations of man this world was fresh natural unmodified except for the dryads a jarring note this might be old earth earth of the golden age the earth of natural man gersen felt a small exhilarating shock of enlightenment here resided the basic charm of the world its nearidentity to the envi ronment in which man had evolved old earth must have known many such smiling valleys the feel of such landscapes permeated the entire fabric of the human psyche other worlds of the oiku mene might be pleasant and comfortable but none were old earth none of them were home for a fact mused gersen here is where i would like to build a cottage with an oldfashioned garden an orchard in the meadow a rowboat tied to the riverbank dreams idle yearning for the unattainable but dreams and yearning which necessarily must affect every man gersen blinked at the im pact of a new thought suddenly attentive he watched the others warweave stood by the riverbank frowning down into the wa ter now he turned and shot a suspicious glance toward gersen kelle beside a clump of ferns as high as his shoulder looked first up to the head of the valley with its great white spire of cu mulus then down toward the far open parkland the forest at either side of the valley formed an aisle continuing till it melted and blurred into haze detteras paced slowly along the meadow hands behind his back now he bent scooped up a handful of sod worked it between his fingers let the soil sift and fall he turned to stare at the dryads kelle did the same the dryads gliding slowly on supple legs moved out of the shadows toward the pool their fronds shone blue and magenta copperrusset goldocher intelligent beings gersen turned once more to watch the three men kelle scowled faintly warweave inspected the dryads with obvious ad s the dkmon princks miration detteras suddenly put his hands to his mouth and shrilled an earpiercing whistle to which the dryads seemed oblivious there was a sound from the ship gersen turned to see pallis atwrode descending the ladder she raised her hands in the sun light drew a deep breath what a beautiful valley she murmured kirth what a beautiful valley she wandered slowly away pausing now and then to look around her in delight gersen on sudden thought turned and ran back up the ladder into the ship rampold where was rampold gersen hastened back to the cargo hold rampold had already entered gersen ad vanced cautiously listened dasces voice came gruff hoarse full of a detestable exultation rampold do as i say do you hear me yes hildemar go to the bulkhead unloose the cable hurry now gersen moved to where he could look unobserved into the hold rampold stood not four feet from dasce staring down into the red face do you hear me hurry or i will cause you such grief you will bewail the day you were born rampold laughed softly quietly hildemar i have asked kirth gersen for you i told him i would cherish you like a son i would feed you the most nutritious foods the most invigorating drink i do not think he will give you to me so i must gulp down just a taste of the joy i have promised myself for seventeen years i am now about to beat you to death this is the first opportunity gersen stepped forward sorry rampold to interrupt rampold uttered an inarticulate cry of utter desolation turned ran from the hold gersen followed him in the engine room he made a careful adjustment of his projac thrust it into a holster returned to the cargo hold dasce bared his teeth like a wild animal rampold has no patience he went to the bulkhead began to unfasten the cable what are you going to do dasce demanded the orders are that you shall be executed dasce stared what orders you fool said gersen cant you guess whats happened im taking your old position one side of the cable fell free ger sen crossed the room dont move unless you want me to break your leg he unfastened the other end of the cable now stand the star king up walk slowly forward and down the ladder dont make a single wrong move or ill shoot you dasce rose slowly to his feet gersen motioned with his projac move dasce said where are we never mind where we are move dasce slowly turned and trailing the two long ends of the cable went forward through the engine room into the saloon to the exit port here he hesitated looked back over his shoulder keep going said gersen dasce descended the ladder gersen following close slipped on the trailing cable he jumped to the ground and fell heavily flat on his face dasce gave a wild raucous cry of exultation leaped on him seized the projac sprang back gersen slowly rose to his feet backed away stop there called dasce oho but i have you now he glanced around fifty feet to one side stood warweave and det teras and slightly behind them kelle pressed against the hull was rampold dasce nourished the projac all of you stand together while i decide what to do old rampold its time he was dead and gersen naturally in the belly he looked to where the three from the university stood and you he said to one of the men you played me false gersen said you wont do yourself much good dasce oho i wont i hold the weapon theres three here who are going to die you old rampold and malagate theres only a single charge in the gun you may get one of us but the others will get you dasce turned a quick look at the charge indicator he laughed harshly so be it who wants to die or rather who do i want to kill he looked from face to face old rampold ive had my pleasure from him gersen yes id like to kill you with a red hot iron in your ear and malagate you sly dog you betrayed me what your game is i dont know why you brought me here i dont know but youre the one im going to kill he raised the weapon pointed squeezed the trigger energy darted from the gun but not the blazing blue bolt only a weak pale sizzle it struck war weave knocked him to the ground gersen charged dasce instead of fighting dasce hurled the weapon at gersens head turned and tiif demon princrs ran up the valley gersen picked up the projac snapped it open inserted a fresh power pack he walked slowly forward to where warweave was picking himself up from the ground detteras barked at gersen you must be a moron allowing such a man to take your gun kelle spoke in a puzzled voice but why shoot gyle war weave is he a maniac gersen said i suggest we go back into the ship where mr warweave can rest there was only a small charge in the gun but no doubt it hurt detteras grunted turned toward the ship kelle took war weaves arm but warweave shook him off and lurched up the ac commodation ladder followed by detteras and kelle and finally gersen gersen asked warweave are you feeling better now yes said warweave in a cold voice but i agree with det teras you displayed the utmost folly im not so sure of that said gersen i carefully arranged the whole affair detteras gaped at him stupidly purposely i shorted out the projac i arranged that dasce could seize it i informed him that there was a single charge left so that he could verify my own conviction regarding the identity ofattel malagate attel malagate kelle and detteras stared blankly at gersen warweave watched him narroweyed malagate the woe ive watched mr warweave for a long time feeling that he should more properly be known as malagate this is lunacy gasped detteras are you serious certainly im serious it had to be either you warweave or kelle i picked warweave indeed said warweave may i ask why of course first of all i dismissed detteras he is an ugly man star kings are more careful with their physiognomy star kings blurted detteras who warweave what non sense detteras likewise is a good eater while star kings eat human food with disgust as for mr kelle i also thought him an unlikely candidate he is short and round again not the physiognomy characteristic of a star king the star king warweaves face twisted in a glacial smile you imply that a good appearance guarantees depravity of character no i imply that star kings seldom leave their planet unless they can compete successfully against true men now two other points kelle is married and has bred at least one daughter sec ondly kelle and detteras have legitimate careers at the university you are honorary provost and i remember something to the effect that a large endowment brought you the job this is insanity declared detteras warweave as malagate the woe and a star king to boot its a fact said gersen and what do you propose to do kill him detteras stared then lunged forward roaring in triumph as he grappled gersen only to grunt as gersen twisted swung an elbow struck with the butt of the projac detteras reeled back i want the cooperation of you and mr kelle said gersen cooperate with a lunatic never warweave is frequently absent from the university for long periods am i right and one of these periods was only recently right detteras set his jaw ill say nothing about that this is true enough said kelle uneasily he glanced sidewise at warweave then back to gersen i assume you have strong rea sons for your accusation certainly id like to hear some of these reasons they make a long story its enough to say that i tracked malagate to the sea province university and narrowed the possi bilities to you three i suspected warweave almost from the first but i never was certain until the three of you stepped out on this planet this is sheer farce sighed warweave wearily this planet is like earth an earth that no man alive has ever known an earth which hasnt existed for ten thousand years kelle and detteras were entranced kelle drank in the view detteras reverently felt the soil warweave went to look into the water star kings evolved from amphibious lizards who lived in wet holes the dryads appeared warweave admired them seemed to consider them ornamental to kelle and detteras and to myself they are i hp dfmon princes intruders detteras whistled at them kelle scowled we men dont want fantastic creatures on a world so dear to us but all this is theorizing after i managed to capture hildemar dasce i went to great lengths to convince him that malagate was his betrayer when i gave him the chance he identified warweave with the proac warweave shook his head pityingly i deny all your allega tions he looked to kelle do you believe me kelle pursed his lips confound it gyle ive come to regard gersen as a competent man i dont believe him to be either irre sponsible or a lunatic warweave turned to detteras rundle what of you detteras rolled up his eyes i am a rational man i cant have blind faith in you in gersen or m anyone else gersen has made a case and astonishing as it is the facts seem to bear him out can you demonstrate to the contrary warweave considered i believe so he strolled to the shelf below which suthiro had installed the switch the inhalator he had worn outside dangled from his hand yes said warweave i believe i can make a convincing case for myself he pressed the mhalator to his face touched the switch at the forward console the airpollution alarm sounded a raucous loud clanging if you turn back the switch gersen called out the noise will stop warweave numbly reached below the shelf reversed the switch gersen turned to kelle and detteras warweave is as surprised as you he thought that the switch controlled the gas reservoirs which you will find under the settees hence his use of the mhalator i emptied the tanks and changed the leads of the switch kelle looked under the settee brought forth the canister he looked at warweave well gyle warweave tossed aside the inhalator turned his back m disgust detteras suddenly roared warweave lets have the truth warweave spoke over his shoulder youve heard the truth from gersen you are malagate said detteras in a hushed voice yes wanveave wheeled about drew himself up to his full height his black eyes glared back and forth and i am a star king superior to men a man has defeated you said kelle wrweaves eyes burnt even brighter he turned to consider the star ki g gersen tt am curious ever since your encounter with lugo tee halt you have sought malagate why malagate is one of the demon princes i hope to destroy each of them so what is your intention in regard to me i plan to kill you warweave thought for a moment you are an ambitious man he said m a neutral voice there are not many like you there were not many survivors of the raid on mount pleasant my grandfather was one i was another indeed said warweave the mount pleasant raid so long ago this is a peculiar voyage said kelle whose attitude had be come one of wry detachment at least we have achieved our os tensible purpose the planet exists it is as mr gersen described it and the money in escrow becomes his property not until we return to alphanor growled detteras gersen spoke to warweave you have taken great pains to secure this world for yourself i wonder why warweave shrugged noncommittally a man might want to live here or build himself a palace suggested gersen a star king wants none of these things warweave said presently you make a common mistake men are after all quite parochial you forget that individual differences exist among folk other than yourselves some perhaps are denied the freedom of their own worlds they become renegade neither man nor their own kind the folk of ghnarumen he easily used the name which sounded like a cough are quite as orderly as the most lawabiding folk of the oikumene in short the career of malagate is not one which the folk of ghnarumen would care to emulate they may be right they may be wrong it is my prerog ative to organize my own style of life as you know the star kings are strongly competitive this world to men is beautiful i find it pleasant enough plan to bring here folk of my race to nurture them on a world more beautiful than earth to father a world and a people superior to both men and the people of ghnarumen this was my hope which you will not understand for there can be no such understanding between your race and mine detteras said between clenched teeth but you took advantage of our liberality to dishonor us if gersen doesnt kill you i will th dfmon princes neither of you will kill malagate the star king two steps took him to the exit port detteras lunged after him frustrating gersens attempt to use his proac warweave turned lashed out with his foot kicked detteras in the stomach umped to the ground ran off down the slope gersen stepped to the exit port aimed sent a bolt of energy unsuccessfully after the bounding figure he descended the ladder gave chase warweave reached the meadow hesitated at the edge of the river looked back at gersen continued down the valley gersen kept to the upper slopes where the ground was hard and began to gain on warweave who had come to a marshy area war weave once more went to the nverbank hesitated if he plunged in before he gained the opposite shore gersen would be upon him he looked back over his shoulder and his face was no longer that of a man gersen wondered how he could have been fooled even for an instant warweave turned uttered a cry m a slurred guttural language went to his knees disappeared gersen reaching the spot found a hole in the nverbank almost two feet across he bent peered in but saw nothing detteras and kelle ran up panting where is he gersen pointed to the burrow according to lugo teehalt large white grubs live under the marsh hmf said detteras his ancestors evolved in the swamps in ust such holes he probably couldnt want a better haven kelle said dubiously hell have to come out to eat to drink im not so sure the star kings dislike human food men find the star king diet equally repellent we cultivate plants and do mesticate animals they do similarly for worms and insects such things as that warweave should do quite well on what he finds underground gersen looked up the valley where hildemar dasce had fled ive lost them both i was willing to sacrifice dasce to get mala gate but both the three stood on the nverbank a breeze rippled the surface of the water moved the branches of the great dark trees which grew at the base of the hills a tribe of dryads wandering along the op posite shore turned their purplegreen eye smudges on the men gersen said perhaps its ust as bad leaving them together on this planet as killing them the star ki g worse said detteras devoutly worse by far they returned slowly to the ship pallis atwrode sitting on the turf rose to her feet as gersen approached she seemed not so much oblivious to the events of the past few minutes as uninter ested unconcerned she came over to him took his arm smiled up into his face her own face was once again vital and fresh kirth i like it here dont you yes pallis very much imagine said pallis in a hushed voice a pretty house up there on the hill old sir morton hodenfroe had a beautiful house up along blackstone edge wouldnt that be nice kirth wonder i wonder first we must return to alphanor pallis then well talk about coming back very well kirth she hesitated then put her arms up to his shoulders wistfully searched his face do you still are you still interested in me after what happened of course gersens eyes felt moist wtiat fault was it of yours none but at home in lantango men are very ealous gersen could think of nothing to say he kissed her forehead patted her shoulders detteras said gruffly well gersen youve made use of kelle and myself in a most cavalier fashion i cant say that i enjoyed it but i cant bring myself to resent it either robin rampold approached slowly keeping to the shadow of the ship hildemar ran away he said mournfully now he will make over the mountains to town and i will never see him again he can make over the mountains said gersen but he wont find any towns i have been watching up along the hillside and through the forest said rampold i think he is somewhere nearby very likely said gersen it is distressing said rampold it is enough to sadden a man gersen laughed you would prefer to be back in the cage no of course not but then i had my dreams of what i would do when i won free seventeen years of hopes and dreams but now i am free and hildemar is beyond my reach he moved discon solately away thf demon princes after a pause kelle said as a scientist i find this planet a place of fascination as a man i find it entrancing as kagge kelle erst while colleague of gyle warweave i find it extremely depressing i am prepared to leave at any time yes said detteras in a gruff voice why not gersen looked up the valley to where hildemar dasce wearing only soiled white pantaloons lurked in the forest like a raging desperate beast he looked down the valley far down over the hazy plain then back to the swampy meadow under which crawled mal agate the woe he looked down into the face of pallis atwrode she took a deep breath i cant believe this is real its real but its also a dream all the rest seems a dream too a terrible dream its over now as if it had never happened ive been she hesitated frowned i dont remember too much just as well pallis pointed across the meadow look kirth what are those beautiful creatures dryads what are they doing out there i dont know looking for something to eat i suppose lugo teehalt says they suck up nourishment from big grubs which bur row under the meadow or perhaps they lay eggs in the soil the dryads wandering up the shore nourished their gorgeous fronds swaying slowly like branches in the wind on the swamp they moved more slowly a step at a time one of them stopped stood stock still under its foot showed a glint of white as the concealed proboscis plunged down into the soft ground a few sec onds passed the ground heaved erupted the dryad toppled over backward up from a crater staggered warweave the proboscis still thrust through his back his face was stained with dirt his eyes stared from his head from his mouth issued a series of appalling cries he shook himself fell to his knees rolled over disengaged himself from the fluttering dryad jumped erect ran crazily up the hillside his steps flagged he fell to his knees clutched at the ground kicked and lay still tyie warweave was buried on the hillside the group returned to he ship robin rampold now diffidently approached gersen i the ship robin rampold now have made up my mind to stay here hiave madp nn mv mind ln slav here the siar avg in one part of his brain gersen was shocked and astonished in another part there was only confirmation of a previous expectation so said gersen heavily you expect to live on this planet with hildemar dasce yes do you know what will happen he will make you his slave or he will kill you for the food which i shall be bound to leave you rampolds face was bleak and drawn it may be as you say but i cannot leave hildemar dasce think said gersen you will be here alone he will be more savage than ever before i hope that you will leave me certain articles a weapon a shovel a few tools to build a shelter some food and what will you do when the food runs out i will look for natural food seeds fish nuts roots these may be poisonous but i will test them carefully and what else is left for me gersen shook his head far better that you return with us to alphanor hildemar dasce will take revenge on you robin rampold said it is a chance i must take as you wish the ship lifted from the meadow leaving rampold standing beside his meager stack of supplies the horizons spread out the planet became a green and blue ball and fell astern gersen turned to kelle and detteras well gentlemen you have visited teehalts planet yes said kelle tonelessly by a roundabout method you have fulfilled the terms of your agreement the money is yours gersen shook his head i dont want the money i suggest that we keep the existence of this planet secret to preserve it from what could only be desecration very well said kelle im agreed i agree said detteras provided that i may return another time under more relaxing circumstances one further condition said gersen a third of the funds in escrow were deposited by attel malagate i suggest that they be transferred to miss atwrodes account as some measure of com pensation for the wrongs done her at malagates orders the dfmon princes neither kelle nor detteras made objection pallis protested halfheartedly then acquiesced and presently became very cheerful and astern the yellowwhite star became one with the multi tude and presently vanished a year later kirth gersen returned alone to teehalts planet in his old model b spaceboat hanging in space he examined the valley by macroscope but discovered no signs of life there was now a projac on the planet and it might well be in the hands of hildemar dasce he waited till nightfall and landed the boat on a shelf in the mountains above the river valley the long quiet night came to an end at dawn gersen started down the valley keeping always to the shelter of the trees from far off he heard the sound of an ax with great care he approached the sound on the edge of the forest robin rampold chopped at a fallen tree gersen stealthily moved closer rampolds face had filled out he looked bronzed and strong and fit gersen called his name rampold looked up startled searched the dark shadows who is there kirth gersen come forth come forth no need to steal up so furtively gersen moved to the edge of the forest looked carefully all around i feared i might find hildemar dasce ah said rampold no need to worry about hildemar he is dead no he is quite alive in a little pen i built for him with your permission i will not take you to see him as the pen is in a private spot well hidden from any who might visit the planet i see said gersen you defeated dasce then of course did you ever doubt it i have much more resource than he i dug a pit during the night built a deadfall in the morn ing hildemar dasce swaggered forth hoping to confiscate my stores he fell into it and i took him captive already he has be come a changed man he looked closely into gersens face you do not approve gersen shrugged i came to take you back to the oikumene no said rampold never fear for me i will live out my days here with hildemar dasce it is a beautiful planet i have the star king found sufficient food to maintain us and daily i demonstrate to hildemar dasce the tricks and conceits he taught me long ago they wandered down the valley to the previous landing place the life cycle here is strange said rampold each form changes into another endlessly only the trees are permanent so i learned from the man who first found the planet come ill show you warweaves grave rampold led the way up the slope to a copse of slender whitetimbered trees to the side grew a seedling rather different from the rest the trunk was veined with purple the leaves were darkgreen and leathery ram pold pointed there rests gyle warweave gersen looked for a moment then turned away he gazed up and down the valley it was as beautiful and placid and quiet as before well then said gersen i will once more depart may never return are you sure you wish to stay absolutely rampold looked up at the sun but i am late hildemar will be expecting me a pity to disappoint him i will bid you farewell now he bowed and departed crossing the valley and disappearing into the forest gersen once more looked up and down the valley this world was no longer innocent it had known evil a sense of tarnish lay across the panorama gersen sighed turned stood looking down at warweaves grave he bent seized the seedling pulled it from the soil broke it cast it aside then he turned and walked up the valley toward his spaceboat the killins machine from how the planets trade by ignace wodleckt cosmopolis september in all commercial communities the prevalence or ab sence of counterfeit money spurious bills of exchange forged notesofhand or any of a dozen other artifices to augment the value of blank paper is a matter of great con cern across the oikumene precise duplication and repro ducing machines are readily available and only meticulous safeguards preclude the chronic debasement of our cur rency these safeguards are three first the single negotia ble currency is the standard value unit or svu notes for which in various denominations are issued only by the bank of sol the bank of rigel and the bank of vega sec ond each genuine note is characterized by a quality of au thenticity third the three banks make widely available the socalled fakemeter this is a pocket device that when a counterfeit note is passed through a slot sounds a warning buzzer as all small boys know attempts to disassemble the fakemeter are futile as soon as the case is damaged it destroys itself regarding the quality of authenticity there is naturally a good deal of speculation apparently in certain key areas a particular molecular configuration is introduced resulting in a standard reactance of some nature electrical capacity magnetic permeability photoabsorption or reflectance isotopic variation radioactive doping a combination of the demon princes some or all of these qualities only a handful of persons know and they wont tell gersen first encountered kokor hekkus at the age of nine crouching behind an old barge he watched slaughter pillage en slavement this was the historic mount pleasant massacre notable for the unprecedented cooperation of the five socalled demon princes kirth gersen and his grandfather survived five names be came as familiar to gersen as his own attel malagate vtole fa lushe lens larque howard alan treesong kokor hekkus each had his distinctive quality malagate was insensate and grim viole falushe gloried in sybaritical refinements lens larque was a meg alomaniac howard alan treesong a chaoticist kokor hekkus was the most mercurial fantastic and inaccessible the most daring and inventive a few folk had reported their impressions uniformly they found him affable restless unpredictable and infected with what might have seemed utter madness except for his demonstrable con trol and strength as to his appearance all had different opinions he was by popular repute immortal gersens second encounter with kokor hekkus occurred in the course of a routine mission beyond and was indecisive or so it seemed at the time in early april of ben zaum an official of the ipcc arranged a clandestine interview with gersen and proposed a stint of weaseling that is to say an ipcc investi gation beyond gersens own affairs had come to a standstill he was bored and restless and so agreed at least to listen to the prop osition the job as zaum explained it was simplicity itself the ipcc had been commissioned to locate a certain fugitive call him mr hoskins said zaum so urgently required was mr hoskins that at least thirty operatives were being despatched to various sectors of the beyond gersens job would be to survey the inhabited lo calities of a certain planet call it bad world said zaum with a knowing grin gersen must either locate mr hoskins or establish as a definite certainty that he had not set foot on bad world gersen reflected a moment zaum who reveled in mystifica ipcc intemorld police coordination company in theory a private organization pro viding the police systems of the oikumene specialized consultation a central information file cnminological laboratories in practice a supergovernmental agency occasionally func tioning as a law in itself the killing machine tion on this occasion seemed to be outdoing himself patiently gersen began to chip away at the exposed part of the iceberg hop ing to float new areas into view wliy only thirty weasels to do the job right youd need a thousand zaums wise expression gave him the semblance of a large blond owl weve been able to narrow the area of search i can say this much bad world is one of the likelier spots which is why i want you to take it on i cant overemphasize how important all this is gersen decided he didnt want the job zaum had determined or was under orders to maintain as much reticence as possible working in the dark irritated gersen distracted him and so re duced his effectiveness which meant that he might not return from the beyond gersen wondered how to turn down the job with out alienating ben zaum and so drying up a pipeline into the ipcc what if i found mr hoskins he asked you have four options which ill name in order of decreasing desirability bring him to alphanor alive bring him to alphanor dead infect him with one of your horrible sarkoy minddrugs kill him outright im no assassin this is more than simple assassination this is confound it im not permitted to explain in detail but its truly urgent i assure you of this i dont disbelieve you said gersen still i wont in fact i cant kill without knowing why youd better get someone else under normal circumstances zaum would have terminated the interview but he persisted gersen thereby was given to understand that either qualified weasels were hard to come by or that zaum regarded his services highly if money is any object said zaum i think i can arrange i think ill pass this one up zaum made a halfserious display of beating his forehead with his fists gersen youre one of the few men whose competence im sure of this is a murderously delicate operation if of course mr hoskins visits bad world which i myself think is likely ill tell you this much kokor hekkus is involved if he and this mr hoskins make contact he flung up his hands gersen maintained his attitude of disinterest but now all was changed is mr hoskins a criminal the demon princes zaums bland brow creased in discomfiture i cant go into details in that case how do you expect me to identify him youll get photographs and physical characteristics this should suffice the job is perfectly simple find the man kill him confuse him or bring him back to alphanor gersen shrugged very well but since im indispensable i want more money zaum made a peevish complaint or two now as to definite arrangements when can you leave tomorrow you still keep your spacecraft if you call the model b locater a spacecraft it gets you there and back and its suitably inconspicuous where is it docked at avente spaceport area c bay zaum made a note tomorrow go to your spaceship make departure the ship will be provisioned and fueled the monitor will be coded to bad world you will find a folder with information regarding mr hoskins in your star directory you need only per sonal effects weapons and the like how long am i to search bad world zaum heaved a deep sigh i wish i could tell you i wish i knew what was going on if you dont find him within a month after arrival its probably too late if we only knew for sure where he was going what were his motivations i gather hes not a known criminal then no hes lived a long useful life then he was approached by a man named seuman otwal who we suspect to be an agent of kokor hekkus mr hoskins according to his wife thereupon seemed to go to pieces extortion blackmail in these circumstances impossible gersen was able to elicit no more information arriving at avente spaceport somewhat before noon of the fol lowing day gersen found matters as zaum had stated boarding the spartan little spacecraft he went first to the star directory where he found a manila envelope containing photographs plus a printed description mr hoskins was shown in various costumes headgear and skintoning he appeared a man in his late maturity the killing machine with a big loose body affable large eyes a wide mouth with heavy teeth a small rapacious nose mr hoskins was an earthman so much was clear from his clothes and skintoning which were gen erally similar but different in detail to those of alphanor gersen put the folder aside reluctantly decided against a visit to earth where he probably could identity mr hoskins such a detour would take too much time and undoubtedly get him into the ipccs blackbook he made a final check of the boat called port control for departure processing half an hour later alphanor was a shining orb astern gersen engaged the monitor and watched as the nose of the boat swept across the sky finally to point in a direction sixty degrees off the baseline between rigel and sol the jarnell coverdrive now seized the ship or more accu rately created conditions where a few pounds of thrust caused near instantaneity of transfer time passed random photons curling and seeping through the jarnell laminae entered the ship to allow the outside universe to be seen stars by the hundreds and thousands drifting past like sparks on the wind gersen kept a careful astrogational record fix ing on sol canopus and rigel presently the ship crossed the sep aration between the oikumene and the beyond and now law order civilization had no formal existence projecting the line of travel gersen finally was able to identify bad world carina lo iv in the star directory bissoms end in the terminology of beyond henry bissom was sevenhundredyears dead the world or at least the region surrounding the principal town skouse was now the preserve of the windle family bad world was no mis nomer thought gersen in fact should he put down at skouse with out good reason offhand he could think of none he would without fail be picked up by the local platoon of the deweaseling corps he would be rigorously questioned after which if he were lucky he would be allowed ten minutes to leave the planet ifwea seling were suspected he would be killed gersen thought harsh thoughts concerning ben zaum and his overelaborate secrecy had he known his destination he might conceivably have set up some kind of cover the single inteiworld organization of be ond existing only to identify and destroy un dercover agents of the ipcc s the drmon princes ahead a greenishyellow star of no great luminosity clung to the crosshairs waxing brighter and larger presently the intersplit kicked off ether collapsing in upon the ship sighed and shuddered through all the atoms of ship and gersen himself a sound to set the teeth on edge but which perhaps wasnt even real the old model b coasted through space nearby hung bis soms end bad world it was a smallish planet cold at the poles with a chain of low mountains forming a cincture of the equator like a weld joining the two hemispheres to north and south ran belts of sea shallowing somewhere near degrees latitude to bay ous and jungles beyond which were swamps and morasses all the way to the permafrost on a windy plateau sat the town skouse an irregular huddle of dingy stone buildings gersen was puzzled why would mr hos kins want to come to bissoms end far more pleasant refuges existed brinktown was almost gay but he was taking too much for granted mr hoskins might never come near bissoms end with the whole mission a mares nest indeed zaum had emphasized as much gersen examined the planet under the macroscope finding lit tle of interest the equatorial mountains were dusty and barren the oceans were gray and mottled with the shadows of low scudding clouds he turned his attention back to skouse a town of perhaps three or four thousand population nearby was a scorched field bordered by sheds and warehouses evidently the spaceport no where were luxurious mansions or castles to be seen and gersen remembered that the windles inhabited caves in the mountains behind the town a hundred miles to east and west evidences of habitation finally dwindled to wilderness there was a single other town beside a dock extending into the north ocean nearby was a metalprocessing plant so gersen deduced from slag tailings and several large buildings elsewhere the planet showed no signs of human occupation if he could not visit skouse overtly he must do so surrepti tiously he picked out an isolated ravine waited till evening shad ows crossed the area then settled as swiftly as possible he spent an hour adjusting to the atmosphere then stepped out into the night the air was cool like that of almost every planet it had a distinctive tang to which the nostrils quickly become dulled in this case a bitter chemical exhalation mixed with some the killing machine thing like burnt spice the one apparently derived from the soil the other from the native vegetation gersen invested himself with various tools of the weasel trade winched down his platform flyer set forth to the west the first night gersen reconnoitered skouse the streets were un paved and aimless there was a commissary several warehouses a garage three churches two temples and a tramway with spindly tracks leading down toward the ocean he located the inn a square threestory structure built of stone fiber panels and timber skouse was a dull town exuding a sense of boredom sluggishness and ignorance gersen assumed the population to have little more status than serfdom he concentrated his attention on the inn where mr hoskins if he were present would almost certainly take up residence he was unable to find a window to look through the stone walls re sisted his eavesdrop microphone and he dared not speak to any of the patrons who at various times during the night staggered out and away through the twisting streets of skouse the second night he had no better success however across from the inn he found a vacated structure apparently at one time a machineshop or fabricating plant but now given over to dust and small white insects unnervtngly like minuscule monkeys here gersen ensconced himself and through the entirety of the greenish yellow day kept watch upon the inn the life of the town moved past him dour men and stolid women wearing dark jackets loose flapping trousers of brown or maroon black hats with upturned brims went about their affairs they spoke in a broad flat dialect that gersen could never hope to imitate so died a tentative plan to secure nativestyle garments and enter the inn in the late after noon strangers came into town spacemen by their costumes from a ship that apparently had only just landed gersen fought off drowsiness with an antisleep pill as soon as the sun descended bringing a mudcolored twilight he left his hiding place and hur ried through the dim streets to the spaceport sure enough a large cargoship had put in and was now discharging bales and crates from its hold even as gersen watched three members of the crew left the ship crossed the floodlit forearea showed passes to the guard at the wicket and turned down the road toward town the demon princks gersen joined them he gave them good evening which they returned with civility and inquired the name of their ship the ivan garfang he was told out of chalcedon chalcedon earth the same the youngest of the group asked what kind of a town is skouse any fun to be had none said gersen theres an inn and very little else its a dull town and im anxious to depart are you carrying passen gers aye weve one aboard and room for four more five should mr hosey disembark as i believe is his plan though for what purpose he comes here the youth shook his head in incompre hension so thought gersen it was to be as easy as that who could mr hosey be but mr hoskins and now where did kokor hekkus fit into the picture he led the three spacemen to the inn and entered with them by all appearances their shipmate and so secure against deweaseler suspicion gersen cemented the association by calling for a round of drinks there was nothing to be had but beer which was thin and sour and a white pungent arrack the interior of the inn was cheerful enough with the tradi tional bar and fire blazing in the fireplace a barmaid wearing a limp red smock and straw slippers served the drinks the youngest of the spacemen who called himself carlo made overtures to which the maid responded with a look of uncomprehending con fusion leave her alone advised the oldest of the spacemen whose name was bude shes not all there he tapped his forehead sig nificantly all the way we come to the back of beyond grumbled carlo and the first woman we spy is a halfwit leave her for mr hosey suggested haivy the remaining spaceman if he disembarks hell have a long dull time of it some sort of scientist asked gersen or a journalist they sometimes choose to visit odd places devil knows what he is said carlo he hasnt spoken more than two words the entire trip the conversation changed gersen would have liked to talk the kjlijng i lchine more of mr hosey but dared not ask questions which beyond almost always implied a sinister aftermath a number of locals had entered the inn and stood before the fire drinking pints of beer at a gulp and talking in their flat voices gersen took the bartender aside and inquired regarding accom modation the bartender shook his head its been so long since weve housed anyone that our beds are all stale youll do better back on your ship gersen looked across the room to carlo bude and halvy they showed no disposition for imminent departure he turned back to the bartender is there someone to run an errand to the ship for me theres a boy in the back who might oblige ill speak to him the boy was duly summoned a blankfaced youth the son of the bartender gersen tipped him liberally and made him repeat three times the message he wished delivered im to ask for mr hosey and say hes wanted at the inn immediately correct be quick now and there may be more money for you remember give the message to none but mr hosey himself the boy departed gersen waited a moment then sauntered from the inn and followed the boy to the spaceport keeping well to the rear the boy was known to the guard at the spaceport and after a word or two was allowed onto the field gersen approached as close as he dared and standing in the shadow of a tall bush watched and waited several minutes passed the boy emerged from the ship alone gersen grunted in disappointment when the boy came out into the road gersen accosted him startled the boy yelped and sprang away come back here said gersen did you see mr hosey yes sir so i did gersen brought out a photograph of mr hoskins flashed a light this gentleman here the bov squinted yes sir the very same and what did he say the boy glanced sidewise whites of his eyes gleaming he asked if i knew billy windle the demon princes billy windle eh yes sir and of course i dont billy windles a hormagaunt he said to tell you if you were billy windle to come to the ship i said no vou were a spaceman and he said hed deal with none but billy windle himself and in person i see and whats a hormagaunt thats what we call them here maybe on your world youve a different name theyre the folk who soak up other folks lives and then go off to live on thamber billy windle lives on thamber the bov nodded earnestly its a real world never think dif ferent i know because the hormagaunts live there gersen smiled as well as dragons and fairies and ogres and underlings the boy said dolefully you dont believe me gersen brought forth more money return to mr hosey tell him that billy windle waits for him in the road and bring him out here to me the boys eyes rolled in awe are you billy windle never mind who i am go give mr hosey the message the boy returned to the ship five minutes later he came down the gangramp followed by mr hosey who was quite definitely mr hoskms they set forth across the field but now floating down through the dark sky came a whirling disk of red and blue lights which swooped and settled to the ground it was a sumptuous flying car decorated in the most elab orate fashion with colored lumes golden scrolls and fluttering fronds of green and gold the rider was a slim longlegged man with muscular shoulders as flamboyantly dressed as his boat his face was tinted blackbrown his features were flexible regular youthful he wore a tight turban of white cloth with a pair of ro guish tassels hanging by his right ear he was charged with nervous vitality jumping to the ground he seemed to bounce the boy and mr hoskins had halted the newcomer walked swiftly across the field he spoke to mr hoskins who seemed sur prised and gestured questioningly toward the road this must be billy windle thought gersen gritting his teeth in frustration billy windle glanced toward the road then made an inquiry of mr hos kins who reluctantly seemed to assent and tapped his pouch but in the same motion he produced a weapon which he displayed to the killing mchine billy windle in a nervous truculent fashion as if to emphasize that he trusted no one billy windle merely laughed where did kokor hekkus enter the picture was billy windle one of his agents there was a simple and direct way to find out the guard at the gate was watching the confrontation with fasci nated attention he did not hear gersen come up behind him he felt nothing as gersen struck him a deft blow which instantly in duced unconsciousness gersen donned the guards cap and cape marched officiously toward billy windle and mr hoskins they were engaged in a transfer each held an envelope billy windle glanced toward gersen waved him back toward the gate but ger sen continued to approach trying to appear obsequious back to your post guard snapped billy windle leave us to our affairs there was something inexpressibly dire in the poise of his head pardon me sir said gersen he jumped forward clubbed at billy windles gorgeous headgear with his projac as billy windle staggered and fell gersen raked mr hoskins arm with a low charge jolt jarring loose his weapon mr hoskins cried out in pain and astonishment gersen scooped up billy windles envelope reached for that which mr hoskins held mr hoskins staggered back then as gersen raised his projac halted gersen shoved him toward billy windles aircar quick get aboard or ill punish you mr hoskins legs were rubbery lurching and tottering he moved at a shambling trot to the aircar as he climbed aboard he tried to stuff the envelope into his shirt gersen reached snatched the envelope tore there was a brief struggle and gersen held half the envelope with the other half somewhere on the ground under the boat billy windle was staggering to his feet gersen could delay no longer the aircar controls were standard he thrust the liftarm far across billy windle shouted something gersen could not hear then as the aircar slanted up brought forth his projac fired the bolt sang past gersens ear cut diagonally across mr hoskins head gersen fired back as the aircar swung across the sky but the range was long and he merely kicked up a blaze of lambent dust high above skouse he swerved flew west settled beside his spaceboat he carried the corpse of mr hoskins aboard and aban doning the bedizened aircar took the model b into space he the demon princes engaged the intersplit and now was safe no known human effort could intercept him mission accomplished in a workmanlike fash ion without undue exertion mr moslems killed and en route to alphanor as per instructions in short sheer routine gersen should have been pleased but this was not the case he had learned nothing succeeded with nothing nothing except the paltry business for which he had been sent to bissoms end kokor hekkus had been involved in the affair with mr hoskins dead gersen would never know why or how the corpse was a problem gersen dragged it into the rear locker shut the door on it he brought forth the envelope he had taken from billy windle opened it within was a sheet of pink paper on which someone had written in florid purple ink the message was titled how to become a hormagaunt gersen raised his eyebrows jest somehow he did not think so gersen read the instructions with a small frisson of horror tickling at his neck they were unpleasant aging is pursuivant to a condition in which the ichors of youth have been exhausted so much is inherently obvious the hormagaunt will desire to replenish himself with these invaluable elixirs from the most obvious source the persons of those who are young the process is expensive unless one has access to a sufficient number of such persons and in this case he proceeds in the following fashion instructions followed from the bodies of living children the hormagaunt must procure certain glands and organs prepare extracts from which a waxy nodule might ultimately be derived this nodule implanted in the hormagaunts pineal gland forfends age gersen put the letter aside and inspected the fragment he had wrenched from mr hoskins it read crimps or more properly bands of density these ap parently occur at random though in practice they are so casual as to be imperceptible the critical spacing is in the killing machine terms of the square root of the first eleven primes the occurrence of six or more such crimps at any of the des ignated locations will validate gersen found the reference incomprehensible but vastly intriguing what had mr hoskins known so valuable that it might be traded on an even basis for the secret of perpetual youth he examined again the horrid directions for becoming a hor magaunt and wondered if they were sound then he destroyed both sets of instructions at avente spaceport he called ben zaum byvisiphone im back zaum raised his eyebrows so soon there was no reason to delay thirty minutes later zaum and gersen met in the vestibule to the spaceports waiting room where is mr hoskins along with the delicate emphasis on the hoskins he gave gersen a look of narrow inquiry youll need a hearse hes been dead for some time since before i left bad world as you identified it did he what were the circumstances he and a man called billy windle had struck some sort of a bargain but they could not come to terms windle seemed very disappointed and killed mr hoskins i managed to recover the body zaum gave gersen a glance of mild suspicion did any papers change hands in other words did windle derive any information from hoskins no youre sure of this absolutely zaum was still not completely at ease this is all you have to report isnt it enough you have mr hoskins which is what you wanted zaum licked his lips glanced at gersen from the corners of his eyes you found no papers on his body no and i want to ask you a question zaum heaved a deep dissatisfied sigh very well if possible ill answer the demon princes s you mentioned kolcor hekkus how does he come into the matter zaum deliberated a moment scratching his chin kokor hek kus is a man of many identities one of them is or so we have been informed billy windle gersen nodded sadly i feared as much i missed my op portunity it may never come again do you know what a hor magaunt is a what a hormagaunt it seems to he an immortal creature who lives on thamber in a measured voice zaum said dont know what a horma gaunt is and all i know about thamber is set your course by the old dog star till faring past the verge extreme dead ahead shines thambers gleam however the song goes you forgot the line after old dog star a point to the north ofachernar no matter said zaum i never found the land of oz ei ther he sighed lugubriously i suspect that youre not telling me the whole story but but what be discreet oh indeed and be sure that if you thwarted kokor hekkus in one of his schemes you will meet him again he never repays a favor and never forgets a wrong from introduction to the demon princes by caril car phen elucidarian press new wexford aloysius vega it may well be asked how from so many thieves kid napers pirates slavers and assassins within and beyond the pale one can isolate five individuals and identify them as demon princes the author while conceding to a certain degree of arbitrariness can nevertheless in good conscience define the criteria that in his mind establish the five as archfiends and overlords of evil first the demon princes are typified by grandeur consider the manner in which kokor hekkus gained his cognomen the killing machine or attel malagates plantation on grabhorne planet a civilization of his own definition or lens larques astounding monument to him self or vtole falushes palace of love certainly these are not the works of ordinary men nor the results of ordinary vices though viole falushe is said to be physically vain and in certain exploits of kokor hekkus there is the quaintly horrid quality of a small boys experiments with an insect second these men are constructive geniuses motivated not by malice perversity greed or misanthropy but by violent inner purposes which are for the most part shrouded and obscure why does howard alan treesong glory in chaos what are the goals of the inscrutable attel malagate or that fascinating flamboyant kokor hekkus the demon princes third each of the demon princes is a mystery each insists on anonymity and facelessness even to close asso ciates these men are unknown each is friendless loveless we can safely discount the selfindulgences of the sybarit ical viole falushe fourth and obverse to the aforementioned is a quality best to be described as absolute pride absolute self sufficiency fach considers the relationship between himself and the balance of humanity as no more than a confron tation of equals fifth and ample in itself i cite the historic conclave of at smades tavern where the five acknowledged themselves grudgingly per haps as peers and denned their various areas of interest ipsi dixeunt such was gersens second encounter with kokor hekkus the aftermath was a period of depression during which gersen spent long mornings and afternoons on the avente esplanade gazing out over the thaumaturge ocean for a period he had considered a return to bissoms end but the project seemed rash and almost certainly pointless kokor hekkus would not stay long at bissoms end gersen must somehow make a new contact this was a resolve easier to form than to implement hair raising anecdotes by the dozen circulated regarding kokor hekkus but specific information was rare the reference to thamber was new but gersen gave it small consideration it could hardly be more than the fantasy of an imaginative boy time passed a week two weeks kokor hekkus received men tion in the news as the presumptive kidnaper of a copus pi cas siopeia viii mercantilist gersen was mildly surprised the demon princes seldom kidnaped for ransom two davs later came news of another kidnaping the scene on this occasion being the hakluz mountains of orpo pi cassiopeia vii the victim a wealthy packer of sourspore again kokor hek kus was reputedly involved indeed only the possible participation of kokor i lekkus made the not uncommon crimes noteworthy gersens third encounter with kokor hekkus arose directly if deviously as a result of the kidnapings and indeed the kidnapings the killing machine themselves followed as a reverse or backhanded consequence to gersens success at skouse the chain of events was expedited by chance one midmorning gersen sat on a bench halfway along the esplanade an elderly man with the pale blue skintoning black jacket and beige trousers of middleclass gentility took a seat on the other end of the bench some minutes later he muttered an expletive threw aside his news paper and looking toward gersen expressed indignation in regard to the lawlessness of the times another kidnaping another in nocent person whisked off to interchange why cannot these crimes be halted what is the constabulary about they warn per sons of means to caution what a sorry condition gersen expressed wholehearted agreement but said that he knew no effective solution to the problem other than making illegal the private ownership of spacecraft wily not demanded the old man i possess no spaceship nor do i feel the need to do so at best they are instruments of frivolity and ostentation at worst they facilitate the commission of crime and especially kidnaping look you he tapped the news paper ten kidnapings all made possible by the spaceship ten asked gersen in surprise so many ten in the last two weeks all persons of extreme wealth and worth the ransoms go beyond to enrich rascals it is money dis sipated in space a loss to us all he went on to remark that moral values had deteriorated since his youth that respect for law and order had reached an alltime nadir that only the most inept or unlucky criminal suffered for his acts to exemplify his convictions he cited a man he had seen only the day previously a man whom he recognized as an associate of the notorious kokor hekkus who almost certainly was responsible for at least one of the kidnapings gersen expressed shock and surprise was the old man sure of his facts yes indeed there is no doubt whatever i never forget a face even though as in this case it has been eighteen years gersens interest began to wane the old man continued re gardless certainly thought gersen or almost certainly this old man could not be a plant by kokor hekkus at pontefract on aloystus where i served as chief notator of the inquisition he appeared before the guldounerie and as i he demon princes recall displayed a remarkably insolent attitude considering the gravity of the charges and what were these gersen asked disbursion with intent to suborn ransackment illicit posses sion of antiquities and revilery his arrogance was justified for he evaded all punishment save admonition it was evident that kokor hekkus had intimidated the panel and you saw this man yesterday beyond question he passed me on the route shdeway pro ceeding north toward sailmaker beach if by sheer chance i notice this single unregenerate calculate the number of those i fail to observe a serious situation gersen declared this man should be placed under observation you do not remember his name no what if i did by all odds it is neither the name he used then nor the name he uses now he has a distinctive appearance the old man frowned not notably his ears are rather large as is his nose his eyes are round and close together he is not so old as i however i have heard that the folk of the fomalhaut planet mature late owing to the nature of their food which clabbers the bile ah he was a sandusker he asserted as much in an extraordinary fashion i can only describe as vainglory gersen laughed politely you have a remarkable memory you think then that this sandusk criminal lives in sailmaker beach why not it is where such unorthodox folk tend to collect true enough after a few further remarks gersen rose to his feet and took his leave the route slideway ran north paralleling the esplanade then curved through the losasso tunnel to terminate at mansh square in sailmaker beach gersen was moderately well acquainted with the area standing in the square and looking up toward melnoy heights he could almost see the house where hildemar dasce at one time had resided and gersens thoughts for a moment became tinged with melancholy he brought himself back to the matter at hand tracing down a nameless sandusker it was a problem rather different from that of locating beauty dasce who once seen could never be forgotten the killing machine surrounding the square were low thickwalled structures ofco quina concrete colorwashed white lavender paleblue pink in the rigelhght they glowed as if incandescent emitting tones and overtones of color the windows and doorways by contrast showing the most intense and utter of blacks along one side of the square ran an arcade housing shops and booths catering principally to tour ists sailmaker beach with its enclaves of offworld peoples each with its typical shops and restaurants was like nowhere else in the oikumene with the possible exception of one or two districts on earth at a kiosk gersen bought a guide to sailmaker beach it contained no mention of a sandusker quarter he returned to the kiosk the proprietress was a short fat in fact almost globular woman with skin tinted chalkgreen perhaps a krokmole imp gersen asked where do the sanduskers quarter themselves the woman considered not many sanduskers that i know of down the foot ofard street youll find a few been requested there because the wind blows the smell of the victuals out to sea where is their foodshop should you call it food i call it rubbish youre not a san dusker no i see not its there on ard street turn down through there see the two cryptmen in the black cloaks right past where they stand thats ard street hold your nose gersen returned the guide to sailmaker beach which at once was placed back in stock gersen crossed the square stepped around the two pale men in long black cloaks and entered ard street an alley rather than a street running on a slight downhill slant all the way to the water in the first block were tea houses and curtained gamerooms exuding a rather pleasant odor of incense then ard street passed through a drab section infested by small sloeeyed children wearing long gold ear chains red and green shirts to the navel and little else then approaching the waterfront ard street widened to become a small court at the sea wall gersen suddenly understood the pertinence of the advice given him by the fat woman of the kiosk the air of ard court smelled richly indeed with a heavy sweetsour organic reek that distended the nostrils gersen grimaced and went to the shop from which the odors seemed to emanate taking a deep breath and bowing his head he entered to right and left were wooden tubs containing pastes liquids and submerged solids overhead hung rows of withered bluegreen ob jects the size of a mans fist at the rear behind a counter stacked the demon princes with limp pink sausages stood a clownfaced youth of twenty wear ing a patterned black and brown smock a black velvet headkerchief he leaned upon the counter without spirit or vitality and without expression watched gersen sidle past the tubs youre a sandusker asked gersen what else this was spoken in a tone gersen could not iden tify a complex mood of many discords sad pride whimsical malice insolent humility the youth asked you wish to eat gersen shook his head i am not of your religion ha ho said the youth you know sandusk then only at secondhand the youth smiled you must not believe that old foolish story that we sanduskers are religious fanatics who eat vile food rather than flagellate ourselves it is quite incorrect come now are you a fair man gersen considered not unusually so the youth went to one of the tubs dipped up a wad of glisten ing blackcrusted maroon paste taste judge for yourself use your mouth rather than your nose gersen gave a fatalistic shrug tasted the inside of his mouth seemed first to tingle then expand his tongue coiled back in his throat well asked the youth if anything said gersen at last it tastes worse than it smells the youth sighed such is the general consensus gersen rubbed his mouth with the back of his hand do you know all the sanduskers of the neighborhood i do i seek a tall man with eyes slightly crossed who has lost a finger with hair leaving the rear of his head like a comets tail the youth smiled placidly his name i do not know that would seem to be powel darling he has returned to sandusk i see well no matter the money will revert to the provincial treasury sad what money is this a bequest to two sanduskers who obliged an eccentric old the killing machine woman the other is no longer conveniently at hand or so i am told and who is the other i am told that he departed alphanor last month indeed the youth seemed to ruminate who could it be again i do not know his name a man of late middle age with large ears a large nose and eyes closely spaced that might be dolver cound but he is still here what are you certain oh yes go to the seawall knock at the second door to the left thank you it is customary to pay for delicacies consumed on the prem ises gersen parted with a coin and left the shop the air in ard court seemed almost fresh the seawall ran perpendicular to ard street twenty feet below the ocean translucent and shot like a star sapphire with rigelrays eased up and down gersen turned left and halted at the second door the entrance to a narrowfronted cottage of the usual lumpy coquina concrete gersen rapped at the door from within came a halting step the door slowly opened dolver cound looked forth a man some what older and heavier than gersen had expected with a round flushed face and cyanotic lips yes gersen stepped forward ill come in if i may cound uttered a dismal bleat of protest but gave way gersen looked around the room they were alone the furnishings were dingy a worn purple and red rug covered the floor and on the cooker steamed dolver counds noon meal gersens nostrils twitched involuntarily cound recovering his poise took a deep breath and thrust out his chest what is the meaning of this intrusion what or whom do you seek gersen gave him a look of hard contempt dolver cound for eighteen years you have evaded the punishment due your crimes whats this gersen brought forth an identification tablet similar to an ipcc blazer with his photograph under a translucent seven the demon princes pointed star he touched it to his forehead the star flashed into light dolver cound watched in loosemouthed fascination i am a member of the executive arm of the new dispensation at pontefract alovsius vega third eighteen years ago you en countered a faulty trial before the guldouncrie now declare you under restraint you must return for a new hearing cound stammered excitedly and finally in a highpitched voice cried you have no jurisdiction no authority further i am not the man you seek no who must i apprehend kokor hekkus cound licked his purple lips glanced toward the door go never return i want nothing to do with you what of kokor hekkus speak no such names to me it is either you or he who must settle the score at the moment he is unavailable you must come i give you ten minutes to pack ridiculous nonsense sheer balderdash gersen shifted his projac into plain sight fixed cound with a hard stare cound suddenly bluff and hearty said come now let us consider a moment to learn where you have made your mistake sit this is our custom wi you drink sandusk brew thank you no i can serve less tasty stuff sea province arrack gersen nodded very well cound went to a shelf took down a bottle a tray a pair of glasses poured drinks gersen stretched yawned as if inattentive cound very slowly brought forward the tray took one of the glasses gersen took the other scrutinized the clear liquid seeking the faint roil which wuld indicate the presence of another liquid or grains of undissolved powder cound watched slyly he would take suspicion for granted thought gersen and would expect a change of glasses drink said cound and raised his glass gersen watched him with interest cound put clown the glass untouched do you not care to drink gersen took his glass mingled the two drinks returned the glass to cound drink first never before a guest i would feel shame i cannot drink before my host but no matter we will both drink during the trip to pontefract since you do not care to pack let us be off the killing machine counds face crumpled and sagged with woe i will go no where with you you cannot force me i am an old man not in the best of health have you no pity its either you or kokor hekkus these are my instructions cound looked toward the door do not speak that name he said in an agonized croak tell me what you know of him never then come bid rigel farewell your sun henceforth will be vega i did nothing do you know no reason tell me what you know of kokor hekkus we would prefer him to you cound drew a deep breath closed his eyes so be it he said at last if i tell you all i know must i still return to aloysius i promise nothing cound sighed what i know is little enough for two hours he asserted the casual quality of his association with kokor hekkus i was falsely accused even the guldounerie panel came to realize this all surviving members of this panel are under punitive re straint we are taking a cumulative vengeance come now the truth i am far from satisfied cound eventually slumped into a chair and declared himself ready to talk first however he professed a need for certain notes and memoranda he went to fetch papers from a drawer but brought forth a weapon gersen waiting with projac ready blasted it from his hand cound turned slowly eyes round and wet he swung his numb arm staggered to a seat and now spoke without further evasion indeed he became verbose almost explosive with information as if inhibition had been completely dissolved yes eighteen years ago he had assisted kokor hekkus in certain oper ations on aloysius and elsewhere kokor hekkus had been anxious to obtain certain antiquities on aloysius they had raided creary castle bodelsey abbey and the houl museum during the latter operation cound had been apprehended by the sons of justice but kokor hekkus made certain arrangements and the guldounerie panel dismissed cound with an admonition thereupon his asso ciation with kokor hekkus became less active dissolving ten years ago thp dfmon princes gersen pressed for details cound waved his arms helplessly what is his appearance he is a man like us all there is nothing about him to describe he is of average size of good physique of unknown age his voice is soft though when he is angry it comes as if he were talking through a tube from a far world he is a strange man polite when it pleases him more often indifferent he is fas cinated by beautiful objects by antiquity and by intricate machines you know how he derived his name this is a story i have never heard it means killing machine in the language of a secret world far out beyond this world had been settled in ancient days then lost and forgotten until kokor hekkus rediscovered it to punish the folk of an enemy town he built a giant metal executioner which split bodies in half with an ax as dreadful as the ax was the scream the metal ogre emitted with ever stroke and thereafter kokor hekkus was so known this is all i know a pity you cannot tell me how to locate him said gersen either you or he must answer to the authorities at pontefract cound sat back limp as a broken bladder i have told all he mumbled what can be served by visiting vengeance upon me will the antiques be restored justice must be satisfied unless you can deliver kokor hekkus into my hands you must pay for your joint misdeeds how can i provide kokor hekkus asked cound in the drea riest of voices i hesitate even to speak his name who are his associates i dont know it has been years since last i saw him in those days cound paused well cound licked his blue lips it could be of no interest to the pontefract authorities hi be the judge of that cound heaved a deep sigh i cannot tell you why not cound made a small hopeless gesture i do not want to be killed in some horrible fashion what do you think awaits you at pontefract no i cannot talk further you have been able to conquer these apprehensions during the last hour the killing machine everything i told you is a matter of public knowledge said cound ingenuously gersen smiled and rose to his feet come cound made no move finally he said in a low voice i knew three men who worked with kokor hekkus there was ermin strank rob castilltgan and a man they called hombaro strank was native to the concourse which planet i do not know castil ligan was from vegas boniface i know nothing about hombaro have you seen them recently certainly not you have photographs cound would admit to none and sat watching in limp resent ment as gersen moved here and there around the room investi gating the obvious spots where cound might keep mementos after a moment or two cound said spitefully if you knew anything of sandusk you would expect no photographs we face the future not the past gersen desisted from his search cound was squinting at him reflectively during gersens search he had taken time to think may i ask what is your rank special agent you are no aloysian where is your throathole no matter if you go around asking questions about kokor hekkus even tually he will find out about it tell him yourself if you have a mind to cound uttered a short bark of a laugh no no my lad even if i knew where to complain i would not i want no more acquain tance with terror gersen said thoughtfully i shall now take all your money and throw your vile food into the sea what counds face once more became lachrymose gersen went to the door youre a miserable lump of abso lutely nothing not even worth the effort of punishing i go now consider yourself fortunate gersen departed the house returned up ard street to marish square rode the slideway south to avente he was by no means happy with the results of his days work there was further knowl the demon princes edge in dolver cound had he either craft or cruelty sufficient to extract it what had he learned kokor hekkus had been so named by the folk of a secret planet ten years ago three men named ermin strank hombaro and rob castilligan had served kokor hekkus kokor hekkus was fascinated by intricate machines he cherished beauty he valued the works of antiquity gersen had lodgings on a high floor of the credenze hotel on the day following his interview with dolver cound he arose before rigel had cleared the catiline hills stained his skin the currently fashionable grayedbuff dressed in somber dark green departed the hotel by a side entrance in the subway system he voided all pos sibility of tracker or sticktight then took himself to cort tower station an elevator lifted him to the foyer where he transferred to a small oneman capsule as the door slid shut a voice inquired his name and destination gersen supplied the information and added his ipcc clearance code there were no further questions the car lofted him thirty floors high moved him laterally dis charged him into the office of ben zaum this was a tworoom suite beside the towers transparent west wall with an allinclusive view south over the city and down the coast to remo shelves along another wall held a variety of trophies curios weapons and world globes by the evidence of his office zaum was a man high in the ipcc organization how high gersen did not precisely know the title mandator umbria division might mean much or little zaum greeted gersen with cautious cordiality youre here looking for work i take it how do you spend all your money women hardly a month ago you were paid fifteen thousand svu i need no money to be candid i want information free or do you want to commission us wtiats information regarding kokor hekkus worth zaums wide blue eyes narrowed innnitesimally to us or from us in both directions zaum reflected hes currently on the red list officially the killing machine we dont even know whether hes alive or dead unless someone gives us a commission standard whimsy once more which gersen acknowledged with a polite smile yesterday i learned the derivation of his name zaum nodded offhandedly ive heard the tale rather grisly might well be fact incidentally to keep you from going stale he opened a drawer the deweaselers tripped up a man on palo and turned him over to kokor hekkus he was returned to us in a condition i wont describe kokor hekkus also sent a message zaum read from a slip of paper a weasel performed an unpar donable act at skouse the creature you have herewith is fortunate in comparison with the weasel of skouse if he is a brooding man let him come beyond and announce himself i swear that the next twenty weasels captured will thereupon go free gersen gave a sickly grin he is angry extremely angry extremely vindictive zaum hesitated a mo ment i wonder well if he would keep his promise gersen raised his eyebrows you suggest that i turn myself over to kokor hekkus not precisely not exactly well think of it like this it would be one mans life for twenty and weasels are hard to come by only the inept are deweaseled said gersen your organi zation is the sounder for their loss he reflected a moment but your suggestion has a certain merit why not identify yourself as the man who planned the operation and ask if he will spare fifty men for the two of us zaum winced you cant be serious what is your interest in kokor hekkus that of an altruistic citizen zaum arranged and rearranged several old striped bits of bronze on his desk im another whats your information there was nothing to be gained by evasiveness which zaum would be certain to sense yesterday i heard three names men who worked for kokor hekkus ten years ago they may or may not be in your files what are the names ermin strank rob castilligan hombaro race world nationality t dont know zaum yawned stretched looked out across avente the day the demon princes was sunny but full of wind far out over the thaumaturge ocean hung great tumbles of cumulus after a moment of placid reflection zaum swung back around to his desk ive nothing much better to do at the moment he touched various pads at the console beside his desk the wall opposite vibrated with a million flickers of white light then flashed to impart a message krmin strank item of entries with a coded set of physical characteristics below to the left ap peared a photograph with a list of aliases to the right was a resume of ermin stranks life and wwks a native of quantique sixth planet of alphard the lonely a specialist in smuggling con traband drugs into the wakwana islands ermin strank had never left his native planet the wrong strank said gersen ermin strank appeared superimposed in dim pink was the information deceased and the date march l ermin strank had his habitat far across the oikumene on vadilov single planet of sabik or eta ophiuchi he was cur rently active as a receiver of stolen goods like ermin strank item he had never traveled far from his native world except for two years at durban on earth in the apparently legitimate capacity of warehouseworker ermin strank was a short spindly knobheaded man of early middle age redhaired of truculent mien incarcerated at kil larney vega systems penal satellite where he had spent the pre vious six years thats the man said gersen zaum nodded briskly an associate of kokor hekkus you say so i understand zaum touched pads on his console ermin stranks resume was augmented by the notation reportedly associate of kokor hekkus zaum looked questioninglv at gersen anything more on strank i think not next on the screen appeared a succession of hombaros the the killing machine most likely of which had disappeared from view eight years previ ously and was presumed dead the files boasted eight rob castilligans the rob castilligan who had robbed creary castle bodelsey abbey and houl museum among other premises was deary item there was a recent no tation to the resume that brought gersen to attention five days previously in the garreu province of scythia halfway around al phanor he had been arrested for complicity in a kidnaping a versatile fellow this castilligan remarked zaum youre interested in the kidnaping gersen acknowledged as much zaum brought details to the screen seized had been the two children of duschane audmar a ninetyfourth degree fellow of the institute reputedly of great wealth they had been sailing on a lake with their tutor a surface glider swooped across the water halting beside the boat the chil dren were taken the tutor escaped by diving from the boat and swimming away under water he had summoned the constabulary which had acted with great efficiency rob castilligan had been apprehended almost immediately but two other men had won free with the children the father duschane audmar had remained aloof taking no interest in the affair the children presumably would be taken to interchange where they might be recovered upon rescission of their fees to use the special jargon of in terchange zaums interest was now fully aroused he sat back inspected gersen with open curiosity i take it that youre acting for aud mar gersen shook his head a fellow of the institute you should know better zaum shrugged hes only ninetyfourth degree he might be waiting for a few more degrees before he goes divine if he were sixty or seventy perhaps ninetyfour is pretty high zaum had thought to detect evasiveness in gersen then youre not interested in this kidnaping im interested but this is the first ive heard of it zaums lips pursed swiftly in and out the question comes to mind of course he was speculating so gersen realized upon the possible in the dkmon princks volvement of kokor hekkus in the matter he turned to the con sole pads lets see what castilligan has to say there was a delay of rive minutes while zaum spoke to various members of the garreu province constabulary another two minutes while castilligan was brought forward and placed before the screen he was a dapper handsome man with a smooth easy natured face sleek black hair varnished against his scalp his skin tone had been washed off his skin was a marmoreal white his manner was polite even cordial as if he were an honored guest rather than prisoner at the garreu carcery zaum introduced him self gersen remained to the side beyond the scope of the outlens castilligan seemed amused at the attention he was receiving zaum of the ipsys all on account of poor little me he spoke with the engaging lilt of a boniface bogtrotter well then what can i do for you beyond baring my lifes secrets that will suffice said zaum drily how did you happen to be caught folly i should have departed alphanor with the others but i chose to remain the beyond bores me im a man with a taste for the niceties youll be quite nicely taken care of castilligan shook his head with detached and impersonal re gret yes its a shame i could apply for modification except that i enjoy myself the way i am vices and all id be a tiresome fellow modified your option of course said zaum still its not too bad if you happen to enjoy the open air no said castilligan earnestly ive thought it all out and its too much like death dear engaging rob castilligan disappears and with him all joie de tivre all the light of the world then in stumps tiresome honest robert meachum castilligan dull as dish water who wouldnt steal meat for his starving grandmother with any luck ill be back from the satellite in five years or perhaps less evidently you plan to cooperate with the authorities castilligan winced impudently as little as i decently can and still get my gold star who were your confederates in the audmar kidnaping come sir you cant expect a man to tattle on his cronies have you never heard of honor among thieves the killing machine dont talk about honor said zaum youre no better than the rest of us castilligan admitted as much in fact i have already bared my soul to the constabulary the names of your confederates august wey pyger symzy kokor hekkus did not participate directly castilligans mouth indented suddenly at the corners once more he essayed whimsy now then why ever should you men tion a name like that were talking reality i thought i heard you mention gold stars for your record indeed i did declared castilligan but not a gold wreath for my gravestone suppose said zaum casually that through your assistance we laid our hands on kokor hekkus can you imagine the lovely gold star youd be elected honorary director of the ipcc castilligan blinked sidelong chewed thoughtfully on his tongue you have a commission against kokor hekkus even if we dont we could hold him for the highest bidder and earn a fortune theres fiftyfive planets wanting the color of kokor hekkus insides castilligan bared white teeth in a sudden dazzling grin well truth to tell ive nothing to hide because nothing i know could offend kokor hekkus he is as you know and i cant change the picture where is he now beyond or so i should think he worked with you on the audmar kidnaping he did not unless he called himself another name in truth ive never seen kokor hekkus as a man its always been rob do this and rob do that by one or another stealthy means its a secretive creature this kokor hekkus in the old days you plundered museums and the like wtiy because i was paid to do so he wanted antiquities and noth ing would do but that daring rob must rob the sources long ago of course my salad days so to speak wtiat of these other kidnapings how many have you worked on castilligan made a delicate face i dont care to say it might prejudice my record the demon princes very well how many do you know of recently about fourteen by recently i mean in the last month fourteen castilligan smiled his gay smile yes its a going concern ive asked myself why and wherefore but he shrugged who am i to read the mind of kokor hekkus no doubt he like everyone else needs money zaum turned gersen a sideglance stopped the audio pickup gersen said what else does he know concerning kokor hekkus zaum relayed the question the prisoner put on a fretful face you play damnably fast and loose with my health suppose i told you enough that kokor hekkus were inconvenienced be sure i know nothing of the sort but assume so do you think his horrors would feel kindly toward me he would learn the dark side to my soul he would ply me with fears and terrors and all the very ills i dread the most a man must have some regard for his skin if he does not who will needless to say what you tell us will not be communicated to kokor hekkus said zaum smoothly bah so you say a man sits beside you this very instant i saw you look at him for all either of us can say it is kokor hekkus himself who shares your office you dont seriously believe this again castilligans mood changed no i do not kokor hek kus is beyond or so i believe spending the vast sums he has earned this last month or two spending how for what as to that i cant say kokor hekkus is old some say three hundred years some four hundred but he maintains a young mans energy there is no lack of enthusiasm to the man after a short pause zaum asked if you are not acquainted with kokor hekkus how can you know of this i have heard him speak i have heard him plan i have heard him curse he is changeable fickle elusive as a bernal flame maiden he is completely generous completely cruel in both cases because he knows no ones mind but his own he is a terrible enemy not a bad master i talk of him like this because it can do him no harm and may help me but i would never risk offending him he invents new and special terrors for this very purpose yet the killing machine should serve him well he will build me a castle and make me robert baron castilligan and where will he perform this romantic fantasy sneered zaum beyond beyond grumbled zaum always beyond sornedaywe will sweep past the pale and make an end to beyond you will never succeed there will always be a beyond never mind what else do you know of kokor hekkus i know he will be kidnaping other rich mens sons and daugh ters he has said as much he needs a vast sum of money and needs it at once from chapter i the astrophysical background in peoples of the concourse by streck and chernitz it is rigel that magnificent star among stars whose prodigious luminosity and spacious zone of habitability has afforded the concourse its existence impossible not to marvel at the sheer grandeur of the system think of it twentysix salubrious worlds swinging in stately thousand year orbits around the dazzling white sun at a mean radius of thirteen billion miles not to mention the six oftignored planets of the incandescent inner belt and blue compan ion a fortieth of a lightyear to the side but the very circumstances that make the concourse what it is provide one of the galaxys most tantalizing mys teries rigel is deemed by most authorities a young star ranging in age from a few million to a billion years how then to explain the concourse which when sir julian hove arrived already displayed twentysix mature biological complexes by the timescale of terrestrial evolution con course life is several billion years old assuming such life to be autochthonous but is such an assumption warranted while the flora and fauna of each planet differ markedly there are at the same time a number of suggestive similarities almost as if concourse life long long ago had a common origin there are as many theories to the situation as theorists the dean of modern cosmologists a n der poulson has ingeniously proposed a situation where rigel blue com the killing machine panion and planets condensed from a gas already rich in hydrocarbons thereby giving life a headstart so to speak others indulging in fanciful nights have wondered if the planets of the concourse were not conveyed hither and es tablished in these optimum orbits by a nowdead race of vast scientific achievement the regularity and spacing of the orbits the nearuniform size of the concourse planets as contrasted with the disparities of the inner worlds give such speculations a measure of plausibility why when how who the hexadelts who carved monument cliff on xi puppis x who left the

continents scythia was the largest the most sparsely populated and in the opinion of the folk of umbria lusitania and lycia the most bucolic garreu province fronting the mystic ocean and backed up into the morgan mountains was the most isolated region of scythia to taube a drowsy sunstruck village on the shores ofjermin bay came gersen in the biweekly airship from the provincial capital marquari in the whole town he found but a single vehicle to be rented an ancient glidecar with rumbling bearings and a tendency to slew sideways downslope gersen inquired directions climbed aboard the car and set forth along the inland road up a long slope he climbed with the shimmering rigellight drowning the landscape in brilliance for a space the road wound back and forth through vineyards orchards of gnarled fruit trees patches of bluegreen kale and ar tichoke thickets of native berries here and there were farm cot tages each with its parasol roof absorbing rigel energy the road swung up over a low ridge gersen halted to take his bearings to the south spread the ocean the foreland sloping up from the bay the spatter of dun and pink and white that was taube in the blaze of light all the colors of the landscape were unreal pastels shim mering and dancing ahead the road swung over to a level area where gersen saw the villa of duschane audmar ninetyfourth degree fellow of the institute it was a rambling structure of stone and sunbleached timber shaded by a pair of enormous oaks and a native ginkgo gersen walked up the driveway lifted and let fall a huge bronze knocker in the shape of a lions paw after a long wait the door was opened by a handsome young woman wearing a peasant smock i have come to speak to duschane audmar said gersen the woman surveyed him thoughtfully may i inquire your business ill have to take that up with lord audmar himself she shook her head slowly i dont think hell see you there have been domestic difficulties and duschane audmar is not re ceiving the killing machine my visit concerns these difficulties the womans expression changed to sudden wild hope the children they have been returned oh tell me im sorry but not to my knowledge gersen took a note book from his pocket tore off a leaf wrote kirth gersen llth degree to discuss kokor hekkns take that to him the woman read the note without a word departed within presently she was back come gersen followed her along a dim hall to a vaulted room with bare white plaster walls here sat audmar with a pad of white paper a quill pen a cutglass bottle of mulberrycolored ink the paper was blank except for a single line in the looping heavily shaded cursive affected by high fellows of the institute audmar was a rather short man squareshouldered firm fleshed he had crisp wellshaped features a small straight nose narrow black eyes glittering like oil a compressed mouth over a cleft chin he greeted gersen evenly put aside paper pen and ink where did you come into eleven at amsterdam on earth that would be under carmands control no it was von bleek just previous to carmand hmm you were young why did you not proceed after eleven there is no great difficulty until the twentyseventh i could not submerge my personal goals to those of the insti tute and as to these goals gersen shrugged they are uncomplicated primitive enough to satisfy a centennial but centripetal audmars eyebrows rose into skeptical arcs but he dropped the subject why do you wish to discuss kokor hekkus it is a subject in which we both are interested audmar nodded curtly an interesting man agreed last week he kidnaped your children audmar sat silently for thirty seconds it was clear that he had not known the identity of the kidnaper wtiat is the basis for this statement i have had an admission from the man who was captured rob castilligan now in the carcery centripetal tending toward centralization or codification by extension tending to a kind of fussy officiousness institute argon the demon princes your status is official no i have no status continue presumably you desire the safe return of the children audmar smiled thinly presumption gersen ignored the ambiguity have you received notice of how to effect their safe return by ransom the message came two days ago will you pay it no audmars voice was soft and easy gersen had expected nothing else centennials and near centennials were forced to maintain impassivity to any and all ex ternal pressures should duschane audmar ransom his children he would thereby admit to pliability he would thus lay himself and the institute open to exterior persuasion the policy was well known for the tenth time gersen wondered why duschane audmar had been molested had he on some earlier occasion revealed flex ibility had the kidnapers merely blundered gersen asked you knew that kokor hekkus was involved no now that you know will you take steps against him audmar gave a small petulant shrug as if gersen should realize that punitive measures were as flagrant an instability as paying ran som to be completely candid said gersen i have reason to re gard kokor hekkus as an enemy i am not restricted as you are i can implement my feelings in audmars eyes appeared a quick gleam of something like envy but he only gave his head a polite inclination i come to you for information said gersen and i hope whatever cooperation you see fit to provide this will be very little or none said audmar still you are human and you must love your children cer tainly you do not wish to see them sold into slavery as they will be audmar smiled a bitter tremulous smile i am human kirth gersen probably more savage and primitive in my humanity than yourself but i am a ninetyfourth i have too much strength i must be careful how i apply it hence he made a gesture in dicating a whole complex of ideas the klli g mac him stasis suggested gersen audmar forbore to answer the ube he said c enly regarding kokor hekkus i know nothing or at least no more than what is common knowledge currently said gersen he seems the most active of the demon princes he creates vast misery he is a vile creature do ou know why kokor hekkus took your children i presume to obtain money how much ransom does he ask a hundred million svu gersen startled had nothing to say audmar smiled grimly not that my little daro and wix arent worth as much and a great deal more you could pay this much if i chose money is no problem audmar turned back toward the pad and the quill pen gersen sensed that his patience was wearing thin in this last month said gersen kokor hekkus has kidnaped at least twenty persons perhaps more this was the last reckoning made by the ipcc before i left avente the victims are all people of great wealth and power kokor hekkus becomes rash said audmar indifferently exactly what are his purposes why suddenly does he need such vast sums of money audmars interest was aroused then sensing the direction of the argument he darted gersen a sudden sharp glance gersen said kokor hekkus seems to have some large proect in mind i dont think he plans to retire not after two hundred and eightytwo years it occurred to gersen that audmar knew rather more concern ing kokor hekkus than he pretended it seems that kokor hekkus has expenses of two billion svu assuming that all the ransoms run as high as the one assessed against you why does he need the money is he building a fleet of warships is he reconstructing a planet is he founding a university audmar heaved a deep wistful sigh you believe he has some large and possibly dystrophic end in view why else would he suddenly require so much money audmar frowned shook his head fretfully it would be a shame the demon princes to thwart kokor hekkus but from my point of view and also in stitute policy his voice dwindled to nothing they are at interchange yes perhaps you are unfamiliar with interchange procedure first travel time is calculated to which fifteen days is added during this period only the socalled party of primary interest may rescind the fee after this time elapses anyone who wishes may do so if i had a hundred million svu i could do so audmar studied him a moment why should you wish to do i want to know why kokor hekkus needs so much money i want to learn many things about kokor hekkus your motives i take it are not dispassionate curiosity my motives are beside the point what i can do is this if i were to come into possession of a hundred million svu plus my expenses i would proceed to interchange and as a free agent take custody of your children incidentally how old are they daro is nine wix is seven meanwhile i would try to ascertain kokor hekkus motives his goals and his current whereabouts and then after learning as much as possible i would bring you your children and if you were interested report to you what i had learned audmars face was utterly expressionless what is your current address i am at the hotel credenze in avente audmar rose to his feet very well you are an eleventh you know what must be done find why kokor hekkus needs this large sum of money he is an inventive and imaginative man a constant source of wonder the institute finds him remarkable and regards certain byproducts of his evil rewarding i can say no more gersen left the room without further ado in the quiet main hall he found the woman who had admitted him she turned him a glance of searching inquiry gersen asked you are the mother of the children she made no direct answer are they are they well i would think so will you give me photographs she went to a shelf the boy was smiling the girl was grave the killing machine the woman could not trust herself to speak aloud and so spoke in a halfwhisper wtiat will happen to them gersen suddenly realized that she took him to be a represen tative of the kidnapers hovi did one disclaim such an imputation before it had been spoken he said awkwardly i know very little of the matter that is im not personally involved but i hope that somehow the only words he could think of were either mean ingless or overly explicit she went on i know how it is that we must detach ourselves but it seems hardly fair to the little ones if there were some thing i could do t dont like to raise your hopes said gersen but perhaps your children will be returned she said simply i will be grateful gersen went from the cool dim house out into the sudden blaze of the garden the afternoon was quiet when he started the old slidecar the rumble of the engine seemed intrusively loud gersen was glad to put the house ofduschane audmar behind him for all its magnificent prospect for all the charm of its design it was a house of silence and sternly repressed emotion where anger and grief must be borne m secret wtiich is why i never went into twelfth gersen told himself three days later a package was delivered to gersen at the cre denze hotel opening it he found within eighteen packets of fresh bank of rigel notes totaling one hundred and one million svu gersen tested them with his fakemeter all were genuine gersen immediately checked out of his hotel rode by subway to the spaceport where his battered old b locator awaited him an hour later he had departed rigel and was in space from the moral essence of civilization by calvin v calvert in a sense the explosion of man across the galaxy must be considered a regression of civilization on earth after many thousand years of effort men had developed a con sensus as to what constituted good and evil when men departed earth they left behind this consensus as well from human institutions by prade textbook tenth and eleventh grades interchange is another of the strange accommodations necessary to the functioning of what we have termed the total mechanism it is a fact that kidnaping for ransom is a common crime owing to the ease by which escape via spaceship can be effected in the past the system for paying ransom often broke down owing to the hatreds and sus picions inevitably generated and many boys and girls were never returned to their homes hence the necessity for in terchange which is to be found on sasani a planet in the near beyond and functions as a broker between kidnaper and those paying ransom interchange guarantees good faith in the transaction the kidnaper receives his money minus the interchange fee the victim is restored safely to his home interchange is officially denounced but prac tically tolerated since it is believed that conditions would the killing machine be far worse in its absence occasionally certain groups dis cuss the feasibility of commissioning the ipcc to stage a raid upon interchange somehow nothing ever comes of it interchange was a cluster of buildings at the base of a rocky hillock in the daarrizm a desert of the planet sasani aquila gb iv to use the geocentric nomenclature still favored by the star directory at one time in the far past an intelligent race had peopled at least the two north continents of sasani for here were to be found the crumble of monumental castles and keeps private spacecraft were banned from the daarrizm and a ring of cannon emplacement enforced the structure persons employing the facilities of interchange were required to land at nichae on the shore of the shallow calopsid sea board an airship for sul arsam no more than a station in the desert then ride a jolting surface car across twenty miles of desert to interchange when gersen arrived at sul arsam a cold drizzle was damp ening the desert soil and even as he walked from airstrip to depot vivid patches of lichen appeared halfway along the path a small humming object struck his cheek and immediately set to work tear ing at his skin gersen cursed slapped brushed it away he noticed his fellowpassengers similarly engaged and also discerned a sly smile on the face of the depot attendant who wore what appeared to be an ultrasonic bugrepeller with five other passengers gersen waited in the depot no more than a long shed with screened sides the drizzle became a brief drenching downpour then halted and suddenly sunlight struck down at the desert raising wisps of vapor the lichen erupted spores in little pink spurts the shuttlebus appeared a lumbering crude contraption on four big wheels it parked an almost purposefully inconvenient two hundred feet from the depot flapping hands and running to avoid the insects gersen and the other five took themselves aboard for half an hour the bus bumped and jerked across the barrens then in the distance appeared interchange low concrete structures around a tumble of crumbling red sandstone a grove of feathery yellow brown and red trees covered the top of the hill where three or four cottages were visible the bus rumbled into a compound halted the passengers alighted and were directed by yellow arrows into a reception room the demon princes behind a counter making entries in a manual sat a small sallow clerk with white hair carefully waxed up around a gray skullcap the front of which displayed the interchange emblem a pair of clasped hands waving the group to seats he continued with his work finally closing the manual with a snap he looked up pointed a finger you sir i will attend to you if you will come forward the individual selected was a saturnine blackhaired man wear ing the tight black jacket and white breeches of bernal the clerk brought forward a form your name rank olguin file mettier you wish to redeem whom rank sett file mettier the fee to be rescinded twelve thousand five hundred svu you are agent principal or noncommitted i am agent very well produce the fee if you please the money was brought forward the clerk counted it with great care passed it through the slot of a fakemeter and so con vinced himself of its authenticity he wrote a receipt requested a counterreceipt which the bernalese refused to supply until the redeemed individual was brought before him the clerk sat back at this display of waywardness inspected the bernalese narrowly you fail to comprehend sir the watchword at interchange is integrity the fact that i allow you to produce your money is sufficient guar antee that the guest whose fee you are rescinding is at hand and in good condition by your hesitancy and suspicion you not only asperse our reputation but also tarnish the luster of your own qual ity the bernalese shrugged unimpressed by the clerks peroration nevertheless he signed the counterreceipt the clerk nodded stiffly touched a button and an attendant in a red jacket came to conduct the bernalese to a waiting room the clerk shook his head disparagingly pointed arbitrarily at another of the visitors this a stocky scowling man with darkbuff skintone wearing the more or less standardized spacemans garb such as gersens own which gave no clue as to his place of origin the clerk was not impressed by his truculent mien name none of your affair the killing machine the clerk once again leaned back in his chair eh now whats this i require your name sir call me mr inconnu the clerk glared this organization operates without guile or circumvention and appreciates a similar attitude in our business as sociates very well then mr inconnu with a flourish the clerk wrote who is the guest whose fees you are rescinding im ransoming a prisoner roared the stocky man heres your cursed loot lets have my nephew back the clerk pursed his lips in prim disapproval i will expedite this affair because such is our policy your nephew is who cader lord satterbus bring him forth and be quick about it the clerk halflowered his eyelids summoned an attendant lord satterbus suite for this gentleman please he made an airy flourish as if dispelling a bad odor and pointed you sir i will deal with you next the third man was slender and diffident he wore satingreen skintone the embroidered jacket the ruffled gaiters currently fash ionable at mountain wilds on image one of the concourse planets he wanted to conduct his business in a confidential fashion for he leaned over the clerk and spoke in a lowpitched mutter a man nerism the clerk would have none of drawing himself back he exclaimed wont you speak up sir i can hardly hear what you say the mans diffidence was of no great durability he lost his temper there is no reason why this discreditable dealing must be so public you should provide booths for those of us with sensibil ity now then sir declared the clerk you mistake us you must not expect to slink in here as if you were visiting a brothel our service is of the highest respectability we act as an escrow insti tution completely impartial representing all interests in trust and probity so now sir speak your business openly the man flushed his skintoning becoming a muddy gray in that case since you are so open and sincere tell me this who owns this business who gets the profits this subject is not at all relevant to our present business responded the clerk the demon princes neither is my name and address come now speak up since you brim with so much veracity it is ample to know that this is a corporate body owned and managed bv several groups bah eventually the man paid his money and was taken away gersen was selected next he gave his name declared himself uncommit ted in other words an independent entrepreneur who might choose to rescind the fee the usage seemed a special euphemism of interchange of a guest who had outstayed the fifteenday pe riod of prime redemption presumably in order to ask a high ransom and thus turn a profit the clerk nodded curtly these are our current availables he gave gersen a sheet listing several dozen names with the corresponding rescission fees gersen ran his eye down the list near the top he saw audmar daro male wix female rescission svu a few spaces below he found cromarty bella female rescission svu and further darbassin oleg male rescission svu and then eperjetokav alusz iphigenia female rescission svu gersen read the figures blinked a typographical error ten billion svu an unheardof ransom an impossible sum a hundred mil lion was unprecedented though here on this list he glanced down were seven or eight guests with fees established at svu an enormous amount of money but still only a hun the killing machine dredth of ten billion something very strange here who could be expected to pay ten billion svu it was a figure beyond the budgets of most planets let alone individuals gersen inspected the list fur ther after the eight guests valued at svu there was only one other valued at more than svu this was patch myron male rescission svu the clerk who while gersen consulted the list had busied himself with another customer now returned do any of our availables meet your immediate needs naturally i want to make a personal inspection said gersen but from sheer curiosity is the figure svu cor rect or is it a misprint it is correct sir at interchange we dare make no mistakes if i may ask who sponsors this young lady on whose behalf do you act the clerk bridled as you must know unless specifically au thorized to do so we must reserve this information i see well what about the audmar item for a hundred mil lion the cromarty the darbassin the floy the helariope and the others wtio sponsors them we have not been authorized to release this information gersen nodded very well ill take a look around one more matter sir in connection with the eperjetokay item we cannot allow mere gratification of curiosity before you may even inspect this available you must make a deposit of ten thousand svu said sum to apply to the rescission fee im not interested to that extent said gersen as you wish the clerk summoned an attendant who led gersen from the reception room along a corridor that presently opened into a courtyard here the attendant paused which items in particular would you like to inspect gersen considered the man from his flat intonations he was an earthman or possibly native to one of the worlds beyond he was about gersens own age or perhaps younger with hulking stooped shoulders an affable heavyfeatured face toned pale yel low a cap with the interchange emblem sat on top a luxuriant crop the demon princes of waw vellow hair that swooped behind the ears and hack in a drakes tail gersen said in a thoughtful voice as you know im uncom mitted yes sir i have a few svu to invest where it will do the most good you must know what i mean the attendant was not quite sure still he nodded sagely you can help me considerably said gersen im sure you know more concerning the individual items than you tell the usual customer if you direct me along the road to profit then it is only fair that i share with you the attendant was clearly intrigued by the direction ofgersens thinking this all seems eminently sensible provided of course that company rules are observed these are strict and the penalties are correspondingly rigorous there is no question of anything not completely aboveboard gersen brought forth a pair of hundredsvu notes there will be several more depending on how much information you can pro vide i can talk for hours many strange events have occurred at interchange but let us proceed if i understand you rightly you wish to inspect each of the guests who are currently available correct very well in this direction are the class e cubicles for guests whose friends and loved ones are unable to rescind them and who now to speak frankly merely await a slavers offer accommo dations range upward to the socalled imperial gardens on top of the hill guests must keep to their quarters during the morning inspection hours hut during the afternoon are allowed recreation of choice and in the evening there is the social period some of our guests find the experience relaxing and own to a sense of grat itude toward their sponsors guided by the now verbose attendant gersen examined the miserable specimens in the class e cubicles then those in classes d and c before each cubicle hung a placard with information regarding the inmates name status and rescission fee the atten dant who was named armand koshiel pointed out various bar gains possible profitmakers and longshot speculations totally incredible look at him oldest son of tywald fitzbittick the the killing machine richest quarryman of boniface whats forty thousand svu to him hed go a hundred thousand without demur if i had the sum id buy the fellow myself its absolute certainty why has not tywald fitzbittick rescinded the youth for forty thousand koshiel shook his head in perplexity hes a busy man perhaps the thrust of business has distracted him but sooner or later mark my words hell be here and money will flow like water very likely koshiel pointed out several other guests in similar circum stances and expressed puzzlement when gersen remained detached and noncommittal i tell you too much deliberation sometimes leads to disappointment for instance there that very cubicle housed a handsome young woman whose father was dilatory the sponsor lowered the rescission fee to nine thousand svu and yes terday a noncommitted buyer i believe a sardanipolitan ar ranged redemption and would you believe it just as the papers were signed the father arrived but was perforce disappointed since the buyer declared himself satisfied an unpleasant scene ensued gersen agreed that procrastination sometimes resulted in in convenience in my opinion declared koshiel the oikumene conference should appropriate a sum ample to meet all rescission expenses why not most of the guests are residents of the oikumene such an arrangement would facilitate the entire program and there would be considerably less unpleasantness and deprivation gersen suggested that kidnapers might thereby be encouraged and koshiel admitted the possibility on the other hand the sit uation now existing has aspects that puzzle me indeed you are acquainted with the transgalactic insurance and guaranty company they have offices in many of the large cities i have heard the name they specialize in kidnap insurance in fact i believe they sell perhaps or percent of all such insurance for the principal reason that their rates are low why are their rates low because their clients are seldom kidnaped while the clients of their com petitors inevitably find their way to interchange i have frequently speculated that either transgaiactic owns interchange or inter the demon princes change owns transgalactic an indiscreet thought perhaps but there it is indiscreet perhaps but interesting and why not the two enterprises certainly seem to dovetail exactly my way of thinking yes many odd events occur at interchange they came to a class b apartment which housed daro and wix audmar now heres a jolly little couple said armand ko shiel the rescission of course is far too high these two are worth perhaps twenty or thirty thousand depending on your taste their time of prime rescission is up they are available but naturally no one in his right mind would pay so restrictive a fee gersen watched the two children through the oneway window they sat listlessly daro reading wix jerking at a loop of string they were much alike slender darkhaired with the luminous gray eyes of their father gersen turned away odd why should anyone post so high a rescission fee and i notice several other guests with similarly high redemptions what is the story here koshiel licked his lips blinked looked furtively over his shoul der i should not impart this information since it concerns the identity of a sponsor but i am sure this particular sponsor is quite indifferent he is the famous kokor hekkus gersen feigned surprise what kokor hekkus the killing machine the same he has always given us a certain amount of busi ness but at the moment it seems that he dominates the entire en terprise in the last two months he has brought twentysix items to interchange and all save one he values at a hundred million svu and in most cases he collects these children are sponsored by kokor hekkus but why marveled gersen does he have some grand pro ject in mind koshiel grinned a cryptic grin yes indeed yes yes indeed and thereby hangs a tale as the monkey said while describing the cats rearquarters again koshiel glanced furtively to all sides you may know something of kokor hekkus who doesnt among his characteristics is devotion to the aesthetic ideal it seems that kokor hekkus has fallen madly in love with a girl the killing machine who i assure you is the loveliest vision of the universe she is nonpareil how do you know this patience this girl far from returning the affection of kokor hekkus finds herself appalled and nauseated by the thought of him where can she flee how can she hide herself the galaxy is too small kokor hekkus is indefatigable he will seek her no matter where she takes herself there is no haven for this delightful crea ture save one interchange not even kokor hekkus dares to vi olate the rules of interchange first he would never be allowed the use of its facilities second the interchange management would spare no effort in punishing him kokor hekkus perhaps scorns peril but he is not rash so this girl acts as her own sponsor she establishes her rescission fee at ten billion svu indeed she wished to set it higher at a thousand billion but this was not allowed so now we have this ludicrous circumstance the girl serene and secure in the imperial gardens at interchange while kokor hekkus sweats and reeks in the extremity of passion and indeed he will not be denied he lacks the cash somewhere he must find ten billion svu i begin to understand said gersen kokor hekkus is by no means baffled koshiel declared with verve he fights fire with fire the girl has used the appointments of interchange to thwart him he will use the same to gain his will ten billion is a large number but it is only a hundred times a hundred million so now kokor hekkus ranges the oikumene kid naping the loved ones of the hundred wealthiest folk alive on the day that the hundredth pays the hundred million kokor hekkus will claim the person of ajusz iphigenia eperjetokay for she is available a highly romantic individual this kokor hekkus in every sense of the word said gersen koshiel did not notice the siccant quality to gersens remark indeed think of it she must wait day after day watching the figure of ten billion become smaller and smaller already he has collected for twenty of the guests he has sponsored every day sees the arrival of more and meanwhile the girl can do nothing she is caught in her own trap hmmf a sorry situation at least from the standpoint of the young lady her home is where ii if dlmon princfs koshiel shook his head as to thdt i hear onl rumor indeed the source of all mv information the rumor in this case is beyond the belief of sensible men like ourselves she is said to have declared herself a native ofnevernever land the planet rhamber thamber gersen was indeed surprised thamber the world of myth of witches and seaserpents gallant knights and magic forests was the locale of childrens fairy tales also he recalled with a sudden tingle the home ofhormagaunts thamber indeed exclaimed koshie with a laugh and an ex pressive gesture it now occurs to me that if you have ten billion svu and vast courage here would be an excellent speculation ko kor hekkus if he must kidnap the scions of another hundred wealthy folk would certainly pay your price just my luck to rescind this nonpareil then have her sicken and die on my hands kokor hekkus and i would both be bereft as they spoke they had been wandering along the row of class b and class a apartments koshiel paused pointed in at a middle aged man who seemed to be drawing a diagram in a notebook here said koshiel is myron patch another guest sponsored by kokor hekkus at a rescission of svu highly overpriced if you ask me unlike the girl from thamber he gave gersen a lascivious wink and nudge of the elbow gersen frowned in at myron patch an undistinguished fellow of medium stature plump with an easy goodnatured countenance the rescission fee aroused his interest why precisely be hind the figure behind the enforced visit of myron patch to inter change was a story he asked koshiel can i talk to this man certainly he is available if you think you can mulct kokor hekkus of a sum in extent of what is it svu a ridiculous figure by all means go to it the apartments are naturally equipped with spycells and mi crophones no said koshiel and for a very good reason there is noth ing to be gained by listening nevertheless said gersen we will take precautions let me speak to the man koshiel touched the button that by ringing a small chime ap prised the guest in question that his attention was required myron patch looked up came slowly to the front of the apartment koshiel inserted a key into a socket a panel snapped aside myron patch the killing machine looked forth at gersen at first with hope and then perplexity ger sen took koshiel by the shoulders moved him close to the panel turned him so that he faced into the apartment now sing loudly koshiel grinned foolishly i know only lullabies from my youth sing lullabies then but loudly and with legato koshiel began to yelp a discordant song gersen motioned to the even more perplexed patch stand close patch pressed his face close to the panel gersen asked why are you here patchs mouth drooped its a long story tell me in as few words as possible patch sighed mournfully i am an engineer and manufacturer i undertook a complicated ob for a certain man a criminal i now know him to be we disagreed he seized my person and brought me here the ransom represents the money under dispute koshiel started a new song gersen asked the criminal is kokor hekkus myron patch nodded dolefully do you know him personally patch said something that gersen could not understand for the fervor ofkoshiels lullaby patch repeated i said i know his agent who comes often to krokmole can you make contact with the agent on krokmole yes not here very well i will rescind your fee gersen tapped koshiels shoulder you may stop we return to the office you are finished there are others to see bargains true bar gains gersen hesitated can i see the woman whom kokor hekkus is pursuing koshiel shook his head not unless you pay ten thousand svu for the privilege in essence she refuses to see anyone even em ployees like myself who would be happy to relieve her tedium and relax her understandable tensions very well then gersen produced another three hundred svu which koshiel bedazzled and dreamy after so much talk of millions and billions pocketed with a murmur of unenthusiastic thanks we return to the office from popular handbook to the planets rd edition krokinole third largest planet of the rigel concourse fourteenth in orbital

returning from sasani aboard gersens model b locater my ron patch explained in greater detail his dealings with kokor hek kus and indeed elaborated upon the whole course of his life originally a native of earth patch had been a victim of the tex ahoma riots and considered himself lucky to escape with his life he arrived on krokinole penniless accepted work as a barnacle scraper for the card estuary docking company presently estab lished a small machine shop at pacris the whitelock capital prospering and expanding in the course of eighteen years patch had become owner and manager of the patch engineering works the largest such enterprise of cumberland he had also achieved a reputation for versatility and ingenuity to such a degree that when seuman otwal brought him a set of bizarre specifications patch was intrigued but not surprised seuman otwal as patch described him was a man somewhat younger than himself with a strikingly ugly face distinguished by a long downcurving nose that almost seemed to meet a sharp up tilted chin seuman otwal had attempted no subterfuge he identified him self as an agent of kokor hekkus and had appeared content when patch declared himself willing to work for the devil himself pro vided his money passed silently through the fakemeter with the relationship established on a realistic footing otwal produced his plans he wanted patch to design and construct a walking fort in the semblance of a monster centipede seventysix feet long and twelve feet high the mechanism was to consist of eighteen segments each equipped with a pair of legs the fort as seuman otwal termed it must be able to move at a speed of at s the demon princes least forty miles per hour on synchronized smoothly operating legs it must be able to spurt liquid fire from its tongue exude noxious gas and tire energy beams through ports in its head patch declared himself capable of contriving the mechanism and with natural in terest inquired its purpose seuman otwal at first seemed dis pleased then explained kokor hekkus fascination with intricate and macabre machines kokor hekkus otwal went on to say had recently been victimized by an obstreperous group of savages and the fort would speak to them in a language they understood warming to his subject otwal favored patch with a lengthy disquisition on his subject of terror according to otwal terror was of two varieties the instinctive and the conditioned to produce a maximum effect both types should be excited simultaneously ei ther alone was capable of being contained kokor hekkus method was to identify and analyze these factors then in his application he selected and intensified the factors of maximum potency one cannot frighten a fish with talk of drowning declared seuman otwal the exposition continued for half an hour with patch becom ing increasingly uncomfortable after otwal had departed he wres tled long and hard with his conscience over the morality of building the mechanical horror here gersen inquired did you ever suspect that seuman otwal might be kokor hekkus himself oh indeed until one day kokor hekkus himself stepped into the shop he did not resemble seuman otwal in the least describe him if you will patch frowned this is difficult he has no remarkable char acteristics he is about your stature he is agile and nervous his head is neither large nor small his features are regular and well spaced he wears somber skintone and garments in the style of the whitelock elders his manner is subdued almost over courteous but it is not convincing nor is it intended to convince all the while as he speaks softly and listens attentively his eyes gleam and one knows he is thinking of the strange sights he has seen and the odd deeds he has done there was an interruption now from the two children who wished to have rigel pointed out to them gersen indicated the white blaze dead ahead then returned to patch who continued with the description of his mental turmoil he had suffered so he de the killing machine dared the mil range of qualms misgivings and apprehensions but at last decided to be guided by two considerations first he had already compromised himself especially since money had been ad vanced to him to the sum of svu and second if he did not build the machine there were a dozen other shops that would do so so work progressed even though patch was uneasily aware that he assisted in the creation of an evil device gersen listened without comment and in fact felt no great dis approbation patch seemed an inoffensive individual who had the misfortune to lack an automatic morality construction continued the fort neared completion kokor hekkus now made his appearance for the purpose of inspection much to patchs dismay he declared himself profoundly dissatisfied he derided the leg action which he characterized as awkward and obviously nonorganic in his opinion the fort would not deceive a child patch at first appalled gradually recovered his wits he brought forward the specifications and demonstrated that he had performed to the letter of his instructions nowhere and at no time had he been supplied unambiguous information regarding leg mo tion kokor hekkus was unmoved he declared the object totally unacceptable and demanded that patch make suitable changes patch angrily disavowed responsibility he would gladly make changes but he must ask more money kokor hekkus drew back in outrage he made a harsh cutting gesture with his hand to signify that patch had gone too far patch he declared had not fulfilled his contract which was thereby void he demanded return of all moneys advanced namely svu patch refused whereupon kokor hekkus bowed and departed patch armed himself but to no avail four days later he was set upon by three men beaten in a thorough but disinterested manner hustled into a spaceboat conveyed to interchange where his ransom was set at svu patch had neither friends relatives nor business associates owing to certain debts incurred in the process of expansion forced sale of his engineering shop would bring no more than svu he had given up hope of redemption and had resigned himself to slavery then gersen had appeared patch hesitantly inquired gersens motives he felt boundless grat itude he recognized gersens generosity but surely there was more to the situation than this gersen felt no impulse to confide in patch assume he said the demon princes that i am acquainted with the patch engineering and construction company that i consider the ransom as constituting payment for a percent interest in the organization patch rather forlornly declared himself satisfied with the ar rangement do you wish formal acknowledgment of partnership you might write a memorandum to the effect essentially i want control over company policy for an indefinite period not to exceed five years as to profits i have no immediate need of money and you may apply all such to repayment of the sum advanced patch was not too pleased with the scheme but had no basis for argument a sudden thought came to him and he rubbed his face nervously by any chance do you intend to have further deal ings with kokor hekkus since you ask yes patch licked his lips allow me at once to register a percent negative vote if in your mind there is even a percent misgiving the negative votes will defeat this reckless ambition gersen grinned all percent cries out in favor of recovering from kokor hekkus money illegally extorted from company funds patch bowed his head so be it rigel flared across the sky gersen located alphanor daro and wix became effervescent with excitement gersen watched them wryly as soon as they returned to the dim old house in the sun struck hills above taube they would rush to the arms of their father and mother the kidnaping the imprisonment the voyage home would become vague gersen would be forgotten gersen mused upon the vagaries of fate that had molded him into a ruefully he supplied the word a monomaniac what if by some fantastic set of circumstances he succeeded in avenging the mount pleasant cataclysm upon all five of the demon princes what then would he be able to retire to buy country land to woo and wed to breed children or would the role of nemesis have become such an ingrained element in his nature that never could he draw back never could he know of evil men without wanting to take their lives it was all too possible and sadly the impetus would come not from indignation or moral outrage but from reflex a passionless reaction and the only satisfaction to be derived would be that of fulfilling a minor physiological need such as belching or scratching an itch as always such reflections drove gersen into a fit of melan the killing machine choly and during the remainder of the voyage he was even more terse and gruff than ever the children inspected him wonderingly though without fear for they had learned at least to trust him down to alphanor down to the continent scythia down to the antiquated garreu province spaceport at marquari here gersen communicated by visiphone with duschane audmar whose face was vaguely haggard gersen guessed that he had given much in trospection to gersens mission he inquired briefly as to the health of his children and accepted gersens reassurance with a curt nod there was no airservice between marquari and taube and spaceships were proscribed except at the spaceports gersen herded the eager children aboard the coast dispatchship a broadbeamed vessel with cargo below and passengers above which required a day and a night to make the fivehundredmile run down the coast to taube here he hired the ancient glidecar and rumbled up the long slope to the manse of duschane audmar the children jumped from the car and ran pellmell without a backward glance for ger sen into the arms of their mother who stood waiting in the open doorway her face worked with the effort to hold back tears and gersen was conscious of an emptiness within himself for he had come to feel affection for the children he entered the house and now secure in their home daro and wix ran up hugged and kissed him audmar came forth conducted him to the austere room where they had first spoken gersen made his accounting kokor hekkus needs ten billion svu he hopes to raise this amount by extorting a hundred million from a hundred of the wealthiest folk of the oikumene he has attained perhaps a third of his goal and money is rapidly coming in he desires the money in order to ransom a young woman who to evade him has taken refuge at interchange under a rescission fee often billion svu hmmf said audmar this woman must be extravagantly attractive for kokor hekkus to value her at this figure so it would seem although any object valued at this figure must be inherently desirable said gersen i would have inspected the woman but she functioning as her own sponsor charges ten thousand svu a look presumably in order to discourage the cu riosity of such as myself duschane audmar nodded the information may or may not be worth a hundred million svu to the institute from which the hp demon princfs money naturally comes my children are hack with me i am of course grateful for this but i tear that i have allowed my emotions to interfere with rm reason i fear that i have compromised myself gersen made no comment i iis private opinion was to the same effect still the institute had only itself to blame should it choose it undoubtedly could destroy kokor hekkus a second matter of interest the young womans name is alusz iphigenia epere tokay she is native to the planet thamber or so she claims thamber audmar at last was interested is this a serious avowal or facetiousness i believe that she makes a serious claim to this effect interesting even if all cockalorum lie looked sidewise at gersen you have something else to tell me you gave me a certain amount ot expense money i used part of it in a manner i considered pertinent which is to say i bought a controlling interest in the patch engineering and construction company ofpatns on krokmole audmar nodded graciously it was the obvious thing to do the opportunity occurred at interchange myron patch was sponsored by kokor hekkus with a rescission of svu the figure interested me i made inquiry and when patch stated that he was able to establish contact with kokor hekkus i re deemed him taking the partnership as security audmar rose to his feet walked to the door returned with a tray containing cordials find said gersen that myron patch has been building a mechanical monster for kokor hekkus a walking fort m the shape of a centipede of eighteen segments audmar sipped his cordial held the glass aloft eyed the rose and violet glintmgs you need not account for the money he said it has paid for a few items of interesting information and as an incidental concomitant brought two pleasant children back to their home he finished his cordial set the glass down with a click gersen understanding more from what was left unsaid than what was said rose to his feet took his leave patns capital of the cumberland ssociated parishes rambled and sprawled for miles along the card river estuary with residential suburbs along the shores of ock eake there were many thousand yearold structures in the old quarter three and fourstory build the killing machine mgs of rough black brick narrow fronted with tall narrow windows and high pitched gables upnver in sevenhundredyearold new town stood the famous river arches eleven monumental river straddling structures of a type unknown elsewhere m the human universe eighthundredfeet high they stood truncated triangles with twohundredfoot arches carved from the base each was iden tical save for color each housed shops studios service areas in the legs with apartments for the urban elite above between the arches of new town and the black brick structures of old quarter spread a dingy industrial area and here was myron patchs shop in min gled eagerness irresolution pride anxiety and wounded dignity he escorted gersen to the main entrance it was a more imposing operation than gersen had expected occupying an area two hundredfeet long by a hundredfeet wide with parts and material storage above patch was depressed to find the shop locked and silent it would seem that in a time of stress ones employees would pitch in keep the wheels rolling so to speak or even make some attempt to rescind the fees of their employer over a hundred men and women derived their livelihood from me and not one so much as made inquiry from the interchange representative presumably they were all occupied m seeking new employ ment gersen suggested be that as it may i am not gratified patch flung the doors wide ushered gersen into the cavernous interior pointed to the section that had been walled off from the main plant seuman otwal insisted on absolute secrecy patch explained i used only trusted employees and then at otwals insistence i put them through a hypnotic process m which i ordered them to forget everything they saw in workshop b after they passed through the door also he said musingly while they were in the hypnotic condition i added the suggestion that they work with greater zeal and accuracy that they feel neither thirst hunger loquacity nor fatigue during the working hours and i must say that for a space i have never seen such an admirable set of workers i was about to extend the plan to the entire working force when i was kidnaped indeed my first thought was that i had encountered bravos from the fabricators protective guild he led gersen across the shop past various forges cutters molds welding ngs and lathes to a door placarded with the universal symbol for keep out a red ihe demon princes palmprint patch ran his finders over the code buttons to the lock since you are a partner there can be no secrets from you precisely said gersen the door slid aside the two passed through an anteroom into workshop b there was the walking fort patchs habit of mild understatement had not prepared gersen for the ferocious aspect of the device the head was equipped with six scythelike mandibles and a collar of long barbed prongs the eye was a single faceted band the ingestion orifice was a conical maw at the top of the head with a pair of jointed arms at each side behind were the eighteen segments each suspended from a pair of highrising jointed legs these encased in a rugose yellow skin at the far stern was a nubbin like a second head equipped with an eye and another set of barbed prongs the torso had not yet been finished and still exhibited a metallic sheen what do you think of it asked patch anxiously as if hoping for vindication or endorsement highly impressive said gersen and patch seemed satisfied id like to know what he wants it for watch patch mounted the head of the object using the prongs as a ladder he stepped into the maw and disappeared ger sen was alone in the room with the seventysixfoot engine of fright it could spew poison from its prongs dart fire from its eyes a sweep of the mandible could slash through a treetrunk gersen looked right and left then retired into the anteroom patch seemed a good fellow sincerely grateful but why put temptation in his way he positioned himself in the anteroom where he could not be seen from the head and watched patch had started the energy system the object insensibly had come alive the head gave a shake the prongs rattled the mandibles clicked from vents at the side of the head came a wild wailing scream gersen stood quivering the scream died now the object moved the legs of alternate segments rising and swinging ahead while the others thrust back backward and forward moved the device the jointed legs work ing smoothly if a trifle stiffly now the metal centipede halted pranced sidewise a step two steps three steps then the near side of legs seemed to collapse the object toppled fell with a clanging thud against the wall gersen would have been crushed had he re mained in the shop unavoidable doubtless a flaw in the machin ery a clumsiness on the part of the operator from the topside thr killing machine maw scrambled patch round face pale and clammy eyes big with consternation gersen watching from the anteroom would have sworn that his concern was real that patch was horrified by the thought of what he might see patch jumped to the floor peered back and forth under the hulk gersen gersen behind you said gersen patch jumped around and if the relief on his face were not genuine then gersen thought the mim ingpads had lost a great performer patch gasped his thankfulness that gersen was safe the phas ing mechanism for the starboard bank of legs had failed it was a deficiency that he had not previously recognised not that it made any great difference one way or the other since now the object must be scrapped he led the way back into the main shop locked the door behind them tomorrow he said its back to work i dont know what has happened to my old customers hut i always satisfied them in the past and perhaps they will bring their business back to us gersen stood looking across to workshop b exactly what faults did kokor hekkus find unacceptable patch made a wry face the leg action he said it did not produce the effect he desired the motion was too stiff and rigid only a soft supple looping motion would serve i pointed out the difficulties and the expense of such a system indeed i doubt if a durable mechanism could be worked out considering the mass of the fort and the terrain to be traversed which i understand is ex tremely rugged my idea is this said gersen kokor hekkus extracted almost half a million svu from us i want to get that money back patch smiled a sad tremulous smile we should be wiser to ignore him we do not need his class of trade let bygones be bygones that is the wise course come into the office we will go over the accounts no said gersen i plan to leave these matters entirely in your hands in the matter of the walking fort however i feel that we must regain our money and we can do it in a safe legitimate fashion llow patch asked dubiously we must modify the fort so that it functions to suit kokor hekkus then we will sell it to him for the full original price possibly but there are difficulties he may not now require the demon princes the fort or he may not have the money or even more likely we wont be able to modify the device to suit him gersen reflected somewhere ive seen a means to overcome the difficulty across the oikumene is vanello something of a resort world for the region back of scorpio at one of the religious festivals a platform supported by a long flexible stem raises a priest ess dressed in flower petals another similar platform raises a table supporting certain symbolic objects as i recall a book a beaker and a human skull no matter the priestess performs rites while the stems twine about each other i learned that the stems are built up of several dozen smaller tubes each containing a magnetic slurry iron powder in a viscous liquid reacting to fields from in ternal windings these tubes selectively contract with great force by proper circuitry any contortion of the tubes is possible it seems to me that this system might be applied to the legs of the walking fort patch scratched his small round chin if what you say is cor rect i am inclined to agree first we will want to consult seuman otwal to assure ourselves that kokor hekkus still needs the fort patch heaved a deep sigh raised his arms let them flap down to his sides so be it though i would rather deal with adders but when patch called the hotel that seuman otwal was wont to patronize he found that mr otwal was not currently in resi dence and the date of his return was indefinite patch heard the news with vast relief only at gersens prompt ing did he leave his name and the request that mr otwal call as soon as possible the hotel clerks face vanished patch became cheerful once again after all we have no need for their filthy money derived from the most vicious crimes imaginable perhaps we can sell the monster as a curio or even mount seats on the back and advertise it as an eccentric charabanc have no fear kirth gersen your money is secure im not interested in the money said gersen i want kokor hekkus patch evidently considered this an odd or even perverse incli nation for what purpose i want to kill him said gersen then regretted his lapse from taciturnity from kokor hekkus the killing machine chapter iv of the demon prmces by caril carphen elusidarian press new wexford aloysius vega ifmalagate the woe can be characterized by the single word grim and howard alan treesongby incompre hensible then lens larque viole falushe and kokor hekkus all lay claim to the word fantastic which one exceeds the other two in fantasy it is an amusing if prof itless speculation consider viole falushes palace of love lens larques monument the vast and incredible outrages kokor hekkus has visited upon humanity such extrava gances are impossible to comprehend let alone compare it is fair to say however that kokor hekkus has captured the popular imagination with his grotesque and eerie humor let us listen to what he has to say in an abstract from the famous telephoned address the theory and practice of ter ror to the students of cervantes university to produce the maximum effect one must identify and intensify those basic dreads already existing within the subject it is a mistake to regard the fear of death as the most extreme fear i find a dozen other types to be more poignant such as the fear of inability to protect a cherished dependent the fear of disesteem the fear of noisome contact the fear of being made afraid my goal is to produce a nightmare quality of fright the demon princes and to maintain it over an appreciable duration a night mare is the result of the undermind exploring its most sensitive areas and so serves as an index for the operator once an apparently sensitive area is located the operator to the best of his ingenuity employs means to emphasize to dramatize this fear then augment it by orders of mag nitude if the subject fears heights the operator takes him to the base of a tall cliff attaches him to a slender obviously fragile or frayed cord and slowly raises him up the face of the cliff not too far and not too close to the face scale must be emphasized together with the tantalizing but in feasible possibility of clinging to the vertical surface the lifting mechanism should be arranged to falter and jerk to intensify claustrophobic dread the subject is conveyed into a pit or excavation inserted headforemost into a narrow and constricted runnel that slants downward and occasion ally changes direction by sharp and cramping angles whereupon the pit or excavation is filled and subject must proceed ahead for the most part in a downward direction seuman otwal made no appearance during the first month nor yet the second during this time patch called his employees back to work solicited business and presently the patch engineering and construction company was once more in full clangorous swing gersen took upon himself the modification of the walking fort he communicated with the local office of the utcs mentioned the annual floration rite at vanello described the sinuous supports to the fortyfive sepalic platforms and minutes later received a port folio of tables graphs schematics and material specifications he took these to patch who scrutinized them nodded sagely said ah yes ah yes ah yes after which he heaved a do lorous sigh and so at vast expense we perfect this ridiculous hur lothrumbo to find that neither seuman otwal nor kokor hekkus nor anyone else will pay for it what then well sue said gersen patch snorted returned to a study of the data gersen had set before him finally he said grudgingly the system is clearly fea sible and will definitely be more flexible than the jointed legs universal technical consultative service the killing machine however the design of the phasing nodes the coupling to the mod ulators and the modulators themselves are far beyond my capabili ties there is a highly competent group of cybernetic engineers as i see it this is basically a cybernetic problem a hundred yards up the street and i suggest that we contract the whole matter over to them as you wish two months later seuman otwal had not appeared after ve hement protest patch communicated once more with the halkshire hotel but seuman otwal had not been seen gersen began to feel spasms of uneasiness and cast about for another means to make contact with kokor hekkus the fort itself so he reasoned by its very nature should provide information he went to the files and brought forth the entire set of plans specifications and correspon dence spread all before him nowhere appeared any categorical identification of the planet on which the metal monster was intended to function gersen began all over again seeking this time for some indirect indication to planet x for information implicit in other data there was no mention of airconditioning equipment evidently the atmosphere was standard or nearstandard in the specifications a section read the vehicle must under full load be able to traverse slopes of up to at a speed not less than ten miles per hour to negotiate easily and certainly broken ground such as a field of irregularlyshaped rock fragments up to six feet in diameter to pass across cre vasses gaps or ditches up to twenty feet wide elsewhere a notation stated energy requirements have been calculated on the basts of percent thermodynamic efficiency with an overperformance factor of percent gersen set to work with sliderule calcultte and integraph he knew the mass of the fort he knew the energy required to propel the vehicle up a slope at a speed of ten miles an hour from the demon princes this information and the overperformance factor he could calcu late the surface gravity of planet x which came to a value of standard implying a diameter of between and miles so far so good but hardly definitive information again gersen studied the specifications they were extremely exact and allowed no elasticity with fourteen color sketches depicting the fort from all sides the object was to be enameled m various shades of black dark brown pink and chalkblue even the enamels and pigments were specified by means of graphs showing wavelength plotted against reflectance one variable had not been indicated mused gersen the color of the impinging light thoughtfully he called in the plants color engineer and requested a set of plaques en ameled m accordance with the graph while he waited gersen investigated another idea the speci fications were so exact as to suggest similarity or identity to an actual living creature the creature would be awesome indeed but this was consistent with the philosophy of kokor hekkus he pre pared a precis detailing the characteristics of the fort which he submitted to the utcs twelve minutes later he received a report to the effect that no creature of these taxonomic indexes could be located in the standard references bestiaries monographs or ex ploration notices many worlds hosted creatures with points of sim ilarity this was a matter of common knowledge the planet idora sadal suud xi exhibited a segmented waterworm ranging to thirty feet in length on earth were various miniature species the krokmole highlands was home to the noxious roofrunner there was stated the report a curiously apt reference m an old volume of childrens tales legends of old thamber here gersen bent sud denly over the sheet the exerpt read easing and squeezing gliding and sliding walking and stalking down the mountain it comes on thirtysix supple hooks dreadful and dire is the creature in its unhurried haste as long as the length of twelve dead victims now we are lost cried princess sozanella shall we succumb to the monster or give ourselves to the horrid taddo trolls hope hold to hope dantinet whispered for this is the ancient foe of the trolls it turns its black face away to look upon the taddo it rears to show its blue belly the the killing machine color of putridity the trolls whimper and scream but too late and the monster tosses them into its maw now we hasten away through the glooms and passages for once the dread has performed a benefit gersen slowly put down the report thamber another reference to the world of myth xavar mankinello the color engineer came in with tabs enameled to kokor hekkus specifications ger sen with as much impatience as he ever allowed himself arranged them beside the depicted fort there was an obvious difference mankinello bent anxiously over the desk theres been no mistake i took great pains gersen studied the tiles assuming that this is so what color light will bring the tiles to the same colors as the sketch mankinello considered the tiles are unquestionably cooler than the sketch lets step into the lab in the laboratory mankinello put the tiles under a color gen erator presumably youre interested in standard incandescence standard starlight i suppose thats close to the same thing somewhat different due to the stellar atmospheres but i can easily code for the stellar progression lets start with about he turned a wheel flicked a switch checked with a com parator close he turned the wheel there it is he glanced through a port see for yourself gersen peered through the opening the tiles were now iden tical to the colors of the sketch color temperature class k ill tell you exactly mankinello consulted a reference class g gersen took sketch tiles returned to the room he had pre empted for his office facts were accumulating the planet in ques tion attended a g star and was characterized by a gravity of g references to the legendary world thamber had occurred with peculiar frequency gersen called utcs requested a search for references to the location hypothetical fictional myth ical hysterical or otherwise of the lost world thamber half an hour later a folder was delivered to him with several dozen extracts there was little of interest the most circumstantial information being contained in a traditional bit of schoolyard doggerel the demon princes set a course from the old dog star a point to the north of achernar sleight your ship to the verge extreme and dead ahead shines thambers gleam the information contained in the first two lines might be applied but thereafter the directions were meaningless there was no more information to be derived from a study of the fort gersen decided that he had come to a dead end somewhere in space hung a world where kokor hekkus planned to take a metal monster this world might be home to alusz iphigenia eperjetokay who valued herself at ten billion svu this world might be the thamber of myth but there was no way of knowing myron patch appeared in the doorway his round face was taut and accusing for a moment he looked at gersen then said in a portentous voice seuman otwal is here from the preface to a concise histofy of the oikumene by albert b hall human evolution has never gone in a smooth flow but always in a cyclical pulse which as history is scanned seems almost convulsive the tribes mingle and merge to form a race then comes a time of expulsion of migration isolation differentiation into new tribes for more than a thousand years this latter process has been on the ascendant as the human race has swept across space isolation special conditions inbreeding have created dozens of new racial subtypes but now there is stasis in the oikumene with many comings and goings and it seems that perhaps the pendulum is about to swing back but only in the oikumene folk still fare beyond ever outward never has isolation been more easy never has personal freedom been so cheap the eventualities anyones guess is good the oiku mene may be forced to expand other oikumenes may come into existence conceivably men may collide with the realm of another race for there is abundant evidence that other spacetraveling peoples have gone before us how and why to disappear no one can say where is seuman otwal gersen asked here in the shop no here in patris he wonders why i left the message patchs expression became more accusing than ever i didnt know the demon princes what to say humiliating to deal politely with a man who has wronged you swallowing ashes what did you say patch made a helpless gesture what could i say except the truth that we had worked out a means to alter the fort we the reference naturally was to the patch engineering and construction company did he seem interested patch gave a grudging nod he claims to have new instructions from his superiors he will be here shortly gersen sat thinking seuman otwal might or might be one of kokor hekkus various identities kokor hekkus might or might not be aware that the weasel of skouse was kirth gersen he rose to his feet wtien seuman otwal comes receive him in your office introduce me as as howard wall plant manager or chief engi neer something of the sort dont be surprised by anything i say or he added by way of afterthought by any change in my ap pearance patch gave a stiff assent and turned away gersen went to the main washroom where a dispenser offered a selection of skin tonings selecting an exotic duotone purplishmaroon with green luster he changed his color and parting his hair in the middle combed it down over his cheeks in the style of the wtiitelock con noisseur he had no change of clothes to complete the transforma tion and so donned a white laboratory smock still dissatisfied he clipped on a pair of gold filigree elfshells over his ears together with a gold nasal ridge that had been forgotten by one of the more foppish of the engineers bedizened and fashionable gersen now failed to recognize himself in the mirror he crossed the corridor to patchs suite the receptionist gave him a wondering look gersen walked past her and into patchs office patch looking up in startlement hastily concealed the weapon he had been inspecting he rose to his feet puffed out his cheeks yes sir what is your wish i am howard wall said gersen howard wall patch frowned heavily do i know you the name is somehow familiar it should be said gersen i just mentioned it ten minutes ago the auvg machine oh gersen yes indeed patch cleared his throat you gave me quite a start he resumed his seat why the elaborate rega lia for seuman otwal he doesnt know me and dont want him to patchs face became dour i dislike catering to the trade of suspected criminals it reflects upon the good name of patch and this is our most valuable asset gersen ignored the obvious rejoinder dont forget i am howard wall your production manager wtiatever you like replied patch with dignity five minutes later the receptionist announced seuman otwal gersen went to the door slid it open seuman otwal came jauntily forward his skin was strikingly twotoned russet and black he had a highbridged hooked nose a long sharp jaw and prowlike chin he wore tall pointed earshells of jet and nacre which gave his head a narrow jutting bony look gersen tried to project upon him the image of the man he had confronted on bissoms end was there similarity conceivably otwal seemed of generally similar phy sique but the facial indexes of the two were at variance gersen had heard reports of malleable flesh but here was something more than wadded cheeks or a splayed nose seuman otwal glanced inquisitively at gersen then at patch who had risen uncertainly to his feet my general manager said patch howard wall otwal nodded politely your custom must be increasing i was forced to it grumbled patch somebody had to look after the business when i was away i have you to thank for it otwal made an airy gesture a matter to be forgotten my employer has his foibles he is by no means unfair though he wants fair value for his generous remuneration mr wall knows whom i represent certainly he understands the need for discretion gersen nodded with the proper degree of solemnity seuman otwal gave a slight shrug very well mr patch i accept this so now patch jerked his thumb toward gersen with rather less suavity than gersen liked and spoke with heavy irony mr wall under stands the nature of our previous difficulties and has some new ideas the demon princes otwal seemed not to notice patchs lack of enthusiasm i shall be glad to listen first a question said gersen is the party you represent still interested in the device as specified in the original contract such conceivably might be the case said otwal if our re quirements are satisfied my employer was appalled by the awkward motion of the first version the legs moved stiffly with an angular scissorlike effect this was the only difficulty inquired gersen it was certainly the most important one presumably the object is built to the wellknown quality standards of patch engineering indeed it is declared patch the difficulty then no longer exists said gersen mr patch and i have devised a system by which any required motion can be programed and enforced upon the legs if so and if the system meets our standards of reliability then this is good news indeed we had best consider the matter of recompense said gersen here i speak for mr patch of course he wants the full sum of the original contract plus the cost of modifications and the normal percentage of profit otwal considered a moment minus of course those devel opmental funds already advanced svu believe to be the i sum patch began to sputter otwal could not restrain a faint smile there have been additional expenses said gersen to a to tal of svu this must be included in the total reckoning otwal started to protest but gersen held up his hand we do not care to argue this point we are prepared to deliver the mechanism but we insist upon payment which is as i stated it of course if your principal wishes to make further representations we shall be glad to listen to him in person otwal gave a cool laugh no matter i agree my principal is anxious to take delivery still and no denigration intended we would prefer to deal with your principal in order to minimize all misunderstanding impossible he is involved elsewhere but why be concerned over trifles i have full power to act on his behalf patch began to make restless movements his prerogatives were ruthlessly being accroached by this socalled partner whose only the killing machine contribution to patch engineering and construction was the re scission at interchange gersen kept one eye on patch and one on otwal neither was predictable we accept this gersen told otwal now we need another installment of developmental money approximately half a million svu impossible snapped otwal my principal is engaged in an enterprise where he must concentrate all his resources patch began to fume you pay me then you gersen said hastily assume that the device is completed and ready for delivery how can we feel confident of collecting our money you have my personal reassurance said otwal bah barked patch that is not enough you cheated me before youd do it again if you had the chance otwal looked pained and turned to gersen if we fail to meet our obligations a ridiculous speculation you need only withhold delivery how simple it all is wtiat would we do then with a thirtysixlegged fort asked gersen no we must insist on onethird payment now another third upon approval of the leg action and the final third upon de livery i think they ought to pay punitive damages muttered patch ten thousand isnt enough it should be a hundred thousand two hundred thousand my discomfort my anxiety my wrangling continued otwal demanded details as to the new leg action gersen replied in diffuse terms we use flexible mem bers shaped precisely to specifications they are actuated by hydraulic tubes of a special variety controlled by electrical modu lations of infinite range otwal finally gave in we could easily take our business to another concern but time is of the essence wlien will you guar antee delivery there must be a penalty clause in the new contract we have already been far too lenient again disputation ensued and at one point patch rose to his feet leaned forward over his desk to shake his fist otwal disdain fully drew back apace the matter finally was adjusted otwal insisted upon seeing the halfcompleted fort and grumbling patch led the way with gersen bringing up the rear as he walked gersen studied otwals form the demon princes a man with the light sure tread of a panther broad in the shoulder narrow of hip very like billy windle but also like millions of other active and muscular men otwal was surprised to find technicians already hard at work he turned to gersen with a rueful grin you anticipated my agree ment certainly after driving the hardest bargain possible otwal laughed an accurate appraisal of the situation you are a clever man mr wall have you ever been beyond never i am orthodox and unadventurous strange said seuman otwal there is a certain air almost an emanation that clings to those who have worked beyond i thought i sensed it in you of course i am often wrong in my suppositions he turned back to the fort well everything seems to be correct except of course for the surface finish to satisfy our curiosity said gersen perhaps you can de scribe its ultimate purpose certainly my principal spends a good deal of time on a re mote planet beset with barbarians when he wishes to go abroad they harass him severely he wants security and this the fort will provide then the fort is purely defensive in nature of course my principal is a muchmaligned man i find him quite reasonable he is daring enterprising even reckless and cer tainly the most imaginative man alive but in all aspects reason able gersen nodded thoughtfully i understand that he makes an imaginative use of the force of terror far better the fear of an act otwal stated than the brutal act itself do you not agree possibly but it occurs to me that a man so obsessed with the abstract notion of terror must suffer inordinate terrors on his own account otwal seemed startled i had not considered this he said i think that i agree an emphatic man lives a hundred lives he senses joys sorrows triumphs despairs and yes terrors beyond the ho rizon of the common man he exults greatly he suffers greatly he fears greatly but never would he arrange matters differently what would you consider his supreme fear the killing machine it is no secret death he fears nothing else and in fact has taken extravagant steps to avoid it you speak with great authority mused gersen you know kokorhekkuswell as well as anyone and of course i am an imaginative man in my own right i also declared patch still i do not conduct my financial business through interchange seuman otwal laughed quietly a sad episode that i suggest we consign to the past and forget forever easy for you to say patch complained you werent locked up away from your business for over two months they returned to the office where otwal rather gloomily so it seemed signed a bank voucher on a numbered account for the sum of half a million svu then once more gracious departed gersen immediately took the money to the local branch of the bank of rigel where the check was verified and the money credited to the account of patch construction when he returned to the shop he found patch in a belligerent mood patch wanted gersen to take the advance from otwal and relinquish his partnership but gersen refused to agree patch mut tered darkly about agreements negotiated under duress and spoke of closing the shop until the law set matters straight gersen laughed at him you cant close the shop i own a controlling interest i didnt realize i was dealing with thugs and bandits blurted patch i didnt realize that the good name of patch construction would be tainted monsters murderers terrorists thieves rob bers wtiat have i let myself in for eventually youll have your shop back gersen consoled him and dont forget therell be a handsome profit for patch con struction unless i get snatched off to interchange again said patch bleakly i expect nothing better gersen uttered a soft quiet curse and patch looked in wonder to see gersen evince an overt sign of emotion wtiats the trou ble something i neglected something i never considered and what is that the dp mon princes i might have put a sticktight on seuman otwal or followed him why bother he stays at the halkshire hotel seek him there yes of course gersen went to the visiphone was connected with the halkshire front desk he was informed that mr otwal was not in residence at the moment but that a message would eventually reach him gersen turned back to patch suspicious rascal he probably would have ducked my sticktight patch was now studying gersen with a new and intent expres sion i knew it all along what youre an ipsy agent gersen laughed shook his head im ust ordinary kirth ger sen how asked patch with a shrewd grin can you get the use of a sticktight operation if youre not police or ipsy no great problem if you know the right people lets get on with our monster on the following day seuman otwal called by visiphone to state that he was leaving the planet he would return in perhaps two months when he hoped to see substantial progress on the day following there was sensational news in the course of one night five of the wealthiest families of cumberland had suffered the kidnaping of one or more of their members such was seuman otwals business on krolonole gersen told patch the fort progressed with satisfactory rapidity a fact that pleased patch but troubled gersen either seuman otwal was kokor hek kus or he was not if not how could he be forced to reveal kokor hekkus whereabouts gersens best hope was that kokor hekkus in his own guise might once more visit the shop if not gersen toyed with the idea of a secret capsule aboard the fort in which to stow away but rejected the idea the fort was far too small might he arrange to accompany the fort as instructor or expert if the fort were truly bound for thamber he might find himself ef fectually exiled for life or enslaved an idea on a different level occurred to him which during the next few days he took steps to implement the control pulses from the forts cycling mechanism ran through a dorsal duct branching the killing machine off right and left to the relays in each segment wtiere the duct passed back across the head gersen introduced a cutoff switch activated by cells on either side of the head if the gas within these cells were ionized say by the impact of a weak projac beam electricity flowing across the cell would open the switch rendering the fort immobile for at least ten minutes meanwhile the surface enamels had been applied the engines and circuits were checked and adjusted the leg action tested under various types of cycles and then the fort was adjudged complete in the dim hours of early morning it was shrouded under canvas walked out into the street to be grappled by a freight copter and conveyed to a wild area at the south of the bize parish barrens for field trials patch proudly sat at the controls gersen rode beside him the fort rambled smoothly over rough ground and shrubs climbed hills without faltering certain maladjustments made them selves known and were taken note of a few minutes before noon the fort breasted a low ridge and scuttled down into the camp of a natural life association party a hundred nature lovers looked up from their noon meal emitted simultaneous gasps of horror and fled screaming over the hills another success said gersen we can now with candor guarantee fnghtfulness to kokor hekkus patch halted the fort turned it about drove it back over the ridge at twilight it was once again draped in canvas and carried back to the shop almost as if seuman otwal were clairvoyant he called on the following day to request a progress report patch assured him that all went well that if he so chose he could undertake a test of the fort on the following day otwal agreed and once again the fort was shrouded trundled out into the predawn stillness and conveyed into the badlands behind the crystal pinnacles with otwal follow ing in a small nondescript aircar gersen wearing his maroon duotone and fashionable ac couterments took the controls and once again the fort ran smartly up and down the foothills weaponry by the terms of the contract had not been installed however the gas sacs and odoriferous glands had been loaded with smokegas and colored water they spouted and sprayed with pre cision and accuracy otwal alighted stood while the fort trundled back and forth then returned to the head compartment and took over the controls he said very little but his attitude indicated ap the demon princes proval patch likewise silent was clearly congratulating himself that the entire odious adventure would soon be at an end at dusk the fort once more was conveyed back to patris otwal patch and gersen gathered in patchs office otwal walked back and forth as if in deep thought the fort seems to perform well enough he said but to be perfectly frank i consider the price somewhat high i shall recommend to my principal that he inspect the mechanism only if the price is reduced to a reasonable and rational figure patch reeled back and went red in the face what he roared do you dare stand here and say that after all our suffering all weve been through to produce the damnable thing seuman otwal inspected patch coldly it serves nothing to rant i have explained my the answer is no out of here dont come back till you bring every cursed coin we have owing patch marched forward get out or ill throw you out nothing could give me more pleasure in fact he seized otwal by the shoulder and hustled him about otwa swayed smiled serenely toward gersen as if in amusement for the playful ferocity of a kitten patch tugged again otwal moved slightly patch was flung across the room to strike his head against his desk and lie blinking otwal turned to gersen what of you do you care to try your luck gersen shook his head i only want to wind up the contract bring your principal for his final inspection then if he is satisfied take delivery under no circumstances will we reduce our price in fact we now must start to charge interest upon the amount owing seuman otwal laughed glanced at patch who was slowly raising himself to a sitting position you take a strong position under the circumstances i might do the same very well i am forced to agree when can the fort be delivered according to the terms of our contract we must pack it in foam crate it and convey it to the spaceport a matter of three days after final acceptance and payment seuman otwal bowed very well i will try to make contact with my principal after which i will render the requisite notifica tion i believe said gersen that a second payment is now due patch was rubbing his head staring in virulent hate toward seuman otwal the killing machine wliy bother said seuman otwal carelessly let us handle these tiresome financial matters later gersen refused to agree what good is a contract if the terms are not intended to be binding patch struggled to his feet moved with an air of purpose around behind his desk gersen stepped quickly past removed the projac from the halfopen drawer otwal laughed negligently you just saved his life i saved our second payment said gersen because i would have been forced to kill you as well no matter no matter let us not talk of death horrid to con sider nonbeing you want your money tiresome people another half million i presume correct and a final payment of gersen consulted notes ofsvu which will settle accounts in full with patch con struction otwal walked slowly back and forth i will have to make ar rangements three days to crate and foam you say that seems a reasonable period it is too long here is how we shall simplify cover the fort with the tarpaulin at midnight walk it out into the street a freight carrier will grapple to it and take it to our cargo ship which is by chance convenient there is one difficulty said gersen the banks will be closed and your check cannot be certified i will bring the money in cash all of it second and third payments together essentially gersen cared not a whit for the money but suddenly it seemed important not to let seuman otwal hoodwink patch con struction a second time he forced himself to consider the situation from a larger perspective he asked cautiously what of your prin cipal seuman otwal made an impatient gesture i will take my chances with him he is occupied elsewhere and has given me full competence come what do you say gersen smiled sourly was this hawkfaced man kokor hek kus or not sometimes it seemed indubitably yes and the next moment as certainly no gersen temporized one more matter that of service do you expect us to provide a technical expert if it becomes necessary you will be notified but after all our the demon princes own technical staff is at hand and indeed is responsible for the design foresee no need for any such expert patch lurched upright in his chair get out he muttered thickly get out both of you murderers thugs you too wall or gersen or whatever your name is i dont know what your game is but get out gersen turned him a casual glance then ignored him seuman otwal seemed amused gersen said if you want to take delivery at midnight pay into our bank account the full sum due us we want no cash to be fakemetered and carried around until the banks open you and your principal of course are men of probity but knaves and scoundrels are known to exist as soon as the deposit is verified you can take delivery of the fort seuman otwal considered gravely then he acquiesced it shall be as you wish he turned a serpents flick of a glance at his watch there is time which is your bank bank of rigel patns oldtown main in half an hour more or less you may make inquiry at mid night i will arrange to take delivery gersen remembering perhaps belatedly his ostensible role turned to patch does the arrangement meet your approval mr patch patch growled something indistinguishable that gersen and seuman otwal graciously assumed to be assent seuman otwal bowed and departed gersen turned to consider patch patch glared back gersen controlled an impulse to rake him over the coals and seated himself we must make plans what is the needs for plans now as soon as the money reaches the bank i intend to buy you out of patch construction if it takes every last cent and then be damned to you you show very little gratitude said gersen but for me youd still be sitting in a cell at interchange patch nodded bitterly you rescinded my fee for purposes of your own i have no idea what these purposes are but they have nothing to do with me as soon as the money reaches the bank ill buy you out ill pay any additional sum you require within rea son and ill say goodbve to you with the utmost oy as you wish said gersen i do not care to stay where i am not wanted s to the additional sum make the total an even half million the killing machine patch puffed out his cheeks that will be eminently satisfac tory half an hour later patch called the area branch of the bank of rigel inserted his account tab into the credit card slot yes he was told the sum of svu had been deposited to his account in that case said patch please open an account in the name of kirth gersen he spelled the name and deposit to this ac count the sum of svu the transaction was performed both patch and gersen affixing signatures and thumbpnnts to tabs patch then turned to gersen you will now write me a receipt and destroy the partnership agree ment gersen did as requested now said patch you will be good enough to leave the premises and never return whatever you say replied gersen courteously the asso ciation has been stimulating i wish you and patch construction prosperity and i offer you a final word of advice after the fort has been delivered try not to be kidnaped again have no fears on that score patch grinned wolfishly im not an inventor and an engineer for nothing i have devised a pro tective harness that will blow the hands and face off anyone who touches me let the kidnapers beware favorite dictum of raffles the amateur cracksman money lost little lost honor lost much lost pluck lost all lost the night of a concourse planet was seldom completely dark for those worlds appropriately placed in orbit blue companion served as a small intense moon the night sky of all the worlds sparkled with at least several sister planets krokinole saw blue companion only as an evening star a state of affairs that would persist for yet another hundred years or so due to the vast circumference of the orbits of all the concourse planets and the consequent sluggish annual motion in the case of krokinole years krokinole midnight was as dark as any of the concourse patris still influenced by the old time whitelock injunctionary proce dures had little to offer in the way ofnighthfe what small nocturnal revelry there was centered in new town at the riverside restau rants old city was dark and damp from the estuary mist with patch construction a bright island half an hour before midnight gersen came quietly along the empty streets blue companion had long departed the sky street illumination consisted of a dim globe at far intervals surrounded by a golden halo of mist the air smelled of damp brick the estuary docks the mud flats across the estuary a subtle rnoldering reek unique to patris old town opposite patch construction stood a row of the tall highgabled buildings each with a deeply recessed the killing machine areaway filled with shadow from one to another of these dark alcoves gersen slipped approaching the oblong of light projected from the open doors of workshop b he came as close as he thought practical leaned back against the moldering brick eased the various clips and straps supporting his weapons and set himself to wait he wore black with black skintone black eyeshells to conceal the gleam of his eyes standing quiet he was part of the misty night a sinister shape time passed inside the shop the forward end of the canvas swathed fort could be seen and from time to time a technician on one occasion patchs burly form appeared in the opening as he stepped out to peer up into the sky gersen checked the time five minutes to midnight he fitted a pair of nightglasses to his forehead slipped them down over his eyes and instantly the street seemed bright though with unreal shadows and tones the chiarascuro sometimes reversed sometimes not the glare from the shop was compensated by a mutachrome filter appearing as a dark blotch gersen scanned the sky but saw nothing at a minute before midnight patch again stepped out into the street two heavy projacs ostentatiously hung in holsters at his waist and at his throat was clasped a microphone undoubtedly tuned to the police emergency band gersen grinned patch was taking no chances after a suspicious look around the sky patch returned within a minute passed a long dismal hoot from the mermiana monument the female colossus standing knee deep in the sea sig nified midnight high in the sky appeared the shape of a freight carrier it settled then halted in midair gersen squinted up through the nightglasses tentatively brought around his grenade rifle the carrier was presumably manned by men in the service of kokor hekkus the galaxy would profit by their deaths but where was kokor hekkus and gersen cursed the uncertainty that restrained him from pulling the trigger a small aircar appeared it swooped and ignoring the traffic laws of patris settled into the street landing less than a hundred feet from gersens hiding place he pressed far back into the shad ows flipped up the nightglasses which now would only hinder and confuse him two men alighted from the aircar gersen grunted in disap pointment neither was seuman otwal neither could possibly be s the demon princes kokor hekkus both were short compact darkskinned both wore tight dark garments and tight black hoods they walked with quick steps to the shop peered into the interior and one made an impe rious gesture gersen lowered his nightglasses glanced up to the freightcarrier it remained as before gersen raised the night glasses returned to the two men from the aircar patch came for ward marching with a swagger of unconvincing truculence he halted and spoke the two nodded curtly and one said a few words into a microphone patch turned gestured the fort walked out into the street the canvas bulging and jerking to the motion of the legs down from the sky came the freightcarrier gersen watched with the certainty that here the chain of events that had started on the avente espla nade was to dwindle and die patch stepped back into the shop one hand on each of his guns the two men in black ignored him down now from the airship came a strongback from which depended ten cables the two men clambered up to the top of the fort shackled the cables to eyebolts along the dorsal ridge they jumped to the ground gave a wave the fort was lofted away through the night the two men went quickly to their car without a backward glance for patch who stood bristling and glaring defiance at their backs the aircar swept off into the dark patch and his shop were left curiously forlorn and bereft the doors to workshop b closed the street was dark and va cant gersen shifted from his cramped position he felt defeated and angry why at least had he not shot down the airship and the fort kokor hekkus might well have been aboard even if such were not the case the destruction of the fort would have infuriated him goaded him to some kind of action gersen knew very well why he had not destroyed the fort in decision had cramped his finger he ached for the final confron tation kokor hekkus must know why he died and who killed him to shoot him down in the dark was good but not good enough how and where to win another opportunity perhaps through seuman otwal and the halkshire hotel gersen stepped out into the street three dark shapes sprang back in startlement one gave a hoarse order and a beam of intense white light flooded forth to blind gersen he snatched for his weapons one of the shapes scrambled forward knocked down his arm another swung a long the kjllwg machine length of black cable it coiled around gersens body almost as if alive to constrict his right arm and his thighs there came another coiling length of cable snapping around his legs gersen tottered fell his heavy weapons were kicked to the side his knife and projac snatched away the man holding the light advanced turned it down at gersen he chuckled good enough this ones the partner with the money it was the cool easy voice of seuman otwal gersen said youre wrong patch bought me out excellent then you have money the light moved closer search him with care this man might well be dangerous cautious fingers probed gersens person found and removed a throwing dagger a pricklesac halffull of anodyne several other devices that obviously puzzled the searchers one said in a voice of respectful wonder this ones a walking arsenal id not like to face him alone yes said seuman otwal thoughtfully a strange sort to be frowsting it as an artisan a strange sort indeed well no mat ter the universe is full of strange sorts as well we know he is now our guest and we need not delay for patch down eased an airboat gersen was hoisted into the hold the craft slid off and away through the krokinole night seuman otwal presently looked into the hold youre a strange man mr wall or whatever your name is you decked yourself out with a variety of weapons almost as if you knew how to use them you concealed yourself with such stealthy patience that we who are also stealthy and patient had no inkling of your nearness and then without a look over your shoulder you swagger out into the middle of the street it was a poor move gersen agreed the initial folly was your partnership with patch and this is useless to deny as we have informed ourselves when it should have been apparent that never would the bumptious patch be paid for the fort he was forced to disgorge at interchange now it is your turn if you can tender us our svu at once we will quickly finalize the matter if you choose not to do so then i fear you must make a space journey the demon princes dont have that much money said gersen let me explain the circumstances no i cannot reason with you i have far to go and much to do if you have no money then you must act through the usual channels interchange asked gersen with a wintry smile interchange i wish you good fortune mr wall or whatever your name dealing with you has been a pleasure seuman otwal departed and gersen saw no more of him he was transferred to another ship where he found himself in the company of three chil dren two young women three older women and a middleaged man presumably members of various wealthy concourse families time passed how long gersen could not know he ate and slept many times but at last the ship became still there was the familiar but always unsettling wait as atmospheres equalized then the pas sengers were led out upon the soil of sasani ushered into a bus and conveyed across the desert to interchange in a small auditorium one of the interchange functionaries gave them a briefing ladies and gentlemen we are glad to have you with us and we hope that during your stay you will try to rest relax and enjoy yourselves the facilities of interchange are those of a sanitarium we allow a certain degree of social intercourse so long as decorum and courtesy is maintained we encourage the enjoyment of your special hobbies and certain sports such as swim ming chess kalingo tennis the use of musical instruments and the chromatil there are no facilities for hiking gliding birdwatching marathonrunning or exploration of the fascinating sasani wilder ness we offer six classes of accommodation ranging from hyperluxurious class aa to the standard e which is plain but by no means uncomfortable the cuisine is of eight standard catego ries corresponding to the principal gastronomic habits of the oik umene peoples for persons who are habituated to other more specialized diets there is a special service at extra charge we natter ourselves that anyone can eat if not with relish at least with nour ishment at interchange our regulations are somewhat more firm than those of the average pleasure resort and i must warn you that surreptitious and solitary ventures across the desert can only lead to inconvenience in the first place there are numerous carnivorous insects secondly there is neither food nor water thirdly the autochthonous inhab the killing machine itants of sasani who leave their burrows only at night are anthro pophages fourthly we are required to protect the interests of our clients and the obstreperous individual soon finds himself deprived of all privileges i will now distribute forms among you please indicate your choice of accommodation and cuisine you will notice a list of reg ulations please read these carefully you will find the personnel courteous if somewhat remote they are well paid so please do not attempt to press gratuities upon anyone we regard this ten dency with suspicion and inquire carefully into the motives of those who offer such inducements tomorrow you will be provided with means of communication with those who might be expected to rescind your fees that is all and thank you gersen examined the form and selected class b accommoda tions which allowed him full use of the institutions recreational activities as well as a modicum of privacy he had eaten the food of all the oikumene including sandusk he thought wryly recal ling the shopkeeper of ard street and indeed was not over fastidious he checked the category classic the cuisine of alphanor west earth and perhaps a third of the population of the oikumene he read the regulations none of which were surprising or ominous except item those persons who are in residence after their period of prime rescission and who thereupon fall into the available category must keep to their apartments during the morning period in order to allow inspection by noncommitted vis itors who might be interested in paying rescission fees in due course gersen was taken to his apartment which seemed comfortable enough the parlor contained a desk a table several chairs a green and black rug a shelf stacked with periodi cals the walls were mauve spattered with orange the ceiling a foxy russet the bathroom included the usual facilities with walls floor and ceiling finished in sealbrown tile the bed was narrow and austerely padded the infraradiator suspended obtrusively from the ceiling as in oldfashioned country inns gersen bathed dressed in the fresh garments provided lay down on his bed and considered the possible directions of the fu ture first it was necessary to rid himself of the depression and selfdeprecation that had been his mood since seuman otwals the demon princes white light had first flashed into his face he had all too long con sidered himself invulnerable protected by destiny merely because of the force of his motivations it was perhaps his single supersti tion the solipsistic conviction that one after another those five individuals who had destroyed mount pleasant must die at his hands persuaded by his faith gersen had neglected the common sense act of killing seuman otwal and had suffered the conse quences he must rearrange his patterns of thinking he had been com placent doctrinaire didactic in his approach he had conducted himself as if the success of his ambitions were preordained as if he were endowed with supernatural capacities all quite wrong gersen told himself seuman otwal had taken him with ridiculous ease seuman otwal held him so cheap that he had not even bothered to question him but had flung him into a hold with the rest of his bag and gersens selfesteem was further mortified he had not previously appreciated the full extent of his vanity very well then he told himself if absolute resourcefulness absolute indomitability were the basic elements of his nature it was now time to put these attributes to work less angry indeed halfamused with his own earnestness he took stock of the situation tomorrow if he so chose he could notify patch of his predicament there was nothing to be gained by this gersen himself had the halfmillion paid him by patch originally money supplied by duschane audmar and perhaps an other seventy or eighty thousand from the money left him by his grandfather his rescission fee was a million svu more than this a sum far beyond his ability to raise if kokor hekkus or seuman otwal the same man could be convinced that he and patch had parted company they might try to rekidnap patch and lower gersens fee to the money he had received from the sale of his partnership but patch if he were wise would take himself out of circulation gersen might be held at in terchange for months or years eventually interchange fees would begin to eat into the sponsors profit the rescission fee would drop as soon as it reached half a million gersen could buy his own way out unless an independent purchaser considered him worth more an unlikely circumstance in effect gersen was confined at interchange for an indefinite period the killing machine what of escape gersen had never heard of escape from inter change if a person managed to elude the vigilance of the guards and the careful system of alarms tattletales and triggerbeams where could he go the desert was fatal by day even more so by night automatic weapons barred helpful spacecraft from the area no one departed interchange except through death or the rescis sion of their fees it occurred to gersen to wonder about alusz iphigenia eperjetokay the girl from thamber her fee was ten billion svu a fantastic sum how close had kokor hekkus come to paying it how gratifying to rescind alusz iphigenia out from under the very nose of kokor hekkus a visionary dream when he could not rescind his own comparatively modest fee a gong sounded to announce the evening meal gersen went to his designated dining area along a blankwalled walk topped with the tight interlacement of glass bands that characterized the avenues and walkways of interchange the dining room was a high ceilinged room painted austerely gray the guests ate at small in dividual tables and were served from carts passing back and forth there was a penalcolony atmosphere to the dining room that was more or less absent from the rest of interchange gersen could not define its source unless it was the isolation of the diners the lack of gossip or banter between the tables the food was synthetic of poor color not too well prepared in quantities not too generous even gersen who took no great interest in food found the meal unappetizing if this was class b cuisine he wondered what class e was like perhaps not much different after dinner came the socalled social hour in a large com pound domed against the dusty sasani night wind here the entire guest population of interchange collected after the evening meal from boredom and curiosity who had come who had gone at the central kiosk gersen signed a chit for beer carried the paper con tainer to a bench seated himself perhaps two hundred other people were in view folk of all ages and races some walking a few playing chess a few conversing others like himself drinking morosely on the benches there was no great gregariousness everyone displayed nearidentical expressions flat dislike for interchange and every thing connected with it including their fellow guests even the children seemed infected by the general gloom though they showed a greater disposition to clot into groups perhaps twenty young women were in evidence even more aloof injured and in the demon princes dignant than the rest gersen inspected them with curiosity which was alusz iphigenia if kokor hekkus were mad to possess her she must necessarily be extraordinarily beautiful none here seemed to fulfill the requirements nearby a tall girl with striking red hair gazed broodingly at her long fingers each joint of which was banded with a black metal sleeve identifying her as an eginand of copus beyond a small darkskinned girl sipped wine she seemed winsome and appealing but not one who would think to value her self at ten billion svu there were others but all seemed too old or too young or of no particular beauty such as the young woman at the other end of his bench who might just conceivably fit the requirements her skin was pale tinged with dusky ivory she had clear gray eyes and regular features her hair was tawny blonde in short she was not unattractive but hardly in the ten billion svu class gersen would not have considered her a second time had it not been for a certain insolent poise to her head a certain cool intelligence of gaze but no for all her clear eyes and regular features she was too ordinary too unexceptional the attendant who had served gersen on his previous visit crossed the compound looking neither right nor left what was his name armand koshiel and gersen became more morose than before the social period ended the guests wandered away to their various suites apartments and rooms the morning meal tea muffins and compote was served di rectly in the apartment after which gersen was summoned to the central administration building where he found himself in the com pany of several of the persons with whom he had come to inter change presently his name was called he entered the office of a har riedlooking clerk who gave him a perfunctory salute and delivered a wellrehearsed speech mr wall seat yourself if you will from your point of view your presence here is a misfortune from ours you are a guest to be treated with courtesy and dignity we are anxious to improve the light in which we are regarded we will take all practical means to that end now you are here sponsored by mr kokor hekkus his demand is for the sum of svu and i now inquire how you propose to secure this sum he waited expectantly i wish i knew said gersen it is totally unrealistic the killing machine the official nodded many of our guests find their fees exces sive as you know we have no control over the fees demanded we can only advise the sponsor to moderation and the guest to a co operative attitude now then can you raise this sum no what of your family nonexistent friends i have no friends business associates none the clerk sighed then you must remain here until one of these events occurs the sponsor may lower his demands to a fea sible sum fifteen days after the date your associates have first had opportunity to appear in your behalf you go on an available basis and the sponsorship fee may be paid by anyone who then receives you into custody after a certain period unless board and room bills are regularly met we may be forced to release custody to a noncommitted visitor for the extent of these bills so then i cant meet the figure i have no one to notify we will state as much to your sponsor do you care to name the maximum figure you can pay about half a million said gersen reluctantly i will so inform your sponsor in the meantime mr wall i trust that you find your visit not too unpleasant thank you gersen was conducted back to his apartment and presently re leased to the dining room for lunch during the afternoon the recreational facilities of interchange were made free to him there were minor sports crafts games he could exercise at a gymnasium swim in a pool or he could remain in his apartment visiting the apartment or room of another guest was forbidden several days passed gersen became tense and charged with the need for activity there was no scope to release this pressure except in exercise at the gymnasium he pondered escape it seemed im possible there was no place to start during the social hour of the third day gersen turning away from the kiosk with beer came face to face with armand koshiel whose schedule apparently brought him through the compound at thi demon princes about this time koshiel murmured a polite apology stepped aside then turned a puz led glance backward gersen grinned ruefully conditions have altered since our last meeting so i see said koshiel i remember you well its mr gas son mr gnsson wall said gersen howard wall of course mr wall koshiel shook his head in bemused wonder isnt it strange the way fate works but now sir i must be off we arent allowed to chat with the guests tell me something plow close to ten billion svu has kokor hekkus achieved he progresses he approaches so i understand all of us here are interested its the largest fee ever to be rescinded gersen felt an irrational pang of anger or perhaps jealousy does the woman come down to the compound i have seen her here on occasion koshiel made tentative efforts to sidle away what does she look like koshiel knit his brows glanced furtively over his shoulder shes by no means what you might expect not a clever jolly type if you know what i mean please excuse me mr wall i must be off or face reprimand gersen went to his usual bench seething with a new set of dissatisfactions this unknown woman by all logical processes should mean nothing to him such was not the case gersen puzzled over himself and his motives how and why had he become fascinated because ofalusz iphigenias selfappraised value often billion svu the fact that kokor hekkus in all his egotism and arrogance was about to possess her the thought awoke a peculiar fury in him because of her asserted origin mythical thamber because of the stirrings of his own sternly repressed romanticism whatever the cause gersen scrutinized the compound seeking the beautiful girl who might be alusz iphigema ofthamber she def initely was not the small dark girl nor the redhaired egmand from gopus fhe taw nvblonde girl with the withdrawn manner was not in evidence but she hardly qualified hough gersen reflected her eyes were an exceedingly lucent grey and no exception could be taken to her figure which was rather slight and delicate but per ihl klh g achl h fectly proportioned the gong sounded he returned to his apart ment disappointed and roiling with uneasiness he next day passed gersen waited impatiently for the social period it finally arrived a new woman was present she was lithe and supple with long legs a long patrician face a dazzling roll of bright white hair intricately coiffed gersen inspected her carefully no he decided with a feeling of relief this could not be alusz iphigema of thamher this woman was too intricate too artificial she might well value herself at ten billion svu and gersen was almost willing that kokor hekkus should pay such an amount and take possession the tawnyblonde girl did not appear gersen re turned to his apartment in disgust and vexation wtule he was pent and helpless kokor hekkus was easing in upon his quarry to distract himself gersen read old magazines until midnight the following day was like those previous they began to merge lose identity at lunch there were two new members to his group gersen overheard a comment that identified the newcomers as fy chus hasselberg first chairman of the jarneh corporation and skerde vorek director of forestlands both of earth both mil lionaires several hundred times over two steps closer to the goal thought gersen sourly during the afternoon he exercised in the gymnasium at dinner the food seemed more than ordinarily tasteless gersen went to the social hour in a surly mood he provided himself a mug of musty sasani wine and seated himself in expectation of another dreary evening half an hour passed then at the entrance to the compound appeared the tawnyblonde girl tonight she seemed even more abstracted than on the former occasion gersen watched her in tently actually he thought she was really not plain her features were so perfect so perfectly placed as to make her face seem un remarkable but certainly she was not plain he watched her pro cure a mug of tea at the central kiosk then she came to sit on a bench not far from gersen he studied her with great interest his pulse moving rather swiftly why he asked himself in irritation why did this young woman at best conventional attractive affect him to such an extent he rose walked to where she sat may i join you he asked if you care to she said after fust sufficient hesitation to in dicate that shed rather sit quietly by herself her voice had a pleas ant archaic swing and gersen tried to place her accent excuse the demon princes me for being curious he said but are you alusz iphigenia eperje tokay i am alusz iphigenia eperjetokay she said correcting his pronunciation gersen drew a deep breath his instinct had been correct from close at hand and looking into her face her quiet good looks seemed somewhat less quiet she might almost be termed hand some it was her eyes he thought that gave life to her face beauty sufficient to urge kokor hekkus to such flamboyant exertions it seemed unlikely and your home is on the planet thamber she turned him another brief incurious look yes do you know that to most people thamber is an imaginary world a place of legend and ballad so i have learned to my surprise i assure you it is far from imaginary she sipped her tea gave gersen another swift glance her eyes large clear candid were her best feature and these were undoubtedly beautiful but now a subtle shift in her position in dicated disinterest in further conversation i wouldnt bother you said gersen stiffly except for the fact that your fiance kokor hekkus has brought me here and i regard him as my enemy alusz iphigenia reflected a moment you act unwisely in re garding him as an enemy suppose he rescinds your fee what then she shrugged it is a matter i do not care to discuss gersen thought yes she is beyond doubt handsome even more than handsome when she spoke even when she thought her fea tures took on a luminosity a vitality that transfigured even ordinary features gersen was at a loss for a means to continue the conversation finally he asked do you know kokor hekkus well not well he keeps for the most part to misk the land be yond the mountains my home is draszane in gentilly how were you able to come here do many spaceships come to thamber no she turned him a sudden sharp glance who are you are you one of his spies gersen shook his head looking into her face he thought with amazement did i ever think this girl plain she is beautiful inexpress ibly so he said if i were free i could help you the killing aiachine she laughed rather cruelly how can you help me when you cant even help yourself and gersen felt an unfamiliar red flush seep across his face he rose to his feet good night alusz iphigenia said nothing gersen stalked off to his apart ment he showered and threw himself on his bed suppose he com municated with duschane audmar pointless audmar would not even bother to send him a refusal myron patch more than point less ben zaum he might be able to raise five or ten thousand svu no more gersen picked up one of the old magazines flicked through the pages a face looked forth one which he seemed to recognize gersen glanced down at the caption the name daeniel trembath was unknown to him strange ger sen flipped the page the face was extremely like that of of whom gersen turned back to the face he had known this man as mr hoskins he had brought back his corpse from bissoms end gersen read the caption in full daeniel trembath archdirector of the bank ofrigel now retiring fiftyone years his excellency the director has served the great bank and the peoples of the concourse last week he announced his retirement what are his future plans i will rest i have worked hard and long perhaps too hard and too long now i will take time to enjoy the aspects of life denied me by my responsibilities gersen looked at the date of the magazine it was cosmopolis for january three months later trembath disappeared a week or so afterwards he was dead by the act of billy windle who might be kokor hekkus on an unpleasant little world be yond gersen now wide awake thought back across the months why would the retired archdirector of the great bank of rigel travel so remotely so secretly to deal with the man who called himself billy windle trembath had wanted perpetual youth what did he have to offer in exchange by the very nature of his career it could be nothing but money the meeting at skouse had oc curred immediately after alusz iphigenia had taken sanctuary at interchange the concatenation of places events and personalities was intriguing kokor hekkus wanted money ten billion svu daeniel trembath archdirector of the bank of rigel was the very symbol of money and also conservative respectabil the demon princes ity why had the ipcc wanted his return dead or alive surely trembath had not stolen ten billion svu gersen remembered the fragment of paper he had taken from mr hoskins at skouse he strove to recall the words now suddenly so pregnant with possi bility crimps or more properly bands of density these ap parently occur at random though in practice they are so casual as to be imperceptible the critical spacing is in terms of the square root of the first eleven primes the occurrence of six or more such crimps at any of the des ignated locations will validate the conclusions to be drawn were staggering there was likewise an aspect to the situation that was the very soul of tragicomedy gersen jumped to his feet paced back and forth across his apart ment if circumstances were as he suspected how could he take advantage of his knowledge he thought for an hour formulating and discarding var ious schemes the crafts and hobby shop seemed the key to the situation the activities encouraged would be simple and easily supervised woodcarving puppetry embroidery shawlweaving watercolors glassmelting possibly photography the morn ing passed with a dismal slowness gersen sat sprawled in the most comfortable of his chairs a delightful variation to his scheme oc curred to him he laughed aloud immediately after lunch he visited the hobby room it was more or less as he had expected a large room equipped with looms pots of modeling clay paints beads wire various other paraphernalia the attendant in charge was a corpulent man of early middleage bald with small dolllike features in a round face he answered gersens questions with a reasonable degree of patience no there were no facilities for pho tographic work several years ago an effort had been made in this direction but the project had been abandoned the equipment re quired too much maintenance had occupied too much of his time gersen put forward a delicately phrased proposal he gersen was almost certain to be a guest for a month or perhaps two prior to his coming he had been experimenting with certain novel artforms involving photography and he wished to continue his activities the killing machine to such an extent that he would be willing to purchase the necessary equipment the attendant considered with a wet pursing of the mouth the project seemed to entail a great deal of trouble for gersen for himself for everyone involved in theory of course it was con ceivable but he gave an eloquent shrug of the shoulders gersen uttered a reassuring laugh any extra attention on the attendants part what was his name funian lubby would be adequately or even gersen amended cautiously generously rewarded lubby sighed heavily interchange policy dictated full cooperation with the guests within understandable limits if mr wall insisted lubby could only do as he required as to the remuneration mr wall had suggested it was against interchange policy but mr wall must be the judge of what was right how soon could lubby provide the proper equipment asked gersen if mr wall provided a list and the necessary funds an order could be placed at sagbad the largest nearby trade center delivery could be expected tomorrow at the earliest more likely the day following excellent said gersen he seated himself wrote out a list it was long and included a number of items intended to obscure ger sens primary purpose lubby pursed his lips hugely in surprise and automatic disapprobation gersen said hurriedly i realize that this makes enormous inconvenience for you is a hundred svu suffi cient compensation for your extra effort you understand said lubby sternly that regulations forbid the transfer of funds between guests and personnel in a case of this sort the money involved is merely a means of providing the craft shop with sorely needed equipment since i presume you will leave these items here on your departure gersen did not wish to seem too eager i suppose so some of them at least those that duplicate my own equipment at home all in all he was highly encouraged that lubby could speak so openly indicated that the craft shop was not under remote surveil lance what do you think this material and equipment will cost he inquired lubby appraised the list megaphot camera chago en larger and printer ball microscope expensive items all tanglemat duplicator what would you be needing that for i prepare kaleidoscopic permutations of natural objects said the demon princes gersen sometimes twenty or thirty copies of a single print are needed and i find the duplicator convenient it will cost a fortune grumbled funian lubby but if youre willing to pay for it yes if i must said gersen i dislike spending money but i like two months away from my hobby even less understandable lubby glanced down the list this is an impressive list of chemicals i hope he said with a sardonic twist of the lips that you are not planning to blow up the institution and thus destroy my livelihood gersen laughed at the joke im sure you are sufficiently knowledgeable to forestall anything of this nature no there are no explosives corrosives or noxious substances here only inks dyes photosensitives and the like so i see i am by no means uninformed in these matters i am an accredited scientific academician of boomaraw college on lor gan and in fact have done research on the flatfish of the neuster ocean until my appointment was canceled another regressive trick of the institute of that i am sure yes a sad situation gersen agreed a person wonders where it will end do they want to make cavemen of us all who knows what the wretched malcontents hope for i have heard that they are slowly acquiring control of the jarnel corpo ration that when they finally secure their percent then pfai no more spaceships no more travel what will that do to us where will that leave me without a job if i am so unfortunate as still to be alive no i spit on those people gersen had been inspecting the craft room wtiere can i work to be the least obtrusive preferably in some corner where i can throw up a screen to keep out the light naturally any effort on your part i am willing to pay for indeed if there were a disused storeroom or something of the sort yes funian lubby heaved himself to his feet let us look the old sculpting studio is no longer in use guests nowadays care nothing for serious work the studio was octagonal the walls were native wood varnished a sour brown the floor was stained yellow brick the ceiling rose to a skylight through which came a grayish almost mauve illumina tion ill block out the light said gersen otherwise the room is quite suitable to test the degree of freedom from surveillance the killing machine he said now i understand that the rules forbid the exchange of money between guests and personnel still rules are made to be broken and it is not fair that you should go to extra exertion with out reimbursement you agree i think you have expressed my point of view exactly good what goes on in this old studio then concerns no one but you and me while i am not a wealthy man i am not parsi monious and i am willing to pay for my pleasures he brought forth his checkbook wrote a draft for svu upon the bank of rigel this should pay for all the items of my list and leave enough to compensate you lubby puffed out his cheeks that should do very nicely i will give your order special attention and who knows the equip ment may be here tomorrow gersen went away well satisfied his hopes might be based on a set of false premises but checking and rechecldng he felt secure how could it be otherwise but he needed one more item the most important of all this job he dared not entrust to funian lubby except as a last resort he made out another draft for twenty thousand svu tucked it into his pocket that night alusz iphigenia made no appearance at the social hour gersen did not care he walked slowly back and forth watch ing waiting and then just as he was about to give up hope armand koshiel appeared taking a short cut through the compound ger sen approached him as casually as possible i am going to walk past the wastepaper bin he said i will drop a scrap of paper come behind me pick it up you will find a draft for twenty thou sand svu get me a ten thousand svu note on the bank of rigel keep the remaining ten thousand without waiting for a reply he turned away sauntered toward the kiosk from the corner of his eye he saw koshiel give a slight shrug then continue the way he was going at the kiosk gersen bought a sack of sweets pausing at the wastepaper bin he tossed aside the sack into which he had tucked the bank draft and crossing to a bench seated himself the crumpled bit of paper beside the bin looked large white and conspicuous here came koshiel back across the compound he went to the kiosk spoke a jocular word to the attendant se lected a bag of sweets for himself tossed the paper toward the bin thf demon princes he bent after it picked up gersens bag seemed to drop them both into the bin and walked away gersen went to his apartment nerves tingling his scheme had been set into motion too much optimism would be foolish but so far all went well a hidden monitor might have observed koshiel pick up the bank draft funian lubby might impose too much su pervision upon him or so much new equipment might attract the attention of persons less genial than lubby still so far so good the following day he looked briefly into the crafts room lubby was occupied with a pair of children who in their boredom had turned to maskmaking the equipment would not be delivered until the morrow said lubby and gersen departed the evening social hour passed with neither koshiel nor alusz iphigema making an appearance on the following day when ger sen returned to his apartment after breakfast he found an envelope on his desk containing a green and pink svu bank note gersen tested it with his fakemeter which with a few other per sonal effects he had been allowed to keep the meter gave a sat isfactory acknowledgment so far so good gersen dared make no further experiments he might even then be under scrutiny so far so good but his equipment still had not arrived and funian lubby seemed in a bad mood gersen returned to his apartment seething with impatience never had a day passed so slowly though fortu nately the sasani day was only twentyone hours long on the afternoon following funian lubby indicated a set of cartons with an affable wave of his fat hand there you are mr wall a fine set of equipment and you can go about your prisms or kaleidoscopes whatever it is you do with all your might thank you mr lubby im very pleased said gersen he earned the cartons into the old sculpting studio and with lubby assisting and crooning m pleasure unpacked them im anxious to see your work said lubby one can always learn and this is a creative technique i have never observed before its a very detailed process said gersen some people even find it tedious but i enjoy slow careful work the first step i think is to close off the skylight and lightseal the door with lubby steadying the ladder gersen stapled opaque cloth across the skylight then prepared a sign that read photographic darkroom knock before entering and attached it to the door the kill f g vi ch e i now he said im ready to begin he considered i think ill start with a simple reiteration in green and pink with lubby watching with vast interest gersen solemnly pho tographed a pin enlarged it ten diameters prepared a master copy from which he printed thirty copies in green and thirty in pink on the autolith what ncxt asked lubby now we come to the painstaking part of the ob fach of these pins must be carefully cut from the background hen ith pins and pinshaped holes i create the reiteration if you desire you may do the cutting while i formulate the correct color of ink lubby looked dubiously at the stack of prints all these are to be cut out yes very carefully lubby unenthusiastically set to work gersen watched closely giving advice and stressing the need for absolute accuracy ihen borrowing lubbys sliderule he calculated the square root of the first eleven prime numbers values ranging from to lubby meanwhile had cut out three pins making a single small mistake gersen complained aggnevedly lubby put down the scissors this is extremely interesting but i fear i must look to other mat ters as soon as he had gone gersen compared the svu bank note with the pink and green pins adiusted the colors added a mordant and a catalyst and printed further pins he glanced into the outer studio lubby was busy with the children gersen took the note to the microscope and as so many of thousands had done before him examined it with an eye to discovering the secret of its authenticity like the thousands before him he discovered no such quality now the key experiment upon which the success of the entire proect depended he selected paper of density and weight similar to the bank note cut a rectangle to the si e of the note precisely five by two and quarter inches he passed the paper through the fakemeter the alarmlight glowed now gersen laid off points along the length of the paper rectangle corresponding to the square roots he had computed next he laid a straightedge across the paper and at each pair of points scored a cross mark with the point of a nail thus so he hoped crimping and compressing the fibers with trembling fingers he lifted the fakemeter the door opened into the room came funian i he demon princes lubby with one motion gersen slid fakemeter bank note and paper rectangle into his pocket with another he picked up scissors and prints simulated intent creativity lubby was disappointed to find that with so much equipment so little had been produced he expressed himself to this effect gersen explained that he had been recalculating certain aesthetic laws a tedious process if lubby so desired he could expedite the process by cutting out more pins very carefully lubby declared himself unable to be of further as sistance gersen cut out a few of the pins while lubby watched arranged them with extreme care on the tabletop lubby looked over the pink and green test panels that gersen had set under a lamp are these the only two colors you will use at least for this present composition said gersen pink and green though they might seem somewhat obvious or even naive are for my purposes absolutely essential lubby grunted they appear particularly bland even faded true said gersen i have added certain agents to the pig ments it appears that the light tends to bleach them lubby presently returned to the main room gersen brought forth his fakemeter passed the paper rectangle into the slot no red light but rather the heartwarming buzz of authenticity the most musical sound of gersens existence he looked at his watch the period was almost at an end there was no time for further work at the social hour alusz iphigema made an appearance to stand aloofly at the back of the compound gersen made no attempt to approach her and so far as he could tell she seemed indifferent to his existence he had thought her plain he had considered her features uninteresting they were perfect she was the most entrancing thing he had ever seen ten billion svu a pittance he could almost applaud kokor hekkus discrimination ger sen could hardly wait to return to the craft shop but the following afternoon found funian lubby at his most tiresome there were no other hobbyists present and for two hours lubby sat gaping with eyes protuberant and fascinated as gersen cut paper pins arranged and rearranged them with frowning con centration his whole soul aching with the wish that lubby depart the day was wasted gersen left the shop seething with sup pressed fury the following day he fared better lubby was busy gersen thekilli g vmchi e photographed the bank note with serial number masked printed two hundred copies with carefully prepared inks the day after on the pretext of exposing large areas of photosensitive paper he locked the door then contriving a ig he crimped the new notes and using a to printing press printed new serial numbers the notes looked about the same as the genuine they had a somewhat different feel but what matter they satisfied the fakemeter as gersen ate dinner he pondered his final problem how to rescind his fees without arousing suspicion if he merely presented himself at the office the question would be raised as to how the money had come into his possession he could think of no prac tical or feasible means to have a parcel delivered to him certainly he could not trust koshiel with so much money he decided that he needed more information during the social hour he went to the office of the assistant ordmator a weaselfaced man wearing the dark blue interchange uniform as if it were a privilege gersen put on a face of worry i have something of a problem he told the ordinator it has been reported to me that an old friend is coming here tomorrow to rescind one of the guests can it be arranged that i look into the bureau when the bus arrives from the spaceport the ordmator frowned i his is a somewhat irregular request i realize this said gersen houever interchange policy is to facilitate the rescission of fees and such is the case here very well said the ordinator be here at this office tomor row immediately after the morning meal and i will arrange the matter gersen went to the compound paced back and forth drank quantities of wine to quiet his nerves the night passed he choked down a few bites of breakfast hurried to the office of the ordinator who pretended to have forgotten the arrangement gersen patiently restated his case oh very well said the ordinator i suppose we cant expect every rescission to work through the proper channels he con ducted gersen to an antechamber or the reception room here they waited he archaic old bus arrived discharged eight passengers they filed into the reception room welp asked the ordmator is one of these your friend yes indeed said gersen that short man with the blue skin the demon princes tone ill just speak a word or two to him and arrange my rescis sion before the ordinator could object gersen went out into the reception room approached the man he had designated excuse me arent you myron patch ofpatris no sir i am no such individual my mistake gersen returned to the ordinator carrying an envelope everything is well he has brought my money i am a free man the ordinator grunted the event seemed rather peculiar but werent peculiar events part of life your friend came to rescind you and someone else also yes he is a member of the institute and doesnt care to dis play too much cordiality the ordinator grunted again all was explained at least all seemed to be explained very well he said if you have your money go rescind yourself ill say a word to the clerk since the process is somewhat irregular when the bus departed interchange gersen was aboard at nichae he hired an aircar and was taken to the city sagbad five days later wearing black skintone black and brown tunic with black breeches gersen returned to interchange aboard the antique bus he went into the nowfamiliar office submitted to the offi ciousness of the clerk and whom do you wish to rescind alusz iphigenia eperjetokay the clerks eyebrows rose you sir are kokor hekkus he spoke with awe no the clerk made nervous movements the fee is large ten billion svu gersen opened the flat black case he was carrying withdrew packets of bank notes in svu denominations the largest in circulation here is the money yes ves but well i must inform you that kokor hekkus has already deposited with us over nine billion svu here is ten billion count it the clerk made a flustered sound you are within your rights the guest is admittedly available with trembling fingers he touched the money i will need help to count so much money counting and fakemetering the money occupied six men four the killing lachine hours the clerk signed a receipt with a nervous flourish very well sir here you are i will send for the guest whose fees you have rescinded she will be here at once and he muttered under his breath kokor hekkus will not enjoy this someone will suffer ten minutes later alusz iphigenia arrived at the office her face was strained and wild her eyes were bright with fear she stared at gersen without recognizing him then went to the door as if to run out across the desert gersen restrained her calm yourself he told her i am not kokor hekkus i have no designs upon you consider yourself safe she looked at him incredulously looked again and now gersen thought she recognized him there is another matter said the clerk he addressed alusz iphigenia since you are acting in the peculiar capacity of your own sponsor the money minus our percent fee is yours alusz iphigenia stared at him apparently without comprehen sion i suggest said gersen that you prepare a bank draft so that she need not carry around so much negotiable currency there was a flurry of consultation a shrugging of shoulders a flutter of hands finally the bank draft was drawn upon the planetary bank of sasani at sagbad in the sum of svu ten billion minus vi percent minus charges of svu for special aa accommodation gersen scrutinized the document with suspicion presumably this is a valid draft you have funds to cover naturally declared the official indeed kokor hekkus has deposited to our account a sum appreciably in excess of this amount very well said gersen this is acceptable he turned to alusz iphigenia come the bus is waiting still she hesitated looking right and left as if again contem plating flight across the daarrizm but now one of the flying black insects struck her clung to her arm she brushed it off with a cry of fear come said gersen once again you can have either kokor hekkus the insects or me and i will neither violate you or eat you alive without further protest she followed him to the bus it lurched roared rumbled interchange became a white and gray tumble dimly glimpsed through the dust the demon princes they sat side by side in the lurching bus then alusz turned a puzzled sidelong glance at gersen who are you no friend of kokor hekkus what are what are you going to do with me nothing discreditable where are we going then you dont understand the nature of kokor hekkus he will track us to the corners of the galaxy gersen had no comment to make the conversation came to an end in truth gersen felt none too secure they were still vulnerable to interception but the journey across the barrens passed without incident the bus bounced into sul arsam they boarded the waiting air ship and presently came down at the nichae spaceport to the side stood the sleek new armintor starskip gersen had bought in sag bad alusz iphigenia hesitated before she went aboard then gave a fatalistic shrug in sagbad there was a further delay at the planetary bank interchange provided a hesitant and worried verification sensing something incorrect yet at a loss to discover where the chairman of the planetary bank reluctantly told gersen through a set of extraordinary circumstances we have the sum in our vaults rep resenting a set of large deposits from interchange they are in notes of various denominations no matter we will accept your count said gersen the money kokor hekkus laboriously accumulated hoard was packed into four cases carried out into the hired aircar now the head cashier came running out into the area a communication from interchange for mr wall gersen controlled his impulse to flee he returned into the bank on the visiphone screen appeared the face of the director behind stood a man gersen did not recognize mr wall said the director there have been difficulties this is achill gogan representing kokor hekkus he earnestly desires that you wait at sagbad until he is able to confer with you certainly said gersen he may look for us at the alamut hotel gersen departed the bank entered the aircar where alusz iph igenia waited despondently with the money to the spaceport he told the pilot the killing machine twenty minutes later sasani lay behind them engaging the in tersplit gersen finally felt secure the relief was intoxicating he sat down on a settee and began to laugh alusz iphigenia across the cabin watched with guarded interest why do you laugh because of how we were rescinded we so she had not recognized him after all gersen came slowly across the cabin and she moved back a distrustful halfinch one evening i spoke to you in the compound said gersen she studied him now i remember you the quiet man who sits in the shadows how did you find so much money i printed it myself and this is what amuses me she stared at him in bewilderment but they tested it they accepted it exactly but here is the greatest joke of all there is bleach in the ink in a week they will have nothing the money i paid kokor hekkus will be blank paper the ten billion svu will be blank pa per i have swindled kokor hekkus i have swindled interchange look there is kokor hekkus money alusz iphigenia considered him dispassionately then turned to look back toward sasani she smiled a pensive smile kokor hek kus will be angry no man alive has such extravagant emotions as kokor hekkus she gave gersen a look of something like wonder he would spend ten billion to gain me because i chose to make this my price and after he bought me she shuddered he would derive ten billion svu worth of use from me by one means or another wtien he gets you what he will do is unthinkable unless i kill him first you will find it difficult sion trumble is the cleverest war chief of thamber and he has failed gersen went to the galley brought back a bottle of wine with two goblets alusz iphigenia first made a negative motion then thought better of it and accepted the goblet gersen asked do you know why i rescinded you no but she fidgeted uncomfortably and a slow pink flush came into her face never thought gersen had she seemed more beautiful because you can guide me to thamber where i will find kokor hekkus and kill him the pink flush slowly subsided she tasted the wine gazed re tw demon princfs nectively into the goblet i do not want to return to thamber i desperately fear kokor hekkus he will now be insane with anger nevertheless that is where we must go she shook her head pensively i cannot help you where thamber lies i do not know the captured revolutionary tedoro exhorts his fellow prisoners allow nothing yield not so much as a quarterinch eat the food they give you concede no more who are they but villains shame them defy them hesitation is a crack m the steel do you want them to bend you this way and that and snap you in two give nothing yield nothing if the commandant permits that you may sit prefer to stand if he gives you lined paper on which to write write across the lines gersen stared at alusz iphigema incredulously then he jumped up to the control deck disengaged the mtersplit the fabric of the ship exuded its almost human sigh of shock the skin seemed to twitch along their bodies motors dead the armintor starskip drifted free in space aquila gb shone far astern teetering at the edge of the psychological distinction between sun and star gersen went into the head showered away the black skintone dressed in his usual spacegarb shorts sandals a light singlet he returned to the saloon to find alusz iphigema sitting where he had left her gazing at the floor gersen said nothing but seated himself on the bench opposite thoughtfully sipped his wine finally she spoke wliy did you turn off the engines there is no point traveling at random since we have no des tination we might as well remain here hf demon princf s she shrugged scowled keep the money take me to earth i have no wish to hang foolishly out here in space gersen shook his head i rescinded your fee at great risk to myself primarily to learn the whereabouts of thamber second arily i find you attractive as a woman i agree with kokor hekkus you are worth ten billion svu alusz iphigenia said angrily you do not believe me it is a fact i could not return to thamber if it were the dearest wish of mv life how did you leave sion trumble captured a small spaceboat in a raid on omad island which is kokor hekkus spaceport i read the operators manual and it seemed simple enough when kokor hekkus threatened war on gentilly unless my father gave me to him i had two choices i could kill myself or i could leave thamber i left in the ship there was a handbook of the planets it mentioned sasam and described interchange as the only locality m the human uni verse safe from criminals she turned a scathing glance toward gersen this is inaccu rate interchange apparently is fair game for counterfeiters gersen acknowledged the fact with a grin and by refilling his wine glass he hesitated before drinking it the bottle had been left alone in the cabin while he showered not inconceivably the woman had poisoned it he put the glass aside and who is sion trum ble the prince of vadrus on the western border of misk we were to have been betrothed he is a brave warrior and has done many noteworthy deeds i see gersen ruminated dont you know the way you came from thamber to sasam i set the astrogation dials for sasam and left thamber behind i know only this and no more kokor hekkus is the only man of thamber to own a spaceship what is the name of your sun justsun is it somewhat orange yes how did you know deduction wtiat does the night sky look like are there any unusual objects in the sky any nearby double or triple stars no nothing unusual the killing machine have there been any recent novae nearby what are novae stars suddenly exploding to give off great amounts of light no nothing like that what of the milky way do you see it as a band around the sky as a cloud or how a ribbon of light streams across the night sky during winter is that what you mean yes apparently youre out toward the fringes that may be alusz iphigenia was unenthusiastic what about tradition asked gersen are there old tales of earth or any of the other worlds nothing very definite a few legends a few old songs she regarded him with an expression that seemed faintly derisive how is it that your star directory and your handbook to the planets cant tell you what you want to know thamber is a lost world whoever ruled thamber in the an cient days kept the secret well theres no information now ex cept a nursery rhyme set a course from the old dog star a point to the north of achernar sleight your ship to the verge extreme and dead ahead shines thambers gleam alusz iphigenia smiled faintly i know that too all of it alp theres more indeed youve left out the middle it goes set a course from the old dog star a point to the north of achernar fare until on the starboard beam six red suns toward a blue sun stream sleight your ship to where afar a cluster hangs like a scimitar under the hilt to the verge extreme and dead ahead shines thambers gleam well well said gersen he rose to his feet umped up to the control deck set dials threw power back into the jarnell system the demon princfs where are we going asked alusz iphigenia sinus the dog star you take the rhyme seriously ive heard no other directions ive got to take it seriously or do nothing whatever hmm alusz iphigenia sipped the wine in that case since ive told you all i know you will put me down at sinus or perhaps earth no but i know no more than ive told you you know the look of thambers constellations your rhyme if it ever gave accurate directions is a thousand years old or more sinus and achernar have both shifted we might arrive somewhere near thamber hopefully within ten or twenty light years then wed have to use the old trick of lost startravelers they scan the sky until in some quarter they find a familiar constellation there will only be one and this in miniature for it will be directly behind their home planet all other constellations will be distorted and even this constellation will have intervening stars superimposed upon it notably the home sun nevertheless there is always the one familiar constellation to search for and if you find it you head for it and presently when it grows to its familiar size your home world is close at hand what if you cant find a familiar constellation you can still find your way home you must fly up or down normal to the plane of the galaxy until you can see the whole spread of it and then there are landmarks to be found this re quires much time much energy much wear and strain upon the jarnell if anything goes wrong then you are lost indeed for there is nothing more to do and you float in space looking down on the home galaxy spreading below like a carpet until your energy fails and then you die gersen shrugged i have never been lost he raised his glass of wine eyed it warily then went to the galley and brought out a new bottle tell me of thamber alusz iphigenia spoke for two hours while gersen leaned back on the settee sipping wine it was a pleasant experience watching and listening for a period the realities of his existence were far away alusz iphigenia mentioned aglabat the city behind a wall of dark brown stone and gersen roused himself enervation was a the killing machine danger his stay at interchange had done him no good he had become pliable easily distracted nevertheless he relaxed again sipping wine listening to alusz iphigenia thamber was a wonderful world no one knew when the first man had arrived the time was lost in the past there were various continents subcontinents peninsulas and a great archipelago of tropical islands alusz iphigenia was native to uraszane in gentilly a principality on the western shore of the smallest continent to the east was vadrus ruled by sion trumble and beyond the land of misk the remainder of the continent except for a number of feuding states on the east coast was wilderness inhabited by bar barians similar conditions prevailed on the other continents alusz iphigenia mentioned a score of peoples each of distinctive char acter certain of these produced great music and pageants of heart stopping grandeur others were fetishists and murderers ruled by ogres in the mountains lived bandit chieftains and arrogant lord lings each secure in his castle everywhere were wizards and war locks capable of the most astounding feats and one weird area to the north of the largest continent was ruled by fiends and demons the native flora and fauna were complex rich and beautiful and sometimes dangerous there were seamonsters scaled wolves of the tundra the horrid dnazd of the mountains to the north of misk technology and the ways of modern living were unknown on thamber even the brown bersaglers of kokor hekkus carried only voulgues and daggers while the knights of misk were armed with swords and crossbows between misk and vadrus there was intermittent strife with gentilly usually allied with vadrus sion trumble was a man of heroic valor but he never had been able to overcome the brown bersaglers in a tremendous battle he had repelled the barbarians of the skar sakau who had thereupon turned their full fury to the south upon the land of misk where they had been raiding villages destroying outposts and spreading devastation gersen listened with wonder the romantic legends regarding thamber had not been exaggerated if anything they were under stated he said as much to alusz iphigenia who shrugged tham ber is a world of romantic deeds certainly the castles have great halls where the bards sing and pavilions where maidens dance to the music of lutes but below are dungeons and torture chambers the knights are a magnificent sight in their armor and their flags the ukmon princes and then in the snows of skava steppe their legs are hacked off by the skodolak nomads and they lie helpless until the wolves tear them to pieces the witches brew philters and the wizards send up the smoke of dreams and also infect their enemies with blights two hundred years ago the great heroes lived tyier trumble con quered vadrus and built the city carrai where sion trumble now rules jadask dousko found misk a land of herdsmen and aglabat a fishing village in ten years he had created the first brown corps and there has been war ever since she sighed in draszane life is relatively calm we have four ancient colleges hundreds of bib liotheques gentilly is a peaceful old country but misk and vadrus somehow are different sion trumble wants me for his queen but would there ever be peace and happiness or would he always be fighting skodolaks or the tadouskooi or the seahelms and always kokor hekkus who now will be implacable gersen was silent alusz iphigenia went on at interchange i read books of earth and the concourse and aloysius i know how you live and at first i wondered why kokor hekkus stayed so long at aglabat why he fought with swords when he could fit out the brown ber saglers with energy weapons but there is no mystery he needs emotion as other men need food he craves excitement and horror and hate and lust he finds it in the land of misk but someday he will dare too much and sion trumble will kill him she laughed sadly or someday sion trumble will attempt a particularly lu dicrous act of valor and kokor hekkus will kill him which will be a pity hmmf said gersen you are fond of this sion trumble yes he is kind and generous and brave he would not think to rob even interchange gersen grinned sourly im more the kokor hekkus type what of the rest of the planet everywhere it is different in birzul the godmus keeps a harem often thousand concubines every day he enlists ten maidens and discharges ten or if he happens to he in a bad humor drowns them in calastang the divine eye rides through the city carried on a vermilion altar forty yards long and forty yards high the lathcar gentry keep racingmen slave runners especially bred and trained for the lath race meets the tadouskooi build their villages on the highest crags and steepest cliffs and throw down the killing mchine the crippled and infirm they are thambers fiercest warriors the tadouskooi and they have leagued themselves to raze the walls of aglabat and they will succeed because the brown bersaglers cannot withstand them have you ever seen kokor hekkus close at hand yes what does he look like give me paper and pen i will show you gersen brought her writing materials she made tentative marks then worked more swiftly line joined line areas became defined a face looked forth from the paper it was an intelligent alert face under a tall square forehead the eyes were wide and inquiring the hair was rich dark lustrous the nose was short and straight the mouth rather small alusz iphigenia sketched in the torso the legs to depict a man somewhat over average height with broad shoulders a narrow waist long legs the body might well have been that of both billy windle and seuman otwal the face in no way resembled the keen jutting countenance of seuman otwal and gersen had never distinctly seen billy windle alusz iphigenia watched him as he studied the picture and gave a shudder i cant understand cruelty killing hate you are al most as frightening as kokor hekkus gersen put the sketch aside when was small my home was destroyed and all my kin except for my grandfather even then i knew the course of my life was arranged i knew that i wuld one by one kill the five men who had conducted the raid this has been my life i have no other i am not evil i am beyond good and evil like the killing machine kokor hekkus built and i am unlucky enough to be useful to you said alusz iphigenia gersen grinned you probably will prefer being useful to me than to kokor hekkus since all i ask is that you guide me to tham ber you are gallant said alusz iphigenia and gersen could not decide whether her remark carried a barb or not sirius burnt white ahead with off to the side the yellowwhite star that had nurtured the human race alusz iphigenia contemplated it wistfully turned to gersen as if to plead with him then thought better of it and held her tongue till dfmon princes gersen pointed to achernar at the source of the river rn danus a point north is the plane ot galactic north containing the sinusachernar line but the rhyme must be a thousand years old perhaps longer so first we take ourselves to the position of sinus a thousand years ago not too difficult then we calculate achernars apparent position of a thousand years ago again not too difficult using these two new points then we angle north and hope for the best and since ive already made the computa tions lie carefully adusted the verniers sinus swung grandly away to the side presently the jarnell snapped out the starskip drifted in un fractured ether gersen turned the bow toward the point achernar had occupied a thousand years before then swung up va in a plane parallel to the northsouth galactic axis here goes he engaged the mterspht the starskip and its contents deprived of inertia and einstemian constrictions slid with nearmstantaneity along the generated fracture now we must watch for six red stars they may or may not he streaming toward a blue star they may or may not be on the starboard beam unless the rhyme intends that the dorsalventral plane of the ship lie parallel to the north south galactic axis time went by near stars slid across stars more distant which in turn slid across the even farther specks of light behind gersen became edgy he expressed doubt that alus iphigema had remembered the rhyme correctly she replied with a shrug in dicating small concern one way or the other and presently offered the conecture that gersen had made a mistake in his computations how long was your trip to interchange he had asked her this before but always she had given him a vague answer as now she did again i slept a great deal lime seemed to go swiftly gersen began to suspect that the rhyme had taken them on a wild goose chase that hamber lay in a different quarter of the galaxy and that alus iphigema knew this fact ery well alusz iphigema was aware of his dubiousness and it was with a note of vindication that she pointed ahead to six beautihil red giants strung out in a downcurving line toward a great blue star gersens only comment was a grudging well they seem to be on our starboard beam so rhyme and calculations both arent the killing machine too far off he disengaged the jarnell the starskip drifted now a cluster shaped like a scimitar probably a nakedeye obect there alusz iphigema pointed thamber is nearby how do you know the cluster like the scimitar in gentilly we call it the god boat though from here it looks different gersen turned the ship toward the hilt once again he cut in the mterspht the boat slipped forward directly through the cluster they flew with stars all around and then came out into a region only sparsely populated its a fact said gersen were at the edge of the galaxy the verge extreme somewhere dead ahead should be chambers gleam dead ahead lay a sparse scatter of stars the sun is g orange said gersen which is the orange sun there that one the orange star appeared something to the side and below gersen cut off the mterspht he adusted the macroscope which revealed a single planet he raised the magnification continents and seas swam into focus thamber said alusz iphigenia epere tokay there is a human quality that cannot be precisely named possibly the most nohle of all human qualities it includes but is larger than candor generosity comprehension nice ness of

baltimore earth tempting to picture baron bodissey at work in the ar cadian habitat he promulgates surrounded by admiring goatherds el orchide serle quantique it was morning over the continent despaz alusz iphigenia pointed out the geographical divisions to the south the long strip under the skar sakau mountains along the seacoast that is the land of mtsk aglabat is hard to see it is brown and merges with the landscape but it is there where the coast curves inland she pointed and where is your home to the west first is vadrus over that arm of mountains you can see the city carrai a patch of white and gray then there are more mountains and gentilly lies beyond there where the sun light is just touching gendlly she turned away from the macro scope but naturally you will never go there nor to carrai why not because neither my father nor sion trumble would allow me to be your slave without comment gersen bent over the macroscope studied the landscape for the better part of an hour while the planet rolled over into the sunlight a number of things are clear he said at last and a number of things arent so clear for instance how i can approach kokor the demon princes hekkus without being killed he undoubtedly has radar and quite possibly skybolts to protect his city we must land somewhere beyond the range of detection devices and the most convenient spot seems to be beyond those mountains and after you land what then in order to kill kokor hekkus first i find him to find him ill have to look for him what of me complained alusz iphigenia woefully i left thamber to escape kokor hekkus now you bring me back after you are killed which is certain what then must i return to inter change it seems that our interests coincide said gersen we both want kokor hekkus dead neither wants him aware of our presence on thamber we will stay together he turned the starskip down toward thamber standing well to the north of the mountains called the skar sakau after careful inspection of the terrain he found an isolated col under a great peak and there he landed to right and left stood other windlashed peaks laced with glaciers below and to the south spread a jumble of ridges chasms precipices as wild a region as any gersen had known while waiting for air pressure to equalize he lowered the little aircar from its pod armed himself with his various weapons wrapped himself in a cape as did alusz iphigenia he opened the port jumped down upon the soil of thamber the sun was bright the air was cold the wind mercifully was still alusz iphigenia joined him to stand looking around with an air of repressed exhilaration as if in spite of her fears she was happy to be home she turned to gersen and spoke impulsively youre not an evil man in spite of what you say about yourself youve treated me kindly more kindly that i could have expected why not give over this fantastic scheme of yours kokor hekkus is secure behind the walls ofagla bat not even sion trumble can threaten him what can you do to kill him you must bring him forth you must defeat all his cruel ruses and never forget that in all the universe he most wishes to meet you im aware of this said gersen and you still persist you must be a lunatic or a sorcerer no then you have made plans how can i make plans when i have no facts thats what were the killixg machine going out for now see this box he nudged a black metal case with his toe i can sit at a distance of ten miles and send a spy cell into aglabat to learn whatever i need to know alusz iphigenia had no rebuttal to make gersen appraised the starskip the surrounding mountains surely no wandering barbar ians would come so high or so far divining his thoughts alusz iphigenia said they keep to the south of the skar where their flocks find sustenance where the granaries ofmisk are near at hand if we fly south we will see their villages they are the most fero cious fighters alive using only daggers and bare hands gersen packed the black case aboard the airboat which unlike the flying platform carried by his old model b was equipped with a transparent dome and comfortable seats alusz iphigenia stepped aboard gersen joined her closed down the dome the boat rose skidded off down the col then south through the soaring juts and crags never had gersen seen such awesome scenery cliffs rose sheer from crevasselike valleys in which wound a dim metal tendril of a river visible only because the orange sun hung at noon chasm opened into chasm winds roaring through collided and buffeted the aircar occasionally a waterfall plunged from the lip of a crag to fray and wave like a wisp of white silk crag after crag ridge after ridge slipped behind and the lay of the valleys was to the south far below forests and meadows could be seen and presently alusz iphigenia pointed to what seemed a complicated crumble of rock pasted to an almost sheer crag a village of the tadouskooi theyll think us a magic bird so long as they dont shoot us down they use only boulders to roll upon their enemies and bows and catapults for their hunting gersen nevertheless gave the vil lage a wide berth swinging across toward the opposite cliff wall the surface of which seemed curiously humped and pocked only when within a hundred yards did he realize he was approaching another village clinging with incredible precariousness to the bar ren rock he glimpsed a few dark figures on a roof a man aimed a weapon gersen cursed swerved but a short sharp metal dart spat through the forepart of the airboat which gave a jerk a lurch then sagged alusz iphigenia cried out gersen hissed between his teeth not two hours on thamber and already faced with disaster the front i hp dfmon princes liftvanes are gone he said trying to speak calmly were in no danger dont be frightened well return to the ship but this was obviously impossible the airboat hung at an alarming angle suspended on the center and rear vanes alone well have to land said gersen may be able to repair the damage i thought you said these people had no weapons it must have been a crossbow captured from kokor hekkus i can think of no other explanation im truly sorry its no fault of yours gersen gave his full attention to the plunging airboat trying to hold it on a manageable slant as they settled into the valley at the last instant he cut off the rear ets pushed the propulsion hard over and for an instant held the craft on an even keel and so they came down easily on a gravel terrace fifty feet above the river gersen stiffly alighted went to inspect the damage his heart sank how bad is it asked alusz iphigema anxiously very bad i might be able to get us back to the ship by sliding the center vane forward or something similar well to work he brought out such tools as the standard equipment afforded and set to work an hour passed noon sunlight left the valley blue shadows collected with them came a dank chill smelling of snow and wet stone alusz iphigema tugged at gersens arm quick hide the tadouskooi startled gersen let himself be dragged into a cleft among the rocks a moment later he saw one of the strangest sights of his lifetime down the valley came twenty or thirty large centipedes each mounted by five men the centipedes gersen noted were similar to the fort built by patch construction but much smaller they ran smoothly over the stones almost flowing the riders were an illfavored lot massively muscled men whose maroon skins were burnished like old leather their eyes were stony and staring their mouths harsh their noses heavy and hooked they wore clumsy garments of black leather helmets of crude iron and black leather each carried a lance an ax and a heavy dagger at the sight of the disabled aircar the band drew up in sur prise at least they werent sent out to pick us up whispered gersen alusz iphigema said nothing they were pressed close together the killing machine m the cleft even in the extremity of the circumstances he felt a tingling at the contact the tadouskooi had surrounded the aircar a number alighted and conversed in a harsh mumble they began to look up and down the valley it was only a matter of seconds before one of them would investigate the cleft gersen whispered to alusz iphigema stay here ill distract them he stepped forward stood with thumbs hooked in his weapon harness for a moment the warriors stood staring then one who wore a helmet more complicated than the others came slowly forward he spoke harsh grumbling words apparently derived from the ancient universal tongue but incomprehensible to gersen the slatecolored eyes of the chief this seemed to be his rank flicked past gersen in new surprise alusz iphigenia had come forward she spoke in a rough approximation of the tadouskooi language the chief replied the remaining warriors sat motionless gersen had never seen a tableau more sinister alusz iphigenia spoke to gersen i have told him that we are enemies of kokor hekkus that we come from a far world to kill him the hetman says that they are embarked on a raid that they are to join with other bands and that they plan to attack aglabat gersen appraised the hetman once more ask him if he can provide transportation back to our ship ill pay him well alusz iphigenia spoke the hetman gave a grunt of grim humor he spoke alusz iphigenia translated he refuses all the company are intent m this great raid he says that if we like we can om the raiding party i told him that you preferred to repair the airboat the hetman spoke gersen caught the word dnazd used sev eral times alusz iphigema turned after a curious hesitation to gersen he says that we cant survive the night here that the dnazd will kill us what is thednazd a great beast this place is called the valley of the dnazd the hetman spoke again in his dull grumbling voice gersens ear accustomed to extracting meaning from the thousand and one dialects and variants of the universal tongue began to penetrate the hoarseness and glottal overtones the hetman for all the ominous sound to his voice did not seem hostile gersen gathered that it was below the dignity of a war party such as this to prey upon hf demon princes helpless wanderers you say you are enemies of kokor hekkus seemed to be the essence of his words in that case the man will be anxious to om the war party if that is to say he is a fighting man as he may be in spite of his unhealthy pallor alusz iphigenia translated lie says that this is a war party your pale skin gives him the impression that you are sick he says that if we wish to come it will be in a menial capacity there will be much work and much danger hmm is that what he says words to that effect it was apparent that alus iphigenia had no wish to join the war party gersen said ask the hetman if there is any means by which we can return to the ship alusz iphigenia asked the question the hetman seemed sardon ically amused if you can escape the dnazd if you can find your way over two hundred miles of mountains without food and shel ter alusz iphigenia translated in a hollow voice he says he cant help us we can try if we like she looked at the airboat can we repair this i dont think so not unless i find tools we had better go with these people at least until something better offers alusz iphigenia reluctantly translated gersens words the chieftain gave an uninterested assent he motioned one of the mounts that carried only four warriors approached gersen climbed up on the pad that served as saddle pulled alusz iphigenia up into his lap this was the closest contact he had ever made with her it seemed amazing that he had restrained himself so long she seemed to be thinking similar thoughts and gave him a pensive look for a space she held herself as rigid as possible then gradually relaxed the centipedes ran smooth as oil down the valley moved the war party along an almost invisible trail that led up and down over boulders through gaps cracks and crevices occasionally when the valley walls closed tight together with the thamber sky a strip of dark blue ribbon and the water a rushing black syrup the procession ascended the clifts the warriors kept utter silence the centipede mounts made no sound there was nothing to be heard but sigh of wind and sound of water gersen became ever more conscious of the warm body leaning against him he reminded himself wistfully that indulgences of this sort were not for him that his life was the a ll vc machine predestined to grief and doom but his cells and nerves and in stincts protested and his arms tightened around alusz iphigenia she looked around he saw that her face was abstracted melancholy that her eyes were bright with something like tears wtly in the world is she melancholy gersen wondered the circumstances were unfortunate vexatious but still short of desperate if anything the tadouskooi had treated them with courtesy a halt inter rupted his thoughts the hetman was consulting a group of lieu tenants their attention was fixed high above upon a crag where gersen made out another of the dull crumbles he now knew for a village alusz iphigenia shifted in his arms this is an enemy village she told him the tadouskooi feud among themselves the hetman gave a signal three scouts dismounted ran ahead testing the path a hundred yards ahead they croaked out in gut tural alarm sprang back as a slab of rock crashed across the trail the warriors stirred no muscle the scouts continued along the trail disappeared half an hour later they returned the hetman signaled one after another the mounts surged forward from far above objects like gray peas appeared falling with odd slowness almost floating but size and speed were illusory the objects were boulders that smashed to splinters along the trail the warriors showing no concern avoided the fall by speeding slowing darting ahead halting wtien gersen and alusz iphigenia were carried past the fall of boulders had halted beyond the village the valley broadened to a crescentshaped meadow with a feathery forest along the river mere the lead mount stopped short and for the first time a grumble of words passed down the line dnazd but the dnazd was not in evidence the party crouching low on their mounts timorously continued across the meadow the day had gone dark high above a few wisps of cirrus burned bronze in the dying sunlight the party presently entered a cleft in the rocks hardly more than a crevice along which the mounts could squeeze only by folding their legs back at times gersen might have touched the walls to either side the crack wid ened became a circular area floored with sand all alighted the mounts were taken to the side shackled together certain warriors dipped leather buckets in a nearby pool fed the mounts buckets of water and what looked to be powdered blood others made small the demon princes fires hung pots on tripods and began to boil up a ranksmelling stew the hetinan and his lieutenants sat together conferring in un dertones the hetman glanced toward gersen and alusz iphigenia made a movement two of the warriors set up a kind of tent of black cloth alusz iphigenia exhaled a soft sigh turned her eyes to the ground the stew was cooked each warrior took an iron bowl from inside his helmet dipped it into the pot careless to steam and boil ing stew having no bowls gersen and alusz iphigenia sat pa tiently while the warriors ate with fingers and slabs of hard bread the first to finish polished his bowl with sand brought it politely to gersen who accepted with thanks dipped into the stew brought the bowl to alusz iphigenia an act which evoked an amused rumble of comment another bowl was forthcoming and now gersen ate the stew was not unpleasant though salty and seasoned with an odd peppery spice the bread was hard and tasted like burning weeds the warriors squatted around the fires without laughing or horseplay the hetman rose went to the tent gersen looked about for a place for himself and alusz iphigenia it would be a chilly night for they had only their cloaks the tadouskooi who had even less evidently planned to lay themselves down before the fire the warriors were looking at alusz iphigenia in a puzzled manner gersen looked at her also she sat staring into the fire arms wrapped around knees nothing to excite perplexity in the opening to the tent the hetman appeared frowning impatiently he beck oned to alusz iphigenia gersen slowly rose to his feet alusz iphigenia without lifting her eyes from the fire said in a soft voice to the tadouskooi women are a lower species they keep their women in common and the highest ranking warrior sleeps with what is available first gersen looked toward the hetman explain that this is not our custom alusz iphigenia looked slowly up at him we can do nothing we are tell him alusz iphigenia turned to the hetman spoke gersens words the warriors sitting around the fire became still the hetman the killing machine seemed startled and came two paces forward he spoke in your own land you are obliged to observe your own customs but this is the skar sakau and here our ways must hold is this pale man the highest ranking warrior present no of course not therefore you the pale woman must come to my tent this is the way of the skar sakau gersen did not wait for the translation tell him that i am an extremely highranked warrior in my own land that if you sleep with anyone it shall be with me to this the hetman responded not discourteously again this is the skar sakau i am the hetman no man can resist me it is beyond dispute that i outrank the pale man so come woman let there be an end to this undignified parley gersen said tell him that i am more highly ranked that i am a spaceadmiral a ruler a lord anything that he will un derstand she shook her head rose to her feet i had best obey tell him you will be killed said alusz iphigenia tell him alusz iphigenia spoke the chieftain came another two steps forward pointed to a burly young warrior outrank this man trounce him thoroughly to emphasize his lowly condition the warrior doffed his upper harness the hetman spoke the pale man carries cowards weapons let him know that he must fight as a man either with dagger or his hands he must remove his fireflashers gersens hand trembled toward his projac but warriors nearby would instantly have overpowered him slowly he handed his weap ons to alusz iphigenia removed his jacket and singlet his oppo nent carried a heavy doubleedged dagger gersen thereupon brought forth his own slimbladed weapon an area of sand between three fires was cleared warriors of the tadouskooi squatted about in a circle livercolored faces grave dispassionate almost insectlike gersen stepped forward assessed his opponent he was taller than himself with hard muscles and quick motions he twitched the heavy dagger as if it were a feather gersen held his blade loosely the young warrior moved his dagger in a hypnotic circle steel glimmering in the firelight the demon princes gersen made a sudden hard motion his blade flashed through the air cut through the warriors wrist pinned it to his shoulder the dagger fell from limp fingers he stared in numb wonder at his helpless hand gersen stepped close picked up the dropped weapon ducked a kick struck the warrior over the ear with the flat of the blade the warrior tottered gersen struck him again the man fell to the ground in a daze gersen recovered his dagger politely placed the young war riors weapon into its scabbard returned to alusz iphigenia and began to dress himself in the clothes he had removed for the first time there was a murmur among the spectators neither applause nor disapproval merely a mild wonder with a hint of dissatisfaction all looked to the hetman who now marched forward he spoke in a loud voice in a careful singsong rhythm pale man you have defeated this young warrior i cannot fault the unconventional method employed though we of the tadouskooi hold it the way of a weakling to stake all on a single cast moreover nothing has been proved other than the fact that you outrank the young war rior you must fight again he searched among the faces but ger sen spoke tell the hetman he instructed alusz iphigenia that my differences in connection to where you shall spend the night are solely with him and it is he with whom i choose to fight alusz iphigenia repeated the message in a low voice and now the audience sat stunned the hetman was obviously surprised does he so choose does he not realize i am champion the master of all men i have so far faced explain to him that i am hetman that since he is not of the clan such a fight must be to the death alusz iphigenia explained gersen said inform the hetman that i have no wish to prove my high rank that i much prefer sleeping to fighting so long as he does not insist on your company alusz iphigenia spoke the hetman removed his shirt then he spoke we shall settle the question of rank quickly for there may not be two leaders to a war party to avoid a cowards cast we will fight with bare hands gersen appraised him tall he stood heavy but agile with dark flesh that seemed as hard as horn he glanced down at alusz iph igenia who looked up at him fascinated then slowly he stepped forward beside the knotted dark body his own seemed pallid and elastic to test the hetman gersen aimed an apparently random the killwg jvmchine blow toward his head instantly a hard hand seized his wrist a foot lashed out gersen disengaged his wrist with a jerk he could have seized the foot and flung the hetman over but instead allowed the toe barely to graze his hip and he swung another lefthanded blow that landed almost as if by accident on the hetmans neck it felt like a tree trunk the hetman hopped forward both feet at a time in a peculiarly disconcerting manner both arms wide gersen punched at the out thrust face he struck the left eye but was caught up m an arm lock of a sort he had never experienced before which in seconds would snap his ulna gersen relaxed his knees then sprang around in a kind of mad somersault kicking the hetman in the face and wrenching his arm free the hetman was less confident when ger sen faced him next he slowly raised both arms gersen struck at the left eye again the hetmans foot lashed out gersen refrained from seizing the ankle again it grazed his hip the hetmans eye was swollen as he sprang back after the kick gersen took advan tage of an instants respite to scrape a hollow into the sand with his foot the hetman circled him gersen moved away feinted his wrist was seized a great hand hacked at the back of his neck gersen dived instantly forward put his shoulder to the hetmans rockhard belly the blow slid off his shoulder gersen thrust forward the hetman pulled up a knee battering gersens chest gersen caught the knee shifted his position caught the ankle twisted the hetman was forced to fall to protect his knee gersen kicked him in the right eye jumped away from the sweep of the massive red arm he stood panting and sobbing his chest aching but the hetmans right eye was closing gersen bent carefully enlarged the hollow in the sand glaring like a boar the hetman watched him then apparently casting caution aside he rushed forward gersen moved aside on occasion he had exercised the same feigned recklessness he jabbed at the hetmans left eye but a dazzling fast blow of the hetmans left hand crushed his wrist causing intense pain and leaving his left hand limp this was a serious loss but the hetmans right eye was shut and his left eye was swollen ignoring the pain gersen flapped his now useless left hand into the red face again the left hand swung up to hack but gersen caught the left wrist in his right hand kicked behind the left knee butted into the hetmans neck and the hetman let himself sag still perfectly controlled and coordinated grunting hissing between his teeth gersen hacked into the momentarily ex the ufmon princes posed neck the hetman purple in the face slashed out back handed gersen who now was beginning to lose his agility caught the blow on his right forearm it was like the impact of a sledge hammer left and right hands both were useless the two men stood back both sweating and gasping both of the hetmans eyes were almost shut gersen strove to conceal the futility of his hands it would be fatal to display weakness summoning his last resources he crouched began to stalk the hetman his arms held as if ready to strike the hetman roared out made his twofooted ump ger sen lurched to meet him drove his right elbow into the black con tusion of the hetmans neck the hetmans arms surrounded gersen he began banging the side of his head against gersens temple gersen sagged low butted at the hetmans chin kicked at his knees both toppled the hetman trying to swing gersen under gersen acceded to the impulse augmented it landed on top clenched in the wet maroon arms he butted at the chin at the nose the hetman tried to counter with snapping teeth heaving and lurching to roll to the top which gersen prevented with outspread legs he butted the teeth scarred his forehead he butted at the nose it broke he butted again battered down at the chin again the teeth lacerated his forehead but the hetman could take no more he loosened his grip that he might place a forearm under gersens neck but gersen had been waiting he jerked himself free sat upon the hetmans abdomen then with his last energy brought his head down against the bridge of the hetmans nose the hetman choked relaxed dazed by pain fatigue the blows to neck and head gersen staggered to his feet arms dangling he looked down at the great maroon body never had he fought so terrible an antagonist was the hetman dead lesser blows had killed lesser men gersen stumbled to where alusz iphigenia sat sobbing in a slurred voice he said tell the warriors to care for their hetman he is a great fighter and the enemy of my enemy alusz iphigenia spoke prom the onlookers came a dismal rum ble several warriors went to look down at the unconscious hetman then glanced toward gersen he stood swaying fires flickered cra zily faces were a nightmare blur he gasped for air and looking high glimpsed a cluster of stars shaped like a scimitar alusz iphigenia had risen to her feet come she said and led him to

warriors stirred blew the coals ablaze set their stew asimmer the hetman his head a mass of bruises sat with his back to a rock looking dourly across the area no one spoke to him nor he to anyone from the tent came gersen followed by alusz iphigenia she had bound his left wrist massaged his right the killing machine arm aside from a thousand bruises aches and the sprain ot his left wrist he was not in bad condition he walked to where the hetman sat and essayed to speak in the harsh dialect of the skar sakau you toughtwell you fought better mumbled the hetman never since boy hood have i been beaten i called you a coward i was wrong you did not kill me by this token you become a clanfellow and het man what are your orders suppose i ordered the party to conduct us to our ship you would not be obeyed the men would ride off i was as you are now war leader beyond this i had only such authority as i was willing to enforce and no more have you in that case said gersen we will consider the events of last night no more than friendly exercise you are hetman we are your guests wtien it suits us we shall part company the hetman lurched to his feet if these are your wishes so be it we proceed against our enemy kokor hekkus ruler of misk the party presently was ready to proceed a scout went to re connoiter the valley but returned hurriedly dnazd dnazd went the subdued rumble of voices an hour passed the sky brightened the scout went forth again returned to signal that all was clear out into the winding valley moved the procession and away at noon the valley widened and as the war party rounded a bend the notch made by the rocky slopes revealed a far view over a sunny green land ten minutes later they came to a spot where sixty or seventy other centipedes stood tethered with warriors squatting nearby the hetman rode forward conferred with others of similar rank without delay the entire troop moved off down the valley an hour before sunset they came down out of the foothills into a rolling savannah here grazed herds of small black ruminants tended by men and boys riding taller animals of the same general type at the sight of the tadouskooi they fled incontinently then finding no pursuit halted to stare in wonder gradually the land became more populated first there were a few huts then round lowwalled houses with tall conical roofs then villages everywhere there was flight none dared face the t a douskooi ihf dfmon princfs at sunset the city aglabat appeared rising from a level green plain battlemented walls of brown stone surrounded the city which seemed a compact mass of tall round towers at the center from the tallest tower of all flew a brown and black pennon kokor hekkus is m residence said aiusz iphigenia when he is gone no pennon flies over green sward as neat and green as the turf of a park the warriors approached the city alusz iphigenia was disturbed best that we part company with the tadouskooi before they invest the town why asked gersen do you think kokor hekkus is to be caught nappmg at any minute the brown bersaglers will sally forth there will be a ter rible battle we may well be killed or worse captured without once coming anywhere near kokor hekkus gersen could not quarrel with her remarks but by some pe culiar circumstance he had attached himself to the war band to leave now especially when he shared the views of alusz iphigenia as to the probable destruction of the tadouskooi seemed like treachery still he had not come to thamber for chrvalric gestures with the city two miles distant the party halted gersen ap proached the hetman wtiat are your battleplans we besiege the city sooner or later kokor hekkus must send forth his army before when this occurred we were too few and were forced to flee we still are few but not too few we will destroy the brown bersaglers we will grind the knights into dust we will drag kokor hekkus across the plain to his death then we will possess ourselves of the riches of aglabat the plan had the virtue of simplicity thought gersen sup pose the army does not come forth sooner or later it must unless they prefer to starve the sun went down into a purple sky lights shone from the towers of aglabat tonight no one offered discourtesy to alusz iphigenia like the night before they occupied the black tent the sense of her nearness finally destroyed gersens self control he took her by the shoulders looked into the dimness of her face kissed her and she seemed to respond but did she her expression could not be seen through the dark he kissed her again and felt moisture on her face she was weeping angrily he stood back why are you crying hllli g machim pentup emotions probably because i kissed you of course suddenly everything was unsatisfactory she was in his power subect to his orders he did not want her submission he wanted her ardor suppose circumstances were different he said sup pose we were in draszane suppose that you had no worries sup pose i came to you like this and kissed you wtiat would you do i will never see draszane again she said sullenly i have many worries i am your slave do as you like gersen sat down on the floor of the tent very well i will go to sleep the following day the fadouskooi moved closer to the city camping a mile in front of its main gate on the walls soldiers could be seen moving back and forth at noon the gates opened out marched six regiments of pikemen wearing brown uniforms with black armor and black helmets the tadouskooi gave a hoarse whoop sprang to their mounts gersen and alusz iphigenia watched the battle from the camp it was savage and bloody waged without quarter the bersaglers fought bravely but without the wild ferocity of the mountain men presently the remnants retreated through the gates leaving a field strewn with dead the following day was eventless the brown and black pennon flew from the spire of the citadel gersen asked alusz iphigenia where does kokor hekkus keep his spaceship on an island to the south he has an aircar like yours to fly back and forth until sion trumble attacked the island and cap tured the spaceship i thought kokor hekkus a great wizard gersen was more dissatisfied than ever it was clear that under no circumstances could he make contact with kokor hekkus should the tadouskooi succeed in storming the city kokor hek kus would escape m his aircar it was essential that they return to the starskip then he would take up a position where he could see but not be seen where he could intercept the aircar that must eventually leave aglabat no matter what the outcome of the battle he toldlusz iphigenia of his decision she approved we need only fare to carrai sion trumble will escort you north of the skar sakau and matters will be as you wish what of you the demon princes she looked away toward the north sion trumble has long desired me for his bride he has professed his love i am willing gersen made a contemptuous sound noble sion trumble had professed his love gallant sion trumble gersen went to speak to the hetinan there were casualties in the battle and i notice that now there are extra mounts if you could spare me one of these i will try to return to my spaceship it shall be as you wish select the mount of your choice the most docile and easily managed of the group will serve toward evening the mount was brought to the tent at dawn gersen and alusz iphigenia would depart for carrai during the night workmen from the city stole forth to erect an enclosure a hundred feet on a side shrouded with brown cloth to a height of twenty feet the tadouskooi were furious at the in solence they mounted their centipedes and sallied forth cautiously however because the enclosure had not been set out for nothing indeed it had not when the ranks of the centipede mounts had drawn close the brown cloth bulged out ran an enormous centipede with thirtysix legs eyes flashing fire the tadouskooi recoiled swung about in confusion dnazd came the cry dnazd no dnazd gersen told alusz iphigenia that is the product of patch engineering and construction and it is time we were on our way they mounted the waiting centipede sent it scurrying off to the northwest on the sward before the city the fort ran back and forth while the tadouskooi scuttled frantically finally fleeing in complete disorder in pursuit came the fort running with a fluid ease that gave gersen rueful pleasure alusz iphigenia was not yet convinced are you sure the thing is metal absolutely certain of the tadouskooi came the way gersen and alusz iphigenia had traveled and the fort followed darting bolts of pur plewhite fire with every flash a centipede shriveled and five men died presently no more were left except that ridden by gersen and alusz iphigenia a halfmile in advance they made frantically for the foothills the fort swerved to cut them off up a swell of high ground gersen urged the mount around a knob of rock here he jumped to the ground lifted down alusz iphigenia the centipede raced away gersen scrambled up to a hidingplace behind an out crop of mosscovered sandstone with alusz iphigenia crawling af the killing jvachne ter she looked at him started to speak then said nothing she was dirty and scratched and disheveled her garments were soiled her eyes were wide the pupils dark with fear gersen had no time for reassurances he brought forth his projac waited there came a whir a thud of thirtysix racing feet over the rise scrambled the fort to pause and search the landscape for its prey gersen fleetingly wondered if long ago in patchs workshop b he had subconsciously envisioned just this sort of confrontation he set the projac at low power took careful aim at a spot along the forts dorsal ridge pulled the trigger in the cutoff cell a relay threw a switch the legs became limber the segmented body sagged to the ground presently the hatch opened members of the crew alighted to walk about the fort in obvious puzzlement gersen counted them nine out of a crew of eleven two had remained inside all wore brown coveralls all carried themselves in an in definable manner that was not of thamber there were two who might be seuman otwal or billy windle or kokor hekkus from distance of fifty yards gersen could not be sure of their faces one turned his neck was too long definitely not the man gersen sought the other but he had gone back into the fort the ioni zation began to dissipate the legs were recovering their strength listen alusz iphigenia breathed into gersens ear gersen could hear nothing listen she said again now ger sen heard a soft clickclick clickclick a sound of vast menace it seemed to come from behind them down the mountainside came the creature that the fort duplicated a true dnazd gersen found it hard to understand how anyone could be deceived by the metal structure if the tadouskooi had been fooled by the fort not so the dnazd it came scuttling forward stopped short apparently from curiosity and amazement the crew had scrambled aboard and clamped the hatch the legs were still limp from the eye came only a weak spatter of fire to strike the dnazd on its rear segment it reared high emitted a wild whistling scream flung itself on the fort both toppled to the ground both rolled and clambered man dibles chewed at the metal hull poisontipped prongs stabbed and scratched within the crew tumbled and rolled until someone man aged to set in motion the automatic righting sequence power back to normal the fort scrambled to its feet once again the dnazd flung itself high to hurtle down at the metal segments fire spat from the the demon princes eye the dnazd lost the use of a leg again the eye took aim a central segment was blasted and the dnazd sagged legs thrashing at the ground the fort moved back fire flared from both sides of the eyes the dnazd became a mound of reeking flesh gersen inched forward once more he turned his projac on the cutoff cell as before the fort swayed to the ground presently the hatch opened the crew limped down the ladder to the ground gersen counted nine ten eleven all had come forth they conferred then went to inspect the dead dnazd when they turned about gersen stood nearby his proac trained on them face away from me said gersen stand in a line with hands in the air ill kill whoever gives me trouble there was indecision tentative swaying and tensing as each man calculated his chances of becoming a hero each decided they were poor gersen underscored the fact with a flash of energy that scorched the ground at their feet grudgingly faces contorted into masks of hate they turned their backs alusz iphigenia came to oin gersen look inside he said make sure all are out she returned after a moment to report the fort empty now said gersen to the eleven men you must do exactly as i say if you value your lives the first man to the right back up six steps he was sullenly obeyed gersen took his weapon a small but vicious projac of a design gersen had never seen before lie down flat on your face put your arms to the small of your back one by one the eleven moved back lay flat were disarmed and bound with straps from their own garments one by one gersen turned the men over so that they lay on their backs one by one he searched their faces none were seuman ocwal which of you is kokor hekkus he asked there was a pause then the man who had carried the projac spoke he is at aglabat gersen turned to alusz iphigenia you know kokor hekkus do any of these men resemble him alusz iphigenia looked searchingly at the man who had spoken his face is different but his manner his way of carrying himself is the same gersen considered the mans features they appeared genuine without the subtle demarcations or change of texture that indicated falseness nor did he wear a mask but the eyes were they the eyes the killing machine of seuman otwap there was an indefinable similarity a sense of cynical wisdom gersen said no more he looked over the remain der of the crew then returned to the man who had spoken what is your name franz paderbush the voice was soft almost obsequious you are native to where i am knight junior of the castle pader at the east ofmisk do you not believe me not with any conviction you need only come to castle paderbush said the captive with a rather unsuitable flippancy of manner and the knight sen ior my father will vouch for me a dozen times over possibly true said gersen still you resemble billy windle of skouse and also a certain seuman otwal whom i last met near krokmole you others he said get to your feet start walking wtiere asked one wherever you choose with our arms bound the savages will kill us grumbled an other find a ditch and hide till nightfall the ten disconsolately departed gersen made another search of paderbush but found no more weapons now knight junior to your feet and into the fort paderbush obeyed with a nimble willingness that gersen found disquieting he tied the knight junior securely to a bench then clamped the port and went to the familiar controls you know how to operate this horror asked alusz iphigenia i helped build it she gave him a thoughtful puzzled look then turned to inspect franz paderbush who favored her with a witless smirk gersen worked the controls the legs responded the fort ran off to the north where are you going asked alusz iphigenia after a moment to the spaceship naturally through the skar sakau through or around you must be mad gersen was dampened in the fort we should be able to make it you know nothing of the trails they are difficult and often the demon princes lead to pitfalls the tadouskooi will roll down boulders the chasms are infested by dnazd if you avoid these there are crevasses precipices crags we have no food what vou say is true but turn west to carrai sion trumble will honor you and guide you north around the skar gersen unable to refute the arguments with poor grace swung the fort around descended into the valley they came into a pleasant rolling country the skar sakau dwindled and faded into the blue haze all through the warm sum mer afternoon the fort ran west past small farms and granges with stone barns and stone cottages with tall roofs and occasional vil lages at the sight of the fort the inhabitants stood glassyeyed transfixed with terror they were an ordinaryseeming folk fair skinned with dark hair the women wearing voluminous skirts and tight patterned bodices the men puffed kneelength bloomers bright shirts and embroidered jackets from time to time a manor house could be seen at the back of a park occasionally there was a castle perched high on a bluff certain of these manors and castles appeared to be falling into ruins ghosts alusz iphigenia ex plained this is ancient country well haunted gersen glancing toward franz paderbush surprised a quiet smile on his face several times he had noted a similar smile on the face of seuman otwal but these were neither the features nor the flesh of seuman otwal the sun sank and twilight fell across the countryside gersen halted the fort at the edge of a lonely watermeadow rations in tended for the crew constituted an evening meal after which pad erbush was confined in the stern lazaret gersen and ajusz iphigenia went outside and watched fireflies overhead hung the constellations of thamber plentiful to the south sparse to the north where intergalactic space began a night creature sang in a nearby forest the air was soft with the bosky odor of vegetation gersen could think of nothing to say finally he heaved a sigh took her hand which she made no effort to with draw for hours they sat with their backs to the fort fireflies flickered across the meadow from a distant village a sadvoiced bell tolled the passage of the hours at last gersen spread his cloak and they slept in the soft grass the killing machine at dawn they once more set forth to the west the country changed the landscape rolled up into forested hills and valleys then became mountains shrouded with tall coniferlike trees the habi tations became fewer more primitive the manor houses disap peared only the castles remained to brood over valley and river on one occasion the silently running fort came upon a band of armed men parading drunkenly down the middle of the road they wore ragged garments and carried bows and arrows outlaws said alusz iphigenia the scum ofmisk and vad rus a pair of stone keeps guarded the border the fort ran past behind bugles blared hurried callstoarms an hour later the fort came out upon a view over rolling coun try to north and west alusz iphigenia pointed there is vadrus see behind the dark forest the patch of white that is the city carrai gentilly is yet to the west but i am well known at carrai sion trumble has often extended hospitality to my family for in gentilly i am princess so now you will become his bride alusz iphigenia looked ahead toward carrai in regret and sad ness as at some bittersweet recollection no i am no longer a child all does not seem so easy before there was sion trumble and kokor hekkus sion trumble is a warrior and no doubt is as brutal in battle as any but to the folk of vadrus he makes an at tempt at justice kokor hekkus of course is the definition of evil before i would have taken sion trumble now i want neither i have had too much excitement indeed she said wistfully i fear that i have learned too much since leaving thamber and i have lost my youth gersen turned he caught sight of the prisoner and why are you amused i recall a similar disillusionment of my youth said franz pad erbush do you care to relate the circumstances no it is only just barely relevant to the conversation how long have you served kokor hekkus all my life he rules misk he is my master perhaps you can tell us something of his plans i fear not i doubt if he has many and these he keeps to the dpmon prncfs himself he is a remarkable man imagine that he will resent the loss of his tort gersen laughed far less than the other harms i have dealt him s at skouse when i thwarted his bargain with daemel trem bath as at interchange when stole his princess and paid him off with blank paper s gersen spoke he studied the eyes of pader bush was it his imagination or did the pupils dilate slightly the uncertainly was exasperating especially when it seemed so pointless and ungrounded billy windle seuman otwal franz paderbush none resembled the other save in physical proportion and in a cer tain indefinable style none according to alusz iphigema could be kokor helckus the fort slid down from the mountains passed through a region of orchards and vines then a wellwatered mead ow land dotted with crofts and villages then it came out on a low headland to overlook carrai a city far different from aglabat in stead of grim brown walls here were wide avenues marble colon nades villas surrounded by trees palaces in formal gardens as splendid as any of earth if there were slums or hovels they were remote from the main thoroughfares at the entrance to the city a great marble arch supported a ball of rock crystal here stood a platoon of guards in purple and green uniforms at the approach of the fort a lieutenant bawled orders the guards marched forward pallid but determined seated their pikes and awaited death fifty yards from the gate gersen halted the fort opened the hatch leapt to the ground the soldiers went limp in astonishment ajusz iphigema came forward the lieutenant seemed to recognize her in spite of her disheveled appearance is it princess iphigenia of dras ane who steps forth from the gullet of the dnazd the beast belies appearances said alusz iphigenia it is ko kor helckus mechanical toy that we have taken from him where is lord sion trumble is he in residence no princess he is to the north but his chancellor only this moment has entered carrai and stands nearby i will send for him a tall whitebearded nobleman in black and purple velvet pres ently appeared he came gravely forward made a gesture of re spect alusz iphigenia greeted him with relief as if here at last was someone in whom she could repose confidence she introduced him to gersen the baron fndel thobalt then she inquired for sion trumble baron thobalt responded in a voice from which irony the killing machine was not absent sion trumble had sallied forth on a raid against the grodnedsa corsairs of the north promeneous sea he was expected back in the nottoodistant future meanwhile the princess should regard the city as her own this would be sion trumbles desire alusz iphigenia turned to gersen a new grace and radiance shining from her face i cannot repay you for your services to me nor would i try after all i suppose you did not regard them as such still i offer you the hospitality that i now command whatever your desire you need only announce it gersen replied that it had been his pleasure to serve her any obligation on her part she had more than canceled by guiding him to thamber but ill still take advantage of your offer i want paderbush confined where hell be absolutely secure until i decide what to do with him we will be lodged at the state palace in the crypts are suitable dungeons she spoke to the lieutenant of the guards and the un fortunate paderbush was hustled away returning to the fort gersen disconnected various cables and connections thereby disabling the mechanism meanwhile a car riage had appeared a tall ornate vehicle on golden wheels gersen ined alusz iphigema and baron thobalt in the forward compart ment with a feeling of guilt for his soiled garments he seated him self on soft red velvet and white fur the carriage proceeded along the boulevard men in rich cos tumes and tall peaked hats women in white gowns of many flounces turned to watch ahead lay the state palace of sion trumble this was a square building at the back of a great garden the design of which like the other palaces of carrai was at once ornate and pleasantly naive there were six tall towers encircled by spiral staircases a dome of glass pentagons held in a web of bronze terraces with balusters in the shape of nymphs at a marble ramp the carriage halted here waited an extremely tall extremely thin old man in black and gray robes he carried a mace terminating in an emerald ellipsoid ap parently an insignia of office he greeted alusz iphigema with mea sured respect baron thobalt presented him to gersen uther caymon seneschal of the state palace the seneschal bowed at the same time casting a critical eye up and down gersens stained garments then flicked his mace foot rw df mon princes men appeared escorted alusz iphigema and gersen into the palace across a long salon hung with crystal they walked on a carpet woven in patterns or lavender rose and pale green they parted in a circular vestibule each to a side corridor gersen was taken to a suite of rooms opening on a walled garden with blossoming trees surrounding a fountain after the hardships of the journey the sud den luxury was unreal gersen bathed in a warm pool and a barber appeared to shave him from a wardrobe a valet brought fresh garments loose dark green trousers gathered at the ankle a dark blue shirt embroidered in white green leather slippers with eccentric curled toes the rakish peaked cap that seemed an essential part of the masculine attire in the garden a table had been set with fruit cakes and wine gersen ate drank and wondered why amid surroundings such as this sion trumble could bring himself to raid corsairs or indulge in any hardships whatever he left the apartment and wandered through the palace finding everywhere furnishings rugs and hangings of exquisite craftsman ship obects of varying styles evidently brought from all the regions of thamber in a drawing room he came upon the baron thobalt who greeted him with somber courtesy after a moment or two of pon dering thobalt inquired as to the nature of the outside universe from which so i understand you have come gersen admitted as much he described the oikumene its var ious worlds and their organizations the beyond and its disorgani zation the planet earth from which had issued all humanity he spoke of thamber and the legend that it had become to which the baron replied that the remainder of humanity was no less a myth to the folk of thamber with a trace of melancholy he asked no doubt you intend to return to your native environment in due course gersen said cautiously you will then explain that thamber is after all no myth i havent considered the matter said gersen what is your own feeling perhaps you prefer isolation thobalt shook his head i am thankful that i need not make this decision before today only a single individual claimed to have visited the worlds of the stars and this was kokor hekkus but he is denounced everywhere as a hormagaunt a man without a soul and not to be trusted the killing machine you are acquainted with kokor hekkus i have seen him across the field of war gersen forbore to ask if the baron had noted a similarity with the man paderbush thinking of paderbush now a prisoner in the crypts he felt a twinge of conscience if the man were not kokor hekkus his only offense was participation m a counterattack upon the tadouskooi gersen signaled a footman take me to the crypts where my prisoner is confined a moment sir knight i will inform the seneschal he alone carries keys to the crypts the seneschal presently appeared considered gersens request then rather grudgingly or so it seemed took gersen to a great door of carved wood unlocked it to reveal a second iron door which opened upon a flight of stone steps these led down a long single flight into an area paved with granite flags illuminated by slits communicating with the outside daylight to one side iron barred doors led into cells only one of which was occupied the seneschal gestured there is your prisoner if you wish to kill him be kind enough to use the chamber beyond where the necessary equipment is at hand i plan nothing like that i only wanted to assure myself that he suffered nothing ill this is not aglabat there is nothing of that sort here gersen went to look through the bars paderbush leaning back in a chair surveyed him with contemptuous mockery the cell was dry and airy on a table were the remnants of an apparently ade quate meal you are satisfied asked the seneschal gersen turned away with a nod a week or two of meditation can do him no great harm allow him to see no one but myself as you wish the seneschal conducted gersen back to the drawingroom where now alusz iphigenia had joined the baron present were also other ladies and knights of the palace alusz iph igenia looked at gersen with something like surprise i have known you only as a spaceman she told him i am surprised to see you a gentleman of vadrus gersen grinned i havent changed in spite of the finery but you he could not find words to express what he wanted to say alusz iphigenia said rather hurriedly i have had word that hip mon princ fs sion trumble returns he will be with us at this evenings ban quet gersen felt an emptiness he strove to deny it to himself in spite of his clothes he was no gentleman of vadrus or elsewhere he was kirth gersen survivor of the mount pleasant massacre doomed to a lifetime of dark deeds he said lightly this is what makes you happy the nearness of your betrothed she shook her head he is hardly that as you well know i am happy because but no i am not happy i am all at odds with myself she gave her hands an excited nutter look all this is mine should i want it i can enov all the best ofthamber but do i want it and then there is kokor hekkus who is unpredictable but somehow i do not think of him is it that i prefer the life of a vagabond that i have seen enough of the worlds beyond thamber to tantalize me gersen had nothing to say she sighed looked at him from the corner of her eye but i have small choice i am here now and here i must stay next week i return to draszane and you will be gone you will wont you gersen gave the matter sober thought where and how i go depends on how best i can return to the spaceship and then and then i continue with what i came to do she sighed it seems a bleak prospect back to the skar sakau the crags and chasms once more then aglabat how will you find your way through the walls and it you are captured she grimaced when i first heard of the crypts under aglabat i did not sleep for months i was afraid to sleep ror fear ot the aglabat crypts an attendant in pale green livery passed by with a tray alusz iphigema took two goblets gave one to gersen and if you were killed or captured how could i leave thamber if i were of a mind to do so gersen laughed uncomfortably if i thought of these matters i would fear them i would be less effective tor my fear and hence more likely to suffer capture or death if you wed sion trumble it appears that you will have the same problems alusz iphigenia shrugged her slender bare shoulders she wore the white flounced sleeveless gown characteristic of the city he is handsome gentle just gallant and perhaps too good for me i the killing machine suddenly find myself thinking thoughts and wishing wishes i never knew before she looked around the room listened a moment to the murmur of conversation then turned back to gersen i find it hard to express myself but in a period when men and women fly space almost instantly when a hundred worlds associate them selves in an oikumene when anything seems possible to human reason this remote little planet with its extremes of virtue and vi dousness seems unthinkable gersen who knew the worlds beyond and the worlds of the oikumene much more intimately than alusz iphigema could not share her feelings it depends he said on how you regard hu manity its past its present and what you hope for the future most people of the oikumene might agree with you the institute he laughed hollowly probably would prefer more ofthamber in the daily life of the oikumene i know nothing of the institute said alusz iphigenia are they evil men or criminals no said gersen they are philosophers alusz iphigema sighed almost absently reached forth to take his hand there is so much i dont know a herald marched into the room followed by pages with long clarions the herald cried sion trumble grand prince ofvadrus enters his palace the room became quiet a distant measured clanking could be heard in the hall the pages raised their clarions blew a fanfare into the room strode sion trumble wearing stained armor a mo rion dented and smeared with blood he removed the morion re vealing a mass of blond ringlets a closecropped blond beard a fine straight nose and the bluest of blue eyes he raised his arm in salute to all then marched to alusz iphigenia bowed over her hand my princess you have chosen to return alusz iphigenia giggled sion trumble looked at her in sur prise the truth of the matter said alusz iphigema is that this gentleman allowed me no choice sion trumble turned to inspect gersen he and sion trumble would never be friends thought gersen noble gallant gentle and just though sion grumble might be he likewise was almost cer tainly humorless selfrighteous and obstinate i have been informed of your coming sion trumble told gersen i noted the dreadful mechanism in which you came we shall have much to discuss but now please excuse me i go to the demon princes relieve myself of my armor he turned departed the room the murmur of conversation began again alusz iphigenia had no more to say and became almost pensive an hour later the company moved to the banquet hall at an ele vated table sat sion trumble in robes of scarlet and white flanked by nobles of the realm below ranged other folk in strict order of precedence gersen found himself near the outer door and he noted that alusz iphigcnia for all her ostensible standing as the betrothed of sion trumble still gave way to at least six ladies of presumably more elevated rank the banquet was long and splendid the wines were strong gersen ate and drank sparingly answered questions with courtesy unsuccessfully tried to make himself inconspicious for it appeared that every eye was on him sion trumble ate scantily and drank less halfway through the meal he rose and pleading fatigue excused himself from the com pany somewhat later a page came behind gersen to whisper in his ear my lord at your convenience the prince wishes to speak with yon gersen rose to his feet the page led him to the circular vesti bule along a corridor through a door into a small drawingroom paneled in green wood here sat sion trumble now wearing a loose gown of pale blue silk he motioned gersen to a chair nearby indicated a tabouret on which stood goblets and flasks be at ease he said you are a man of a far world please ignore our incom prehensible protocol we will talk as one man to another with complete candor tell me why are you here gersen could see no reason to tell other than the truth i came to kill kokor hekkus sion trumble raised his eyebrows alone how will you storm his walls how will you defeat the brown bersaglers i dont know sion trumble looked into the fire that burned in a nearby grate as of the moment truce exists between misk and vadrus there might well have been war when the princess iphigenia chose to cast her lot with me but now it seems that she will have neither of us he frowned into the fire gripped the chair handles i will provide no provocation the killing machine can you help me in any way whatever gersen thought that he might as well learn the worst conceivably what is your quarrel with kokor hekkus gersen described the raid on mount pleasant five men de stroyed my home killed all my kin enslaved my friends i hope to bring retribution to these five malagate is dead kokor hekkus will be next sion trumble frowned and nodded you have undertaken what seems a formidable task specifically what do you want of me first your help and guidance in returning to my spaceship which i left to the north of the skar sakau this i will provide to the best of my ability to the north of the skar are principalities hostile to me and the tadouskooi are implacable there is another aspect to the affair said gersen he hesi tated suddenly aware of another startling possibility that till now he had not recognized he continued slowly when i took the fort from kokor hekkus i took also a prisoner who i thought might be kokor hekkus himself princess iphigenia thinks not but i am uncertain it seemed unlikely then and does so now that kokor hekkus could resist the first trial of his new toy and something about this prisoner reminds me of another man who might also he kokor hekkus i can deal with your uncertainty said sion trumble in the palace is baron eri castiglianu once intimately leagued with kokor hekkus and now his direct enemy if anyone will know kokor hek kus the baron castiglianu is the man and tomorrow you may make the test i will be happy to hear his opinion sion trumble came to a decision i cannot help you to any large extent for i do not visit war or hardship upon my people without good cause so long as kokor hekkus keeps to aglabat i will not provoke him he made a sign the audience was over gersen rose to his feet left the room in the antechamber he found the seneschal who con ducted him to his apartments gersen went out into the garden looked up at the sky found the scimitarshaped cluster the god boat and thought of what he must do and was almost appalled yet what otherwise why had he come to thamber he demon princfs he went to bed and slept well sunlight streaming into his room awakened him he bathed dressed in the most somber of the gar ments to he found in his wardrobe ate a breakfast of fruit pastry and tea clouds rolled in from the west and there was rain in his garden gersen watched the drops plash in the pool and considered the various factors to the situation always he returned to the same idea the identity of paderbush must be established by one means or another a page entered to announce the attendance of baron eri cas tiglianu he was a gaunt man of middle age stern of demeanor scarred along both his cheeks i have been ordered by prince sion trumble to place my special knowledge at your disposal he said this i shall be pleased to do you are aware of what i require not clearly i want you to look closely at a man and tell me whether or not he is kokor hekkus the baron grimaced and what then you can do this assuredly notice these scars they were wrought by the orders of kokor hekkus i hung three days on a rod through my cheeks living only through hate come then let us inspect this man he is here he is confined below in the crypts the page brought the seneschal who unlocked the double doors of timber and metal into the crypt the three descended paderbush stood in the cell hands on bars legs apart staring forth into the outer chamber gersen pointed this is the man the baron advanced inspected paderbush closely well asked gersen no said the baron after a moment this is not kokor hek kus at least no i am sure not although the eyes look at me with evil wisdom no he is a stranger i have never met him at aglabat or elsewhere very well then it appears i have been wrong gersen turned to the seneschal open the door you intend to release the man not completely but he need no longer be confined in a dun geon the killing machine the seneschal unlocked the door come forth said gersen it appears that i have done you an injustice paderbush slowly stepped from the cell he had not been ex pecting release and he moved warily gersen took him by the wrist using a grip that could instantly be transposed into an armlock come along back up the stairs where do you take this man the seneschal inquired petu lantly prince sion trumble and i will jointly make a decision said gersen to baron eri castighanu he said my thanks for your cooperation you have been helpful baron castighanu hesitated this man may be a villain in any case he may seek to overpower you gersen displayed the projac he carried in his left hand i am prepared for anything the baron bowed walked swiftly away relieved to be dis charged of his obligation gersen took paderbush to his apartments closed the door upon the seneschal gersen seated himself in a leisurely manner paderbush stood in the center of the room and finally asked wtiat do you plan with me now i am still puzzled said gersen possibly you are the man you say you are in which case i know nothing to your discredit other than the fact that you serve kokor hekkus still i would not have you pent in a dungeon for hypothetical crimes you are soiled will you bathe no you prefer sweat and grime perhaps you would change your clothes no gersen shrugged as you wish paderbush folded his arms glared down at gersen wtiy do you restrain me here gersen considered i suspect that your life is m danger i mean to protect you i am well able to protect myself nevertheless please seat yourself in that chair yonder ger sen pointed with the tip of his proac you stand like a wild beast about to pounce and this makes me uneasy paderbush gave him a cold grin seated himself i have done the demon princes you no harm he said presently but you have humiliated me thrown me into a dungeon and now you ply me with hints and innuendos i tell you kokor hekkus is not a man to overlook pur poseful wrongs done to his underlings if you wish to spare your host much embarrassment i suggest that you discharge me from custody that i may return to aglabat you know kokor hekkus well gersen asked in a tone of easy conversation certainly he is a man like a khasferug eagle his eyes glitter with intelligence his joy and his anger are both like fire and sweep all before them his imagination is as broad as the sky everyone wonders regarding the thoughts that form and pass behind his brow and from what source they are derived interesting said gersen i am eager to meet him as i shall soon do paderbush was incredulous you are to meet kokor hekkus gersen nodded you and i will return to aglabat in the fort after a week or two of rest here at carrai i prefer to leave at this moment impossible i want no notice of my arrival i wish to surprise kokor hekkus paderbush sneered you are a fool you are more than a fool how can you surprise kokor hekkus he knows more of your movements than you do yourself from the avatars apprentice in scroll from the ninth dimension there was no cessation to the haze that extended right and left in gelid layers and up was as good as down there was a sense of comings and goings of invisible fluttering messages all quite beyond marmadukes apprehension he began to suspect that somehow the doctrine of temporal stasis had effected a transposition of percepts why else he wondered as he groped through the mauve suffusion should the word lachrymose occur to him again and again and again he found himself at the edge of a bulging limpid win dow beyond which danced anamorphotic visions looking up he spied a fringe of curving rods below he found a pink curving shelf in which were embedded more of these rods to the side a lumpy porous object thrust forth like a pro digious nose and he now saw the object to be a nose in all verity a most extraordinary object marmaduke altered the trend of his musings the central problem so it seemed was to learn from whose eye he looked forth much after all would depend upon his viewpoint the morning passed paderbush at times seemed to doze in the chair at times seemed vividly alert on the verge of a sudden attack upon gersen after one of these tense periods gersen said i urge you to patience first as you know i carry a weapon he held the dkmon princfs the projac up into paderbushs view and second even without it you could do nothing against me are vou so sure paderbush asked with weary insolence we are of a size let us try a fall or two and see who is the better man thank you not on this occasion wtly should we exert our selves presently we will have our noon meal so let us relax as you wish at the door sounded a taptaptap gcrsen went to stand by the thick panel who is there it is uther caymon seneschal came the muffled voice open the door if you please gersen did so the seneschal stepped forward the prince wishes to see you in his chambers at once he has heard the opinion of the baron eri castiglianu and he begs that the prisoner be given his freedom he wishes to provide kokor hekkus no pretext for contentiousness i definitely intend to relinquish all control over this man in due course said gersen but now he has agreed to accept the hospitality of sion trumble for possibly two weeks that is generous of him observed the seneschal drily in asmuch as the grand prince has been so remiss as to forget to proffer this same hospitality will you accompany me to the apart ments of prince sion trumble gersen rose to his feet with pleasure what will i do with our guest i dare not leave him nor do i care to go everywhere arm in arm with him return him to the dungeon said the seneschal crossly this is hospitality adequate for his sort the grand prince would not agree to this declared gersen he has only just requested that i release the man the seneschal blinked that is so please convey my apologies and ask if he will condescend to meet me here the seneschal made a gruff noise threw up his hands in a help less gesture threw a baleful sideglance toward paderbush and left the room gersen and paderbush sat facing each other tell me said gersen are you acquainted with a man named seurnan otwal i have heard his name mentioned the killing machine he is an associate of kokor hekkus you and he have certain mannerisms in common that may well be true perhaps because of our association with kokor hekkus wtiat are these mannerisms an attitude of the head a certain set of gesticulations what i might call a psychic aura very strange indeed paderbush nodded solemnly but said no more a few minutes later alusz iphigenia came to the door and was admitted she glanced in surprise from gersen to paderbush why is this man here he thinks the solitude of the dungeon unjust since his of fenses number only a dozen or so murders paderbush grinned wolfishly i am paderbush knight junior of castle pader none of my line have shunned taking a life or two at the risk of his own alusz iphigenia turned away addressed herself to gersen carrai is not so gay as before something has changed something is lacking perhaps it is in me i want to return to draszane to my home i thought that a great gala was being planned in your honor alusz iphigenia shrugged perhaps it has already been forgot ten sion trumble is angry with me or at least is not so gallant as before she gave gersen a quick sideglance perhaps he is jealous jealous why should he be jealous after all you and i spent much time alone this is enough to arouse suspicion and jealousy ridiculous said gersen alusz iphigenia raised her eyebrows am i so illfavored is the mere suggestion of such a relationship so absurd not at all said gersen to the contrary but we must not let sion trumble suffer such a misconception he summoned a page sent him to request audience with sion trumble the page presently returned to announce that the prince was seeing no one return said gersen convey to sion trumble this message say that tomorrow i must depart if necessary i will ride the fort north of the skar sakau and somehow find my spaceship also inform the prince that princess iphigenia plans to accompany me inquire now if he will see us iiedi mon princfs alusz iphigenia turned to gersen you really mean to take me if you care to return to the oikurnene but what of kokor hekkus i thought a detail then youre not serious said alusz iphigenid sadly yes will you come with rne she hesitated then nodded yes why not your life is real my life all of thamber none of it is real it is animated myth archaic scenes from a diorama it stifles me very well we will leave very soon alusz iphigema looked at paderbush what of him she asked dubiously will you free him or leave him for sion trumble no he comes with us alus iphigenia turned a puzzled glance at gersen with us yes for a brief period paderbush rose to his feet stretched his arms this conver sation bores me i will never go with you oh not even so far as aglabat to meet kokor hekkus i go to aglabat alone and now he sprang through the apartment fled across the garden bounded up and over the wall he was gone alusz iphigcma ran to look across the garden then turned to gersen gall the attendants he cant get tar these gardens are all part of the inner courtyard hurry gersen seemed in no desperate haste alusz iphigema tugged at his arm do you wish him to escape no said gersen with sudden energy he must not escape we will inform sion trurnble who will best know how to recapture him come in the corridor gersen ordered the page ake us quickly to sion trumbles apartments on the run the page led them along a corridor to the circular vestibule down another redcarpeted hall to a broad white door here stood two guards in white uniforms with black iron morions open said gersen we must see sion trumble at once no my lord we have orders from the seneschal to admit no i one gersen aimed his profac at the lock there was a blaze of fire i he killing uul r and smoke the guards cried out in protest gersen said stand back guard the hall for the safety ofvadrus ihe guards hesitated halfdazed gersen thrust open the door entered with lus iphigema they stood m an entry with white marble statues looking down from alcoves gersen peered along one hall through an archway walked up to a closed door listened from beyond came the sound ot movement he tried the door it was locked he used his proac burst the door open charged into the room sion trumble halfclad leapt around in startlement he opened his mouth bawled something incomprehensible alusz iph igema gasped hes wearing the clothes of paderbush this was true on a frame hung sion trumbles green and blue robes he had been divesting the stained garments worn by pader bush now he reached for his sword gersen hacked at his wrist struck it from his hand sion trumble reached to a shelf where reposed a handweapon gersen destroyed it with a blast of his projac sion trumble turned slowly sprang at gersen like a wild beast gersen laughed aloud stooped caught his shoulder in sion trum bles belly grabbed the instantly raised knee tossed him through the air he caught at the blond curly hair and as sion trumble struggled and surged pulled off came the blond hair off came the entire face leaving gersen holding a warm rubbery sac by the hair the fine straight nose tilted askew the mouth lolled open the man on the floor had no face the scalp the face muscles showed pink and red through a film of transparent tissue the eyes glared lidless under a bare forehead above a black nostril gap the lipless mouth grimaced wite with its suddenly conspicuous teeth wtw what is rhat asked alusz iphigema in a hushed voice that said gersen is a hormagaunt it is kokor hekkus or billy windle or seuman otwal or paderbush or a dozen others and now his time has come kokor hekkus recall the raid on mount pleasant i have come to bring you retribution kokor hekkus rose slowly to his feet deaths head of a face staring once you told me that ou feared only death said gersen now you are to die kokor hekkus made a gasping sound gersen said you have lived the most evil ot lives i should kill the demon princes you with the utmost terror and pain but it is sufficient that you die he pointed his projac kokor hekkus gave a wild hoarse sound flung forward with arms and legs wide to be met by a gush of fire the following day seneschal uther caymon was hanged at the public gallows the accessory creature companion and confidant of kokor hekkus standing on a tall jointed ladder he yelled down to the awed crowd fools fools do you realize how long you have been gulled and milked and bled of your gold of your war riors of your beautiful women for two hundred years i am this old kokor hekkus was older against the brown bersaglers he sent your best and they died in futility to his bed came your beautiful girls some returned to their homes others did not you will cry when you hear of how they fared at last he died at last i die but fools fools the executioner had broken the ladder the crowd stared hol loweyed at the jerking figure alusz iphigenia and gersen walked in the garden at the palace of baron endel thobalt she still was pale with horror how did you know you knew but how first i suspected from sion trumbles hands he had the wit to carry himself differently from paderbush but his hands were the same longfingered a smooth glossy skin thin thumbs with long nails i saw these hands but was deceived until once more i saw paderbush at close range sion trumble disclosed himself further he was aware that you had decided not to wed him he told me so but only three people knew you me and paderbush for only in the fort did you make up your mind when i heard sion trumble make this statement then i looked at his hands and i knew what an evil thing i wonder what planet bore him who were his parents he was a man blessed and cursed with his imagination a sin gle life was insufficient for him he must drink at every spring know every experience live to all extremes on thamber he found a world to his temperament in his various entities he created his own epics wtien he tired of thamber he returned to the other worlds of man less amenable to his will but nonetheless amusing he is dead the killing machine and now more than ever must leave thamber said alusz iphigenia there is nothing to keep us tomorrow we shall leave wtiy tomorrow let us leave now think i am sure that can take us to the spaceship the way north around the skar is not hard the landmarks are known there is no need to stay said gersen let us go a small group of carrai noblemen gathered in the late afternoon light baron endel thobalt spoke with sudden anxiety you will send back ships from the oikumene gersen nodded i have agreed to do so and i will alusz iphigenia heaving a small sigh looked around the land scape someday i dont know when i will come back to tham ber too remember gersen told the baron that if ships from the oikumene arrive your old ways will not last there will be grum bling and nostalgia and dissatisfaction perhaps you prefer thamber as it is now i can speak only for myself said endel thobalt i say that we must rejoin humanity no matter what the cost he was echoed by his fellows as you wish said gersen alusz iphigenia climbed within gersen followed clamped the hatch went to the console looked down at the bronze plague patch engineering and construction company patris krokinole good old patch said gersen ill have to send him a report on how his machine worked presuming that it carries us back to the spaceship alusz iphigenia standing beside him pressed her head lightly against his shoulder looking down into the shining dustygolden hair gersen remembered how first he had seen her at interchange how first he had thought her unremarkable he laughed quietly alusz iphigenia looked up why do you laugh someday youll know but not right now smiling at some private recollection other own alusz iphigenia said no more the demon princes gersen thrust the go lever ahead thirtysix legs rose and fell

company ofkirth ger sen the less certain she became that she understood his personality his moods perplexed her his behavior was a source of misgiving his modesty and selfeffacement were they inversion brooding cynicism his careful politeness could it be no more than a sin ister camouflage such questions entered her mind with increasing frequency no matter how staunchly she rejected them on one occasion the date was july they sat on the avente esplanada in front of the grand rotunda gersen sought to explain the seeming contradictions of his character theres really no mystery ive been trained to a certain function its all i know to justify the training to fulfill my life i exercise the func tion its as simple as that alusz iphigenia knew the general outlines ofgersens past the five demon princes joining for the historic raid on mount pleasant had destroyed or enslaved five thousand men and women among the handful of survivors were rolf gersen and his young grandson alusz iphigema realized that such an experience must alter anyones life still she herself had known tragedy and terror i am not changed she told gersen earnestly i feel neither rage nor hate illl l teoi loll my grandfather relt the rage and hate said gersen in rather a flippant tone ot voice so far as im concerned the hate is ab stract lus iphigema became e cn more disturbed are you then just a mechanism this is rnindtessness to be the instrument of someone elses hate crersen grinned thats not quite accurate grandfather trained me or rather had me trained and i am grateful to him without the training i would be dead he must ha e been a terrible man so to warp a childs mind he was a dedicated man said gersen he loved me and assumed i shared his dedication i did and i do but what of the future is revenge all you want from life revenge i dont think so i have only one life to live and i know what hope to achieve but why not try to achieve the same goals through a lawful agency isnt this a better way there isnt any lawful agency only the ipcc which isnt altogether etfective fhen why not bring the issues before the people of the con course and the other important worlds you have the energy you have more than enough mono isnt this better than killing men with your own hands gersen had no rational counterarguments these arent my talents he told her i work alone at what i do best but you could learn gersen shook his head if involve myself with words and harangues i trap myself i become futile alus iphigema rose to her feet she walked to the balustrade looked out across the rhaumaturge ocean gersen studied the clear profile the proud stance as if he had never seen them before the time was approaching when he must lose her and everything that was eas and fresh and uncomplicated would leave his life the breeze shifted her bright hair she was looking down into the blue water watching the shifting glints and planes ofrigel light gersen sighed picked up a newspaper

his efforts to prove that blue companion and the twentysix worlds of the concourse were originally an independent system which wandered into the gravitational domain of rigel such a circumstance would explain the disparity in the ages of the concourse worlds and rigel a compara tively young star gersen looked up alusz iphigenia had not moved he read on cosmopolis magazine about to be sold famous

position elbows on the balustrade chin resting in her hands she studied the hon on contemplating the soft contours gersen felt himself softening he now was a man of almost unlimited wealth the could live a life of wonderful ease and pleasure gersen considered a long minute then shrugged and looked back to the newspaper srko poisonvusier to dif cuilu rules iol ifd pamg godoland sarkovy july as if claris adam were to he destroyed alus iphigenia glanced over her shoulder gersen was reading the newspaper in complete absorption she swung around in outrage here was sangfroid indeed while she wrestled with doubts and conflicts gersen read a newspaper an act of conspicuous msensi tivity gersen looked up smiled his mood had changed he had comeah e alusz iphigenias fury ebbed gersen was a man beyond her understanding whether he were vastly more subtle than she or vastly more elemental she would never know gersen had risen to his feet were going on a trip across space toward ophmchus are vou ready ready you mean now yes now whynot no reason yes im ready in two hours ill call the spaceport the distis spaceship corporation produced nineteen models ranging from a version of the b to the splendid distis imperatrix with a black and gold hull with funds derived from his epic looting of interchange gersen had purchased a pharaon a spacious craft equipped with such niceties as an

dark ness alusz iphigenia studied the star directory with a puzzled frown ophiuchus isnt a star its a sector where are we going the sun is phi ophiuchi said gersen and after a barely perceptible pause the planet is sarkovy sarkovy alusz iphigenia looked up quickly isnt that where the poisons come from gersen gave a curt nod the sarkoy are poisoners no doubt about it alusz iphigenia looked dubiously out the forward port ger sens haste to leave alphanor had puzzled her she had credited a sudden determination to alter his way of life now she was not so sure she opened handbook to the planets read the article on sar kovy gersen stood by the pharmaceutical cabinet compounding a conditioner against possibly noxious serums proteins viruses and bacilli of sarkovy interchange an institution of the planet sasani in the nearbeyond functioning as a detention depot and broker between kidnappers and those who sought to pay ransom gersen had swindled interchange of ten billion svu the palace of love alusz iphigenia asked why are you going to this planet it seems an evil place i want to talk to someone said gersen in a measured voice he handed her a cup drink this youll avoid itches and scabs wordlessly alusz iphigenia drank the mixture there were no formalities at sarkovy gersen landed at paing spaceport as close as possible to the depot a timber structure roofed with varnished reeds a clerk registered them as visitors and they were immediately set upon by a dozen men wearing dark brown gowns with bristling fur collars and cuffs each protested himself the foremost guide and sponsor of the region what do you wish my sir my lady a visit to the village i am a hetman if its the sport of harbite you seek i know of three excellent beasts in furious condition poisons by the dram or pound i guarantee freshness and pre cision trust me for your poisons gersen looked from face to face several of the men were tat tooed on the cheek with a dark blue maltese cross one wore two such tattoos your name i am edelrod i know the lore of sarkovy marvelous tales i can make your visit a joy a period of edification gersen said i see you are a venefice of the undermaster cat egory true edelrod seemed a trifle crestfallen you have visited our world before for a brief period you come to replenish your chest rest assured sir i can guide you to fascinating bargains absolute novelties gersen took edelrod aside you are acquainted with master kakarsis asrn i know him he is condemned to cooperation he is not dead then he dies tomorrow night good said gersen i will hire you then provided that your rates are not exorbitant i lend my knowledge my friendship my protection all for fifty svu per day agreed well then our first need is conveyance to the inn i he dfmon princes at once edelrod summoned a dilapidated carryall they bumped and jounced through pamg to the poison inn a three stoned structure with walls of poles a twelveconed roof sheathed with green glass tiles there was a barbaric grandeur to the great lobby rugs woven in bold patterns of black white and scarlet cov ered the floor along the wall were pilasters carved to represent attenuated hankap with gaunt sagging faces vines with green leaves and purple flowers hung from the roof beams windows thirty feet high overlooked gorobundur steppe with a blackgreen swamp to the west a dark forest to the east meals were to be taken in a vast dining room furnished with tables chairs and buffets of a dense black wood to alusz iphigenias relief the kitchen appeared to be operated by outworlders and they were offered a choice of six cui sines alusz iphigema nevertheless distrusted the food tor all we know its seasoned with some horrid drug gersen made light of her qualms they wouldnt waste good poison on us i cant guarantee much else this is nomadstyle bread the little black things are reedberries and this is some sort of stew or goulash he tasted it ive eaten worse alusz iphigema glumly ate the reedberries which had a dank smoky flavor how long do you plan to remain here she asked politely two days or so provided all goes well your business of course is your own affair but i feel a certain curiosity theres no mystery i want information from a man who may not live long i see but it was plain that alusz iphigenia felt no great in terest in gersens plans and she remained in the lobby while ger sen sought out edelrod i would like to speak with kakarsis asm can this be ar ranged edelrod pulled thoughtfully at his long nose a ticklish matter he must cooperate with the guild such men are guarded carefully for obvious reasons of course i can try to make arrangements is expense a critical factor naturally i expect to pay no more than fifty svu into the guild treasury another fifty to the guildmaster and perhaps twenty or thirty to you edelrod pursed his lips he was a plump man of uncertain age the palace of love with a pelt of soft heavy black hair your largesse is not of the regal variety the people of sarkovy respect reckless liberality above all other virtues if i understand the signs correctly said gersen i have sur prised you by the money i seem willing to spend the amounts i mentioned are the top limit if you cant arrange matters at these rates i will inquire of someone else i can only do my best said edelrod despondently please wait in the lobby i will make inquiries gersen went to sit beside alusz iphigenia who pointedly asked no questions edelrod presently returned with a ubilant expres sion i have set affairs in motion the cost will be very little more than the figures you suggested and he snapped his fingers exul tantly i have had second thoughts said gersen i dont care to speak to master asm edelrod became agitated but it is feasible i have approached the guildmaster perhaps on another occasion edelrod made a sour grimace foregoing all personal gain i might arrange matters for some trifling sum two hundred svu or thereabout the information is of no great value i am leaving tomorrow for kadaing where my old friend master venefice coudirou can settle everything for me edelrod raised his eyebrows and allowed his eyes to bulge why then this alters all you should have mentioned your con nection with coudirou i believe the guildmaster will accept sub stantially less than his previous demand you know my top figure said gersen very well sighed edelrod the interview may be conducted later this afternoon in the meantime what are your wishes would you care to explore the countryside the weather is fine the woods are ablaze with flowers sultnes popbarks there is a welldrained path alusz iphigenia who had been restless rose to her feet edelrod led them along a path which crossed a brackish river and plunged into the forest the vegetation was a typical sarkovy melange trees shrubs cycads bubbleshells grasses of a hundred varieties the high fo thp demon princes hage was for the most part black and brown with occasional splotches of red below were purples greens pale blues edelrod enlivened the stroll with a discussion of various plants beside the way he indicated a small gray fungus here is the source oftwi tus an excellent selective poison fatal only if ingested twice within a week it ranks in this respect with mervan which migrates harm lessly to the skin and becomes a lethal principle only upon exposure to direct sunlight i have known persons who fearing mervan kept to their tents for days on end they came to a little clearing edelrod looked sharply in all directions i have no overt enemies but several people have died here recently today all seems well notice this tree growing to the side he pointed to a slender whitebarked sapling with round yellow leaves some call it the cointree others the goodfor nought it is completely inoffensive either as a primary or an op erative you might ingest the whole of it leaves bark pith roots and note nothing other than a sluggishness of digestion recently one of our venefices became irritated at such insipidity he made an intensive study of the cointree and after several years finally derived a substance of unusual potency to be useful it must be dissolved in methycm and wafted into the air as a fog or a mist whence it enters the corpus through the eyes causing first blind ness then numbness then complete paralysis think of it from waste a useful and effective poison is this not a tribute to human persistence and ingenuity an impressive accomplishment said gersen alusz iphigema remained silent edelrod went on we are frequently asked why we persist in deriving our poisons from natural sources why do we not immure ourselves in laboratories and synthesize the answer is of course that natural poisons being initially associated with living tissue are the more effective i would suspect the presence of catalyzing impurities in the natural poisons gersen suggested rather than metaphysical as sociation edelrod held up a minatory finger never scoff at the role of the mind eor instance let me see there should be one some where near yes see there the little reptile under a mottled white and blue leaf rested a small lizardlike creature the palace of low this is the meng from one of his organs comes a substance which can be distributed either as uigar or as furux the same sub stance mind you but when sold as uigar and used as such the symptoms are spasms biting off of the tongue and a frothing mad ness when sold and used as furux the interskeletal cartilage is dissolved so that the frame goes limp wtiat do you say to that is that not metaphysics of the most exalted sort interesting certainly hm what occurs when the sub stance is sold and used as say for the sake of argument water edelrod pulled at his nose an interesting experiment i won der but the proposal encases a fallacy who would buy and ad minister an expensive vial of water the suggestion was poorly thought out admitted gersen edelrod made an indulgent gesture not at all not at all from ust such apparent folly come notable variations the graybloom for instance who would have ever suspected the virtue to be de rived from its perfume until grand master strubal turned it upside down and left it in the dark for a month whereupon it became tox meratis one waft will kill the venefice need merely walk past his subject alusz iphigema stooped to pick up a small rounded pebble of quartz wtiat horrible substance do you produce from this stone edelrod looked away half embarrassed none whatever at least none to my knowledge though we use such pebbles in ball mills to crush photis seed to flour never fear your pebble is not so useless as it seems alusz iphigema tossed it away in disgust unbelievable she muttered that people should dedicate themselves to such activity edelrod shrugged we serve a useful purpose everyone oc casionally needs poison we are capable of this excellence and we feel dutybound to pursue it he inspected alusz iphigema with curiosity have you no skills of your own no at the hotel you may buy a booklet entitled primer to the an of preparing and using poisons and i believe it includes a small kit of some basic alkaloids if you are interested m developing a skill thank you i have no such inclination edelrod made a polite gesture as if to acknowledge that each must steer his own course through life they continued in due course the forest thinned the path iw dkmon princes turned out upon the steppe at the edge of town stood a long eight coned structure of ironbound timber with ten iron doors facing to the steppe across an area of packed clay were hundreds of small booths and shops the caravanserai explained edelrod this is the seat of the comenance from which the udgmencs come he pointed to a platform at the top of the caravanserai where four caged men gazed disconsolately down into the square to the tar right stands kakarsis asm can i speak to him now gersen asked i will go to inquire wait if you please at this booth where my grandmother will prepare you a fine tea alusz iphigenia looked dubiously at the appurtenances of the booth on a plank a brass urn bubbled furiously flanked by brass drinking pots shelves displayed a hundred glass jars containing herbs roots and substances impossible to identify all clean and salubrious edelrod declared cheerfully rest and invigorate yourselves will return with good news alusz iphigenia wordlessly seated herself on a bench after con sultation with edelrods grandmother gersen procured pots of mildly stimulating verbena tea they watched a caravan trundling in from the steppe first an eightwheeled wagon carrying the shrine the cabin of the hetman and brass tanks of water behind were several dozen other wagons some large some small motors rumbling clacking whining all carried astounding superstructures at the very peak of which were tented living quarters with goods and bales loaded below some men rode motorcycles others lounged on the wagons which were driven by old women or slaves of the tribe children ran behind rode bicycles or dangled peril ously from the understructure the caravan halted women children arranged tripods hung up cauldrons and began to prepare a meal while slaves unloaded goods from the wagons furs rare woods bundles of herbs chunks of agate and opal caged birds tubs of raw gums and poisons and two captive hankap the nearintelligent creature which furnished the sarkov sport known as harbite meanwhile the men of the tribe gathered in a quiet suspicious cluster to drink tea and glower toward the ba aar where they expected to be cheated edelrod stepped briskly forth from the caravanserai gersen grumbled to alusz iphigenia here he comes with six reasons wh the business will cost more money the palace of love edelrod procured an infusion of scorched aol from his grand mother he sat down and silently began to sip well asked gersen edelrod sighed shook his head my arrangements have been for naught the chief monitor declares the interview impossible just as well said gersen i only wished to bring him the condolences ofviole falushe it will make small difference one way or another wtiere will he cooperate at the poison inn as diversion for the convenance which currently is in residence at pamg perhaps i will have a chance to utter a few words there or at least make a reassuring signal said gersen well then let us look through the bazaar subdued and depressed edelrod took them through the bazaar only in the poison quarter did he recover his animation and pointed here and there to bargains and especially noteworthy prep arations he seized a ball of gray wax observe this deadly mate rial i handle it without fear i am immunized but if you were to rub it on an article belonging to your enemy his comb his ear scraper he is as good as gone another application is to spread a film over your identification papers then should an overofficious administrator hector you he is contaminated and pays for his in solence alusz iphigenia took a deep breath how does a sarkoy survive to become an adult two words edelrod replied holding two fingers didactically high caution immunity i am immune to thirty poisons i carry indicators and alarms to warn ofcluthe meratis blacktox and vole i observe the most punctilious caution in eating smelling donning garments bedding with a strange female ha ha here is a favorite trick and the ovenmpulsive lecher finds himself in difficulties but to go on i am cautious in these situations and also in passing down wind of a covert even though i have no fear of meratis caution has become second nature if i suspect that i have or am about to have an enemy i cultivate his friendship and poison him to diminish the risk you will live to become an old man said gersen edelrod reverently made a circular motion with his two hands moving in opposite directions to symbolize a halting ofgodogmas wheel let us hope so and here he pointed to a bulb contain the d mon princes ing white powder cluthe useful versatile effective if you need poison buy here i have cluthe said gersen though it may be somewhat stale discard it or you will be disappointed edelrod told him earnestly it will merely provoke suppurating sores and gangrene he turned to the dealer your stock is fresh fresh indeed fresh as the morning dew after a bout of heated bargaining gersen bought a small casket of cluthe alusz iphigema stood with her back turned her head at an angle of angry disapproval now then said gersen back to the hotel edelrod said tentatively a thought occurs to me were i to bring the monitors a cask of highquality tea at a cost of perhaps twenty or thirty svu they might well allow your visit by all means make them such a gift you will naturally reimburse me what when you already have been conceded a lavish hun dred and twenty svu edelrod made an impatient gesture you do not realize the difficulties he snapped his fingers petulantly very well so be it my friendship for you impels me to sacrifice where is the money here is fifty the remainder after the interview what of the lady wtiere will she wait not here in the bazaar the nomads might consider her part of the merchandise edelrod chuckled such events have been known but have no apprehension she is under the aegis of submaster iddel edelrod she is as safe as a twohundredton statue of a dead dog but gersen insisted on hiring a conveyance and sending alusz iphigema back to the poison inn edelrod then conducted gersen into the caravanserai through a set of halls up to the roof six monitors hulked on stools beside a bubbling cauldron hitching fur collars up around their necks they glanced incuriously at edelrod then turning back to their tea muttered among themsekes evi dently a satiric observation for they all gave hoarse caws of amuse ment gersen approached the cage of kakarsis asm onetime master venehce now condemned to cooperation asm was somewhat taller the palace of love than the average sarkoy though still bulky through chest and belly his head was long narrow in the forehead broad at the cheek bones heavy at the mouth a thick black pelt grew low down his forehead his lank black mustache drooped dispiritedly in keeping with his criminal status he wore no shoes and his feet tattooed with wheels in the traditional fashion were mottled pink and blue with cold edelrod addressed asm in a peremptory voice villainous dog here is a nobleman from offworld who deigns to inspect you be on your best behavior asm raised his hand as if he were casting poison edelrod jumped back with a startled oath and asm laughed gersen turned to edelrod wait to the side i wish to speak privately to master asm edelrod grudgingly withdrew asm seating himself on a stool inspected gersen with eyes like flints i have paid to speak to you said gersen in fact i come from alphanor for this purpose asm made no response has viole falushe made representations on your behalf asked gersen a gleam shone behind the near opacity of the eyes you come from viole falushe no the gleam died it would seem said gersen that having involved you in wrongdoing he should likewise be here sentenced to cooperation theres an agreeable thought said asm i dont fully understand the crime you were caged and sen tenced because you sold to a notorious cnnnnap asm snorted spat into a corner of the cage how should i recognize him as viole falushe i knew him long ago under a dif ferent name he has changed he is unrecognizable wtly then should you be sentenced to cooperation the decretal was clear enough the guildmaster had pre pared a special price schedule for viole falushe all unaware i sold him two drams of patziglop and a dram of vole little enough but there can be no remission the guildmaster has long been my enemy though he has never dared to test my poisons he spat again glanced reflectively sidewise at gersen why should i talk with you i hi dlmon princes because i will undertake that you die by alpha or beta rather than cooperation asm gave a sad sardonic snort of regret with guildmaster petius on the scene small chance he wishes to test his new py rong guildmaster petrus can be persuaded by money if no other means asm shrugged i expect little but what then i lose nothing by talk what do you wish to know i take it viole falushe has departed the planet long ago where and when did you know him previously long ago how many years twenty thirty a long time he was then a slaver but very young no more than a boy indeed he was the youngest slaver i had yet known he arrived in a rickety old ship bulging with young girls all fearful of his wrath would you believe it they were happy to be sold to me asm shook his head in wonder a terrible young man he quaked and quivered with the force of his passions today he is different the passion is still terrible but viole falushe has grown to surround it he is a different man wtiat was his name when you first knew him asm shook his head it escapes me i do not know perhaps i never knew he traded two fine girls for money and poison they cried with relief to leave the ship the others cried from their ill fortune ah what sobbing asm gave his head a wry shake inga and dundine were their names how they would chatter they knew the lad well and never tired of reviling him what became of them do they still live there i am ignorant asm umped to his feet strode back and forth returned as abruptly to his stool i was called south to sogmere i sold the girls there was little depreciation i had only used them two years who bought them it was gascovne the wholesaler of murchisons star i can tell no more for this is all i know and where was the first home of the girls earth gersen ruminated j moment and viole falushe as he is now what is his description the palace of love he is a tall man wellfavored his hair is dark he has no remarkable or distinguishing features i knew him when his mad ness was rampant when it altered the look of his face now he is careful and polite he speaks softly he smiles his condition might never be known unless like me you had known him as a lad gersen asked further questions asm was unable to augment his remarks gersen prepared to depart asm feigning indifference said you intend to speak to guildmaster petrus on my behalf yes asm thought a moment he opened his mouth and spoke as if it were an effort be careful he is a positive man and baleful if you thrust at him overstrongly he will poison you thank you said gersen i hope to be able to help you he signaled edelrod who had watched with poorly disguised curiosity take me to guildmaster petrus edelrod led gersen down into the caravanserai through one crooked hall after another finally to a room hung with yellow silk on a cushion sat a thin man with intricately tattooed cheeks ex amining a row of small flagons an outworld gentleman to speak to the guildmaster said edelrod the thin man hopped erect approached gersen carefully smelled his hands patted his garments inspected his tongue and teeth one moment he disappeared behind the silks presently he returned to signal gersen this way if you will gersen entered a high window less chamber so high indeed the ceiling could not be seen four spherical lamps hanging low on long chains threw an oily yellow light on the table the ubiquitous brass cauldron bubbled the air was heavy with warmth and odor must fabric leather sweat the sharp dry exhalation of herbs guildmaster petrus had been sleeping now he was awake and leaning forward from his couch tossed herbs into a pot and pre pared an infusion he was an old man with bright black eyes a pallid skin he greeted gersen with a quick nod gersen said youre an old man i have one hundred and ninetyfour earth years how much longer do you expect to live six years at least or so i hope many men wish me poisoned on the roof four criminals await execution are all to coop erate iiil di mon frincfs ml t have a dozen new poisons to test as have other masters ot the guild i have assured asm that he will die by alpha or beta you must have the gift of perceiving miracles i myself am a skeptic the arrogance ot asm has long been a blemish upon the region he now must cooperate with the guild standards com mittee gersen eventually paid svu that asm might die by alpha edelrod somewhat sulky met gersen in the hall hey set orf through paing by streets lined with tall timber huts on stilts the facade of each hut constructed to represent a visage doleful sat urnine or astounded and so the returned to the poison inn alus iphigenia was in her room gersen decided not to disturb her he bathed in a wooden vat went down to the lobby to look out across the steppe dusk blurred the landscape the wheeled poles were black intricate silhouettes gersen ordered a pot of tea and with nothing better to do reflected on the condition of his life by ordinary standards he was a fortunate man wealthy beyond the grasp of the mind what of the future suppose that by some freak of fortune he was able to achieve his goal with the five demon princes destroyed what then could he integrate himself into the normal flow of existence or had he become so distorted that always to the end of his days he must seek out men to destroy gersen gave a gnm chuckle unlikely that he would survive to confront the problem in the meantime what had he learned from asm only that twenty or thirty years ago a young madman had sold a pair of girls dundme and inga to asm who later sold them to gascoyne the wholesaler of vlurchisons star next to nothing except that dundine and inga knew their kidnaper well and never ceased to revile him alusz iphigenia appeared she ignored gersen and went to look out over the dark steppe where now one or two far lights flickered in the sk appeared a purple glow a bank of white lights and a packet of the robarth hercules line descended to the field alus iphigenia watched a row moments then turned and came to sit by gersen holding herself stiffly erect she shook her head at his offer of tea how long must vou stay here only until tomorrow night whv may not we leave now ou have conrerred with your friend you have bought vour poison thl palc e of love as if in response to her question edelrod appeared bowing in absurd punctilio tonight he wore a long gown of green cloth a tall fur cap health and immunity he greeted them do you attend the poisonings hey are scheduled for the hotel rotunda for the education of gathered notables tonight i thought they were tomorrow night the date has been set forward by a whirl of crodogmas wheel i omght the rogues must cooperate we will be there said gersen alusz iphigenia rose swiftly to her feet departed the lobby gersen found her in her room are you angry with me not angry i am utterly bewildered i cant understand your morbid fascination with these horrible people death that isnt a fair statement the people live by a system dif ferent from ours i am interested i live by my ability to avoid death i might learn something to help me survive but you dont need this knowledge you have a vast fortune ten billion svu in cash no longer no longer have you lost it the vast fortune is no longer cash there now exists an anon ymous corporation of which i own the stock the money yields a daily income a million svu more or less still a vast fortune of course with all this money you need not involve yourself hire mur derers to do your work hire the disgusting edelrod for money he would poison his mother any murderer i could hire could be hired to murder me but there is another consideration i dont care for notoriety or public ity to be effective i must be unknown a nonentity i fear i have already been noted by the institute and this would be a great mis fortune alusz iphigenia spoke with great earnestness you are ob sessed you are a monomaniac this concentration on lethahty effectiveness masters you completely gersen forbore to point out that this same effectiveness and lethahtv had preserved her existence on several occasions you have other capacities alusz iphigenia went on you have sensibilities even frivolities you never indulge them you are the demon princks spiritually starved crippled you think only of power death poison devious plots revenge gerscn was startled by her vehemence the accusations were distorted far enough of the mark that they carried no sting still if she believed them what a monster he must appear in her eyes soothingly he replied what you say simply isnt true maybe some day youll know this maybe some day gersens voice dwindled in the face of the angry shake alusz iphigenia gave her head which sent her goldbrown hair flying additionally what he was about to sav now that he considered it seemed somewhat im probable even absurd talk of relaxation a home a family alusz iphigenia spoke in a cold voice what then of me i have no right to rule your life or disturb you said gersen you have only one life you must make the best of it alusz tphigenia rose to her feet calm and composed sadly gersen went to his own room still in a sense the quarrel was welcome perhaps motivated subconsciously he had brought her to sarkovy to indicate the direction his life must go to give her the option of detaching herself somewhat to his surprise she appeared for dinner though grim and pale the dining room was crowded everywhere were the fur collars and blackfurred pates of sarkoy notables tonight an unusual number of women were present in their peculiar purple brown and black gowns weighed down with necklaces bangles hairpieces of turquoise and jade in one corner sat a large group of tourists from the excursion ship which had put into paing earlier in the the occasion gersen decided for the advancement of the evenms poisonings by their costumes the tourists were from one of the concourse planets alphanor to judge by their beige and gray skin toning at gersens elbow appeared edelrod aha lord gersen a pleasure to see you here may i join you and your lovely lady i may be able to assist for the poisonings taking gersens assent for granted he seated himself at the table tonight a banquet of six courses sarkoy style i recommend that you attempt it you are here on our wonderful planet you must enjoy it to the hilt i am pleased to be present all goes well tonight i trust quite well thank you edelrod spoke correctly tonight only the sarkoy cuisine was offered the first course was served a pale green broth of swamp the palace of love produce rather bitter accompanied by stalks of deepfried reed a salad of celery root whortleberry and shreds of pungent black bark as they ate porters carried four posts out upon the terrace set them upright into sockets the second course appeared a ragout of pale meat in coral sauce heavily seasoned with side dishes of jellied plantain crystal lized jaoic a local fruit alusz iphigenia ate without great appetite gersen felt no hun ger whatever the third course was set before them collops of perfumed paste on disks of chilled melon accompanied by what appeared to be small mollusks in spiced oil as the platters were being removed in preparation for the fourth course the criminals were led out on the terrace where they stood blinking into the lights they were naked except for heavy padded collars bulky mattresslike gloves a tight girdle around the waist each was attached to a post by six feet of chain alusz iphigenia looked them over with seeming indifference these are the criminals wtiat are their offenses edelrod looked up from the battery of bowls which had just been set before him containing a hash of crushed insects and cereal pickles a plumcolored conserve and pellets of fried meat appre hending the question he glanced at the criminals there is asm who betrayed the guild next is a nomad who committed a sexual offense alusz iphigenia laughed incredulously on sarkoy is this pos sible edelrod gave her a look of pained reproach the third threw sour milk on his grandmother the fourth dishonored a fetish alusz iphigenia wore a puzzled expression she glanced at ger sen to learn whether or not edelrod were serious gersen said the offenses seem arbitrary but some of our restraints seem strange to the folk of sarkovy precisely the case stated edelrod every planet has its own rules i am appalled at the insensitivity of certain folk who come here from other worlds avarice is a typical offense on sarkovy one mans property is the property of all money it is distributed without a second thought unstinting generosity excites approval and he looked expectantly toward gersen who only smiled alusz iphigenia had let the fourth course go untasted the fifth the demon princes course was served a wafer of baked pastry on which were arranged three large steamed centipedes with a garnish of a chopped blue vegetable and a dish of glossyblack paste which gave off an acrid aromatic odor alusz iphigenia rose to her feet departed the dining room edelrod looked after her solicitouslv she is not well i fear not a pity edelrod attacked his food with gusto the meal is by no means at its end to the terrace came four undermasters from the guild and a master venefice to direct proceedings and make analytic com ments all seemed in readiness for the poisonings the undermasters set a tabouret in front of each of the criminals with the poisons arranged in white saucers the first subject called forth the master venefice is one kakarsis asm in requital for manipulations deleterious to the guild he has agreed to test a variation of that activant known as alpha when ingested orally alpha almost instantly shocks the main spinal ganglion tonight we test alpha in a new solvent which may well result in the most rapid lethality yet discovered by man criminal asm cooperate if you please kakarsis asm rolled his eyes to right and left the undermaster stepped forward kakarsis asm opened his mouth gulped the dose and a second or two later was dead amazing declared edelrod something new every week the executions proceeded the master venefice supplying in formative details the sexual offender tried to kick poison into the undermasters face and was reprimanded otherwise the poisonings proceeded smoothly the sixth course an elaborate salad was fol lowed by teas infusions and trays of sweetmeats and the banquet was at an end gersen slowly went up to the suite alusz iphigenia had packed her belongings gersen stood by the door puzzled by a sudden gleam of panic in alusz iphigenias eyes unaware that against the white woodwork he appeared a dark sinister shape alusz iphigenia spoke in a breathless rush the excursion ship is returning to alphanor have booked passage we must go our own ways gersen was silent for a moment then he said there is money in your bank account ill see that more is paid into it as is the palace of love much as youll ever need if an emergency arises if there are inadequate funds notify the bank manager hell make the neces sary arrangements alusz iphigenia said nothing gersen went to the door should you ever need help alusz iphigenia gave a short nod ill remember goodbye then goodbye gersen went to his own room where he lay on his bed hands behind his head so ended a pleasant passage in his life never again he told himself never would he involve a woman with the dark necessities of his life especially one so honorable and generous and kind early in the morning the robarthhercules packet departed with alusz iphigenia aboard gersen went to the space port signed the exit register paid a departure tax pressed a gratuity upon edel rod and departed sarkovy from handbook to the planets th edition aloysius sixth planet to vega planetary constants diameter miles sidereal day hours mass aloysius with its sister planets boniface and cuth bert were the first worlds to be intensively colonized from earth aloysius hence presents aspects of consid erable antiquity the more so that the first settlers a dynamic group of conservationists refused to build structures not in harmony with the landscape the conservationists are gone but their influence lingers the pretentious glass towers of alphanor and earth the concrete of olliphane the unbridled confu sion which has overtaken the markab system these are nowhere to be seen the axis ofajovsius is inclined at an angle of degrees to its plane of orbit hence there are seasonal fluctuations of notable seventy mollified somewhat by a dense atmosphere there are nine continents dorgan is the largest with new wexford its chief city owing to a calculated policy of low taxes and favorable regu lations new wexford has long functioned as an im portant financial center with an influence far in excess of its population the autochthonous flora and fauna are not partic ularly noteworthy through intensive effort by the original settlers terrestrial trees and shrubs are wide the palace of love spread the conifers especially finding a hospitable en vironment landing formalities at aloysius were as rigorous as those of sar kovy were lax at a distance of a million miles the first shell gersen announced his intention to land identified himself and his ship gave references explained the reasons for his visit and was allowed to approach the second shell at a distance of a half million miles here he waited while his application was studied his references checked he was then ordered down into the third shell a hundred thousand miles above the planet and here after a brief delay he was given landing clearance the formalities were irksome but not to be avoided had gersen neglected to halt at the first shell weapons would have been trained on his ship had he failed to heed the second shell a thribolt gun would have fired a salvo of adhesivepaper disks at his ship had he then failed to halt he and his ship would have been destroyed gersen complied with all necessary regulations received clear ance and landed at the dorgan central spaceport new wexford lay twenty miles north a city of crooked streets steep hills and old buildings of almost medieval aspect the banks brokerage houses exchanges occupied the center of the city with hotels shops and agencies on the surrounding hills and some of the finest private homes in the oikumene scattered about the sur rounding countryside gersen checked into the vast congreve hotel bought news the thnholt gun shoots a jarnellpuwered pruectile toward its target questneedle protrudes a hundred and sixty feet ahead of the proecnle at the socalled preliminary roil section of the intersplit and is in tenuous contact with undisturbed space upon encoun tering matter the questneedle disengages the intersplit and triggers its charge either adhesive paper disks or high explosives in effect the thnbolt gun is an instantaneous weapon over last distances its effectiveness limited only by the accuracy of the aiming and launching techniques since once in flight the proectile cannot change direction on every technically competent world methods of guiding the thnholt procctile by automatic sensors are under intensive study and have been since the development of the original weapon the most promising system is to fi upon the distance of the target by conventional radar drive the pruectile by mtersplit for a very brief period in order to bring it into space near the target upon which it then likes a new fix i liners of great delicacy and dependability are necessary together with the utmost discretion on the part of the launchers for there is nothing to prevent the proectile once it leaves the intersplit from fixing upon a new target which inconveniently happens to be cruising close at hand none of the secondary or tertiary systems are considered trustworthy and are used only under special circumstances nil dimon princfs papers ate a placid lunch the life of the city flowed past him mercantilists in their consciously archaic garb aristocrats from boniface anxious only to return occasional a citizen ofcuthhert conspicuous for the eccentric flair of his garments and his glossy depilated head farthfolk at the congreve could be identified by somber garments and an indefinable selfassurance a quality the citiens of the outer worlds found exasperating no less than the geocentric term outer worlds itself gersen relaxed the atmosphere of new wexford was sooth ing everywhere were reassuring evidences of solidity goodliving law and order he liked the steep streets the stone and iron build ings which now after more than a thousand years could no longer be denigrated as selfconscious quaintene the cuthbertian epi thet gersen had paid one previous visit to new wexford two weeks of discreet investigation had then pointed to one jehan ad dels of transspace investment corporation as an economist of extraordinary resource and acumen gersen had called addels by public telephone blanking his own image addels was a youngish man slight of body with a long quizzical face a balding scalp which he had not troubled to have rehaired addels here i am someone you dont know my name is irrelevant i believe you are employed by transspace correct how much do they pay you sixty thousand plus some fringe benefits addels replied without embarrassment though he was talking to a stranger over a blank screen why id like to hire you in a similar capacity at a hundred thousand with a monthly raise of a thousand and a bonus even five years of say a inillion svu the terms are appealing addels replied dryly who are you i prefer to remain anonymous said gersen if you insist ill meet you and explain as much as you like essentially what you need to know is that i am not a criminal the money i want you to handle has not been acquired contrary to the laws of new wex ford hm how much is the sum in question what securities are represented the palce of lovt ten billion svu m cash whisht breathed jehan addels wtwre a flicker of an noyance crossed his face and he broke off his sentence jehan addels liked to think of himself as imperturbable he continued this is an extraordinary amount of money i cant believe it was accumu lated by conventional means i havent said this the money came from beyond where con ventions dont exist addels smiled thinly and no laws hence no legality and no criminals still the source of your funds is no concern of mine exactly what do you wish done i want the money invested to yield income but i want to call no attention to the money want no rumors no publicity i want the money invested without causing even a ripple of notice difficult addels reflected a moment not impossible how ever if the program is properly planned this is at your discretion you will control the entire opera tion subect to an occasional suggestion from me naturally you may hire a staff though the staff is to be told nothing small problem there i know nothing you are agreeable to my terms certainly if the whole business is not a hoax i cant avoid becoming an extremely wealthy man both from my salary and from investments can make collateral with yours but i will believe it when i see the money presumably it is not counterfeit your own fakemeter will assure you of this ten billion svu mused addels an enormous sum which might well be expected to tempt even an honest man how do you know i wont embezzle from you i understand that you are not only a cautious man but a man of discipline also you should have no inducement to embezzle otherwise i have no safeguards jehan addels gave his head a crisp nod where is the money it will be delivered wherever you like or you can come to the congreve hotel and pick it up yourself the situation is not all that simple suppose i should die over night how would you recover your money if you should die how would i learn of the fact what disposition would i then make of this ast sum presuming that it exists come to suite sixfifty at the congreve hotel ill give you the demon princes the money and well make arrangements for any immediate contin gencies jehan addels appeared in gersens suite half an hour later he inspected the money which was contained in two large cases checked a few of the notes with his fakemeter and shook his head in awe this is a tremendous responsibility i could give you a receipt but it would be a meaningless formality take the money said gersen tomorrow include in your will an instruction that in the event of your death the money is mine if i die or do not communicate with you within a year use the income for charitable purposes but i expect to be back in new wexford within two or three months hereafter i will communi cate with you only by telephone using the name henry lucas very well said addels rather heavily i think this takes care of all contingencies remember absolute discretion not even your family must know the details of your new occupation as you wish the next morning gersen had departed aloysius for alphanor now three months later he was back in new wexford again at the congreve hotel going to a public telephone blanking the screen as before he tapped out jean addels callnumber the screen burst into a pat tern of green leaves and pink briar roses a female voice spoke braemar investment company mr henry lucas to speak to mr addels thank you addels face appeared on the screen addels this is henry lucas addels leaned back in his chair i am happy and i may say relieved to hear from you the line is clear addels checked his antieavesdrop meter and blinker light all clear how are matters progressing well enough addels proceeded to describe his arrange ments he had paid the cash into ten numbered accounts in as many banks five in new wexford five on earth and was gradually con verting the cash into incomeproducing investments using enor the palace of love mous delicacy to avoid sending tremors along the sandpapered nerves of the financial world i had not comprehended the magnitude of the job when i undertook it said addels it is simply staggering mind you i am not complaining i could not ask for a more interesting or more challenging job but investing ten billion svu discreetly is like jumping into water without getting wet i am putting together a staff merely to handle details of investigation and management eventually for maximum efficiency i think we will be forced to become a bank or perhaps several banks wtiatever is most appropriate said gersen in the mean time i have a special job for you addels instantly became wary and what is this job recently ive been reading that the radian publishing com pany which publishes cosmopolis is in financial difficulties i would like you to buy control addels pursed his lips i can do this without difficulty of course in fact i can buy outright radian is oo the verge of bank ruptcy but you should know that as an investment this is not an attractive buy they have been losing money steadily for years which of course is why they can be had so easily in this case we will buy as a speculation and try to put things right i have a particular reason for wishing to own cosmopolis addels hastily disavowed any intent to act counter to gersens wishes i merely want you to be under no misapprehensions i will start acquiring radian stock tomorrow murchisons star sagitta in the star directory lay out in the galactic plane behind vega thirty lightyears beyond the pale it was one of a cluster of five varicolored suns two red dwarfs a blue white dwarf a peculiar unclassifiable bluegreen star of medium size and a yelloworange g which was murchisons star murchison the single planet was somewhat smaller than earth with a single huge continent cincturing the world a searing wind blew dunes around the equatorial zone mountainous highlands sloped gradu ally to the polar seas in the mountains lived aborigines black crea tures of unpredictable characteristics by turns murderously savage torpid hysterical or cooperative in the latter mood they served a useful purpose supplying dyes and fibers for the tapestries which were one of murchisons principal exports the factories which the demon princes produced the tapestries were concentrated about the city of sabra and employed thousands of female operatives these were supplied by a dozen slaving concerns chief among which was gascoyne the wholesaler by virtue of efficient inventory control gascoyne was able to give his customers efficient service at reasonable prices he made no effort to compete with the specialty houses dealt mainly in industrial and agricultural classifications at sabra his principal business was in industrial f selecteds women unprepossessing or past the first bloom of youth but warranted to be of good health and agility cooperative diligent and amiable such were the terms of gascoynes tenpoint guarantee sabra on the shore of the north polar sea was a drab haphazard city with a heterogeneous population whose main goal was to earn sufficient money to go elsewhere the coastal plain to the south was studded with hundreds of peculiar volcanic stubs each crowned with a bristle of livercolored vegetation sabras single distinction was orban circus an open area at the heart of the city centered on one of these volcanic stubs the grand murchison hotel oc cupied the crest of the stub around the circus were the most im portant establishments of the planet wilhelms trade hotel the tapestry mart the depot of gascoyne the wholesaler odenours technical academy cadys tavern the blue ape hotel the her cules import company warehouse and showroom of the tapestry producers cooperative the sportsman supply and trophy house gambels spaceship sales the district victualling company sabra was a city large enough and wealthy enough to need pro tection from raiders and freehooters even though like brinktown in another quarter of the beyond it fulfilled a service to the folk who lived beyond the pale thribolt batteries were constantly manned by members of the city militia and ships coming in from space were regarded with intense suspicion gersen approaching with circumspection radioed down to the spaceport and was directed into a landing orbit at the spaceport he was subjected to interrogation by members of the local de weaseling brigade who were reassured by gersens pharaon wea sels uniformly traveled space in locater bs these were the only the single interworld organization of beyond existing to identity and destroy agents of the ipcc the ipcc accepting a contract to locate and destroy a malefactor who had fled the oikumene could implement its commitments only by sending one or more agents beyond where they were known as weasels and considered fair game the palace of love ships the ipcc chose to risk beyond gersen for once could afford to be candid he stated that he had come to sabra to locate a woman brought here twenty or more years before by gascoyne the wholesaler the deweaselers watching the pips and bulbs on their truth machine exchanged sardonic glances amused by this excess of quixotism and waved gersen forth to the freedom of the city the time was midmorning gersen registered at the grand murchison hotel on top of orban stub which was crowded almost to capacity with tapestry buyers commercial salesmen from the oikumene sportsmen intent on stalking the bower mountain ab origines gersen bathed changed into local costume scarlet plush pan taloons and a black jacket descending to the dining room he ate a lunch of local sea produce seaweed salad a dish of local mollusks directly below were the depot and offices of gascoyne the whole saler a rambling structure of three stories enclosing a central court yard an enormous pink and blue sign across the facade read gascoynes mart select slaves for any purpose a pair of handsome women and a stalwart man were depicted be low at the bottom of the sign a message read gascoynes point guarantee is justly famous gersen finished his lunch descended to the circus crossed to gascoynes mart he was lucky enough to find gascoyne himself available and was ushered into a private office gascoyne was a handsome wellbuilt man of indeterminate age with dark curly hair a dashing black mustache expressive eyebrows his office was sim ple and informal with a bare floor an old wooden desk an infor mation screen showing evidence of much use on one wall hung a plaque with gascoynes famous tenpoint guarantee limned in gold leaf and surrounded by scarlet festoons gersen explained the pur pose of his visit about twentyfive years ago give or take five years you visited sarkovy where you bought a pair of women from a certain kakarsis asm their names were inga and dundine i am anxious to locate these women perhaps you would be good enough to search them out in your records gladly said gascoyne i cant say as i recall the circum stances but he went to the information bank worked the knobs the demon princes and dials a moment evoking flashes of blue light and a sudden grinning visage which nickered away gascoyne shook his head de spondently might as well be a stone for all the use it gives me i must have it repaired well we shall see this way if you please he took gersen into a back room lined with ledgers sar kovy i go there seldom a pestilent world the home of a wicked race he searched his ledgers one year after another this must be the trip so long ago thirty years now let us look my my how this old ledger brings back the memories good old days is not just a banality what were the names again inga dundine i dont know their last names no matter here they are he copied numbers upon a slip of paper went to another ledger turned to the numbers in ques tion they were both sold here on murchison inga went to qualags factory you know where that is third along the right bank of the river dundine went to juniper factory across the river from qualags i trust these women were not friends or relatives like any other my business has its disagreeable aspects at qualags and juniper the women live wholesome productive lives but cer tainly they are not pampered still who is in this life and raising his eyebrows he made a deprecatory gesture around his austere office gersen gave his head a wry shake of sympathy he thanked gascoyne and departed qualags factory was a halfdozen fourstory buildings around a compound gersen entered the lobby of the main office which was hung with sample tapestries a pallid male clerk with varnished blond hair came to inquire his business gascoyne tells me said gersen that thirty years ago qualags purchased a female named inga on your invoice v can you tell me if this woman is still employed by you the clerk shuffled off to search his records then went to an intercom and spoke a few words gersen waited into the office came a tall placidfaced woman with heavy arms and legs the clerk said petulantly gentleman here wants to know about inga bag theres a yellow card on her with two white clips but i cant find the reference youre looking under dormitory f the bs are all dorm a the woman located the correct reference inga bag dead i remember her very well an earthwoman giving herself all style the palace of love of airs complained constantly of this and that she came to the dye works while i was recreation counsellor remember her well she worked in blues and greens and it put her off she finally threw herself into a vat of dustyorange thats long ago my how time flies leaving qualags gersen crossed the river by a bridge and walked to the juniper factory which was somewhat larger than qualags the office was similar though with a brisker atmosphere gersen again put his question this time in connection with dundine but the clerk was not cooperative and refused to check the records we arent allowed to give out such information said the clerk looking disdainfully at gersen from the altitude afforded him by his position behind the counter let me discuss the matter with the manager said gersen mr plusse owns the factory if you will be seated i will an nounce you gersen went to examine a tapestry ten feet wide by six feet high representing a flowered field on which stood hundreds of fanciful birds mr plusse will see you sir mr plusse was a small surly man with a white topknot and eyes of blue agate clearly he had no intention of obliging gersen or anyone else sorry sir we have our production to consider trou ble enough with the women as it is we do our best for them we provide good food and recreational facilities bathe them once a week still its impossible to keep them satisfied may i ask if the woman still works for you it makes no difference if she does or not you would not be allowed to disturb her if she is here if she is the woman i am looking for ill be glad to recompense you for any inconvenience hmf just a moment mr plusse spoke into the intercom is not there a dundine in wickerstitching whats her current index hmf i see he returned to gersen whom he now regarded in a thoughtful new light a valuable employee i cant have her badgered if you insist on speaking to her youll have to buy her the price is three thousand svu without a word gersen put down the money mr plusse licked his small pink mouth hmf he spoke into the intercom with a minimum of commotion bring dundine to this office ten minutes passed while mr plusse ostentatiously made no the demon princes tations on a chart the door opened the clerk entered with a large bodied woman in a white smock her features were big and moist her hair was short mousebrown crimped and tied with string wringing her hands apprehensively she stared from mr plusse to gersen and back again you are leaving our service said mr plusse in a dry voice this gentleman has bought you dundine looked at gersen with bright fear oh what do you plan to do with me sir im useful and well here i do my work i dont want to go out on the back farms i wouldnt want to do this and im too old for barge work nothing like that dundine ive paid mr plusse off youre a free woman now you can go back to your home if you like tears sprang into her eyes i dont believe it its true but why did vou do this dundmes face wavered between bewilderment fear and doubt i want to ask you a few questions dundine turned her back bent her head over her hands after a moment gersen asked is there anything you want to bring with you no nothing if i was wealthy id take that little tapestry on the wall the little girls dancing i did the wickenng on that tapestry and i was all that fond of the thing what is the price gersen asked mr plusse that is our style nineteen which is priced at seven hundred fifty svu gersen paid svu and took the tapestry come dun dine he said shortly best that we start off but my goodbyes my dear friends impossible said mr plusse do you wish to disturb the other women dundine sniffed and rubbed her nose theres my bonuses i havent taken its three recreation halfperiods id like to give them to almenna that cant be done as you know we never allow transfer or bartering of bonus units if you wish you may use them now before your departure dundine looked uncertainly toward gersen do we have time thf paiale of loit it seems a shame to let them go to waste but suppose it makes no difference now they walked along the river road toward the center of town with dundine casting timid glances toward gersen i cant imagine what you want of me she said tremulously im certain ive never known you in my life im interested in what you can tell me ofviole falushe viole falushe but i know no such person i can tell you noth ing dundine stopped short her knees shaking are you going to take me back to the factory no said gersen hollowly i wont take you back he looked at her in deep discouragement arent you the dundine who was kidnaped with inga oh yes im dundine poor inga ive never heard other since she went to qualags they say its ever so dreary at qualags gersens mind raced back and forth you were kidnaped and brought to sarkovy yes indeed and oh what a time we had riding the steppes on those bouncing old wagons but the man who kidnaped you and brought you to sarkovy that was viole falushe or so i am told him dundmes mouth twisted as if she had bit into some thing sour his name wasnt viole falushe and gersen belatedly recalled that kakarsis asm had told him the same the man who had sold inga and dundine had not used the name viole falushe at that time no no said dundine m a soft voice looking far back in her life that wasnt any viole falushe it was that nasty little vogel filschner all the way back into the oikumene in fragments and eaculations bits from here oddments from there dundine told her story and gersen gave over trying to elicit a connected narrative expansive inflated with freedom dundine talked with enthu siasm she knew vogel filschner yes indeed she knew him well so he changed his name to viole falushe small wonder after the shame his mother must feel though madame filschner had never enjoyed the best of reputations and no one had ever known vogel fllschners father he had attended school with dundine two classes ahead the demon princes where was this asked gersen why at ambeules declared dundine surprised that gersen did not already know the story as well as herself though gersen knew rotterdam hamburg and paris he had never visited am beules a suburb of rolingshaven on the west coast of europe vogel filschner had always been a strange brooding boy ac cording to dundine extremely sensitive she confided ripe al ways for a great rage or eyefuls of tears one never knew what vogel might do and for a space she fell silent shaking her head in marvel at the deeds of vogel filschner then when he was sixteen and i but fourteen a new girl came to school oh she was a pretty thing jheral tinzy was her name and who but vogel filschner should fall in love but vogel filschner was grubby and unsavory jheral tinzy a girl of sensitivity found him repulsive who could blame her mused dundine vogel was an eerie boy i can see him yet tall for his age and somewhat thin with a round belly and a round bottom like a billiken he walked with his head to the side watch ing all with his dark burning eyes they watched they saw all they never forgot a thing did vogel filschners eyes i must say that jheral tinzy used him heartlessly laughing and gay the while she drove poor vogel to desperation this is my belief and that man vogel took up with i cant recall his name he wrote poetry very strange and daring he was thought ungodly though he had pa trons in the upper classes those days are so long ago so tragic and so sweet ah if i could live them again what changes there would be at this point dundine went into a nostalgic reminiscence even now i can smell the air from the sea ambeules our old district is on the gaas and this is the loveliest part of the city though by no means the richest the flowers are unimaginable to think that i have seen no flowers for thirty years except for those i myself have worked and now nothing must do but that dundine should examine her tapestry which she had draped upon the back bulkhead of the saloon presently she returned to the subject of vogel filschner the most morbidly sensitive of youths the poet egged him on and truth to tell jheral tinzy humiliated vogel dreadfully whatever the cause vogel performed his terrible deed there were twenty nine girls in the choral society every friday night we sang vogel the palck of love had learned to operate a spaceship it was a course all the boys took so vogel stole one of those little locater ships and when we came out from choral practice to the bus it was vogel who drove us away he took us to the spaceship and made us all get aboard but it was the one night jheral tinzy had not come to practice vogel had no knowledge of this until the last girl left the bus and he was like a stone statue too late then he had no choice but to flee dundine sighed twentyeight girls pure and fresh as little flowers how he dealt with us we knew he was strange but fe rocious as a wild beast no never how could we girls imagine such things for reasons best known to himself he never used us in bed inga thought he was sulking because he had failed to capture jheral godelia parwitz and rosamond i cant think of her name they tried to hit him with a metal implement though it would have been the death of all had they succeeded for none of us knew how to guide the ship he punished them in a dreadful manner so that they cried and sobbed inga and i told him he was a wicked monster to act so he only laughed did vogel filschner a wicked monster am i ill show you a wicked monster and he took us to sarkovy and sold us to mr asm but first he stopped at another world and sold ten girls who were the least wellfavored then inga and i and six others who hated him the most were sold on sarkovy of the others the most beautiful i know nothing thanks to kalzibah i have been suc cored dundine wanted to return to earth at new wexford gersen fur nished her a wardrobe a ticket to earth and funds sufficient to keep her in comfort the rest of her life at the spaceport she embarrassed him by falling on her knees and kissing his hands i thought to die and have my ashes scattered on a far planet how was i so lucky with so many other poor creatures why did kalzibah select me for his favor the same question in different terms had been troubling ger sen himself with his wealth he might have bought the whole of qualag and juniper and every other factory in sabra and brought each of the wretched women to their homes wtiat then he asked himself sabra tapestries were in demand new factories would be established new slaves imported a year later all would be as before the demon princes still gersen heaved a sigh the universe abounded with evils no one man could defeat them all meanwhile dundine was wiping her eyes and apparently preparing to fall on her knees once more gersen said hastily one request i wish to make of you anything anything you plan to return to rolingshaven it is my home you must not reveal how you were brought from sabra tell no one invent any wild tale but do not mention me do not men tion that i asked you ofvogel filschner trust me the fiends of hell can tear forth my tongue even then i will not speak goodbye then gersen departed hastily before dundine could again demonstrate her gratitude at a public telephone he called bramar investment company henry lucas to speak to mr addels a moment mr lucas addels appeared on the screen mr lucas gersen allowed his image to go forth all continues to go well as well as could be expected my problems arise only from the sheer mass of our money i should say your money addels permitted himself to smile but gradually i am training an orga nization incidentally radian publishing company is ours we had it cheaply because of the circumstances i mentioned previously no one has been inquisitive there have been no questions no rumors to the best of my knowledge none zane publishing com pany bought radian irwin and jeddah own zane a numbered ac count at a pontefract bank owns irwin and jeddah bramar investment is the numbered account who is bramar investment ostensibly it is i well done said gersen you could not have managed bet ter addels acknowledged the praise with a stiff nod i must say once more that radian seems a poor investment at least on the basis of past performance why has it been losing money everyone seems to read cos mopolis i see it everywhere perhaps this is so nevertheless circulation has slowly been the palace of love declining more significantly the typical reader no longer is a de cisionmaker the management has been trying to please everyone including the advertisers as a result the magazine has lost its flair there would seem to be a remedy for the situation said gersen hire a new editor a man of imagination and intelligence instruct him to revitalize the magazine without regard for adver tisers or circulation sparing no reasonable expense when the mag azine regains its prestige circulation and advertisers will return fast enough i am relieved that you preface the word expense with reason able said addels in his driest voice i still am not accustomed to dealing with millions as if they were hundreds no more am i said gersen the money means nothing to me except that i find it uncommonly useful one other matter instruct the cosmopolis head office i believe it is located in lon don that a man named henry lucas will be sent to the editorial offices represent him as an employee of zane publishing if you like he is to be put on the payroll as a special writer who will work when and where he chooses without interference very well sir i will do as you require from introduction to old earth by ferencz szantho erdenfreude a mysterious and intimate emotion which dilates blood vessels slides chills

erdenfreude they state is the flux of a hundred thousand racial memories boiling up almost to the level of consciousness geneticists speak of rna metaphysicians refer to the soul parapsychologists make the possibly irrelevant observation that haunted houses are to be found on earth alone history is bunk henry ford gersen who had lived nine years on earth nevertheless felt some thing of an outworlders exhilaration as he hung above the great globe awaiting his clearance from space security finally it arrived the pal ice op iove with precise landing instructions and gersen dropped down to the west europe spaceport at tarn he passed through sanitation pro cedures and health inspection the most stringent of the oiku mene punched appropriate buttons at the immigration control console and finally was allowed to proceed about his business he rode to london by tube and registered at the royal oak hotel a block off the strand the season was early autumn the sun shone through a high thin overcast old london permeated with the vapors of antiquity shone like a fine gray pearl gersens clothes were in the alphanor style fuller in cut and richer in color than the clothes of london on the strand he went into a gentlemans outfitter where he selected a fabric then stripped to his underwear and was measured by photonic scanners five minutes later he was delivered his new garments black trou sers a jacket of dark brown and beige a white blouse and black cravat inconspicuous now gersen continued along the strand dusk came to the sky every planet had its distinctive dusk thought gersen the dusk of alphanor for instance was an electric blue gradually fading to the richest of ultramarines sarkovy dusk was a dead dismal gray with a tawny overtone dusk at sabra had been browngold with domains of color around the other stars of the cluster the dusk of earth was dusk as it should be soft heathergra soothing an ending and a beginning gersen dined at a restaurant which had maintained an unbroken tenancy for over seventeen hundred years the old oak beams fumed and waxed were as stout as ever the plaster recently had been scraped of twenty layers of whitewash and refinished a process which oc curred every hundred years or so gersens thoughts reverted to his youth he had visited london twice with his grandfather though for the most part they had lived in amsterdam there never had been dinners such as this never leisure or idleness gersen shook his head sadl as he recalled the exercises to which his merciless grandfather had put him a wonder that he had stood up to the discipline gersen bought a copy of covmopohs and returned to the hotel he went into the bar and sitting at a table ordered a pint of wor thmgtons aje brewed at burtonontrent as had been the case for something less than two thousand years he opened cosfwpo is it was easy to understand why the magazine had become moribund there were three long articles have earthmen become less vir thk demon princks ile patricia poitrine new toast of the smart set a cler gymans guide to spiritual renewal gersen flicked through the pages then laid the magazine aside he drained the mug and went up to his room in the morning he visited the editorial offices of cosniopolis and asked to speak to the personnel director this was mrs neutra a brittle blackhaired woman wearing a great deal of preposterous jewelry she showed no inclination to speak to gersen sorry sorry sorry i cant consider anything or anyone at this moment im in a flap everybodys in a flap theres been a shakeup no ones job is any good perhaps i had better speak to the editor in chief said gersen there was to have been a letter from zane publishing and it should have arrived the personnel director made a gesture of irritation who or what is zane publishing the new ownership said gersen politely oh the woman pushed among the papers on her desk maybe this is it she read oh youre henry lucas yes hmm piff puff youre to be a special writer some thing we just dont need at the moment but im only personnel director oh hell fill out the application make an appointment for your psychiatric tests if you survive and you probably wont show up a week from tomorrow for your orientation course gersen shook his head i dont have time for any of these formalities i doubt if the new owners have much sympathy with them sorry mr lucas this is our inflexible program what does the letter say it says to put mr henry lucas on the payroll as special writer then please do so oh double bingbang hell if this is how things are going to go why have a personnel director wtly have psychiatric tests and orientation courses why not just let janitors put out the rag the woman seized a form wrote with swift strokes of a flam boyant quill pen here you are take it into the managing editor hell arrange your assignment the managing editor was a portly gentleman with lips pursed the palace of love in a worried pout yes mr lucas mrs neutra just called me i understand you have been sent in by the new ownership ive been associated with them for a long time said gersen but all i want at this moment is whatever identification you supply your special correspondents so that if necessary i can demonstrate that im an employee of cosmopolis the managing editor spoke into an intercom on your way out step into department a and your card will be prepared he leaned morosely back into his chair it seems that you are to be a roving reporter responsible to no one a very nice billet if i may say so wtiat do you propose to write about one thing or another said gersen whatever comes up the managing editors face sagged with bewilderment you cant go out and write a cosmopolis article like that our issues are programmed months ahead we use public opinion polls to find out what subjects people are interested in i low can they know what theyre interested in if they havent read it asked gersen the new owners are throwing the public opinion polls away the managing editor shook his head sadly how will we know what to write about i have an idea or two for instance the institute could stand an airing what are its current aims who are the men of degrees what information have they suppressed what of tryon russ and his antigravity machine the institute deserves a comprehensive study you could easily devote an entire issue to the institute the editor nodded curtly dont you think its a bit well intense are people really interested in these matters if not they should be easily said but its no way to run a magazine people dont wnt to really understand anything they want to think they have learned without the necessity of application in our heavy articles we try to supply keys and guides so at least theyll have something to talk about at parties but go on what else do vou have in mind ive been thinking of viole falushe and the palace of love exactly what goes on at this establishment what face does viole falushe show what name does he bear when he comes in from w dp mon princes beyoncp who are his guests at the palace oflove how have they farced would they care to return an interesting topic the editor admitted a bit close to the knuckle perhaps we prefer to steer away from sensationalism and shall we say the grim facts of reality still ive often won dered about the palace of love wtiat in the world does go on the usual i suppose but no one knows for sure wtiat else thats all for now gersen rose to his feet in fact ill be working on this last story myself the managing editor shrugged his shoulders you seem to have been accorded a free hand gersen immediately rode the subchannel tube to rolmgshaven arriving at the vast zone station a few minutes before noon he crossed the whitetiled lobby past shdeways and escalators labeled wien pans tsargrad berlin budapest kiev neapolis and a dozen other ancient cities he paused at a kiosk to buy a map then went to a cafe settled himself at a table with a stem of beer and a plate of sausages gersen had lived long in amsterdam and had passed through the zone station on several occasions but of the city rolingshaven he knew little as he ate he studied the map rolingshaven was a city of considerable extent divided into four principal municipalities by two rivers the gaas and the sluicht and the great evres canal at the north was zummer a rather grim district of apartment towers and careful malls laid out by some neat minded city council ot the distant past on the heybau a prom ontory hooking out into the sea was the famous handelhal conservatory the wonderful galactic zoo and the kindergarten zummer otherwise was devoid of interest south across the sluicht was the old city a teeming confu sion of small shops inns hostels restaurants beer caverns book stalls huddled offices askew little houses of stone and timber dating from the middle ages a district as chaotic and picturesque as zummer was stark and dull and here as well was the ancient university overlooking the fish market along the banks of the evres canal ambeules lay across the canal a district of nine hills covered with homes and a periphery given to wharves warehouses ship yards mud flats from which were dredged the famous flamande the pamce of love oysters the great gaas estuary separated ambeules from dourrai a district of somewhat lower hills again covered with small homes with the great industries and fabrication plants straggling along the shore and southward this was the city where viole falushe or more accurately vogel filschner had lived and where he had committed his first great crime the exact locale was ambeules and gersen decided to base himself in this area finishing the beer and sausages he rode an escalator to the third level above where a local tube car whisked him south under the evres canal to ambeules station he rode to the surface and look ing right and left through the hazy radiance which characterized the region approached the old woman who managed a newsstand which is a good hotel nearby the old woman pointed a brown finger up hoebhngasse to the rembrandt hotel as good as any in ambeules of course if its elegance you require then you must go to the hotel prince franz ludwig in old town the finest m furope with prices to match gersen chose the rembrandt hotel a pleasant oldfashioned structure with public rooms paneled in dark wood and was taken to a suite of highceilmged rooms overlooking the great gray gaas the day was still young gersen rode a cab to the maine where he paid a small fee and was given access to the city directory he ran the record back to the screen spun to the letter f fi and finally the name filschner at this time three filschners were listed gersen made notes of the addresses he likewise found two tmzys and made similar notes then he dialed to the current list ings and found two filschners and four tinzys one of the fil schners and one of the tinzys had maintained the same address across the years gersen next visited the office of the ambeules helion and on the strength of his cosmopolis card was given access to the morgue he brought the index to the screen scanned it for the name vogel filschner found a code number coded and punched the show button the tale was much as dundine had told though in condensed form vogel filschner was described as a boy given to spells of brooding and wandering alone by night his mother hedwig fil schner identified as a beautician professed herself amazed at vo thf demon princes gels outrageous deed she described him as a good boy though very idealistic and moody vogel filschner had had no close friends in the biology labo ratory he had been teamed with a lad named roman haenigsen the school chess champion they had played an occasional game of chess during the lunch hour roman evinced no astonishment at vogels crime he was a fellow who hated to lose whenever i beat him he would go savage and throw aside the pieces still it amused me to play with him i dont like people who take the game frivolously vogel filschner was not a frivolous boy thought gersen a photograph appeared the kidnaped girls grouped in a picture identified as the philidor bohus choral society in the front row stood a plump smiling girl m whom gersen recognized dundme among the girls would be jheral tmzy and gersen checked the faces against the caption jheral tmzy was the third girl in the fourth row not only did a girl m the third row obscure her face she also had turned her head aside at the time the photograph was taken and what could be seen of her face was indistinct there was no photograph of vogel filschner the file ended so much for that thought gersen vogel fil schners identity as viole falushe was not widely apprehended m ambeules if at all as verification gersen dialed for the file on viole falushe the demon prince but only a single reference ex cited his interest viole falushe at various times has implied that his original home was earth on several occasions a rumor has reached us to the effect that viole falushe has been seen here m ambeules why he should wish to haunt our unexciting district is a question which cannot be answered and the rumors appear no more than an insane hoax gersen departed the newspaper offices and went to stand in the street the gendarmery gersen decided against approaching them unlikely that they could tell him more than he already knew un likely that they would if they could additionally gersen had no desire to arouse official curiosity gersen checked the addresses he had noted as well as the lo cation of the philidor bohus lyceum on his map the lyceum was the nearest at the far side of lothar parish gersen signaled a threewheeled autocab and was conveyed up one of the nine hills through a district of small detached houses some were constructed the place of love in the ancient fashion of glazed dark red brick and a high pitched roof of milkglass tiles others were m the new hollow trunk style narrow concrete cylinders two thirds below the ground there were houses of artificial sandstone compressed as a unit from molded soil houses of pink or white panels surmounted by crimped metal domes houses of laminated paper with transparent roofs electrically charged to repel dust the bulbs of urncast glass or glassmetal so common among the worlds of the concourse had never won acceptance among the folk of western europe who com pared them to pumpkins and paper lanterns and called the people who lived in them nonhuman futunans the cab discharged ger sen before the philidor bohus lyceum a grim cube of synthetic black stone flanked by a pair of smaller cubes the director of the lyceum was dr willem ledmger a bland largebodied man with taffycolored skin and a lank lock of yellow hair which wound around his scalp in a most peculiar manner ger sen wondered at the mans audacity thus to present himself before several thousand adolescents ledinger was affable and unsuspi cious readily accepting gersens statement that cosmopohs wished to present a survey of contemporary young people i dont think theres much to write about said ledinger our young people are if i must say it unexceptionable we have many bright students and at least a fair quota of dullards gersen steered the conversation to students of the past and their careers from here it was an easy connection to the subect of vogel filschner ah yes mused dr ledmger patting his yellow topknot vogel filschner i havent heard his name for years before my time of course i was a mere instructor across the city at hulba technical academy but the scandal reached us never fear fac ulties have big ears wtiat a tragedy to think of a lad like that going so far wrong he never returned to ambeules then hed be a fool to do so or to advertise his presence at any rate do you have the likeness of vogel filschner among your rec ords perhaps i might do a separate piece upon this peculiar crime grudgingly dr ledmger admitted that photographs of vogel filschner were on file but why rake up the old nastiness it is like breaking into graves ii if di mon princes on the other hand such an article might identify the rogue and bring him to ustice justice dr ledmger curled his lip in disbelief after thirty years he was a hysterical child no matter what his crime by this time he has made redemption and found peace what could be gamed by bringing him to what you call justice gersen was somewhat startled by dr ledingers vehemence to dissuade others perhaps there is a potential vogel filschner among your students this very instant dr ledmger smiled wistfully i dont doubt it an instant cer tain of these young rascals well i wont tell tales out of school and i wont supply you with the photographs i find the idea com pletely obectionable is there a yearbook for the year of the crime or better the previous year dr ledmger looked at gersen a moment his affability slowdy disappearing then he went to his wall plucked a volume from the shelves he watched quietly as gersen turned the pages and finally came upon the photograph of the girls choral society he had al ready seen gersen pointed there is jheral tmzy the girl who rebuffed vogel and drove him to his crime dr ledmger examined the picture think of it twentyeight girls snatched away beyond their lives blasted wonder how they fared some may still be alive poor things whatever became of jheral tmzy she was not among the group if you recall dr ledmger examined gersen with suspicion you seem to know a great deal about the case have you been completely candid with me gersen grinned not altogether i am principally interested in vogel filschner but i dont want anyone to know im interested if i can get the information i need discreetly with no one the wiser so much the better you are a police officer or of the ipcc gersen displayed his identification here is my sole claim to fame hmmf cowiopohs plans to publish an article on vogel fil schner it seems a waste of paper and ink no wonder cosmopohs has lost prestige the palace of love what of jheral tinzy you have her photograph in your files undoubtedly dr ledmger laid his hands upon the desk to signal that the interview had reached its end but we cannot open our confidential files haphazardly i am sorrv gersen rose to his feet thank you in any case i have done nothing to help you said dr ledmger stonily vogel filschner had lived with his mother in a narrow little house at the eastern end of ambeules bordering on a dingy district of warehouses and transportation depots gersen climbed the em broidered iron steps touched the button faced the inspection eye a womans voice spoke yes gersen spoke m his most confident voice i am trying to locate madame hedwig filschner who lived here many years ago i know no one of that name you must consult with ewane clodig who owns the property we only pay rent ewane clodig whom gersen found m the offices of clodig properties consulted his records madame hedwig filschner the name is familiar i dont see it on mv list here it is she moved let me see thirty years ago you have her present address no sir that is too much to ask i have not even a forwarding address from thirty years ago but it comes back is she not the mother of vogel filschner the boy slaver correct well then i can tell you this when the deed was known she packed her belongings and disappeared and no one has heard of her since jheral tmzys old home was a tall octagonal structure of the so called fourth palladian style situated halfway up bailleui hill the address corresponded to one which gersen had noted in the current directory the family had not changed its residence a handsome woman of early middleage answered the door she wore a gay peasant smock a flowered scarf around her head gersen appraised the woman before he spoke she returned a gaze so direct as to be bold youre jheral tinzy gersen asked tentatively jheral the womans eyebrows arched high no no in the demon princes deed she gave a sardonic bark of laughter what a strange thing to ask who are you gersen produced his identification the woman read returned the card what makes you think i am jheral tinzy she lived here at one time she would be about your age im her cousin the woman considered gersen more care fully than ever what did you want with jheral may i come in ill explain the woman hesitated as gersen came forward she made a quick motion to restrain him then after a dubious glance over her shoulder she moved aside gersen entered a hall with a floor of immaculate white glass tiles on one hand was the display wall characteristic of middleclass european homes here hung a panel intricately inlaid with wood bone and shell lenka workmanship from nowhere one of the concourse planets a set of perfume points from pamtile a rectangle of polished and perforated obsid ian and one of the socalled supplication slabs from lupus gersen paused to examine a small tapestry of exquisite design and workmanship this is a beautiful piece do you know where it came from its very rich agreed the woman i believe it came from off world it looks to me like a sabra piece said gersen from the upper floor came a harsh call emma wtw is there awake already muttered the woman she raised her voice a gentleman from cosmopolis aunt we wish no magazines cried the voice i am explicit very well aunt ill tell him so emma signaled gersen into a sitting room jerked her head toward the source of the voice jherals mother she is not well a pity said gersen where incidentally is jheral the nonhuman names uf peninsula lupus iii devote the greater part ot their lues to the working of these slabs which apparcrirlv have a religious significance twice each year at the solstices two hundred and twentyfour microscopically exact slabs are placed aboard a ceremonial harge which is then allowed to drift out upon the ocean ihe lupus salvage company maintains a ship ust over the hon on troin peninsula a as soon as the raft has drifted hom sight of land it is recovered the slabs are removed exported and sold as vhjrt ilnii the palice of love emma turned her bold glance on gersen wtly do you want to know to be candid im trying to locate a certain vogel filschner emma laughed soundlessly and without mirth youve come to the wrong place to find vogel filschner what a joke you knew him oh yes he was in the class under mine at the lyceum you havent seen him since the kidnaping oh no never still its strange that you should ask emma hesitated smiling tremulously as if in embarrassment its like a cloud passing over the sun sometimes i look around sure that ive glimpsed vogel filschner but hes never there wtiat happened to jheral emma seated herself looked far back aown the years you must remember that there was much publicity and outcry it was the greatest outrage in memory jheral was pointed at there were unpleasant scenes several of the mothers actually slapped and abused jheral she had snubbed vogel driven him to crime hence shared his guilt i must admit said emma reflectively that jheral was a heartless flirt she was simply adorable of course she could bring the boys with one little sidelong glance like this emma demonstrated such a rascal she even flirted with vogel pure sadism because she couldnt bear the sight of him ah the detestable vogel every day jheral would come home from school to tell us another of vogels enormities how he dissected a frog and then after wiping his hands on a paper towel ate his lunch how badly he smelled as if he never changed his clothes how he would boast of his poetic mind and try to impress her with his magnificence its true jheral with her tricks incited vogel and twentyeight other girls paid the price and then great indignation everyone turned against jheral as perhaps they had always longed to do jheral finally ran away with an older man she never returned to ambeules not even her mother knows where she is into the room rushed a blazingeyed old woman with a mane of flying white hair gersen jumped behind a chair to avoid her charge wtiat do you want asking questions in this house be off with you hasnt there been trouble enough i dont trust your ss ihf dmon princes face you are like all the rest out never return scoundrel the audacity entering this house with your filthy questions gersen left the house as expeditiously as he was able emma started to accompany him to the door but her aunt hobbling for ward shoved her aside the door closed the nearhysterical ranting became muffled gersen heaved a deep breath a virago he had been lucky to es cape without scratches at a nearby cafe gersen drank a flask of wine and watched the sun sink toward the sea an excellent possibility of course that the entire line oi investigation beginning with the notice in the avente newspaper was a wild goose chase to date the only link between viole falushe and vogel filschner was the opinion ofka karsis asm emma tmy apparently believed that she had seen vogel fllschncr m ambeules viole falushe might well enjoy the dangerous pleasure of returning to the scenes of his childhood if so why had he not revealed himself to his old acquaintances al though it seemed that vogel filschner had made precious few friends or acquaintances in any event jheral tmzy perhaps had made the wisest of decisions when she took herself away from am beules vmie falushe had a notoriously long memory his one friend had been roman haemgsen the chess champion some where also there had been mention of a poet who had incited vogel filschner to excess gersen called for a directory and searched for the name haemgsen there it was the book almost fell open to the name gersen copied the address and asked directions from a waiter it appeared that roman haemgsen lived scarcely five minutes walk away finishing his wine gersen set off through the waning sunlight the house of roman haemgsen was the most elegant of the houses he had visited this day a threestory structure of metal and meltstone panels with electric windows to go transparent or opaque at a spoken word haemgsen was only ust arriving home when gersen turned into the walk a small brisk man with a large head and prim me ticulous features he peered sharply at gersen and asked his busi ness candor in this case seemed more useful than indirection gersen said i am making inquiries in regard to your old classmate vogel filschner i understand that you were almost his only friend the palace of love hm said roman haenigsen he thought a moment come inside if you will and we will talk he took gersen into a study decorated with all manner of chess memorabilia portraits busts collections of chessmen photographs do you play chess he asked gersen i have played on occasion though not often like anything else one must practice to keep in fighting trim chess is an old game he went to a board disarranged the chess men with affectionate contempt every variation has been ana lyzed there is a recorded game to illuminate the results of any reasonable move if one had a sufficiently good memory he would not need to think to win his games he could merely play someone elses winning game luckily no one owns such a memory but the robots still you did not come here to talk of chess will you take a glass of liquor thank you gersen accepted a crystal goblet containing an inch of spirits vogel filschner strange to hear that name once more is his whereabouts known this is what i am attempting to learn roman haemgsen gave his head a wry shake you will learn nothing from me i have neither seen him nor heard from him since i had hardly expected that he would return in his old identity but its possible gersen paused as roman haemgsen snapped his fingers peculiar said haenigsen each thursday night i play at the chess club perhaps a year ago i noticed a man standing under the clock i thought surely thats not vogel filschner he turned i saw his face it was a man somewhat like vogel but far different a man of fine appearance and poise a man who had nothing of vogels hangdog surliness and yet since you mention it there was something to this man perhaps his manner of holding his arms and hands which reminded me of vogel you havent seen this man smce not once did you speak to him no in my surprise i must have halted to stare but then i hurried on past he demon princfs can you think of anyone vogel might wish to see did he have friendi other than yourself roman haenigsen pursed his lips wryly i was hardly his friend we shared a laboratory table i played him an occasional game of chess which he often won had he applied himself he might have taken the championship but he cared only for mooning over girls and writing bad poetry in imitation of a certain navarth ah navarth this is the poet whom vogel filschner sought to emulate unfortunately in my opinion navarth was a charlatan a bom bast a man of the most dubious attitudes and what has become of navarth i believe he still is about though hardly the man he was thirty years ago people have grown wise studied decadence no longer shocks as it did when i was a lad vogel naturally was entranced and went through the most ludicrous antics in order to identify with his idol yes indeed if anyone is to blame for the crimes of vogel filschner it is the mad poet navarth drinking whisky by the peg singing songs of drunken glee i thought to swallow half a keg but tim r mortiss degurgled me not precisely comme il faut to practice frank polygamy i might have practiced even so but tim r mortiss disturgled me chorus tim r mortiss tim r mortiss hes a loving friend he holds my hand while im asleep he guides me on my fourday creep hes with me to the end to woo a dainty eskimo i vowed to swim the bering sea no sooner had i wet a toe when tim r mortiss occurgled me a threat arcane a fearful bane within an old phylactery i turned the rubbish down a dram now tim r mortiss perturgles me chorus with a snapping of fingers and clicking of heels in midair the dkmon princes tim r morriss tim r mortiss hes a loving friend he holds my hand while im asleep he guides me on my fourday creep hes with me to the end navarth on the following day gersen paid a second visit to the offices of the helion the dossier on navarth was enthusiastic and ample reporting scandals improprieties defiances and outrageous pro nouncements across a period of forty years the initial entry dealt with an opera presented by students of the university with a li bretto by navarth the first performance was declared an infamy and nine students were expelled from the university thereafter navarths career soared and collapsed resurged recollapsed at last with finality for the past ten years he had resided aboard a house boat on the gaas estuary near the fitlingasse gersen tubed to station hedrick on boulevard castel vivence and surfaced in the commercial and shipping district of ambeules beside the gaas estuary the district roiled with the activity of agencies warehouses offices wharves buffets restaurants wine shops fruit hawkers news kiosks dispensaries barges nosed into docks to be unloaded by robots drays rumbled along the boulevard from below came the vibration of freight moving by tube at a sweetshop gersen inquired for the fitlingasse and was directed east along the boulevard automatic opensided passenger wagons served the boulevard with patrons riding on benches facing the street gersen rode a mile two miles with the gaas on the right hand the bustle di minished the imposing blocks and masses of the commercial dis trict gave way to ancient three and fourstory structures queer narrowwindowed buildings of meltstone or terracotta panels stained a hundred subtle colors by smoke and salt air occasionally the wagon passed vacant areas where only weeds grow through these gaps could be seen the next street to the north on a somewhat higher level than boulevard castel vivence with tall apartment buildings pressed tightly against each other the fitlingasse was a narrow gray alley striking off up the hill gersen alighted and almost at once observed a hulking twostoried the palace of love houseboat moored to a dilapidated dock a wisp of smoke drifted up from the chimney someone was aboard gersen took stock of the surroundings hazy sunlight played on the estuary on the far shore thousands of houses with brown tile roofs stood in ranks down to the waters edge elsewhere were unused wharves rotting piles a warehouse or two a saloon with purple and green windows extending over the water on the dock a girl of seventeen or eighteen sat tossing pebbles into the water she gave gersen a brief dispassionate stare then looked away ger sen turned back to consider the houseboat if this were navarths residence he enjoyed a very pleasant prospect though the wan sunlight the brown roofs of dourrai the rotting wharves the lap ping water invested the scene with melancholy even the girl seemed somber beyond her years she wore a short black skirt a brown jacket her hair was dark and rumpled whether from wind or neglect it could not be known gersen approached and inquired is navarth aboard the houseboat she nodded without change of expression and watched with the detachment of a naturalist as gersen descended the ladder to the landing then crossed an alarming gangplank to the foredeck of the houseboat gersen knocked at the door there was no response gersen knocked again the door was flung violently open a sleepy un shaven man peered forth his age was indeterminate he was thin spindleshanked with a twisted beak of a nose rumpled hair of no particular color eyes which though perfectly set gave the impres sion of looking in two directions at once his manner was wild and truculent is there no privacy left in the world off the boat at once whenever i settle for a moments rest some sheepfaced functionary some importunate peddler of tracts insists on pounding me out of my couch will you not depart have i not made myself clear i warn you i have a trick or two up my sleeve gersen tried to speak to no avail when navarrh reached within he hastily retreated to the dock a moment of your time he called i am no functionary no salesman i am named henry lucas and i wish navarth shook his skinny fist not now not tomorrow not in the total scope of the future nor at any time thereafter do i wish to make your acquaintance be off with you you have the face of a man that brings ill news a gnashing blacktooth grin these mat the demon princes ters are clear to me you are fey i want nothing of you go away with a leer of evil triumph he swung the gangplank away from the landing reentered the houseboat gersen returned to the dock the girl sat as before gersen looked back down at the houseboat he asked in a wondering voice is he always like that he is navarth said the girl as if this were all that need be said gersen went to the saloon drank a pint of beer the bartender was a quiet watchful man of great height with an imposing stomach and either knew nothing about navarth or did not choose to reveal what he knew gersen gleaned no information he sat thinking a half hour passed then going to the tele phone directory he looked in the classified section under salvage an advertisement caught his eye joban salvage and tow tugs crane barge diving equipment no job too large or too small gersen telephoned and made his needs known he was assured that on the morrow the equipment he required would be at his service the following morning a heavy oceangoing tug drove up the estuary turned eased into the mooring next to navarths house boat with a bare three feet between the mate bawled orders to the seamen lines were flung up to the dock and dropped over bol lards the tug was moored navarth came out on deck dancing with fury must you moor so close take that great hulk away do you intend to thrust me into the dock leaning on the railing of the tug gersen looked down into navarths upturned face i believe i spoke a few words to you yesterday i recall very well i requested your departure and here you are again more inconveniently than before i wonder if you would give me the pleasure of a few minutes conversation perhaps there might be profit in it for you profit bah i have poured more money out of my shoe than you have spent i require only that you take your tug elsewhere the palace of lole gertainly we are here but for a few minutes navarth gave a pettish nod at the far side of the tug the diver gersen had hired was climbing back on board gersen turned to navarth its very important that i speak to you if you would be so good as to this importance exists from a single point of view be off with you and your mammoth tug at once said gersen he nodded to the diver who touched a button under the houseboat sounded an explosion the houseboat shuddered and began to list navarth ran back and forth in a frenzy from the tug grapples were lowered and hooked to the houseboats rubrail apparently there has been an explosion in your engine room gersen told navarth how can this be there has never been an explosion before there is not even an engine i am about to sink not so long as you are supported by the lines but we are leaving in one minute and i must cast loose the grapples wtiat navarth threw up his arms i will go to the bottom together with the boat is this your desire if you recall you yourself ordered me to leave said gersen in a reasonable voice hence he turned to the crewmen throw off the grapples we depart no no bellowed navarth til sink if you invite me aboard your boat if you talk to me and help me compose an article im writing then thats a different matter said gersen i might be disposed to help you through this mis fortune even perhaps to the extent of repairing your hull wtly not stormed navarth you are responsible for the explosion careful navarth thats at the very verge of slander remem ber there are witnesses bah what you have done is piracy and extortion writing an article indeed well then why didnt you say so in the first place i too am a writer come aboard we will talk i am always grateful for some small diversion a man without friends is a tree without leaves gersen jumped down upon the houseboat navarth now all amiability arranged chairs where they caught the full play of the pallid sunlight he brought forth a bottle of white wine sit then i he demon princes make yourself at ease he opened the bottle poured then leaning back in his chair drank with pleasure his face was placid and guile less as if all the racial wisdom had passed through leaving no per ceptible traces like earth navarth was old irresponsible and melancholy full of a dangerous mirth you are a writer then i may say you do not correspond to the usual image gersen produced his cosmopoliv identification mr henry lu cas read navarth special writer why do you come to me i am no longer heeded my vogue is a memory discredited penurious where was my offense i sought to express truth in all its vehe mence this is a danger a meaning must be uttered idly without emphasis the listener is under no compulsion to react his custom ary defenses are not m place the meaning enters his mind i have much to say about the world but every year the compulsion dwin dles let them live and die it is all one to me wtiat is the scope of your article viole falushe navarth blinked an interesting topic but why come to me because you knew him as vogel filschner hm well yes this is a fact not generally known with fingers suddenly limp navarth poured more wine what specifi cally do you wish knowledge i suggest said navarth suddenly brisk that you seek the information at its source gersen nodded agreement well enough if i knew where to look but what if he is off beyond at his palace of love this is not the case he is here on earth as soon as navarth spoke he seemed to regret his ingenuousness and frowned in irri tation gersen leaned back his doubts and misgivings dissolved vogel filschner and viole falushe were one here was a man who knew him in both identities navarth had become uneasy and resentful a thousand topics more interesting than viole falushe how do you know hes on earth navarth made a sound of grand scorn how do i know any thing am navarth he pointed to a wisp of smoke on the sky i see that i know he pointed to a dead fish floating belly up the pallf of love ward i see that i know he raised the bottle of wine held it up against the sunlight i see that i know gersen reflected a moment m silence i am in no position to criticize your epistemology he said at last in the first place i dont understand it have you no more explicit knowledge of viole falushe navarth attempted to lay his finger slyly alongside his nose but miscalculating prodded his eye there is a time for bravado and another for caution i still do not know the point of your article it is to be a judicious document without exaggeration or apol ogy i intend that the facts will speak for themselves navarth pursed his lips a dangerous undertaking viole fa lushe is the most sensitive of men do you recall the princess who detected a pea under forty mattresses viole falushe can smell out a slur in a blind infants morning invocation to kalzibah on the other hand the world revolves the carpet of knowledge unrolls viole falushe has given me no cause for gratitude your appraisal of his character then is negative asked gersen cautiously navarth could control himself no longer he drank wine with a grandiose gesture negative indeed were i to give all orders what a retribution i could create he slumped back in his chair pointed a skinny finger toward the horizon spoke in a hushed mon otone a pyre tall as a mountain and viole falushe at the top platforms surrounding for ten thousand musicians with a single glance i strike the fire the musicians play while their whisky boils and their instruments melt viole falushe sings soprano he poured more wine a wistful vision it can never be i would be content seeing viole falushe drowned or dismembered by lions you evidently are well acquainted navarth nodded his gaze fixed on the past vogel filschner read my poetry an imaginative youth but disoriented how he changed how he expanded to his imagination he added control he is now a great artist artist what manner of artist navarth dismissed the question as irrelevant never could he have arrived at his present stature without art without style and proportion do not be deceived like myself he is a simple man with the clearest of goals now you you are the most complicated the demon princes and opaque of men i see a corner of your mind then a black film shifts are you an earthman but tell me nothing navarth waved his hands as if to intercept any answer gersen might feel called upon to make there is too much knowledge already in the world we use facts as crutches to the impoverishment of our senses facts are falsehoods logic is deceit i know a single system of commu nication the declaiming of poetry viole falushe is also a poet he has no great art with words grumbled navarth unwilling to relinquish control of the conversation when viole falushe visits earth where does he stay here with you navarth stared at gersen unbelievingly this is a sorry thought where then does he stay here there everywhere he is as elusive as air how do you seek him out that i never do he occasionally visits me and he has done so recently yes yes yes have i not implied as much why are you so interested in viole falushe to answer this would be to inflict a fact upon you said ger sen with a grin but its no secret i represent cosmopolis magazine and i wish to write an article on his life and activities hmmf a popinjay for vanity is viole falushe but why not put your questions to him directly i would like to do so first i must make his acquaintance nothing is easier declared navarth provided you pay the fees why not i am on a liberal expense account navarth jumped to his feet suddenly full of enthusiasm we will need a beautiful girl young unsullied she must project a par ticular quality of scintillance a susceptibility a fervor an urgency he looked vaguely here and there as if in search of something he had lost up on the dock he spied the girl whom gersen had seen the day before navarth put fingers to his mouth produced a shrill whistle signaled the girl to approach shell do very well is this an unsullied young scintillant asked gersen she seems more of a guttersnipe ha ha cawed navarth you will see i am weak and ca the palace of love chectic but i am navarth old as i am women bloom under my touch you will see the girl came aboard the houseboat and listened to navarths program without comment we go forth to dine expense means nothing we shall exalt ourselves with the finest prepare yourself then with silks with jewels with your most precious unguents this is a wealthy gentleman the finest of fellows wtiat is your name once more henry lucas henry lucas he is impatient to proceed go then prepare yourself the girl shrugged i am prepared you are the best judge of this declared navarth inside then while i consult my wardrobe he glanced at the sky a yellow day a yellow night i will wear yellow he led the way into his saloon which was furnished with a wooden table two chairs of carved oak shelves stuffed with books and oddments a vase containing several stalks of pampas grass na varth reached into a cabinet for a second flagon of wine which he opened and banged upon the table along with glasses drink with this he disappeared into the next room gersen and the girl were left alone he examined her covertly she wore the black skirt of yesterday with a black shortsleeved blouse sandals no jewelry or skin tone which on earth was not currently fashionable the girl had good features though her hair was a tangle she was either extremely poised or vastly indifferent on impulse gersen took a comb from navarths washstand and going to the girl combed her hair after a single startled glance she stood quiet and passive gersen wondered what went on in her mind was she as mad as navarth there he said at last you look somewhat less of a raga muffin navarth returned wearing a maroon jacket several sizes too large a pair of yellow shoes you have not tasted the wine he filled three glasses brimming a merry evening in prospect here the three of us three islands in the sea on each island a castaway soul we go forth together and what shall we find gersen tasted the wine a fine heady muscatel he drank na varth poured the wine down his throat as if he were emptying a bucket into the estuary the girl drank without a tremor without the demon princes any display of emotion a strange girl thought gersen somewhere behind the grave face was flamboyance what stimulus could bring it forth what would cause her to laugh are we ready then navarth looked inquiringly from the girl to gersen then threw open the door and ushered them graciously forth in search ofviole falushe from viole falushe chapter iii of the demon princes by carl carphen elucidarian press new wexford aloy sius vega each of the demon princes must cope with the prob lem of notoriety each is sufficiently vain and flamboy ant to wish to flourish his personality to impress his style upon as many lives as possible practical considerations however make an onymity and facelessness important especially as each of the demon princes relishes his visits to the worlds of oikumene viole falushe is no exception like mal agate kokor hekkus lens larque and howard alan treesong he jealously guards his identity and not even guests at his palace of love have seen his face in some respects viole falushe is the most human of the demon princes which is to say his vices are on a scale of human understanding the unimaginable cru elty reptilian callousness megalomania weird mischief exemplified respectively by kokor hekkus malagate lens larque and howard alan treesong are totally absent the evil in viole falushe can be characterized as arachnid vindictiveness infantile sensitivity mon strous selfindulgence his vices aside there is an oddly appealing aspect to viole falushe a warmth an idealism so much is conceded by the most uncompromising moralists lis the dkmon princfs ten to viole falushe himself as he addresses the stu dents of cervantes university i am an unhappy man i am haunted by my in ability to express the inexpressible to come to terms with the unknown the pursuit of beauty is of course a major psychological drive in its various guises which is to say the urge to perfection the yearning to merge with the eternal the explorers restlessness the realization of an absolute created by ourselves yet larger than our totality it is perhaps the most single important human thrust i am tormented by this thrust i strive i build yet paradoxically i suffer from the conviction that should i ever achieve my peculiar goals i might find the results dissatisfying in this case the contest is worth more than the victory i will not describe my own struggle my griefs my dark midnights my heartbreaks you might find them incomprehensible or worse ludicrous t am often described as an evil man and while i do not dispute the label i have not taken the stricture to heart evil is a vector quality operative only in the direction of the vector and often the acts which incur the most censure do singularly small harm and often benefit to the people concerned i am often asked regarding the palace of love but i do not intend to gratify prurient curiosities in this connection suffice it to say that i espouse the augmen tation of awareness and find no fault with the gratifi cation of the senses though i myself practice an asceticism which might surprise you the palace of love extends over a considerable area and is by no means a single structure but rather a complex of gar dens pavillions halls domes towers promenades and scenic panoramas the people of the palace are all young and beautiful and know no other life they are the happiest of mortals so speaks viole falushe rumors are not so kind to him he is said to be fascinated with erotic variations and culminations one of his favorite games is to rear a beautiful maiden with great care in an iso the paiau of love lated cloister she is trained to the knowledge that some day she will meet a miraculous creature who will love her and then kill her and one day she is liberated upon a small island where viole falushe awaits the hotel prince franz ludwig was the most elegant rendezvous of rolingshaven the main foyer was enormous it measured two hundred feet on a side and a hundred feet to the ceiling golden light exuded from twelve chandeliers a deep goldenbrown carpet enriched with subtle patterns covered the floor the walls were covered with silk of pale blue and yellow the ceiling depicted scenes from a medieval court the furnishings were of an intricate antique style solid yet graceful with cushions of rose or yellow satin the woodwork lacquered a muted gold on marble tables stood eight foot urns from which a profusion of flowers overflowed beside each table stood a smartly uniformed page boy here was a sumptuous intricacy which could be found nowhere but on old earth never before had gersen entered a place so grand navarth selected a couch near an alcove where a quartet of musicians played a set of capriccios navarth summoned a page and ordered champagne is this where we seek viole falushe asked gersen i have seen him here on several occasions said navarth we shall be on the alert sitting in the murmurous golden room they drank champagne the girls black skirt and blouse her bare brown legs and sandals whether through paradox or improbable juxtaposition seemed nei ther tawdry nor unsuitable and gersen was somewhat puzzled how had she managed the transformation navarth spoke of this and that the girl said little or nothing gersen was content to let events go at their own pace indeed he found himself enjoying the outing the girl had put down consid erable wine but showed no effects she seemed interested in the people who moved through the great foyer but in a spirit of de tachment at last gersen asked what is your name i dont know how to speak to you the girl did not respond immediately navarth said call her what you like this is my custom tonight she is zan zu from eridu the demon princes the girl smiled a brief flicker of amusement gersen decided that she was not after al a lackwit zan zu eh is this your name its as good as any other the champagne is finished an excellent vintage we go to dine navarth rose to his feet and gave his arm to the girl crossing the foyer they descended four broad stairs into the dining room which was no less magnificent than the foyer navarth ordered dinner with enthusiasm and finesse never had gersen enjoyed a finer meal one which made him regret the limits imposed by the capacity of his stomach navarth ate with voracious enjoyment zan zu of eridu as gersen now thought of the girl ate delicately without interest gersen watched her sidelong was she ill had she recently undergone some great sorrow or shock she seemed composed enough too composed considering the wine she had drunk muscatel champagne the various wines na varth had ordered to accompany the dinner well it made no difference to him gersen reflected his business was with viole falushe though here at the hotel prince franz ludwig in the company of navarth and zan zu viole falushe seemed unreal with an effort gersen brought himself back to the business at hand how easy to be seduced by richness elegance exquisite food the golden light of chandeliers he asked if viole falushe is not to be found here where do you propose to look i have no set scheme navarth explained we must move as the mood takes us do not forget that viole falushe long ago re garded me as an exemplar is it not reasonable to suppose that his program will merge with our own reasonable indeed we will test the theory they lingered over coffee trifles of fragrant pastry quarter gills of krystaliek then gersen paid the dinner check well over svu and they departed the hotel prince franz ludwig now where asked gersen navarth ruminated we are somewhat early still atmikmaks cabaret there is always amusement of one kind or another if only in watching the good burghers at their decorous ease from mikmaks cabaret they moved on to parus der flie gende hollander and thence to the blue pearl each new tavern and cabaret was somewhat less genteel than the previous one or so the palace of lol it seemed from the blue pearl navarth led the way to the sunset cafe on the boulevard caste vivence in ambeules thereafter to a succession ofwaterfront dives beer cellars and dance halls at za diels allworld rendezvous gersen interrupted one of navarths dissertations is it here that we can expect viole falushe where else but here demanded the mad poet now some what drunk where the heart of earth beats the thickest blood thick purple smelling of must like crocodile blood the blood of dead lions never fear you will see your man what was i dis cussing my youth my squandered youth at one time i worked for tellur transit investigating the contents of lost suitcases here perhaps i gained my deepest insight into the structure of the hu man soul gersen sat back in his chair in the present circumstances pas sive wariness was the optimum course to his surprise he found himself slightly drunk though he had attempted moderation the colored lights the music navarths wild talk were probably no less responsible than the alcohol zan zu was as remote as ever looking sidelong at her as he had tended to do all evening gersen won dered what goes on in this umbral creatures mind wtiat does she hope from life does she daydream does she yearn for a handsome lover does she ache to travel to visit the outworlds from the ancient cathedral on flammande heights came twelve reverberating strokes of the bass bell the hour is mid night croaked navarth he rose swaying to his feet looked from gersen to zan zu from eridu now we proceed wtiere now asked gersen navarth pointed across the street to a long low pavilion with an eccentric roof and festoons of green lights i suggest the ce lestial harmony cafe the rendezvous of travelers spacemen off world wanderers wayward vagabonds such as ourselves to the celestial harmony cafe they walked navarth declaim ing upon the poor quality of life in presentday rolingshaven we are stagnant slowly decaying wtiere is our vitality drained to the outworlds we have bled our life away on earth remain the sickly the depraved the cryptic thinkers the sunset wanderers on the mud flats the paranoids and involutes the great epicures the timid dreamers the medievalists you have traveled the oikumene gersen inquired never has my foot lost contact with the soil of earth the demon princes in which of the categories then are you included navarth waved his arms on high have i not inveighed against categories here is the celestial harmony cafe we arrive at the peak of the evening they entered threaded their way to a table and navarth in stantly ordered a magnum of champagne the cafe was crowded voices clatter and shuffle competed with boisterous jigs played by an orchestra of fife concertina euphonium and banjo while the clientele danced cavorted kicked and pranced after the modes fa miliar to them a long bar on a level somewhat higher than the main floor ran the width of the building men standing at the railing were silhouetted against the orange and green lights of the bar at the tables of the main floor sat men and women of every age race social condition and degree of sobriety most wore european gar ments but a few displayed the costumes of other regions and other worlds hostesses formal and selfappointed roved here and there soliciting drinks dispensing ribald repartee arranging assignations the musicians presently took up other instruments a baritone lute viola flute and tympanet with which they accompanied a troupe of tumblers navarth drank champagne with indefatigable zest zan zu from eridu looked this way and that whether from interest uneasiness or a sense of suffocation gersen could not be sure her knuckles were white where she held the goblet she turned her head suddenly met his gaze her lips quivered in the faintest possible ghost of a smile or an embarrassed grimace she raised the goblet and sipped her champagne navarths gayety was at its height he sang to the music tapped the table with his fingers reached to embrace the hostesses who sidestepped with an air of boredom as if struck by a new thought he turned to consider zan zu then inspected gersen as if puzzled why gersen were not more enterprising gersen could not resist another glance at zan zu and whether through wine the colored lights the ambiance of the eve ning the guttersnipe tossing pebbles from a dock was gone gersen stared at her the transformation was astonishing she was magic a creature of entrancing intensity navarth was watching gayety suddenly abandoned gersen turned navarth looked quickly away what am i up to gersen wondered what is navarth up to reluctantly gersen rejected the palace of love the concepts which had surged up in his mind he settled back in his chair zan zu the girl from eridu looked somberly down at her gob let with relief sadness boredom gersen was at a loss to decide the ways of the girls mind seemed important indeed what was he getting into he asked himself with a pang of bitter anger he glared at navarth who met his gaze blandly zan zu sipped her champagne navarth intoned the vine of life grows a single melon the color of the heart is unknown until the rind is split gersen looked out across the tables navarth filled his goblet gersen drank navarth was right for a gain so wild so deli cious so magic there must be an initial abandon a burning of bridges what of viole falushe what of his basic momentum and as if in response to these thoughts navarth seized his arm he is here gersen roused himself from his brooding wtiere there at the bar gersen scanned the line of men who stood along the railing their silhouettes were nearly identical some looked this way some that some held mugs or flasks others leaned with elbows on the railing wich is viole falushe see the man who watches the girl he can see no one else he is fascinated gersen searched along the line of men none seemed to be paying any great attention navarth whispered in a husky voice she knows she is even more aware than i gersen glanced at the girl who seemed uneasy her fingers fum bled with the stem of the goblet as he watched she glanced across the room at one of the dark shapes how she had divined the at tention was beyond gersens comprehension a waiter approached the girl and spoke into her ear gersen could not hear what was said zan zu looked down at the cham pagne goblet twisting the stem between her fingers she came to some decision and putting her hands on the table she rose ger sen felt a surge of passion ignoble to sit quietly to allow this to happen he had been affronted he was being pillaged of something which while it had never belonged to him nevertheless was his own with a spasm of terror he wondered if it were too late he lurched forward he put his arm around the girls waist drew her the demon princes down upon his lap she gave him an astounded glance like one suddenly waking from sleep why did you do that i dont want you to go why not gersen could not bring himself to speak zan zu sat passively if somewhat primly gersen noticed that there were tears in her eyes that her cheeks were wet gersen kissed her cheek navarth gave vent to a mad cachinnation never never does it end gersen put zan zu back on her chair but held his hand over hers what never will end he asked in an even voice i too have loved but what of that the time for love is past now there will be trouble of course do you not understand the sensitivity of viole falushe he is as strange and delicate as a fern frond he cannot bear deprivation it sets his teeth on edge and makes him ill this did not occur to me you have acted altogether wrongly scolded navarth his thoughts were totally for the girl you need only have followed her and there would have been viole falushe yes muttered gersen true true i now understand that he glowered at the wine goblet then back at the line of silhouettes someone was watching he could sense the attention there was trouble on the way he was not in optimum condition he had not trained in weeks additionally he was half drunk a man walking past seemed to slip he reeled into the table and upset wine into gersens lap he looked into gersens face with eyes the color of bone did you trip me you sneak ive a mind to spank you like a child gersen studied the man he had a slabsided face close cropped yellow hair a short neck as wide as his head his body was stocky and muscular the body of a man who spent much of his life on one of the heavy planets i dont believe i tripped you said gersen but sit down join us for a glass of wine ask your friend to join us as well the whiteeyed man paused to consider a moment he came to a decision i demand an apology certainly said gersen it was on the tip of my tongue if in any way i am responsible for causing you inconvenience i am i sorry this is not enough i despise foul baboons like yourself who the palace of love insult one then think to smirk themselves free of the conse quences this is your privilege said gersen despise whom you like but why not bring your friend over to join us we could find much to talk about you are from which world he raised his glass to drink the whiteeyed man struck down the glass i insist that you leave the premises you have offended me sufficiently gersen looked across the whiteeyed mans shoulder your friend comes in spite of your asinine braying the whiteeyed man turned to look gersen kicked at his knee hacked into the bulwark of a neck seizing one of the mans arms gersen heaved and sent him spinning across the dance floor the whiteeyed man bounced erect without effort and came back in a running crouch gersen pushed a chair into his face the whiteeyed man swept it aside while gersen struck him in the stomach this was ribbed with muscle and hard as oak the whiteeyed man hunched his shoulders jumped for gersen but four bouncers had appeared two propelled gersen to the rear entrance and ejected him two more escorted the whiteeyed man to the front entrance gersen stood disconsolately in the street the entire evening a botchery what had got into him the whiteeyed man might well be circling the building to find him gersen stepped back into the shadows after a moment he started cautiously around to the front at the corner waited the whiteeyed man dogs meat you kicked me you struck me it is my turn best that you go your way said gersen in a mild voice i am a dangerous man wtiat do you think of me the whiteeyed man approached gersen backed away in no mood for roughhousing he carried weapons but on earth killing was not taken lightly the white eyed man sidled forward gersens heel came in contact with a bucket he picked it up slung it into the mans face and was quickly around the corner the whiteeyed man came after him gersen held out his hand to display his projac see this i can kill you the whiteeyed man stood back teeth glinting in contempt gersen went to the front entrance of the celestial harmony cafe the whiteeyed man following at a distance of thirty feet tiif dfmon princes the table was vacant navarth and zan zu were gone the lounging figure at the railing lost among the others the whiteeyed man waited beside the building gersen re flected a moment then slowly as if in reverie he moved off down the boulevard and turned into a dark side street he waited a minute passed gersen slid twenty feet farther along to a more favorable position all the time watching the gap where street met boulevard but no one passed in front no one came to investigate gersen waited ten minutes watching both ways and presently craning his neck to peer up on the chance that his enemy was coming over the roofs at last he returned to the boulevard the botchery was complete the whiteeyed man the most immediate link with viole falushe had not bothered to pursue gersens ac quaintance seething with frustration gersen rode out boulevard castel vivence to the fitlmgasse the tug had departed the houseboat once more sound of hull rode dark and silent on the water gersen alighted from the cab went out to stand on the dock silence lights from dourrai glinted on the estuary gersen shook his head in mournful amusement what more could be expected from an evening with a mad poet and a girl from eridu he returned to the cab and was conveyed to the rembrandt hotel the girl i met in endu was kind beyond belief the hours that i spent with her were hours far too brief wtiere willows shade the river bank she urged that i recline she fed me figs and poured me full of pomegranate wine i told of force and time and space i told of hence and yonder i asked if she would come with me to know my worlds of wonder she clasped her knees her voice was soft it dazes me to ponder the blazing stars and tintamars the whirling ways you wander you are you and i am i and best that you return and i will stay in endu with all this yet to learn navarth at ten oclock the following morning gersen returned to the houseboat all was changed the sun was yellow and warm the sky shining blue with the blue of earth was necked here and there the dfmon princes with fairweather clouds navarth sat hunched on his foredeck sun ning himself gersen descended the ladder walked along the landing he stopped by the gangplank ahoy may i come aboard navarth slowly turned his head inspected gersen with the hooded yellow eyes of a sick chicken he shifted his gaze to watch a string of barges sliding silently along on jets of ionized water he spoke in an even voice i have no sympathy for persons of weak liver who raise their sails only to drift downwind gersen took the remark as implicit permission to board the boat mv shortcomings aside what eventuated navarth querulously brushed away the question we have strayed the quest the undertaking what quest what undertaking leads by a devious route first there is sunlight the road is broad and white but soon it narrows at the end is an awesome tragedy a thousand mindsplitting colors possibly the sunset if i were young once more how i would alter events i have been blown by winds like a bit of trash you will find it the same you failed to seize the occasion each chance comes a single time gersen found the remarks uninspiring all this to the side did you speak last night to viole falushe navarth raised a skinny hand in the air the palm cupped for ward tumult a reel of shapes angry faces flashing eyes a strug gle of passions i sat with a roaring in my ears what then of the girl i agree in every respect magnificent where is she who is she navarths attention became fixed upon an object in the water a white and gray seagull evidently he planned no meaningful re sponses gersen went on patiently wtiat of viole falushe how did vou know he would be at the celestial harmony cafe nothing could be simpler told him that we would be there wtien did you inform him navarth made a fretful movement your questions are tire some must i set my watch by yours must i wisely consult with you must i the question seemed simple enough the palace of love we live by different referents transpose if you like i can not navarth was plainly in a cantankerous mood gersen said soothingly well then for one reason or another we missed viole falushe last night how do you suggest that we find him now i make no more suggestions what is your concern with viole falushe you forget that i have already explained this to you to be sure well as to arranging a meeting this is no great problem we will invite him to a small entertainment a banquet perhaps something in navarths tone or perhaps the quick glittering glance which accompanied the words put gersen on his guard you think he would attend certainly if it were a carefully planned affair how can you be sure how do you know definitely that he is on earth navarth raised a monitory finger have you ever watched a cat walk through the grass at times it halts with one paw raised and calls out is there a reason to these sounds gersen could not trace the linkage of ideas he said patiently wtiat of this party or banquet whatever it is to be yes yes the party navarth had become interested now it must be exquisitely arranged and it will cost a great deal a million svu for one party one banquet who is to be invited the pop ulation of sumatra no a small affair of twenty guests but arrangements must be made and quickly i am a source an inspiration for viole fa lushe in sheer majesty he has excelled me but i will prove that in a smaller compass i am superior wtiat is a million svu i have dreamed away more than this in an hour very well said gersen you shall have your million a days income he reflected i will need a week a week is hardly enough but we dare delay no longer why not viole falushe returns to the palace of love how do you know navarth looked off across the water do you realize that a the demon princes crook of my finger disturbs the farthest star that every human thought disturbs the psychic parasphere this is the source of your knowledge psychic perturba tions as good a method as any other but now as to the party there are conditions art implies discipline the more excellent the art the more rigorous the discipline hence you must concede to cer tain limitations what are they first the money bring me a million svu immediately yes of course in a sack navarth gave an indifferent wave of the hand secondly i am in charge of arrangements you may not interfere is this all thirdly you must conduct yourself with restraint otherwise you will not be invited i would not care to miss this party said gersen but i too will make conditions first viole falushe must be present never fear as to that impossible to keep him away secondly you must identify him to me no need he will identify himself third i want to know how you plan to invite him how else i call him by telephone just as i call my other guests what is his number code he can be reached by coding sora gersen nodded very well i will bring you your money at once gersen returned to the rembrandt hotel where he had a reflective lunch how mad was navarth his spasms of lunacy alternated with periods of canny practicality both somehow conducing to na varths convenience the call code sora now navarth had yielded it with suspicious facility gersen could no longer re strain his curiosity he went to a nearby booth banked the lens touched the buttons the presentation appeared the outline of a startled human face a voice spoke who calls gersen frowned bent his head forward the voice spoke again who calls it was navarths voice gersen said i wish to speak to viole falushe the palace of love who calls one who wishes to make his acquaintance please leave your name and call number in due course you may receive a return call and gersen thought he heard a poorly suppressed chuckle thoughtfully he left the booth galling to be outwitted by a mad poet he went to the bank of vega called for and received a million svu in cash he packed the notes into a case returned by cab out boulevard castel vivence to the fitlmgasse as he alighted he saw zan zu the girl from eridu emerging from a fishmongers shop with a paper cornucopia full of fried smelt she wore her black skirt her hair was a tousle but some of the magic of two nights before still hung about her she went to sit on an old baulk and looking out across the estuary munched the fish gersen thought she appeared tired listless a trifle haggard he proceeded to the houseboat navarth took the money with a noncommittal grunt the party then seven days hence have you issued invitations not yet leave all to me viole falushe will be among the guests i presume you will call him at sora of course navarth nodded three times with great gravity where else and zan zu she is to come zan zu zan zu the girl from eridu oh that one it might not be wise the mans name was hollister hausredel his position registrar at the philidor bohus lyceum he was a man of early middleage with an almost total lack of distinguishing characteristics he wore modest gray and black and lived in one of the sluicht apartment towers with his wife and two small children gersen deciding that his business with hausredel would go best at a maximum distance from the school approached him as he left the tube escalator a hundred yards from his apartment building mr hausredel yes hausredel was somewhat startled i wonder if we might talk for a moment or two gersen in thk demon princks dicated a nearby coffee bar perhaps you would have a cup of coffee with me what do you want to talk about a matter concerning a service vou can do for me to vour profit the talk went without difficulty hausredel was more flexible than his superior dr willern ledinger on the following day hausredel met gersen at the coffee bar with a large paper enve lope here we are all went well you have the money gersen passed across an envelope hausredel opened the flap counted tested one or two of the notes with his fakemeter good i hope i have helped you as much as you have helped me and shaking gersens hand warmly he departed the coffee bar gersen opened the envelope he extracted two photographs copied from those in the school archives for the first time gersen saw the face ofvogel filschner it was a sullen face black eyebrows canted down over burning black eyes the mouth hung in a discon tented droop voge had not been a handsome boy his nose was long and lumpy his cheeks were puffy with hahy fat his black hair was overlong and even in the photograph seemed unclean a more striking contradiction to the popular image of violc falushe was hard to imagine but of course this was vogel filschner at the age of fifteen and many changes had undoubtedly taken place the other picture was that of jheral tiny a delightfully pretty girl her black hair glossy her mouth pursed as if she were restraining a mischievous secret gersen studied the picture at length it afforded him rather more perplexity than illumination inasmuch as the face in the photograph was almost exactly that of zan zu the girl from eridu thoughtfully gersen examined the remaining material in the envelope information regarding other members of vogel fil schners class with the present whereabouts when it was known gersen returned to the picture of jheral tinzy the coquetry was absent in the face of zan zu otherwise one was a replica of the other the resemblance could not be accidental gersen rode bv tube to station hedrick in ambeules and took the now familiar route up boulevard castel vivence the time was early evening sunset color still lingered along the estuary the houseboat was dark no one responded to gersens rapping he tested the button the door slid open the palace of love gersen entered the lights came aglow he went to navarths telescreen the code as he had expected was sora the crafty navarth to the side was an index gersen looked through the listings finding nothing of interest he scrutinized the wall the underside of the shelf the top molding of the telescreen on the chance that navarth might have noted down a number he did not care to entrust to his index but he found nothing from the shelf gersen took down an untidy portfolio containing ballads odes dithyrambs a growl for gruel the juices i have tramped i am a darting minstrel they pass drusillas dream castles in the clouds and the anxieties of those who live di rectly below by reason of falling objects and wastes gersen put the poems aside he inspected the bedrooms on the ceiling of the one occupied by navarth was the photograph of a naked woman twice lifesize arms high and outspread legs ex tended and stretched apart hair afloat as if she were engaged in a vigorous leaping calisthenic navarths wardrobe contained a fan tastic assortment of costumes of every style and color on a shelf were hats caps and helmets gersen explored the drawers and cab inets finding many unexpected objects but none which seemed to bear upon the matter at hand there were two other small bedrooms furnished in a rather spartan manner one of these was pervaded with faint sweet per fume violet or lilac in the other was a desk and here by a window overlooking the estuary navarth evidently created his poetry the desk was crammed with notes names apostrophes and allusions a discouraging volume of material which gersen did not even trou ble to explore he returned to the main saloon and pouring himself a glass of navarths fine moscato dimmed the lights and settled into the most comfortable chair an hour passed the last traces of afterglow departed the sky the lights of dourrai glistened on the waves a dark shape became visible a hundred yards offshore a small boat it approached the houseboat there was the rattle of oars being shipped and footsteps on the deck the door slid back zan zu entered the halfdark saloon she gasped in fear and sprang back gersen caught her arm wait dont run away ive been wait ing to talk to you zan zu relaxed and came into the saloon gersen turned up if dfvn princes the lights zan zu sat warily on the edge of a bench onight she wore black trousers a dark blue acket her hair was tied back with black ribbon her face was white and wan gersen looked at her a moment re you hungry she nodded come along then in a nearby restaurant she ate with an appetite which nullified gersens doubts as to the state of her health navarth calls you zan zu is that your name no what is your name i dont know i dont think i have a name what no name everyone has a name i dont where do you live with navarth yes for as long as i remember and he has never told you your name he has called me by many names said zan zu somewhat ruefully i rather like not having a name i am anyone i wish to be wtio would you like most to be she flashed gersen a sardonic glance gave her shoulders a shrug hardly a talkative girl thought gersen she asked a sudden question why are you interested in me for various reasons some complicated some simple to begin with youre a pretty girl zan zu considered the statement a moment do you think so indeed hasnt anyone else told ou as much no strange thought gersen talk to very few men or women navarth tells me there is danger what kind of danger slavers i dont care to be a slave understandable arent you afraid oi me a little gersen signaled a waiter after consultation he ordered a large piece of cherry torte floating in whipped cream which was set be fore zan zu from endu the palace of love well then said gersen have you been to school not a great deal gersen learned that navarth had taken her here and there to odd corners of the world remote villages and islands gray cities of the north resorts of smkiang the sahara sea the levant there had been an occasional tutor seasons at some what unusual schools much reading of navarths books not a very orthodox education gersen remarked it suits me well enough and navarth what is his relationship to you i dont know he has always been there sometimes he is she hesitated sometimes he is kind other times he seems to hate me i dont understand but then i am not particularly inter ested navarth is navarth hes never mentioned your parents never havent you asked him oh yes several times when he is sober he becomes flam boyant aphrodite rose from seafoam lilith isas the sister of an ancient god arremce sprang to life when lightning struck a rose tree and i may select a source at my own discretion gersen listened surprised and amused wtien navarth is drunk or when he is exalted with poetry he tells me more but perhaps it is less he frightens me he speaks of the journey i ask journey where and he wont say but it must be something terrible i dont want to go she fell silent the conversation so gersen noticed had not diminished the gusto with which she attacked the torte has he ever mentioned a man named viole falushe perhaps i have not listened vogel filschner no who are these men the same man using different names do you remember at the celestial harmony cafe the man who stood by the railing zan zu looked down into her coffee cup gave a slow thoughtful nod who was he i dont know why do you ask because you started to go to him yes i know why if you dont know him the demon princes the girl twisted the cup back and forth watching the swirls of black liquid its hard to explain i knew he was watching me he wanted me to come navarth had brought me there and you were there as if everyone wanted me to go to him as if i were some thing to be sacrificed i was dizzy the room was unsteady perhaps i had drunk too much wine but i wanted to have it all over with if this were mv fate i would know but you wouldnt let me go i remember this much and i she stopped and took her hands away from the coffee cup anyway i know you mean me no harm gersen said nothing zan zu asked tentatively do you no are you finished they returned to the houseboat which was as they had left it where is navarth gersen asked he prepares for his party he is tremendously excited since you have come all is different and after i left the celestial harmony cafe the other night what happened zan zu frowned there was talk it seems there were lights in my eyes orange and green blurs the man came to the table and stood looking down at me he spoke to navarth did you look at him no i dont think so what did he say to navarth zan zu shook her head there was a sound in my ears like rushing water or the roar of the wind i didnt hear the man touched my shoulder and after that what zan zu grimaced i dont remember i cant remember she was drunk cried out a voice navarth rushed into the saloon carefully drunk what are you doing aboard my private houseboat i came to learn how you are spending my money all is as before now depart at once come come said cersen patiently this is a cavalier tone to take with the man who repaired your houseboat after first stoving it in bah has there ever been an act to equal it i understand that in your youth you contrived a few outrages of your own the palace of love in my youth sputtered navarth i have contrived outrages all my life what of the party it is to be a poetic episode an exercise in experiential art i think it best that you do not attend this particular party as wtiat im paying for it if i dont come give me back my money navarth flung himself petulantly into a chair i expected you to take this line im afraid so where is the party to be held we meet at the village kussines twenty miles to the east the rendezvous is precisely at the hour of two in the afternoon in front of the inn you must wear harlequinade and a domino viole falushe is to come indeed indeed have i not made all clear not altogether all are to wear dominoes naturally how will i recognize viole falushe what a question to ask how can he hide black radiation hangs about him he exudes a dread sensation these qualities may be obvious said gersen still how else may he be identified you must determine this at the time at the moment i do not know myself at ten minutes before the appointed hour gersen parked his rented air car in a meadow on the outskirts of kussines and alighted a cloak concealed the harlequinade he carried the domino in his pocket the afternoon was soft and sunny fragrant with the exhalations of autumn navarth could hardly have hoped for a finer day thought gersen he checked his garments carefully the harle quinade offered little scope for concealment but gersen had made the best of the situation inserted horizontally into his belt was a blade of thin keen glass the buckle serving as a handle under his left arm hung a projac in his right sleeve was poison thus encum bered gersen swept his cloak about him and marched into the village a collection of ancient black iron and meltstone structures on the shore of a small lake the setting was bucolic and charming almost medieval the inn perhaps the newest structure of the vil lage was at least four hundred years old as gersen approached a young man in gray and black stepped forward for the afternoon party sir gersen nodded and was led to a dock at the edge of the lake where a canopied boat awaited domino please said the young man in uniform gersen donned the mask stepped aboard the boat and was conveyed to the opposite shore it seemed that he was one of the last to arrive at a semicircular buffet stood perhaps twenty other guests all selfconscious in their costumes one who could only be navarth came forward divested gersen of his cloak while we wait taste this vintage it is supple and light and will amuse you gersen took the wine and stepped aside twenty men and the palace of love women which was viole falushe if he were present he was not readily apparent a slender young woman stood stiffly nearby hold ing her goblet as if it contained vinegar navarth had allowed zan zu to the party after all thought gersen or dragooned her into coming to judge by her attitude he counted ten men eleven women if parity of sexes were to be observed there still remained at least one man to arrive even as gersen counted the white canopied punt drifted into the dock a man stepped ashore he was tall lean his manner combined indolent ease with taut wariness gersen inspected him carefully if this were not viole falushe he must be considered the most likely candidate the man slowly ap proached the group navarth hurried forward with a crouch that was almost servile and took the cloak which the man tossed to him with the cloak hung on its peg a goblet of wine in the newcomers hand navarths ebullience returned he waved his arms walked back and forth with long springing strides friends and guests all are now arrived a chosen group of nymphs and undergods poets and philosophers notice as we stand here in the meadow our patterns of orange and red and black and red we contrive an un conscious pavan we are performers participants and spectators at the same time the frame within which spontaneity is confined the theme so to speak is that which i have ordained the varia tions and intricacies counterplay and development is our mutual concern we must be subtle and free carefully reckless at all times consonant our figures must never leave the chord navarth held his goblet up to a shaft of sunlight drank with a grand flourish then pointed dramatically through the trees follow me fifty yards away was a charabanc with a tasselled yellow canopy the sides enameled in red orange and green benches cushioned in bright orange plush ran along the sides in the center kneeling mar ble satyrs supported a marble slab on which were dozens of bottles of every size shape and color all containing the same soft wine the guests climbed aboard the charabanc slid off silent and easy on its repulsion skids through a beautiful park drifted the charabanc magnificent vistas opened on all sides the guests gradually discarded restraint there was conversation and laughter but for the most part all were content to sip the wine and enjoy the autumn scenery gersen scrutinized each man in turn the last man to arrive still seemed the most likely candidate for the identity of viole fa the dimon princes lushe gersen thought of him as possibility no but at least four others were tall lean dark and composed possibilities no no no and no the charabanc halted the group stepped down into a meadow sprinkled with purple and white asters navarth hopping and skip ping like a young goat led the group under a grove ot tall trees the time was now about three oclock afternoon sunlight slanted through the masses of golden leaves to play upon a great nig of tan and golden silk with a border of graygreens and blues beyond stood a silken pavilion supported by white spiral poles spaced around the rug were twentytwo tall peacocktail chairs beside each stood an antique tabouret of ebony inlaid with mother ofpearl and cinnabar with a vermilion bowl of crystallized spice on each working by some mysterious rationale navarth arranged his guests in the splendid chairs gersen found himself at one end of the rug with zan zu several chairs distant and the five possi bilities at the far side from somewhere came music or more ac curately nearmusic a succession of wry quiet chords sometimes so soft as to be unheard sometimes so complex as to be equivocal and perplexing never completing or fulfilling a progression always of a haunting sweetness navarth took his own place and all sat quietly from the pa vilion came ten young girls naked but for golden slippers and yellow roses over their ears they bore trays on which were goblets of heavy green glass containing the same delicate wine as before navarth remained in his chair the other guests were content to do likewise sundrenched yellow leaves floated down to the golden rug an aromatic odor hung in the air gersen sipped his wine cautiously he could not afford to be lulled soothed close at hand was viole falushe a situation for which he had paid a million svu the sly navarth had not kept the letter of his promise where was the aura of black radiation navarth had mentioned it seemed to hang heaviest around possibilities no no and no but in this regard gersen was disinclined to trust his para psychic powers a tension an expectancy began to be felt navarth sat crouched in the chair as if already bemused the naked girls dappled by sunlight and leafshadow poured wine moving slowly as if walking under water navarth lifted his head as if hearing a voice or a tar off sound he spoke in an exultant voice and the vagrant chords the palace of love seemed to match themselves to the rhythm of his speech creating music some here have known emotion in many phases no one can know every emotion for these are both infinite and fugitive some here are unaware untouched unexplored and know it not see me i am navarth called the mad poet but is not every poet mad it is inevitable his nerves are conductive and transport un containable gushes of energy he fears how he fears he feels the movement of time between his fingers it is a warm pulsing as if he grasped an exposed artery at a sound a distant laugh a ripple of water a gust of wind he becomes sick and faints because never in all the extent of time can this sound this ripple this gust recur here is the deafening tragedy of the journey which we all under take would the mad poet want it to be different never exulting never desperate never clasping life against his bare nerves na varth leapt to his feet and danced a jig all here are mad poets if you would eat the delicacies of the world await if you would re flect sit in your chairs and watch the fall of the leaves notice how slow is their motion here time has slowed on our behalf if you would exalt yourself this magnificent vintage never cloys nor stu pefies if you would explore erotic proximities or middle distances or indistinct horizons bowers and dells surround us his voice descended an octave the chords became measured and slow there can be no light without shade no sound without silence exultation skips along the verge of pain i am the mad poet i am life hence by the inevitable consequence death is here as well but where life cries out its meanings death sits quiet look then among the masks and navarth pointed from one silent harlequin to another around the circle death is here death watches life it is not witless aimless death it is death with a snuff cap intent on a single candle so do not fear unless you have cause to fear navarth turned his head listen from far away came the merry sound of music it grew louder and louder still and into the glade marched four musicians one with castanets one with guitar and two fiddlers and they played the most impelling and merry of jigs enough to set the pulses racing suddenly they stopped short in their music the castanet player brought forth a flute and now the music was of a heart breaking melancholy and playing in this fashion they moved off through the trees and presently were lost to hearing the soft in tiif demon princes decisive chords went on as before without beginning or end as easy and natural as breathing gersen had become uneasy circumstances were moving be yond his control in this harlequinade he felt inept was this an other ofnavarths craftv plovs were viole falushe to stand before him now and announce himself gersen could never act the au tumn air was heavy with haze the wine had made him maudlin he could never spill blood on the magnificent rug of tawny tan and gold nor even on the carpet of golden leaves beyond gersen leaned back in his chair amused and disgusted with himself very well then for the moment he would sit and reflect some of the other guests were stirring perhaps navarths talk of death had chilled them for they moved tentatively and carefully gersen wondered to whom navarth had referred in his talk of death the girls moved sedately along the line of chairs pouring wine as one bent near gersen he caught the scent of her yellow rose straightening she smiled at him and passed on to the next guest gersen drank the wine he leaned back in the chair even if he had become detached and passionless he could yet speculate cer tain of the guests had risen to their feet and leaving their high backed chairs they mingled and talked in soft husky voices possibility no stood brooding possibility no stared fixedly at zan zu possibility no like gersen sprawled in his chair pos sibilities no and no were among those talking gersen looked toward navarth what next navarths inten tion must extend beyond the instant what more had he planned gersen called to him navarth turned aside reluctantly gersen asked is viole falushe here tish exclaimed navarth you are a monomaniac i have been told as much before well is he here i invited twentyone guests counting myself twentytwo are present viole falushe is here wwiishe i dont know what you dont know gersen sat upright aroused from his lethargy by navarths doubledealing we must have no mis understanding navarth you accepted a million svu from me agreeing to fulfill certain conditions and i have done so snapped navarth the simple truth is the paiacv of love that i do not know in what semblance viole falushe currently walks i knew the boy vogel pilschner well viole falushe has al tered his face and his manner he might be one of three or four unless i were to unmask this group send away those i recognized until one remained i could not give you viole falushe vry well this we shall do navarth wuld not submit my life might well be slid from my body by one route or another i object to this i am a mad poet not a lummox immaterial this is how we will act be so kind as to summon your candidates into the pavilion no no croaked navarth it is impossible there is an easier way watch the girl he will go to her and then you will know a half dozen might go to her then claim her only one man would challenge you and if no one challenges navarth held out his arms what can you lose both turned to look toward the girl gersen said wtiat can i lose indeed what is her relationship to you she is the daughter of an old friend declared navarth suavely she is in effect my ward i have been at pains to nurture her and bring her nicely to maturity and this now accomplished you offer her here and there to passing strangers the conversation becomes tiresome said navarth look a man approaches the girl gersen swung around possibility no had approached zan zu and was talking in a manner unmistakably ardent zan zu lis tened politely as in the celestial i larmony cafe gersen felt a surge of emotion lust jealousy protective instinct whatever the nature of the urge it compelled him to step forward and join the two you are enjoying the party gersen asked with factitious goodfellowship a wonderful day for such an outing navarth is a magnificent host still he has introduced no one to no one what is your name possibility no answered courteously navarth doubtless has good reason for the neglect best that we do not divulge our iden tities thk demon princes sensible said gersen he turned to zan zu still what is your opinion i have no identity to divulge possibility no suggested why not approach navarth and inquire his thoughts on the subject i think not navarth would become confused he has pro pounded a fallacy he seems to advocate intimate relationships be tween walking costumes is this feasible i doubt it certainly not at the level of intensity navarth would insist upon quite so quite so said possibility no be a good fellow and leave us to ourselves the young lady and i were enjoying a private discussion my apologies for interrupting you but the young lady and i already had planned to gather flowers from the meadow you are mistaken said possibility no when all wear harlequinade error is easy if there has been an error it is for the best as i prefer this delightful young flowerpicker to the last be so good as to excuse us possibility no was amiability itself really my good fellow your facetiousness has run its course surely you must see that you are intruding i think not in a party of this sort where experience is to be clasped to the naked nerves where death walks there is wisdom in flexibility notice the woman yonder she appears loquacious and prepared to discuss every subject in your repertory wtly not join her and chat away to your hearts content but it is you she admires said possibility no brusquely be off with you gersen turned to zan zu apparently you must make the choice conversation or wildflowers zan zu hesitated looking from one to the other possibility no fixed her with a gaze of burning intensity choose if indeed there is a choice between this lout and myself choose but choose carefully zan zu demurely turned to gersen let us pick flowers possibility no stared looked away toward navarth as if to call upon him to intercede then thought better of it and walked away zan zu asked are you really anxious to pick wildflowers the pafsc of imf you know who i am of course i dont care to pick wildflowers unless you do oh what then do you want of me gersen found the question hard to answer i do not know myself zan zu took his arm let us go to look for flowers and per haps we will find out gersen looked around the group possibility no watched from a distance possibilities no and no appeared to pay them no heed they started off through the trees zan zu leaning on his arm gersen put his arm around her waist she sighed possibility no gave a quick jerk of the shoulders and by this motion seemed to cast off restraint he came after gersen with soft portentous strides in his hand he carried a small weapon behind gersen saw in a nearinstantaneous glimpse stood navarth look ing after them his posture a curious superimposition of shame on glee gersen pushed zan zu to the ground ducked behind a tree possibility no halted he turned toward zan zu and to gersens shocked amazement pointed his weapon gersen leapt from behind the tree and struck the mans arm the weapon threw a sear of energy into the ground the two confronted each other eyes blaz ing with mutual hate a shrill blast of whistle from the forest came the thud of heavy feet gendarmes swarmed forth a dozen or more urged by a lieutenant in a golden helmet and a furious old man in brocaded gray navarth stepped forward haughtily what is the meaning of this intrusion the old man who was short and overweight bounded torward to shake his fist what the devil are you up to trespassing upon my private property you are a jackanapes and these naked girls an absolute scandal in a stern voice navarth demanded of the lieutenant wtio is this old rogue what right does he have to intrude upon a private party now the old man stepping forward discerned the rug and went pale behold he whispered huskily my priceless silk sik kim nig spread out for these rascals to cavort upon and my chairs oh my precious bahadurs wtiat else have they stolen the demon princfs this is balderdash stormed navarth i have rented these premises and hired the furniture the owner is baron caspar heaulmes who is at a samtonum for his health i am baron caspar heaulmes cried the old man i do not know your name sir behind that ridiculous mask but i perceive you to be a blackguard lieutenant do your duty take them all away i insist on the fullest investigation navarth threw his hands into the air and argued the case from a dozen viewpoints but the lieutenant was inexorable i fear i must take all into custody baron heaulmes is making a formal com plaint gersen standing to the side had been watching with great in terest simultaneously noting the movements of possibilities no no no whichever was viole falushe and it would seem to be possibility no he would be sweating heavily at this mo ment once he were arrested and taken into court his identity must become known possibility no stood dour and dismal possibility no was carefully assessing the situation looking this way and that possi bility no seemed unconcerned even amused the lieutenant by this time had seized navarth charging him with trespass theft offenses against public morality and simple as sault the latter arising from his attempt to kick baron heaulmes the remaining gendarmes now commenced to herd the guests to ward a pair of carcelwagons which had descended to the meadow possibility no loitered at the edge of the group and taking ad vantage of navarths obstreperous behavior slipped behind a tree gersen raised up a shout a pair of gendarmes looked around bawled peremptory orders and marched forward to conduct pos sibility no to the carcelwagons possibility no jumped back among the trees when the gendarmes ran m pursuit there came a dire flash of radiation once twice and two men lay dead possi bility no sprinted away through the forest and was lost to view gersen gave chase but halted after a hundred yards fearing am bush shedding his mask he ran to the semicircular buffet beside the pond where he found and donned his cloak the punt ferried him across the lake to the outskirts of kussmes five minutes later he reached his air car and took it aloft he hovered several minutes searching the air space if possibility no the palace of lovl had arrived by air car he must likewise be taking himself aloft and also thought gersen patrol craft would be converging on the scene of the murders one man m harlequinade looked much like another the sooner he was gone the better and gersen flew full speed back toward rolingshaven from the rolingshaven mundus kussines september two agents of the county gendarmery this afternoon were murdered by a guest at a mysterious orgy on the estate of baron caspar heaul mes at kussines in the confusion attendant upon the violence the murderer made good a temporary escape and is believed to be hiding in the woods his name has not yet been made public host and ringleader at the bacchanalian fete was the notorious poet and freethinker navarth whose esca pades have long edified the citizens of rolingshaven the article goes on to describe the circumstances of the murder the names of the persons taken into custody are listed from the rolingshaven mzmdus rolingshaven october victim of an inexplicable attack was lan kelly of london who last night was waylaid in the bissgasse and viciously beaten to death there is no clue as to the identity of his assailant and no apparent motive ketly figured in the news two days ago as a guest at the poet navarths fantastic party on the estate of baron caspar heaulmes police are work the palace of love ing on the theory that the two circumstances are con nected article for cosmopolis viole falushr by navarth part i the boy notorious as much for his fascinating palace of love as for the ghastly score of his crimes is viole falushe the demon prince who is he what is he i perhaps better than anyone alive am able to calculate his motives and an alyze his acts i have little knowledge of the man as he is today if he were to pass me on the street i would not recognize him but i can say this much judging by viole falushe as a youth i find the popular concept of viole fa lushe which is to say a man handsome elegant gay ro mantic impossible to credit the notion is in fact startling and ludicrous i first met viole falushe when he was fourteen his name was then vogel filschner if the man resembles the boy his celebrated amours can only have been achieved through duress or drugs as all know i am jealous of my reputation for dispassionate candor and to this end inter viewed all the women who as girls knew vogel filschner well i withhold their names for obvious reasons repre sentative comments a boy preoccupied with every sort of nastiness vogel was utterly repellent though there were boys far uglier than he in our class four years i knew him and instead of learning to take pains with himself he became worse i could never bear to sit next to vogel he smelled badly as if he never changed his socks or his underwear im sure he never washed his hands and possibly never bathed the demon princes vogel filschner i suppose it was not all his fault his mother must have been a sloven he had disgusting per sonal habits such as picking his nose and examining the yield making queer gulping noises and above all smelling these are representative remarks indeed some of the milder comments i am a man above all fair and judicious hence i quote none of the more extravagant anecdotes let me describe vogel filschner as i knew him he was tall and arachnid with spindly legs and an unhealthy round belly to complete the somewhat spiderlike illusion were his round cheeks and pink proboscis of a nose to his credit he admired my poetry though i fear that vogel distorted my doctrines beyond recognition i preach augmented ex istence vogel wanted me to approve his solipsistic ruth lessness the first occasion i was approached by vogel filschner was at the time of my celebrated contretemps with dame amelie pallemontdalhouse in connection with my spon sorship of her daughter earline which of course is a fas cinating tale in itself in any event vogel appeared one morning with some wretched doggerel he had written it seems that vogels juices were flowing that he was in love with a pretty girl who needless to say was far from flattered by the compliment the article continued for several pages on october navarth having paid exemplary damages of svu to baron caspar heaulmes was discharged from the court which likewise dismissed charges against navarths guests gersen met navarth on the mall in front of the justice courts navarth at first made as if he would pass without deigning to rec ognize gersen but gersen finally was able to divert him to the table of a nearby cafe justice bah navarth made a grimace toward the courts think of it money i must pay that vindictive and sanctimonious unmentionable he should have indemnified me did he not disrupt the party what did he hope to gain running forth from the forest like that navarth paused to moisten his throat with the beer ger the paiacv w love sen had ordered it is enough to turn a man sour he set the mug down with a thump and turned a yellow glance toward gersen what do you want of me now another exercise in bathos i warn you i will not be so malleable a second time gersen displayed the newspaper articles dealing with the event navarth refused to look at them a wretched lot of nonsense sheer scurrility you journalists are all alike i notice that yesterday a certain lan kelly was murdered yes poor kelly did you come to the arraignment no then you missed your chance because among the crowd was viole falushe he is the most sensitive of men and cannot forget an injury lan kelly was unlucky enough to resemble you in size and manner navarth shook his head ruefully ah that vogel he detests frustration as a bee sting do the police know the murderer is viole falushe i told them he was a man i met in a bar what else could i if sayr gersen had no reply to make he indicated the article once more twenty names are listed which refers to zan zu navarth made a contemptuous gesture toward the article se lect as you like one is as accurate as the next one of these names must refer to her said gersen which how should i know what name she chooses to supply the police i believe i will drink more beer the argument has parched my throat i see here a drusilla wavles age eighteen is this she quite possibly possibly indeed and this is her name merciful kalzibah must she own a name a name is a weight a chain to a set of uncontrolled circumstances to own no name is to own freedom are you so stolid then that you cannot imagine a person without a name she is what one chooses to call her strange said gersen she exactly resembles the jheral tinzy of thirty years ago navarth jerked back in his chair how do you know this i have not been idle for example i have produced this ger sen produced a dummy cosmopous from the cover looked the face of young vogel filschner superimposed upon the outline of a tall thk demon princes ominous gray figure below was the caption the young viole fa lushe vogel filschner as i knew him by navarth navarth seized the dummy read the article aghast he raised his hands to his head hell kill us all hell drown us in dog vomit hell grow trees in our ears the article seems balanced and judicious said gersen cer tainly he can take no offense at facts navarth read farther and went into a new paroxysm of dismay you have signed my name i never wrote all that its all true the more so when is this to be published in a week or two impossible i forbid it in that case return me the money i lent you that you might finance your party lent navarth was shocked anew that was no loan you paid me you hired me to produce a party at which viole falushe would be present you did neither baron heaulmes it is true truncated your party but this is no affair of mine and where was viole falushe you can point to the murderer but this means nothing to me please return the money i cannot i have spent money like water and baron heaulmes demanded his pound of flesh well return me the nine hundred thousand svu you have left wtiat i have no such sum on hand perhaps we can set aside a portion as your payment for this article but no no the article must not be published best that we have a complete understanding said gersen you have not told me all for which i am grateful you have published the rest na varth kneaded his forehead these have been terrible days have you no pity for poor old navarth gersen laughed you plotted to get me killed you knew that viole falushe would attempt to possess drusilla wayles or zan zu whatever her name you knew that i would not allow it lan kelly paid his life in my place the pal ice of love no no nothing like that i hoped you would kill viole fa lushe youre a devious villain what of drusilla how was she to fare did you consider her i consider nothing said navarth huskily i cannot allow my self to ponder if i lifted the partition between my two brains for so much as an instant tell me what you know with extreme reluctance navarth obeyed i must go back to vogel filschner once more when he kidnaped the choral society jheral tinzy escaped that you know but she was the cause of the crime and the parents of the other girls blamed her it became very hard very rough there were threats names called in public navarth had come under similar attack one day he proposed to jheral tinzv that they run away together jheral bitter and dis illusioned was in a mood for anything they went to corfu where they spent three years and every day navarth loved jheral tinzy more ardently than the day previous one terrible day vogel filschner appeared at the door of their little villa he was no longer the old vogel though his appearance was much the same he stood more erect but the most striking change was his new personality he had become hard sure firm his eves were bright his voice assured evildoing clearly was good for him vogel made a great show of amity to navarth past is past jheral tinzy i want nothing from her she has given herself to you she is sullied i am fastidious in this respect i take no woman fresh from another mans use be assured she never will know an iota of my love she should have waited yes she should have waited because she miht have known i would return but now my love for jheral tinzy is gone navarth was somewhat reassured he brought out a bottle they sat in the garden ate oranges drank ouzo navarth became very drunk and fell asleep wtien he awoke vogel filschner was gone jheral tinzy was gone as well a day later vogel filchner reappeared navarth was in a frenzy where is she wtiat have you done with her she is well and safe what of your promise you told me you had no more love for her the df mon princes this is true the promise shall be kept jheral will never know my love nor the love of any other man do you underestimate my emotion poec love can turn to hate in a flicker of time jheral will ser e and serve well she would not gratify my love but she will appease my hate navarth threw himself at vogel filschner but vogel vaulted over the wall and navarth was left alone nine years later vole falushe made contact with navarth b telescreen but now his face was blanked navarth heard only his voice navarth asked for the return of jheral tmzy and viole fa lushe agreed two days later a child three years old was brought to navarth viole falushe called again i have done as i promised you have jheral tmzy again ts it her daughter it is jheral tmzy this is all you need know i put her into your charge keep her nurture her guard her see that she remains undefiled for one day i will return for her the screen went dead navarth turned to inspect the girl even now he could see her resemblance to jheral what to do navarth considered the child with mingled emotion he could regard her neither as a daughter nor as a manifestation of his former love he felt antag onism there would always be a bittersweet ambiguity in their re lationship for navarth was unable to love impersonally the object of his love must relate to himself navarth exemplified his contradicting impulses in his rearing of the girl he fed her provided shelter both of the most casual and desultory sort otherwise the girl was independent she became moody and uncommunicative she made no friends and presently gave up asking questions as she matured her resemblance to jhera tmzy became ever more striking she was jheral tmzy indeed and her presence tor mented navarth with memories of the past a dozen years passed but viole falushe had made no appear ance still navarth never dared hope that viole falushe had for gotten indeed he became ever more obsessed with the certainty that viole falushe would presently arrive and take the girl away he tried from time to time to acquaint the girl with the danger represented by viole falushe but his approach varied with his mood and he was never sure that she understood him he at tempted to seclude her a task rendered difficult by the girls un the palace of love predictable habits and he took her off to remote corners of the earth when the girl was sixteen they lived in edmonton canada the goal of hordes of pilgrims who came to gaze upon the sacred shin navarth reasoned that here among the interminable festivals processions and sacerdotal rites they might well live unnoticed but navarth was wrong viole falushe by some means knew his whereabouts one night the telescreen lit up to show a tall figure standing against a flashing blue background which obscured his fea tures navarth nevertheless recognized viole falushe and despon dently called out show to the telescreen well navarth said viole falushe what do you do m the holy city have you become a devout kalziban that you live al most in the shadow of the shin i study muttered navarth i derive a sense of purpose from the pervasive zeal and what of the girp i refer to jheral she is well i trust she was in fair condition last evening i havent seen her since viole falushe stared fixedly at navarth with only the glitter of his eyes giving dimension to his silhouette is she pure how would i know demanded navarth crossly i cant watch her day and night in any event what affair is it of yours if anything the intensity of viole falushes glance increased it is my affair in all respects to such a degree that you would never imagine your language is extravagant sniffed navarth i can hardly believe you to be serious viole falushe laughed softly someday you will visit the palace of love old navarth someday you will be my guest not i declared navarth i am a new antaeus never may i detach my toe from earth if necessary i will fall flat on my face and cling with both hands well then summon the girl call jheral before the screen so that i may see her an odd note had entered viole falushes voice sweetness and tenderness burdened with an almost insupportable rage how can i call her when i dont know her whereabouts she may be prowling the streets or canoeing on the lake or lying in someones bed the demon princes a hoarse sound interrupted navarth but viole falushes voice was mild never say that old navarth she was given into your care i intended that you give her proper instruction have you done so i suspect not the best instruction is living itself declared navarth bluffly i am no pedant as you well know there was a moments silence then viole falushe said do you know why i put the girl in your care my own motivations confuse me said navarth how should i know yours i will tell you because you know me well you know what i require without explicit instructions navarth blinked i had not considered the matter in this light then old navarth you are remiss i have heard this accusation a hundred times but now you know what i expect i hope you will repair your neglect the screen went dead navarth in a fury of frustration and resentment went striding out along the great nave that avenue extending from the plaza of beatitudes to the temple of the shin but the press of pilgrims irked him and he took refuge in a tea house where he drank four cups of strong tea before he was suf ficiently composed to think specifically navarth wondered what did viole falushe expect he had a romantic interest in the girl he wanted her inculcated preconditioned receptive navarth could not restrain a wild cackle of mirth which aroused surprised glances from the other patrons of the teahouse most of them blackclad pilgrims viole falushe wanted him to make the girl conscious of the great honor which awaited her he wanted her preconditioned pre disposed already fervent the pilgrims fresh from ceremonies at the temple were regarding him with suspicion navarth jumped to his feet and departed the tearoom there was no further reason to remain in edmonton as soon as possible he took the girl back to rolingshaven once or twice he mentioned viole falushe to the girl in a tone of dejection for now he had come to think of the girl as doomed to such effect that on one occasion the girl ran away fortuitously the event occurred immediately before one of viole falushes visits the palace of love to earth when he telephoned navarth demanding to see the girl navarth was forced to blurt forth the truth viole falushe spoke in a mild voice best that she be found navarth but navarth made no attempt to find the girl until he was sure viole falushe had departed from earth here gersen interposed a question how could you be sure navarth attempted to evade the question but finally admitted that viole falushe during his visits to earth could be telephoned at a particular code number then you could call him now yes yes of course snapped navarth if i wanted to do so which i do not he continued his story but now he became cau tious using many flamboyant gestures shirting his yellow glance all around with only an occasional brief flicker for gersen it seemed that when gersen appeared on the scene navarth sensed that here might be a weapon to be used against viole fa lushe with the utmost caution committing no overt acts always leaving himself lines of retreat navarth tried to arrange for the discomfiture or destruction of viole falushe events however superseded his plans and now quavered navarth pointing a long finger at the cos mopolis dummy this you believe viole falushe would react unfavorably to the ar ticle indeed indeed he is the least forgiving of men it is the key to his soul perhaps then we had best discuss the article with viole falushe himself what benefit can derive from that he will merely have more time to generate a suitable response gersen pondered well then it seems that we had best publish the article in its present form no no cried navarth have not made all clear he would punish us in equivalence to his annoyance and he uses a subjective judgment this article would offend him to an unprecedented fury he hates his childhood he only comes to ambeules to gloat and work mischief on his old enemies do you know what happened to rudolph radgo who jeered at vogel filschners pimples rudolph radgos face is a garden of carbuncles through sarkovy poison there was maria who moved her seat because vogels rheums and snivelings upset her maria now lacks all trace of a nose twice she the demon princes has had grafts twice she has suffered the loss of her new member she is not to have a nose for all her life so you see it is not wise to offend viole falushe navarth craned his neck what are you writing this is interesting new material i am incorporating it into the article navarth threw his hands up so wildly that his chair almost over turned have you no prudence perhaps if we discussed the article with viole falushe he might authorize its publication its you who are mad not i we can only try very well croaked navarth i have no choice but i warn you i disavow all connection with the article as you wish shall we make our call here or at the house boat at the houseboat they left the plaza rode the tube to ambeules and were con veyed to the fitlingasse by surface wagon the houseboat floated serene and quiet on the estuary where is the girl asked gersen zan zu drusilla whatever her name navarth refused to answer gersens question so he implied was like asking the color of the wind he hopped on down the ladder jumped aboard the boat and with a desperate tragic ges ture flung wide the door he stalked to the telescreen pushed buttons and spoke a muffled activating word the presentation sprang to life a single frail lavender flower navarth turned to look at gersen he is available when off earth the pattern is blue they waited from the telescreen came a wisp of tender mel ody then after a moment or two a voice ah navarth my ancient companion with a friend yes an urgent matter this is mr henry lucas representing cosmopolis magazine a journal with an honored tradition but have we not met there is about you a disturbing familiarity i was on sarkovy recently said gersen as i recall your name was in the air a miasmic planet sarkovy nevertheless one with a certain macabre beauty the palace of love navarth spoke i have had a misunderstanding with mr lucas and i wish specifically to disavow responsibility for his actions my dear navarth you alarm me mr lucas is surely a man of courtesy you shall see as navarth has mentioned i work for cosmopolis said gersen in fact i am a senior official one of our writers prepared a rather sensational article i suspect the writer of overenthusiasm and therefore checked with navarth who reinforced my doubts it seems that the writer came upon navarth in an exalted mood and on the basis of a casual word he went to enormous lengths of research and produced the article ah yes the article you have it with you gersen displayed the dummy it is included here i insisted on checking the facts apparently to good avail navarth insists that our writer took the most extreme liberties he feels that in all fair ness you should be allowed to authenticate the article before pub lication sound notion navarth well then allow me to examine this alarming effusion im sure it cant be all that grim gersen slipped the magazine into the transcription rack viole falushe read from time to time he made sudden apparently in voluntary noises hisses between the teeth small throaty sounds turn the page please his voice was light and mild presently he said yes i have finished there was a moments silence then he spoke again and now the voice superficially jocular rang with a tinny overtone navarth you have been singularly reckless even for an exhilarated poet bah muttered navarth did i not disassociate myself from this entire farrago not completely i notice matters which are magnified and dis torted in a manner possible only to a mad poet you have been indiscreet navarth said bravely candor is never indiscreet truth which is to say the reflection of life is beautiful beauty is in the eye of the beholder said viole falushe i for one find little beauty in this abusive article mr lucas is quite correct in seeking my reaction the article may not be published for some fantastic reason navarth saw fit to grumble what good is notoriety if your friends are unable to profit from it i he demon princes exploitation of notoriety and humiliation of your friends are not identical spoke the mild voice can you imagine my distress if this article appeared and exposed me to ridicule i would be forced to demand amends for all concerned which is only simple ustice since by an act ot yours my feelings are injured then by other acts you must atone until my feelings are whole again it is not enough to assert that i am oversensitive if you hurt me then you must assuage the hurt no matter how disproportionate the effort truth reflects the cosmos argued the mad poet to ex punge truth one must destroy the cosmos this is the dispropor tionate act aha declared viole falushe but the article is not neces sarily truth it is a point of view an image or two snatched out of context i the person most intimately concerned denounce the point of view as a flagrant distortion i would like to make a suggestion said gersen why not allow cosmopolis to present the real facts or that is to say the facts from your own point of view no doubt you have a statement to make to the folk of the oikumene who are fascinated by your exploits whether or not they approve of them no i think not said viole falushe such an article would seem selfinflation or worse a rather spurious apologia basically i am a modest man but are you not an artist as welp certainly on the truest and noblest scale artists before me have conveyed their assertions by abstract symbology the spectators or audience has always been passive i use a more poignant sym bology essentially abstract but palpable visible and audible in short a symbology of events and environments there are no spec tators no audience no passivity there are only participants they encounter experience at its keenest no man has dared conceive on so vast a scope before here viole falushe gave a slow strange chuckle with the exception perhaps of my megalomaniac con temporary lens larque though his concepts are less fluid than my own but i dare to say it i am perhaps the supreme artist of history my subect is life my medium is experience tools are pleasure passion pungence pain i arrange the total environment in order to suffuse the total entity f his of course is the rationale of my estate popularly known as the palace of love the palace of love gersen nodded sagely precisely what the folk of the oiku mene are anxious to learn rather than publish a vulgar expose of this sort gersen tapped the dummy with the back of his hand cosmopohs would like you to explain your thesis we want pho tographs charts odor swatches sound impressions portraits above all we want your expert analysis possible possible good to this end let us meet together name a time and place and i will be there the place where else the palace of love each year i wel come a group of guests you shall be in the current contingent and mad old navarth as well not i protested navarth my feet have never yet lost con tact with earth i do not care to risk the clarity of my vision gersen also demurred the invitation though tempting is not particularly convenient i would prefer to meet you tonight here on earth impossible on earth i have enemies on earth i am a shadow no man can point and say there stands viole falushe not even my dear friend navarth from whom i have learned much of value a lovely party that navarth magnificent worthy of a mad poet however i am disappointed in the girl i gave you to nurture and i am disappointed in you you have exercised neither the tact the imagination nor the creative direction for which i had hoped con sider the girl in the light of what she is and what she might be i had expected a new jheral tmzy gay and grave sweet as honey tart as lime with a brain full of stars ardent yet innocent what do i find a wanton a hoyden a sourfaced ragamuffin completely irresponsible and undiscernmg imagine in preference to me she chose a certain lan kelly an insolent unworthy person far better dead i find the situation incomprehensible the girl clearly had not been welltrained surely she knows of me and my interest in her yes said navarth mulishly i have pronounced your name well i am not quite satisfied and i am sending her elsewhere for corrective training by less gifted but more disciplined tutors i think it likely that she will join us at the palace of love ah navarth you spoke yes said navarth in a dull voice i have decided to advan tage myself of your invitation i will visit your palace of love the demon princes all very well for you artists said gersen hurriedly but i am a busy man perhaps a brief conference or two here on earth but i have already left earth said viole falushe in a voice of gentle reproach i hang here in orbit only until i hear that my plans for the young minx have been implemented so you must come to the palace of love the violet flower flashed green faded and shifted to a delicate pale blue the connection had been broken navarth sat sprawled in his chair a long two minutes head askew chin on his chest gersen stood looking out the window sensible of a sudden new hollowness navarth lurched to his feet went out on the front deck gersen followed the sun was setting into the estuary the died roofs of dourrai glowed bronze the rotting black wharves and docks stood forth in queer shapes and angles all was invested with an unreal melancholy gersen presently asked do you know how to reach the palace of love no he will inform us he has a mind like a filing cabinet no detail evades him navarth swung his arms indecisively then went inside to return with a tall slender blackgreen bottle and two goblets he broke off the seal poured drink henry lucas what ever your name whatever your trade within this bottle is the wis dom of the ages tincture of earthgold nowhere is tipple to equal this it is unique to old earth mad old earth like mad old navarth yields its best in its serene maturity drink of this precious elixir henry lucas and count yourself fortunate normally it is reserved for mad poets tragic pierrots black angels heroes about to die gannot i be counted among these muttered gersen more to himself than navarth as was his habit navarth raised the goblet into the sunlight of which only a few smoky orange rays remained he tossed half a cupful into his mouth stared out across the water i leave earth the withered leaf is lifted by the wind look look look in sud den excitement he pointed to the somber suntrail along the estu ary the road ahead the way we must go gersen sipped the liquor which seemed to explode into a spray of multicolored lights there is no doubt but what he has taken the girl navarths mouth twisted awry i have no doubt as to this he the palace of love will punish her hissing like a serpent she isjheral tinzy and once again she has rebuffed him so once again she will return to her infancy you are sure she isjheral tinzy not someone who resembles her closely she is jheral tinzy there are differences significant differ ences jheral was frivolous and a trifle cruel this one is somber pensive and never thinks of cruelty but she is jheral tinzy they sat each occupied with his own thoughts dusk fell across the water lights commenced to shine from the far slopes a uni formed messenger alighted from his air car and descended the lad der he called from the landing a delivery for the poet navarth navarth lurched to the gangplank i am he thumbprint here please navarth returned with the delivery a long blue envelope slowly he opened it withdrew the enclosure at the top was the lavender flower of the screen presentation the message read go beyond to sirneste cluster in aquarius sector deep within the cluster hangs the yellow sun miel the fifth planet is sogdian upon which at the south of the hourglass continent you will discern the city atar in one months time go to rubdan ulshaziz at his agency and say i am guest of the margrave excerpt from the televised debate at avente alphanor on july between gowman hachien counsel for the planned progress league and shzor jesno fellow of the institute th degree hachien is it not true then that the institute orig inated as a cabal of assassins jesno to the same degree that the planned prog ress league originated as a cabal of irresponsible sedi tionists traitors suicidal hypochrondnacs hachien this is not a pertinent response jesno the elasticities the areas of vagueness sur rounding the terms ol your question do indeed encom pass the exact truth of the situation hachien what then in inelastic terms is the truth jesno approximately fifteen hundred years ago it became evident that existing laws and systems of public safety could not protect the human race from four bland and insidious dangers first universal and compulsory dosage of drugs tonics toners conditioners stimulants and prophylactics administered through the public wa ter supply second the development of genetic sciences which allowed and encouraged anous agencies to alter the basic character of man according to con tern porar the palace of love biological and political theory third psychological control through media of public information fourth the proliferation of machinery and systems which m the name of progress and social welfare tended to make enterprise imagination creative toil and the subsequent satisfactions obsolete if not extinct i will not speak of mental myopia irresponsibility masochism or the efforts of persons nervously groping for a secure womb to reenter this is all irrelevant the effect however was a situation analogous to the growth of four cancers in a human organism the institute came into being by much the same progress that the body generates a prophylactic serum with trepidation dampened by fatalism navarth boarded ger sens distis pharaon standing in the saloon looking right and left he spoke in a tragic voice so at last it has happened poor old navarth pried away from his source of strength see him now a huddle a sack of tired bones navarth you failed to discriminate in your company you befriended waifs and criminals and ournal ists for your tolerance you are to be wafted away into space compose yourself said gersen its not all that bad as the pharaon lifted from earth navarth gave a hollow groan as if a spike were being driven into his foot look out the port suggested gersen see old earth as you have never seen it before navarth inspected the great blue and white globe and reluc tantly agreed that the vista was of majestic dimensions now earth recedes said gersen we point ourselves toward aquarius we engage the intersplit and suddenly we are insulated from the universe navarth pulled at his long chin strange he admitted strange that this shell can convey us so far so fast somewhere there is mystery it impels one to theosophy to the worship of a space god or a god of light theory dissolves the mystery though it lays bare a cryptic new stratum quite likely there is an endless set of these layers mystery below mystery space is foam matter particles are nodes and con densations the foam fluxes at varying rates the average activity of these minuscule fluxes is time thk demon princes navarth cautiously moved across the ship it is all very inter esting had followed an early bent i might have been a great scientist the voyage proceeded navarth was a rather trying companion ebullient one moment morose the next at one time he simulta neously became afflicted with claustrophobia and agoraphobia and lav on a settee with his feet bare and a cloth pulled over his head on other occasions he sat by the port watching the stars pass crow ing with amazement and glee another time he became interested in the workings of the intersplit and gersen explained it as well as he could spacefoam is whorled into a spindle the pointed ends crack and split the foam which has no inertia the ship inside the whorl is insulated from the effects of the universe the slightest force propels it at an unthinkable rate light curls through the whorl we have the illusion of seeing the passing universe hmm mused navarth how small can the units be made gersen could give no definite answer quite compact i sup pose think if you carried one on your back you could become invisible to drift a million miles with each breath unless a person anchored himself why isnt this done the intersplit would break the connection no anchor would hold navarth argued the point at length and lamented his previous ignorance had i known previously of this marvelous device i might have contrived a useful new machine the intersplit has been known for a long time but not to me and navarth went off to brood through the hither stars of aquarius flew the pharaon the pale that invisible barrier theoretically separating order from chaos fell behind ahead glowed sirneste cluster two hundred stars like a swarm of bright bees controlling planets of every size and description gersen located miel with some difficulty and pres ently the fifth planet sogdian hung below of earthsize and at mospheric tvpe like most of the settled planets the climate appeared temperate the polar ice was of small extent the equatorial zone showed expanses of desert and jungle the hourglass continent was evident at once and the macroscope located the city afar gersen sent down a request for landing clearance but received the palace of love no acknowledgment which gersen took as a sign that landing for malities were unknown he settled toward the planet and atar spread below a small pink and white city surrounding an inlet of the ocean the space port was operated in the manner standard at all the outer worlds as soon as gersen had landed two port officials approached exacted a fee and departed there were no deweaselers a sign that the world was not a haven for pirates raiders and slavers no public conveyance was available gersen and navarth walked a half mile to the town the people of atar darkskinned folk with hair dyed orange wearing white pantaloons and wide complicated white turbans regarded them with great curiosity they spoke an incomprehensible language but gersen by dint of repeating rubdan ulshaziz rubdan ulshaziz presently learned the whereabouts of the man he sought rubdan ulshaziz operated an import and export agency near the ocean he was a bland darkskinned man dressed like the others in loose pantaloons and turban gentlemen i welcome you will you drink punch he poured out tiny cupfuls of thick cold fruit syrup thank you said gersen we are guests of the margrave and were instructed to come to you of course of course rubdan ulshaziz bowed you will now be conveyed to the planet where the margrave has his little estate rubdan ulshaziz favored them with a lewd wink excuse me a little moment i will instruct the person who is to conduct you he disappeared behind a portiere presently to return with a dour seeming man with closeset eyes who nervously puffed clouds of smoke from an acrid cheroot rubdan ulshaziz said this is zog who will escort you to rosja zog blinked coughed spat a shred of tobacco to the floor he speaks only the language of atar continued rubdan ul shaziz he will not be able to offer a description of your destina tion are you ready i need equipment from my spaceboat said gersen and the spaceboat itself is it safe as safe as if it were a tree i will go bond on this if you do not find all correct upon your return seek out rubdan ulshaziz and demand an accounting but what do you wish from your ship the margrave furnishes everything even to new garments the demon princes i need my recorder said gersen i plan to take photo graphs rubdan ulshaziz made a suave gesture the margrave sup plies all equipment of this sort the most modern combinations he wants his guests to arrive unburdened by possessions though he is indifferent to their psychic baggage in other words said gersen we are not to carry any per sonal belongings with us none whatever the margrave supplies everything his hos pitality is allinclusive you have locked sealed and coded your spaceship good then from this moment forward you are a guest of the margrave if you will accompany fendi zog he signaled zog with a peremptory twist of the hand zog inclined his head and gersen and navarth followed him to an open area behind the warehouse here was an air car of a design unfamiliar to gersen and so it seemed to zog as well sitting at the controls zog tested first one operator then another squinting at the rather haphazard arrangement of knobs grips and voice sensors finally as if tiring of the uncertainty he pushed at a cluster of fingerflicks the air car jerked aloft darted across the treetops with zog crouching over the controls and navarth calling out in wrath zog finally took command of the air car they flew twenty miles south across the cultivated plots and stock pens surrounding atar to a field on which rested a latemodel baumur andromeda once again zog betrayed signs of uncertainty the air car swooped bucked wallowed and finally sank to rest navarth and gersen alighted with alacrity zog signaled them toward the andromeda they climbed aboard and the port closed behind them through a transparent panel in the partition separating the saloon from the forward compartment they saw zog settling himself at the controls navarth called out an instant protest zog squinted back through the panel bared yellow teeth in what might have been meant as a smile of reassurance and drew a curtain the magnetic lock clicked shut on the intervening door navarth sank back in dismay life is never so sweet until it becomes a hazard what a sour trick for vogel to play on his old preceptor gersen indicated the pleated burlap screen which covered the ports he also wants to preserve his mystery navarth shook his head in bewilderment what use is knowl the palace of love edge to minds benumbed by fright why do we wait does zog consult the operators manual the andromeda lurched and rose at an alarming rate almost hurling gersen and navarth to the floor gersen grinned to hear navarths roar of protest the sun miel as it could be glimpsed through the burlap swung right and left then rolled down and out of sight below the hull off through the cluster flew the androm eda and it seemed as if zog changed course several times whether from inaccuracy poor spacemanship or a desire to confuse his pas sengers two hours passed a yellowwhite sun bulked large behind the screened ports below hung a planet the configuration of which could not be discerned by reason of the curtain with an impatient ejaculation navarth went to pull the curtain aside a crackle of blue sparks struck out at his fingertips and he fell back with a startled cry this is an imposition he exclaimed ill usage in deed from an unseen diaphragm a recorded voice spoke as cher ished guests you will wish to please your host by adhering to certain standards of courtesy and restraint it is not necessary to define these standards they will be clear to all persons of delicacy the stimulus provides a jocular reminder to the insensitive or thought less navarth made a surly sound in his throat theres a smug dog for you wtiat harm in peering forth from the port evidently the margrave hopes to conceal the location of his headquarters said gersen balderdash what is to prevent a mans searching the cluster until he finds the palace of love there are hundreds of planets gersen pointed out very likely other discouragements as well he need fear no intrusion from me sniffed navarth the andromeda settled upon a field surrounded by bluegreen gum trees of distinctly terrestrial derivation zog immediately un sealed the port a process which gersen watched first with amazement then quizzical amusement wary of unseen micro phones he communicated none of his ideas to navarth they alighted into the morning glare of a yellowwhite sun much like miel in color and radiance the air was pungent with the odor of gum trees and native vegetation shrubs with lustrous the demon princes black stalks black and scarlet leafdiscs blue spikes with fluttering dark blue vanes puffs of cottony membrane enclosing tomatored nodes there were also clumps of terrestrial bamboo and grass and a thicket of blackberry bushes bizarre bizarre muttered navarth looking about there is fascination to be found on these far worlds this is almost like earth said gersen but other areas may be dominated by local plants then you will see the truly bizarre no scope even for a sane poet grumbled navarth but i must put aside my individuality my pitiful small cell of sentience i have been snatched from earth and no doubt my bones will rot in this strange soil he picked up a clod crushed it between his fingers let the fragments fall to the ground it looks like soil it feels like soil but it is starstuff we are far from earth what and we are to be marooned as well with neither a crust nor a bottle of wine for zog had returned within the andromeda and was sealing the port gersen took navarths arm and hustled him across the meadow zog has a reckless temperament he may take off on intersplit and carry away ship meadow shrubs grass and two pas sengers if we stand too near then you could well sing of bizarre circumstances but zog raised the ship on its ionic pencils gersen and navarth watched it dwindle into the bright blue sky so here we are some where in sirneste cluster said navarth either the palace of love is nearby or viole falushe has performed another of his gro tesque jokes gersen went to the edge of the meadow and looked through the screen of trees grotesque joke or not here is a road and it must lead somewhere they set out along the road between hedges of tall black rods with scarlet leafdiscs clattering and chattering in the wind the road wound around a knob of black schist swung up a steep rise gaining the crest they looked out upon a valley and a small city only a mile or two distant is this the palace of love wondered navarth hardly what i expected far too neat too precise and what are those circular towers the towers to which navarth referred rose at regular intervals across the city gersen could only suggest that they con tained offices or apartments or perhaps served to house civic func tionaries the palace of love as they started down the hill a vehicle approached at a great rate a bumping thudding platform supported by rolling air cushions standing at the controls was a gaunt stern person in a brown and black uniform who on closer inspection proved to be a woman she halted the car inspected the two with a skeptical gaze you are the margraves guests step aboard then navarth took exception to the womans tone were you sup posed to meet the ship this is inefficiency we were forced to walk the woman gave him a scornful halfsmile get aboard unless you care to walk more gersen and navarth climbed aboard navarth fuming with in dignation gersen asked the woman what city is that it is city ten and what is your name for this planet i call it fools world other folk may call it what they like her mouth snapped shut like a trap she swung the vehicle around and started back down the road the bladders pounding gersen and navarth clinging tight to avoid being hurled into the ditch navarth bawled orders and instructions but the woman drove even more furiously and did not slow until they entered the city by a curving treeshaded avenue whereupon her pace became extremely sedate gersen and navarth were exposed to the curious stares of the citys inhabitants these were a people without distinctive peculiarity other than that the heads of the men were shaved clean as an egg eyebrows scalp and beard while the women affected an elaborate coiffure of long varnished spikes occasionally tipped with flowers or other ornaments both men and women wore garments of ex travagant cut and color and carried themselves with a peculiar mix ture of swagger and furtiveness speaking emphatically in low voices laughing in loud brash bays only to stop short look in all directions then continue with their mirth the vehicle passed one of the towers navarth had noted a structure of twenty stories each apparently consisting of six wedge shaped apartments navarth spoke to the woman what is the purpose of the towers which rise so prominently it is where the taxes are collected was the reply aha then henry lucas you are correct the towers house civic functionaries the demon princes the woman gave navarth a caustic gray glance they do in deed indeed and indeed navarth paid her no further heed he pointed to one of the numerous cafes along the boulevard patronized principally by men these rascals have much idle time navarth noted see how they loll and take their tipple viole falushe is less than harsh with his subjects if such they be the vehicle swung into a turnaround halted before a long twostory building on the veranda sat a number of men and women in various costumes obviously outworlders off then shagheads said the woman driver tersely here is the inn i have done my stint incompetently and in a surly manner declared navarth ris ing and preparing to alight your own head incidentally would never be the worse for a few changes perhaps a full beard as a start the woman touched a button the bed of the vehicle tilted navarth and gersen were forced to jump to the ground the ve hicle departed with navarth making an insulting gesture at the womans back a footman came forward to meet them you are guests of the margrave this is correct said navarth we have been invited to the palace during the wait you will be housed in the inn wait of what duration demanded navarth i assumed that we would be taken directly to the palace the footman bowed the margraves guests assemble here all go forth together i presume there are five or six others yet to come this being the usual number may i show you to your rooms gersen and navarth were conducted to cubicles eight feet on a side each containing a low narrow bunk a wardrobe a lavatory ventilated only by the lattice in the door navarth was housed next to gersen and his complaints were clearly audible gersen smiled to himself for reasons know best to himself such was the style in which viole falushe wished his guests to wait within the wardrobe were earthstyle garments of a light crisp fabric gersen washed removed his beard with a depilatory changed into fresh garments and went out upon the veranda na the palace of love varth had preceded him and already was holding forth to the eight people four men and four women who sat there gersen took a seat to the side and considered the group beside him sat a portly gentleman wearing the black neckband and beige skintone cur rently fashionable on the mechanics coast of lyonesse one of the concourse planets he was so gersen discovered a manufacturer of bathroom fixtures named hygen grote his companion dor anie almost certainly not his wife was a cool wideeyed blonde woman with only an ultrafashionable hint of bronze skin luster a pair of serious young women sat quietly to the side sociology students at sea province university near avente their names were tralla callob and mornice whill they seemed awed halfalarmed and sat close to each other feet flat on the floor knees pressed tightly together tralla callob was not unattractive though she seemed unaware of this and took no pains to make the most of herself mornice wtiill was victimized by overlarge features and a truculent conviction that every man in the group intended assault upon her chastity more relaxed was margary liever a middleaged woman from earth who had won first prize in a television contest her hearts desire she had chosen a visit to viole falushes palace of love viole falushe had been amused and obliging torrace da nossa was a musician a man of sophistication and elegance perhaps a trifle soft more than a trifle vain and wdth an effortless ease of manner which made meaningful conversation dif ficult he was visiting the palace of love preparatory to composing an opera entitled the palace of love lerand wible was a marine architect of earth who recently had constructed a sailboat of ultimate design the fin was osmium the sails were tall airfoils of metalplated foam selfsupporting and unstayed sails and fin extended at opposite diameters of a metal slipring the hull always floated upright in its most efficient hy drodynamic posture both hull and fin were coated with a water repellent reducing skin friction to a minimum while ducts expelled air to minimize turbulence wible had met viole falushe in con nection with his fanciful scheme for a seagoing palace ringshaped to enclose a central lagoon skebou diffiani was a taciturn man with a head of coarse black hair a black tightly curled beard and an expression conveying dis dain and suspicion of all the others he was a native of quantique i he dfmon princes which went far to explain his aloof manner his occupation was day laborer his inclusion in the group could be explained only as a caprice of viole falushe margery lie er had been the first to arrive five of the long local days before then tralla and mornice had come then skebou diffiani lerand vvible and torrance da nossa were next followed by hvgen grote and doranie navarth plied all with questions pacing the veranda darting side glances right and left but no one knew any more than he did none knew where lay the palace of love or the time of departure the uncertainty troubled no one in spite of the constricted cham bers the hotel was reasonably comfortable and there was the city to be explored a pulling mysterious city with latencies and un dercurrents some or the guests found fascinating others disturbing a gong summoned the group to lunch which was served on a back court under black green and scarlet trees the cuisine was uncom plicated pastry wafers poached fish fruit a cool palegreen bev erage and cakes of spiced currants during the meal six new guests arrived and were brought immediately to the court for lunch they were druids of vale or virgo ti and apparently consisted of two families though such relationships were shrouded in secrecy there were two druids two druidesses and two adolescents all wore similar garments black gows black cowls longtoed black slippers druids dakaw and pruitt were tall and saturnine druidess wust was thin sinewy with a hollowcheeked face and druidess laidig was portly and imposing the lad hule was sixteen or sev enteen extremely handsome with sallow clear skin and clear dark eyes he spoke little and smiled never surveying all with a troubled gaze the girl billika about the same age was likewise pale with something of the same troubled gaze as if she constantly strove to balance sets of irreconcilable relationships the druids sat together ate hurriedly with cowls drawn for ward and only occasional mutters of conversation after lunch when the guests returned to the veranda the druids came purposefully forward introduced themselves with brave cordiality and took seats among the others navarth came to question them but their evasiveness was a match for his curiosity and he learned nothing the talk became general reverting as it always did to the city the name of which was either city ten or kouhha the subect of the towers arose he plce of lovt what was their function did they contain business offices as dor anie suggested or were they residences navarth reported the ex planation of the woman in the uniform that the towers were taxgathering agencies but the rest of the group found the idea farfetched diffiani made the somewhat brutal assertion that the towers were brothels notice early in the morning girls and young women arrive later the men come torrace da nossa said the hypothesis is one which leaps to mmd but the women leave when they will and they seem to in clude every stratum of society which is hardly typical hygen grote gave a sly wink to navarth there is a simple way to resolve the question i suggest that we deputize one of our number to make direct inquiry druidesses laidig and wust snorted and drew their cowls close around their faces the girl billika licked her lips nervously druids dakaw and pruitt looked off in different directions gersen won dered why the druids notoriously prim had ventured on the jour ney to the palace of love when their sensibilities could not but fail to be outraged mysteries everywhere a few minutes later gersen and navarth went for a stroll through the city examining stalls stores workshops and residences with the untroubled curiosity of tourists the people watched them with indifference and perhaps a tinge of envy they seemed pros perous gentle easy of disposition still gersen sensed a pervading quality he could not define nothing so coarse as fear or discord or anxiety a wide treeshaded cafe tempted navarth gersen pointed out that they lacked money navarth brushed the matter aside and insisted that gersen oin him for a glass of wine gersen shrugged and followed navarth to a table navarth signaled the proprietor we are guests of the margrave vole falushe we have no coin of the city we intend to patronize your cafe and you may send the account to the hotel for collection the proprietor bowed punctiliously it shall be as you wish then we will drink a flask of whatever wine you consider suit able for this time of day at once sir the wine was served a pleasant beverage which navarth found somewhat too delicate they sat watching folk walk past directly the demon princes opposite rose one of the cryptic towers which now in midafternoon showed no great activity navarth summoned the proprietor to order another flask of wine and indicating the tower asked what goes on in yonder tower r the proprietor seemed puzzled by the question it is like all the rest where we pay our taxes by why so many towers then would not a single tower suf fice now the proprietor was amazed wtiat sir for so many peo ple as live here hardly possible with this navarth was forced to be satisfied returning to the hotel they found that two more guests had arrived both men of earth harry tanzel of london gian mario of no fixed address both were wellfavored men tall keenfaced darkhaired of ages not immediately apparent tanzel was per haps the handsomer of the two mario was more energetic and vital the local day was a long twentynine hours when night finally arrived the guests retired without protest to their cubicles only to be awakened at midnight by a gong and summoned to a midnight meal in accordance with local custom the following morning saw the arrival of zuly a tall languor ous dancer from the world valhalla tau gemini vi she com ported herself with the most exquisite mannerisms to the suspicion and perturbation of the druids especially young hule who could not keep his eyes away from the woman immediately after the morning meal gersen navarth and ler and wible went walking beside the canal which ran behind the hotel today appeared to be a holiday the people of the city wore garlands some were drunk others sang songs in praise of arodin evidently a folk hero or ruler even on a holiday said navarth they go to pay their taxes nonsense said wible when do men go to pay taxes with so jaunty a step the three paused to watch men going and com ing from the tall tower definitely it is a brothel it can be nothing else but so public so industrious we may be misled by appear ances conceivably do you wish to enter the place the palce of love no indeed if brothel it is i am unfamiliar with their methods and might perform some unorthodox act to the discredit of us all you are unusually cautious remarked gersen i am on a strange planet sighed navarth i lack the strength i derive from the soil of old earth but i am curious we shall resolve the question once and for all come he led the way to the pavilion where they had been served the day before and scanned the tables a portly middleaged gentleman in a wide brimmed green hat sat looking off along the boulevard a small jug of wine at his elbow navarth approached him your pardon sir as you can see we are strangers here one or two of your customs puzzles us and we wish to learn how matters stand the middleaged man heaved himself erect and after a mo ments hesitation pointed to the other chairs i will explain as best i can though there is small mystery here we do as best we can and live according to our lights navarth gersen and wible seated themselves first of all navarth inquired what is the function of that tower yonder where so many people go in and out ah there yes that is our local agency of tax collection tax collection asked navarth with a triumphant glance at wible and the folk who go in and out pay taxes exactly the city is under the wise sponsorship of arodin we are prosperous because taxes suck away none of our wealth at this lerand wible made a skeptical sound how is this possible is it not the same elsewhere the money collected is the money which otherwise would be spent on frivolity the system is beneficient to all every girl of the region must serve five years performing a stipulated number of services per day naturally the more attractive girls fulfill their quota sooner than those who are plain and there is consequently a considerable incentive to main taining pulchritude aha said wible in effect a civic brothel his informant shrugged call it what you wish there is no diminution of resource the yield is devoted to civic expense there is no outcry at the collection of tax and the tax collectors find their work not irksome or if they do they can make in lieu payments which usually happens should the girl wed before her service is the dkmon princes complete then of course we have our obligation to arodm which each of us discharges by the payment of a twoyearold child thereupon we pay no more taxes except for an occasional special assessment no one complains when his child is taken usually not the child is taken to a creche immediately after birth so that no bonds of affection are formed folk breed children early to discharge their obligation as rapidly as possible wible exchanged glances with navarth and gersen and what happens to the children they go to the account of arodin the unsuitable are sold to the mahrab the satisfactory serve at the great palace i gave a child ten years ago i now owe tax to no one navarth could contain himself no longer leaning forward in his chair he pointed a knobby finger so this is why you sit here blinking so smugly in the sun where is your guilt guilt the man raised his hands to adjust his widebrimmed hat in puzzlement there is no guilt i have performed my duty i gave my child i patronize the civic brothel twice a week i am a free man while the child you gave is now a tenyearold slave some where he or she toils that you may sit here with your belly on your lap the man rose to his feet face pink with fury this is incite ment a serious offense what then do you do here you plucked foolish old fowl why do you come to this city if you dont fancy our ways i did not select your city as a destination said navarth with dignity i am a guest ofviole falushe and remain here only pend ing his notification the man laughed a harsh throbbing chortle this is the out world name for arodin you come to enjoy the palace and you have not even paid he pounded the table once with his fist and marched out of the cafe other patrons who had been listening pointedly turned their backs presently the three returned to the hotel even as they arrived the thud of the bladderbuggy sounded at the end of the boulevard it rumbled up to the hotel halted a man alighted and turned to help a young woman who ignoring the hand jumped to the ground navarth gave a raucous cry of surprise the palace of love the young woman attired in fashionable alphanorstyle garments was navarths erstwhile ward known as zan zu drusilla and oth erwise navarth took her aside and pelted her with questions what had happened to her wtiere had she been pent drusilla could tell him little she had been shoved into an air car by the whiteeyed man conveyed to a space vessel and placed in the custody of three grim women each of them wore a heavy gold ring after the poison sprayed from the rings was demonstrated upon a dog no further threats or warnings were necessary drusilla was taken to avente on alphanor lodged at the splen did hotel tarquin the women were watchful as hawks speaking seldom never more than two or three feet away the gold rings a sinister glitter they took her to concerts restaurants fashion shows cinematic displays museums and galleries they urged her to buy clothes to tone her skin to make herself chic all of which drusilla resisted from sullen perversity whereupon the women bought the clothes toned her skin and arranged her hair drusilla retaliated by sagging drooping contriving to look as uncouth as possible finally the women took her to the spaceport they boarded a spaceship which conveyed them to sirneste cluster and the planet sogdian they arrived at the agency of rubdan ulshaziz at atar simultaneously with another guest for the palace of love milo ethuen who stayed in drusillas company the remainder of the journey the three women came as far as the kouliha space field then returned to atar with zog navarth and gersen looked around to inspect ethuen who now sat on the veranda with the others a man not unlike tanzel and mario with a brooding face dark hair long arms and sensitive hands the manager of the hotel came forth upon the veranda ladies and gentlemen i am pleased to announce that your wait is at an end the guests of the margrave are assembled you must now set forth on your journey to the palace of love please follow me i will conduct you to your conveyance excerpt from the televised debate at avente alphanor july between gowman hachieri counsel for the planned progress league and slizor jesno fellow of the institute th degree hachieri you admit that the institute arranges as sassination of persons striving to improve the human condition jesno you beg the question hachieri do you murder anyone whatever jesno i dont care to discuss tactical theory there are very few such events hachieri but they occur jesno only in the case of absolutely flagrant of fenses against the human organism hachieri is not your definition ofoffense arbitrary are you not simply opposed to change are you not conservative to the point of stagnation jesno to all three questions no we want nat ural organic evolution the human race needless to say is not without flaws when elements of the race attempt to cure these ills to create an ideal man or an ideal society there is the certainty of over compensation in one or another direction the flaws the palace of love with the reaction to the flaws creates a distortion factor a filter and the final product is more diseased then the original natural evolution the slow abrasion of man against his environment has slowly but definitely im proved the race the optimum man the optimum so ciety may never eventuate but there will never be the nightmare of the artificial man or the artificial planned progress which the league advocates not so long as the human race generates that highly active set of an tibodies known as the institute hachieri this is a resonant speech it is superfi cially persuasive it is ridden with maudlin fallacies you want man to evolve through abrasion against his en vironment other human beings are part of the envi ronment the league is part of the environment we are natural we are neither artificial nor sick the ills of the oikumene are by no means obscure or mysteri ous they are susceptible to remedy we of the league propose to take action we do not intend to be dis suaded or intimidated if we are threatened we shall take measures to protect ourselves we are not helpless the institute has tyrannized society long enough it is time that new ideas permeated the human community behind the hotel waited a long omnibus with six bladder wheels and a canopy of rosypink silk amid banter laughing and repartee the guests eleven men and ten women climbed aboard settled themselves upon cushions of purple satin the bus trundled across the canal and away to the south kouliha with its tall towers was left behind for an hour the guests rode past carefully tended farms and orchards toward a line of wooded hills and speculation was rife as to the exact location of the palace of love hygen grote went so far as to push into the forward compartment and make inquiry of the driver this was the gaunt woman in the brown and black uni form hygen grote was rebuffed and returned to his seat grinning ruefully and shaking his head up into the hills rolled the bus under tall umbrellashaped trees with glossy black trunks and green the demon princes yellow leafdiscs from somewhere in the distance came the me lodious hooting of treedwelling creatures enormous white moths fluttered through the shade which became ever more dank ever more pungent with the reek of lichens and largeleafed shrubs at the ridge the road broke out into a dramatic blaze of sunlight ahead spread a vast blue ocean the bus plunged down a steep straight road and halted at a dock here waited a glasshulled yacht with blue decks and a white metal superstructure four stewards in dark blue and white uniforms assisted the guests from the bus conducted them to a building of white coral blocks where they were asked to change into new garments white yachting costumes with rope san dals and loose white linen caps the druids protested vigorously on doctrinal grounds they flatly refused to part with their cowls and so they boarded the yacht the men attired in white trousers and ackets the women in white skirts and ackets with heads en cowled in black as before the time was sunset the yacht would not get under way until the morrow the passengers assembled in the saloon where they were served earthtype cocktails and presently dinner the two younger druids hule and billika wore their cowls rather more loosely than their parents thereby incurring reprimands after dinner the three young men mano tanzel and ethuen played deck tennis with tralla and mornice drusilla huddled dis consolately near navarth who conducted the strangest of conver sations with druidess laidig gersen sat to the side watching propounding speculations wondering where his responsibilities lay and to whom from time to time drusilla wistfully looked across the saloon toward him clearly she dreaded the future with good reason thought gersen he could think of no way to reassure her zuly the dancer supple as a white eel walked around the deck with da nossa skebou diffiani the quantique stood by the rail thinking the mysterious thoughts of his race with an occasional contemp tuous glance toward da nossa and zuly billika shyly came up to talk to drusilla followed by hule who seemed to find drusilla attractive billika somewhat flushed had been tasting wine she wore her cowl artfully disarranged to show her curly brown hair a situation which did not evade the notice of druidess laidig who however was unable to detach herself from navarth margary liever chatted with hygen grote and his companion the plllceorlolt dorame until doranie became bored and went to saunter along the deck where to h gen grotes annoyance she was joined by lerand wible ihe druids were the first to bed followed by hygen grote and doranie gersen went out on the deck and looked up at the sky where the stars of sirneste cluster blazed to the south and east heaved the waters of an ocean whose name he did not know not far distant skebou difham leaned on the rail looking across the same ocean gersen returned within drusilla had gone to her stateroom on the sideboard the stewards had arranged a collation of meats cheese fowl aspic and a selection of wines and liquors zuly conversed in low tones with da nossa margary liever now sat alone a vague smile on her face was she not achieving her hearts desire navarth had become somewhat drunk and was swag gering about spoiling for an opportunity to produce a dramatic scene but everyone else was relaxed and gave him no scope na varth finally threw up his hands and went off to bed gersen after a last look around followed gersen awoke to the pitch and roll of the yacht the time was shortly after dawn sunlight slanted into the cabin through the sec tion of hull above the waterhne below dark blue water surged past not yet illuminated by the sun gersen dressed went to the saloon to find himself the earliest riser land lay four or five miles off the starboard beam a narrow beach a wooded foreshore backed by low hills with the hint of purple mountains m the distance gersen went to the buffet helped himself to breakfast as he ate other guests appeared and presently the entire complement sat in the saloon devouring grills and pastries drinking hot beverages marveling at the scenery and the easy motion of the yacht after breakfast gersen went out upon the deck where he was joined by navarth foppish in his white yachting costume the day was perfect sunlight glinted on the blue swells clouds soared above the hon on navarth spat over the side contemplated the sun the sky the sea the ourney begins it must start like this innocent and pure gersen understood navarths meaning well enough he made no comment i hf dfmon princes navarth spoke again in a voice even more gloomy no matter what else you say ofvogel he knows how to do a thing well gersen inspected the gold buttons on his jacket they seemed no more than buttons in response to navarths puzzled stare he said mildly such articles have been known to conceal spycells navarth laughed hoarsely not likely vogel may well be aboard but he wont be eavesdropping hed be afraid of hearing something unpleasant it would spoil the trip for him you think hes aboard then hes aboard no fear would he miss an experience like this never but who gersen considered hes not you nor i nor the druids hes not diffiam he would not be wible a different type altogether too fresh and fair and round he would not be da nossa though its barely possible barely possible hes one of the druids but i think not that leaves only three the tall dark men tanzel mano ethuen he could be any of these they turned to consider the three men tanzel stood on the bow looking ahead across the ocean ethuen sat sprawled m a deck chair talking to bilhka who squirmed in mingled embarrassment and pleasure mano the last to arise had ust finished breakfast and was stepping out on deck gersen tried to match each of them to what he knew ofviole falushe each was tense yet elegant each might have been possibility no the murderer m harlequinade who had fled on long legs from navarths party any could be viole falushe said navarth and what of zan zu drusilla whatever her name she is doomed navarth threw his hands up m the air and stalked away gersen looked toward drusilla as he had decided to think of her she stood talking to hule the young druid who in the fervor of the moment had let fall his cowl a handsome lad thought ger sen earnest with a look of internal tension which women must eventually find provocative indeed drusilla was examining him with some small interest druidess wust barked a sharp order hule guiltily snapped up his cowl and slunk away gersen went over to drusilla she gave him a look of wary welcome were you surprised to see us at the hotel gersen asked the placeor iovi she nodded i had never expected to see you again after a moments hesitation she asked whats going to happen to me why am i so important gersen still in doubt regarding spycells spoke cautiously i dont know what will happen i will protect you if i can youre important because you resemble a girl viole falushe once loved and who scorned him he may be aboard the yacht he may be one of the passengers so you must be very careful drusilla turned a fearful look around the deck which one you remember the man at navarths party yes he will be a man like that drusilla winced i dont know how to be careful i wish i were someone else she looked over her shoulder cant you take me awa not now drusilld bit her lip why did it have to be me i might answer if i knew who you were to begin with zan zu drusiila wayles jheral tinzy im none of them she said in a dolorous voice who are you i dont know you dont have a name fhe man at the dock saloon called me spooky thats not much ofa name ill be drusilla wayles she looked at him care fully youre not really a journalist are you i am henry lucas a monomaniac and i mustnt talk to you too much you know why drusillas face lost its momentary animation if you say so fry to identify viole falushe said gersen he will want you to love him if you dont hell hide his anger but you may know by a glance a threat a look on his face or while he flirts with someone else he will watch to see if you notice drusilla pursed her lips doubtfully im not very discerning do your best but be careful dont bring trouble on yourself here comes tanzel good morning good morning said tanzel breezily he spoke to drusilla you look as if youve lost your last friend thats not the case you know not with harry tanzel aboard cheer up were off to the palace of love the demon princes dmsilla nodded i know just the place for a pretty girl ill personally show you all the sights if i can fight off my competitors gersen laughed no competition here i cant take time from my job much as id like to job at the palace oflove are you an ascetic simply a journalist what i see and hear will show up in cos mopohs keep my name out of it warned tanzel facetiously some day ill be a married man id never live down that kind of fame ill be discreet good come along now tanzel took drusillas arm ill help you with your morning constitutional fifty times around the deck they walked off drusilla with a last forlorn glance over her shoulder at gersen navarth sidled up theres one of them is he the man i dont know hes starting strong three days the yacht plied the sunny seas for gersen three pleasant days though the hospitality came from a man he intended to kill there was an effortless quality to the hours a dreamlike isolation and each persons characteristic style was intensified becoming a thing larger than life attitudes and rigidities relaxed hule allowed his cowl to hang loose and finally discarded it altogether billika more tentatively did the same whereupon zuly in a spirit of cool mischief offered to arrange her hair billika hesitated then with a sigh of hedonistic abandon assented so zuly shaped and clipped to accentuate billikas pale wideeyed delicacy to the amazement of all the men aboard druidess laidig cried out in anger druidess wust clicked her tongue the two druids were startled but all the others begged them not to browbeat the girl such was the atmo sphere of ease and gayety that druidess laidig at last fell to laugh ing at navarth and billika managed to slip away quietly not long after druidess laidig allowed her own cowl to hang loose as pres ently did druid dakaw druid pruitt and druidess wust held to the full rigor of their habit but tolerated the delinquency of the others with no more than an occasional disparaging glance or mut tered sarcasm tralla mornice and dorame noting the attention paid to the the p lace of love younger girls became extremely enthusiastic and gay clearly none planned to rebuff any attempted gallantry each afternoon the yacht halted to drift on the ocean all who chose plunged into the clear water while others went below to watch through the glass hull these latter included the older dru ids diffiam who participated in no activity except eating and drinking margar liever who professed a fear of deep water and hygen grote who could not swim the others even navarth donned the swim suits provided by the yacht and splashed m the warm ocean at dusk of the second evening gersen took drusilla to the bow refraining from any intimacy of contact which might infuriate viole falushe should he be watching drusilla seemed to feel no such constraint and gersen became aware with a bittersweet pang that the girl was in some degree infatuated with him gersen as sus ceptible as anyone else fought back his inclinations even if he succeeded in destroying viole falushe what then there was no place for drusilla in the harsh future he had laid out for himself still the temptation remained drusilla with her somber moods her sudden flashes of joy was fascinating but circumstances were as they were and gersen kept his conversation to the business at hand drusilla had noticed nothing mano ethuen tanzel all plied her with attention as gersen had instructed she showed fa voritism to none even as they stood m the bow watching the sun set mano came to join them after a moment or two gersen excused himself and returned to the promenade if mano were vi ole falushe it would not do to antagonize him if he were not then viole falushe watching hatefully from elsewhere would be reas sured that drusilla preferred no single person the morning of the fourth day found the yacht cruising among small islands lush with vegetation at noon the yacht approached the mainland and drifted up to a dock the voyage was over the passengers disembarked regretfully with many a backward glance margary liever frankly wept in a structure beside the dock the guests were issued new gar ments for the men there were loose velvet blouses in the softest and richest of colors mossgreen cobaltblue dark maroon with loose black velvet trousers fastened below the knees with scarlet ribbons the women received the same style blouses m paler the demon princes shades with striped matching skirts all were issued soft velvet be rets square loose with an intriguing tassel when all had reassembled they were served lunch then ush ered to a great wooden wagon with six green and gold wheels and a dark green canopy supported by spiral posts of a beautiful dark wood the wagon set off along a coastal road late in the afternoon the track veered inland over rolling grassy hills spangled with flow ers and the ocean was lost to sight soon there were trees tall and solitary much like earth trees but conceivably indigenous then clumps and groves at dusk the wagon halted beside one such grove the guests were conducted to a hostel built high in the treetops led along swaying walkways to small wicker tree houses supper was served on the ground to the light of a great cackling fire the wine seemed stronger than usual or perhaps all were in a mood to drink everyone seemed larger than life the twentyone were the only people alive in the universe toasts were drunk in cluding several to our unseen host the name viole falushe was never mentioned a troupe of musicians appeared with fiddles guitars and pipes they played wild wailing tunes which set the heart pounding and the head swaying zuly leapt to her feet and improvised a dance as wild and abandoned as the music gersen forced himself to sobriety at times like this it was most important to watch he saw lerand wible whisper to billika a moment later she sidled away and off into the shadows he too was gone the druids and druidesses were rapt with the dancing sit ting with heads back eyes halfclosed only hule noticed he looked thoughtfully after the two then crept quietly up to drusilla and whispered in her ear drusilla smiled she turned a flicker of a glance toward gersen and said something in a soft voice hule nodded without enthusi asm seated himself close beside her and presently put his arm around her waist a half hour passed with only gersen seeming to notice wible and bitlika were once more among the group billika with eyes bright and mouth soft it seemed that only a moment later druidess laidig bethought herself of billika and sought around to locate her there sat billika something was amiss something was new and the palace of love different druidess laidig could sense this much but there was nothing else to see her suspicion lulled she returned to her en joyment of the music gersen watched mano ethuen and tanzel they sat with tralla and mormce but it seemed as if their eyes wandered toward drusilla gersen chewed his lip viole falushe if indeed he were among the guests did not seem disposed to yield his identity wine music firelight gersen leaned back aware of giddiness who among the group was watchful who attentive that person would be viole falushe gersen saw no one who seemed other than relaxed druid dakaw was asleep druidess laidig was nowhere to be seen skebou diffiani also had disappeared gersen chuckled and leaned toward navarth to share the joke then thought better of it the fire became embers the musicians wandered away like figures in a dream the guests roused themselves and went by swaying walkways to their wicker cabins if other assignations had been made if other trysts were kept gersen had no knowledge of them in the morning the guests assembled for breakfast to find that the wagon was gone and there was speculation as to what mode of transport next would be offered them after breakfast a steward pointed out a path there we will go i have been requested to guide if all are ready i suggest that we set off for there is far to go before evening hygen grote spoke in an astonished voice you mean to say we walk exactly this lord grote there is no other way to our des tination i never expected all this backing and filling complained grote i thought that when we were invited to the palace of love an air car simply took us there i am only a servant lord grote i can offer no explanation grote turned away not completely pleased but he had no choice presently his spirits rose and he was the first to start singing an old walking song of his fraternity at lublinken college over low hills through glades and groves went the path they walked over a wide meadow startling a number of white birds into flight they descended a valley to a lake where lunch awaited them the steward would not allow an overlong rest there is still far to go and we cannot walk fast for fear of tiring the ladies thk demon princes im already tired snapped the druidess wust i dont intend to move another step anyone who wishes may return said the steward the path is plain and there is staff to assist you along the way but now it is time for the rest of us to go on it is afternoon and a wind is rising indeed a breeze with a hint of coolness blew small wavelets across the lake and the western sky was paved with herringbone clouds druidess wust elected to continue with the group and all set off along the shore of the lake presently the path turned aside mounted a slope and struck off across a park of tall trees and long grass on and on trudged the party with the wind at their backs with the sun declining behind a range of mountains they halted for pastries and tea then off once more with the wind sighing through the branches as the sun sank behind the mountains the party entered dank heavy woods which seemed all the darker for the going of the sun the pace was slow the older women were tired though only druidess wust complained druidess laidig wore a grim expres sion while margary liever strolled along with her customary small smile hygen grote had lapsed into sulky silence except for an occasional terse word to doranie the woods seemed endless the wind now distinctly cool roared through the upper branches dusk fell over the mountains at last the party stumbled into a clearing to find a rambling old forest lodge of timber and stone the windows glowed with yellow lights smoke drifted from a chimney within must be found warmth and food and good cheer and so it was the tired travelers climbing stone steps to the porch entered a vast beamed parlor with bright rugs on the floor and a roaring blaze in the fireplace some of the group sank grate fully into deep chairs others chose to go to their rooms to refresh themselves once again new clothing was issued for the men black trousers and short jackets with a dark brown cummerbund for the ladies long trailing black gowns with white and brown flowers for the hair those who had bathed and dressed returned to the parlor to the envy of those who still sat tired and dirty presently all had bathed and changed into the new dark garments mulled wine was served and presently a hearty forest dinner the palace of lolt goulash bread and cheese red wine and all the toil of the day was forgotten after dinner the guests gathered around the fireplace to sip liquors and now the talk was loud and brave everyone speculating as to where lay the palace of love navarth struck a dramatic pose in front of the fire it is plain he cried in a great brassy voice or is it not does not everyone understand or is it left to old navarth the poet to illuminate speak navarth called ethuen reveal to all vour insight why cherish them for your private pleasures i have never had that intention all will know what i know and all will feet what i feel we are midway along in the journey here is where the carelessness the amplitude the calm ease depart the winds arose at our back and hurried us through the woods our refuse is medievalism come now old man chaffed tanxel speak so we can un derstand you those who understand me will do so those who cannot will never do so but all is clear he knows he knows druidess laidig impatient with hyperbole spoke crossly he knows what who knows what what are we all but perambulatory nerves the artist knows the linkage of nerve with nerve speak for yourself muttered diffiani navarth performed one of his extravagant gesticulations he is a poet like myself did i not teach him every pang of the soul even wry ache of the mind every whisper of blood navarth navarth groaned wible enough or at any rate something different here we are in this strange old lodge a per fect refuge for ghosts and wipwarks druid pruitt spoke sententiously this is our lore each man and each woman is a living seed when his planting time comes he is delved and covered and finally comes forth as a tree and each soul is distinct there are birches and oaks and lavengars and black paneys the talk proceeded the younger and more energetic folk ex plored the ancient structure and played hideandseek in the long hall among the billowing amber curtains druidess laidig became uneasy and craned her neck to find billika at last she hoisted herself to her feet and went off looking fue demon princes here and there presently to return with a downcast bilhka dru idess laidig muttered something to the druidess wust who lumped up and went off down the hall there were loud echoing voices in the hall then silence and a moment later druidess wust returned with hule who seemed sullen three minutes later drusilla came back to the saloon her face was flushed her eyes alive with something between mirth and mis chief the dark gown suited her beautifully she had never looked more beautiful she crossed the room and slipped into the seat beside gersen what happened he asked we played a game in the hall i hid with hule and watched as you told me to see who would be most angered and who was i dont know mano says he loves me tanzel was laughing but he was annoyed ethuen said nothing and would not look at me wtiat were you doing that they should be angry dont for get its dangerous to thwart people drusillas mouth drooped yes i forgot i should feel fright ened i do feel frightened when i think about it but you will take care of me wont you i will if i can you can i know you can i hope i can well what was going on to annoy mano tanzel and ethuen nothing very much hule and i sat in an old couch that was turned backwards hule wanted to kiss me and i let him the druidess found us and embarrassed hule dreadfully she called me names harlot lilith nymph drusilla imitated wusts pe culiar grating voice to an exactitude and all heard yes all heard wtio seemed the most upset drusilla shrugged sometimes i think one then the other mano seems the softest ethuen has the least humor tanzel is sometimes sarcastic ob iously thought gersen there had been much which he had missed best that you do not hide with anyone not even hule be pleasant to each of the three but prefer none the palace of love drusillas face became bleak and drawn i am frightened re ally when i was with the three women thought i might run away but feared the poison in their rings do you think they would have killed me i dont know but for now go to bed and sleep and open your door to no one drusilla rose to her feet with a final cryptic glance at gersen she went to the stairs ascended to the balcony and entered her chamber one by one the group dwindled and at last gersen sat alone gazing into the dying fire waiting for he knew not what the balcony lights were dim a balustrade obscured his vision a shape drifted up to the door of one of the chambers it quickly opened and closed gersen waited another hour while the fire became embers and the wind blew spatters of rain against the dark windows there was no further activity gersen went to his own bed the chamber which had received the visitor so gersen noted the next morning was that oftralla callob the sociology student he watched to see upon whom her eyes rested but could be sure of nothing this morning all wore similar costumes gray suede trousers a black blouse a brown jacket an intricate black hat which was almost a helmet with ear flaps flaring rakishly outward breakfast like the meal of the night before was simple and substantial as they ate the pilgrims cast appraising glances at the sky ragged patches of mist blew over the mountain directly over head was a thin overcast breaking at the east into tattered clots of nimbus a not too cheerful outlook after breakfast the steward marshaled the pilgrims evading questions put to him how far must we walk today this from hygen grote i really dont know sir i have never heard the distance men tioned but the sooner we start the sooner we arrive hygen grote gave a despondent snort this certainly wasnt what i expected well im as ready as ill ever be the path led south from the clearing all turned to take a final look at the somber old lodge before it passed from sight for several hours the trail wound through the woods the sky remained overcast the graymauve light which penetrated the trees s i he demon princes invested with moss the ferns and the occasional pale flowers with a peculiarly rich color rock outcrops covered with black and red lichen began to appear everywhere were fragile little growths not dissimilar to the fungus of earth but taller and manytiered ex haling a bitter oldage smell when crushed the path began to rise the woods fell below the pilgrims found themselves on a rockstrewn slope with mountains looming to the west at a stream they paused to drink and catch their breath and the steward distributed sweet biscuits to the east spread the forest gloomy and dark above loomed the mountain hygen grote again deprecated the difficulty of the way to which the guide made the blandest of replies there is much in what you say lord grote but as you know i am only a servant with orders to make the journey as convenient and inter esting as possible how can trudging these weary miles be interesting or con venient grumbled grote to be answered by margary liever come now hygen the scenery is delightful look at the view and did you not enoy the romantic old lodge i did i am sure that this is the hope of the margrave said the steward and now lords and ladies best that we continue the trail slanted up the mountain slope soon druidess laidig and dorame were falling behind and the steward courteously slowed the pace the path entered a stony gulch and the ascent became less steep lunch was brief and austere consisting of soup biscuits and sausage then once again the pilgrims set off along the trail wind began to strike down the mountainside a few cold gusts at a time overhead dark gray clouds raced to the east up the bleak moun tainside plodded the pilgrims and the city kouhila the glasshulled yacht the green and gold wagon were only remote memories margary liever remained cheerful and navarth swung along grin ning as if at some malicious oke hygen grote gave up complain ing saving his breath for the exertion of moving uphill halfway through the afternoon a rain squall drove the party to shelter under a ut of rock the sky was dark an unreal gray light washed the landscape the pilgrims in their costumes of black and umber were as if derived from the same stone and soil as the moun tain itself the trail entered a stony gorge the pilgrims plodded forward the palice of love in silence the badinage and gentilities of the first few days put aside there was another brief shower which the steward ignored for the light was waning the gorge widened but the way ahead was blocked by a massive stone wall topped by a row of iron spikes the steward went to a black iron postern raised a knocker and let it fall after a long minute the portal creaked back to reveal a crooked old man in black garments the steward addressed the pilgrims here is where i leave you the path lies beyond you need only follow make the best haste possible because darkness is not far away one by one the group passed through the gap the portal clanged shut behind them for a moment they milled uncertainly looking this way and that the steward and the old man had gone there was none to direct them diffiam pointed there the path it leads up toward the height painfully the pilgrims proceeded the path traversed a stonv bar ren crossed a river once more slanted up through the blowing wind pmally just as the light failed the path came out on the ridge diffiani in the lead pointed ahead lights a hospice of some sort the group straggled forward bending to the windgusts turn ing faces away from driven drips of ram a long low stone structure bulked against the sky one or two of the windows showed a wan yellow illumination diffiam found a door pounded on it with his fist it creaked open and a woman peered forth who are you wtry do you come so late we are travelers guests tor the palace of love bawled hy gen grote is this the way yes this is the way fnter then were you expected of course we were expected is there lodging for us here yes yes quavered the old woman i can give you beds but this is the old castle you should have gone by the other path fnter then i must look about you have supped i trust no said grote despondently we have not perhaps i can find gruel what a shame the castle is so cold the pilgrims passed into a bleak courtyard lit by a pair of feeble lamps the old woman conducted them one at a time to tall the dt mon prices ceihnged chambers in various quarters of the castle these were austere gloomy decorated to the precepts of some longforgotten tradition gersens chamber contained a cot a single lamp of red and blue glass three walls were black iron relieved by patterns of rust in one of the walls was a door the fourth wall was paneled in dark waxed wood and carved with enormous grotesque masks there was neither tire nor heating the room was chill the old lady breathless and anxious told gersen when food is ready youll be summoned she pointed to the door yonder is the hath with precious little warm water one must make do and she hurried away gersen went into the bathroom tested the shower the water ran hot he stripped off his clothes bathed then rather than dressing in sodden clothes he stretched out on the cot and covered himself with a quilt tune passed gersen heard a distant gong strike nine times there might be supper again there might not the warmth of the shower had made him drowsy and he fell asleep vaguely he heard the gong strike ten times then eleven evidently there was to be no supper gersen turned over and went back to sleep twelve strokes of the gong into the room came a slender maiden with silky blonde hair she wore a skintight garment of blue velvet and blue leather slippers with rolled toes gersen sat up in bed the maiden spoke we have now pre pared a meal all are aroused all are summoned to eat she rolled a wardrobe cart into the room i lere are garments do you require assistance without waiting for a response she brought under linen to gersen presently he was clothed in beautiful fabric after a style quaint ornate and complicated the maiden dressed his hair applied gallantry discs to his cheeks sprayed him with scent my lord is magnificent she murmured and now a mask which tonight is of necessity the mask consisted of a black velvet casque fitting down to the ears v ith a black visor a nosecup and a chinguard only gersens cheeks mouth and eves were bare mv lord is now mysterious as well said the maiden in the softest of voices i will lead you tor the way is by the old corridors she took him down a draughty staircase along a dank echoing corridor with only the feeblest of lamps to light the way the walls once splendid in patterns of magenta silver and gold were faded and blotched the tiles of the floor were loose the maiden the palale of love s halted by a heavy red pornere she looked sidelong at gersen and put her finger to her lips with the dim light glowing on her blue velvet garment and glinting in her hair she seemed dreamstuff a creature too exquisite to be real lord she said within is our banquet i must urge you to mystery for this is the game all must play and you may not speak your name she pulled aside the por tiere gersen stepped through into a vast hall from a ceiling so high as to be unseen hung a single chandelier casting an island of light around a great table laid with linen silver and crystal here sat a dozen people in the most elaborate of costumes wearing masks gersen examined them but recogni ed none were they his fellows along the journey he could not be sure others entered the room now they came by twos and threes all masked and all moving with an air of wonder gersen recognized navarth whose swaggering gait was unmis takable the girl was she drusilla he could not be certain forty people had entered the room converging slowly upon the table footmen in silver and blue livery assisted all to seats poured wine in the goblets serving from silver trays gersen ate and drank aware of a peculiar confusion almost bewilderment where and what ws reality the rigors of the our ney seemed as remote as childhood gersen drank somewhat more wine than he might have under different circumstances the chandelier exploded in a dazzling burst of green light then went out gersens eyes proected orange afterimages into the dark from around the table came whispers and hisses of surprise the chandelier slowly returned to normal a tall man stood on a chair he wore black garments and a black mask he held a goblet of wine in his hand guests he said i make you welcome i am viole falushe you have attained the palace of love avis rara black mascara will you stay to dine with me amanita botulina underneath my upas tree this dainty tray of cloisonne contains my finest patchouli aha my dear what have we here a dead mouse in the potpourri with mayonnaise the canapes ravished from a sturgeon womb with silver prong we guide along the squeaking oyster to his doom a samovar of hangdog tea a cup or are you able antimony macaroni on my hemlock table navarth there are many varieties of love said viole falushe in a pleas ant husky voice the range is wide and all have contributed to the creation of the palace not all of my guests discover this and not every phase is yielded to them for some the palace will seem little more than a holiday resort others will be haunted by what has been described as unnatural beauty this is everywhere in every detail every view others will revel in ardor and here i must offer information the palace of love gersen studied viole falushe with a rapt intensity the tall masked figure stood spare straight arms at sides gersen turned his head this way and that trying to identify the figure but the chandelier hanging directly above the man distorted his contours the people at the palace of love are amiable gay and beau tiful they fall into two categories said viole falushe the first are servants they are pleased to obey every wish of my guests every whim or caprice the second class the happy people who inhabit the palace are as independent in their friendships as i my self they are to be identified by their garments which are white hence your choice is wide gersen sought around the table trying to find tanzel or mario or ethuen and thus eliminate them from suspicion in this effort he was unsuccessful among the forty were a dozen persons who might be any of the three he turned back to listen to viole fa lushe are there restrictions a person who went mad and began to kill would naturally be restrained then again all of us here cherish our privacy one of our most delightful prerogatives only the most thoughtless person would intrude where he was not wanted my personal apartments are sufficiently secluded you need not appre hend an accidental intrusion this is almost impossible viole fa lushe turned his head slowly looked around the room no one spoke the room was heavy with expectancy viole falushe continued speaking so now the palace of love at times in the past i have arranged small dramas of which the participants were never aware i have contrived moods in artful sequence i have employed tragic contrasts to heighten the delec tation on this occasion there will be no such program you will be free to do as you like to create your own drama i advise re straint the rare jewels are the most precious the degree of aus terity i myself practice would astound you my great pleasure is creation of this i never tire some of my guests have complained of a gentle melancholy which hangs in the air i agree that the mood exists the explanation i believe arises from the fugacity of beauty the tragic pavane to which all of us step ignore this mood why brood when there is so much love and beauty here take what is offered have no regrets a thousand years from now it will be all the same satiety is a problem but it is your own i cannot protect you the servants are to serve command them the residents who i hf ufmon princes wear white are to woo to beguile i pray that you do not become infatuated either with the palace or its people such a situation pre sents difficulties you will not see me though spiritually i am always in your midst there are no spy devices no sound transmitters no vision cells upbraid me if you choose revile me praise me i cannot hear my only reward is the act of creation and the effect it produces do you wish to look forth on the palace of love turn then in your seats the far wall slid away daylight poured into the hall before the guests spread a landscape of mmdwrenching beauty wide lawns feathery greenbower trees tall black cypress twinkling birch ponds pools marble urns pavilions terraces rotundas constructed to an airy delicate architecture that seemed almost to float gersen like the others had been startled by the sudden open ing of the wall recovering he umped to his feet but the man in black had disappeared gersen sought out navarth who was it mano tanzel ethuen navarth shook his head i did not notice i have been looking for the girl where is she with a sudden sinking feeling gersen swung around none of the people in the room was drusilla when did you see her last when we arrived when we came into the courtyard already the ourney seemed remote gersen muttered i hoped to protect her i told her so she trusted me navarth made an impatient motion you could have done nothing gersen went to the window looked across the panorama to the left was the sea a group of distant islands to the right moun tains reared ever higher and harsher with cliffs falling to the valley floor below was the palace a loose grouping of terraces halls and pleasances a door slid aside to reveal a descending staircase one by one the guests descended to the valley the precincts of the palace occupied a roughly hexagonal area per haps a mile on a side the base was the north cliff with the palace at its midpoint the second side clockwise was demarcated by a line of rocky crags the gaps between which were choked by rank thorny thickets the third side was white beach and warm blue sea the fourth and fifth sides were less distinct and merged into the the palace of love natural landscape the sixth side angling back to the cliff was de marcated by a line of carefully cultivated flower beds and fruit trees arranged against a rude stone wall within the area were three vil lages innumerable glades gardens waterways the guests wan dered where they chose spent the long days in whatever fashion seemed most pleasurable bright mornings golden afternoons eve nings and nights one by one they drifted away the servants as viole falushe had implied were acquiescent and possessed of great physical charm the folk in white even more beautiful than the underservants were innocent and willful as chil dren some were cordial some were perverse and impudent all were unpredictable it seemed as if their sole ambition was to evoke love to tantalize to fill the mind with longing and they became depressed only when guests found the underservants preferable to themselves they showed no awareness of the worlds of the uni verse and only small curiosity though their minds were active and their moods mercurial they thought only of love and the various aspects of fulfillment as viole falushe had hinted infatuation too intense might lead to tragedy of this danger the people in white were gravely aware but made small effort to avoid the danger the mystery of the druids presence resolved itself on the first day after arrival dakaw pruitt laidig and wust with hule and billika in careful convoy explored the precincts and fixed upon a delightful little glade for their center of operations to the back rose a line of black cypress to right and left were lower trees and flowering shrubs at the center was a great spraddlerooted oak in front of the glade a pair of shelters was erected low domes of pale brown fiber here the group took up residence and thereafter each morning and afternoon held evangelical meetings expounding the nature of their religion to all who came past with great fervor they urged rigor harshness restraint and ritual upon the folk of the garden who listened politely enough but after the meetings enticed the druids to relaxation and pleasure gersen decided that the whole affair was one of viole falushes wry okes a game he had chosen to play with the druids the other guests arrived at the same conclusion and attended the meetings to judge whose doc trines would triumph the druids worked with great intensity and built a fane of stones and twigs standing at the front one or the other would cry out must you all then die to become dead the mode to the s the demon princes eternal is through minglement with a vitality more enduring than your own the source of all is the triad magragdag air earth and water this is the holy immanence which combines to pro duce the tree of life the tree is the wise the vital the enduring look at lesser things insects flowers fish man see how they grow bloom lapse while the tree in its placid wisdom lives on yea you titillate your flesh you rore your stomach you flood your brain with vapor what then how soon you die while the noble tree with roots in earth holds innumerable leaves to the glory of the sky forever and when vour flesh sags and withers when your nerves no longer leap when your belly is sour when your nose drips from the liquor you have misused then is no time to worship the tree no no no for the tree will have none of your corrup tion all must be fresh and good so worship give over the sterile cavortings the animal gratifications worship the tree the palace folk listened with respect and awe it was impossible to judge how deeply the druid doctrine touched them meanwhile dakaw and pruitt began to dig a great hole under the oak burrow ing down between the sprawled roots hule and billika were not allowed to dig and showed no disposition to do so indeed they watched the process with horrified fascination the palace folk in their turn insisted that the druids partici pate in their festivities arguing you wish us to learn your ways but in all fairness you must know the way we live too so that you may judge our lives and see if after all we are corrupt grudgingly the druids acquiesced sitting in a huddled group and maintaining the closest possible strictures upon hule and billika the other guests watched with varied reactions skebou diffi ani attended the meetings with regularity and presently to the astonishment of all announced his intent to become a druid thereafter he donned black robe and cowl and joined the others at their rituals torrace da nossa spoke of the druids with pitying contempt lerand wible who along the way had displayed an in terest in billika threw up his arms in disgust and stayed away mario ethuen and tanzel went their own ways and were seen but seldom navarth had become obsessed he roved the garden mo rose dissatisfied looking this way and that he took no joy in the beauty of the garden and went so far as to sneer at viole falushes arrangements there is no novelty here the pleasures are banal there are no exhilarations no staggering insights no sublime the palace of love sweep of mind all is either gross or maudlin the gratification of gut and gland this may be true gersen admitted the pleasures of the place are simple and undramatic but what is wrong with this nothing but it is not poetry it is all very beautiful to do viole falushe credit he has avoided the macabre the sadistic spectacles which occur elsewhere and he allows his servants a certain degree of integrity navarth made a sour grumbling sound you are an innocent the more exotic pleasures he reserves for himself who knows what goes on beyond the walls he is a man who halts at nothing and integrity in these people bathos they are dolls toys con fections no doubt many are the little children extorted from kou hila those he did not sell to the mahrab and when they lose their youth what then where do they go gersen only shook his head i dont know and where isjheral tinzy navarth went on where is the girl what does he do with her he has had her at his mercy gersen gave a grim nod i know you know jeered navarth but only after i reminded you you are not only innocent you are futile and foolish no less than myself she trusted you to protect her and what have you done swilled and trolloped with the others and this is the extent of vour effort gersen thought the outburst exaggerated but made a mild re ply if i could contrive some feasible course of action i would do so and in the meantime in the meantime i am learning learning what i find that none of the people here know viole falushe by sight his offices seem to be somewhere back in the mountains i can find them nowhere in the valley i dare not try to cross the stone wall to the west nor the thorn barrier to the east i would certainly be apprehended and journalist or not dealt with harshly since i have no weapons i can demand nothing i must be patient if i do not speak to him here at the palace of love i will no doubt find opportunity elsewhere all for your magazine eh wtiy else asked gersen the demon princes they had come to the glade of the druids dakaw and pruitt were delving as usual below the great oak where they had excavated a chamber tall enough for a man to stand erect navarth approached peered down into the sweating dust streaked faces wtiat do you do down there you burrowing dru ids are you not pleased with the vista above ground that you seek a new viewpoint below you are facetious said pruitt coldly be on your way this is holy soil how can you be so sure it looks like ordinary dirt neither pruitt nor dakaw made response navarth barked down what sort of mischief are you up to this is no ordinary pastime speak now go awy old poet said pruitt your breath is a pollution and saddens the tree navarth moved back and watched the digging from a little dis tance i do not like holes in the ground he told gersen they are unpleasant look at wible yonder he stands as if he were overseer to the project navarth pointed toward the entrance to the glade where wible stood legs apart hands clasped behind his back whistling between his teeth navarth joined him the work of the druids enthralls you not at all said lerand wible they dig a grave as i suspected for whom that i cant be sure perhaps you perhaps me i doubt ifthev will inter me said navarth you may be more pliable i doubt if they will inter anyone said wble whistling once more through his teeth indeed how can you be so sure come to the consecration and see for yourself when does this rite occur tomorrow night so i have been informed little music was to be heard on the grounds of the palace the quiet of the garden was as crystalline and clear as a dewdrop but on the following morning the folk in white brought forth stringed instru ments and for an hour played a wistful music rich with plangent overtones a sudden shower sent all hurrying to the shelter of a nearby rotunda where they stood chattering like birds and peering the palace of love up at the sky gersen contemplating their faces thought how frail and tenuous was the connection between them and the guests did they know anything except frivolity and love and there was the question raised by navarth what happened when they aged few in the garden were past the first bloom of their maturity the sun came forth the garden glinted with freshness gersen drawn by curiosity went to the druids glade within one of the shelters he glimpsed billikas pale face then wust came to stare at him from the doorway the long afternoon passed today a portent hung in the air and uneasiness seemed to infect everyone evening arrived the sun sank in a great tumult of clouds gold orange and red flamed over head and far into the east with the coming of dusk folk of the garden went to the druids glade to each side of the oak tree were fires tended bv druidess laidig and dmidess wust druid pruitt emerged from his shelter he went to the fane and began his address his voice was heavy and resonant he paused frequently as if to hear the echoes of his words lerand wible approached gersen i am speaking to everyone in our group whatever happens do not interfere do you agree to this naturally not i didnt think you would well then wible whispered a few words gersen grunted wible moved off to speak to navarth who tonight was carrying a staff after wible spoke navarth threw down his staff on each world a hallowed tree how does it become so by the afflatus by the concentration of life oh worshipful druids who share the life of the first germ bring forth your awe your most poignant dedication wtiat say we two are here two have lived for this consecration come forth druids go to the tree from one shelter staggered hule from the other billika baffled dulleyed as if bewildered or drugged they stared this way and that then saw the fires fascinated they approached step by slow step silence was heavy in the glade the two approached the tree looked at the fires then descended into the hole below the tree behold called pruitt they enter the life of the tree oh blessed pair which now becomes the soul of the world exalted children lucky two forever and ever stand in sun in rain by day by night and help us to truth druids dakaw pruitt and diffiani ii dimon princes began to spade earth into the hole they worked uth gusto in half an hour the hole was fall the soil banked around the roots the druids marched around the tree holding brands from the rire each called forth an invocation and the ceremony ended with a chant the druids customarily breakfasted at the refectory of the near village the morning after the consecration they marched across the meadows entered the refectory behind them came hule and bilhka the druids took their usual places as did hule and billika wust was the first to notice she pointed a trembling finger laidig screamed pruitt leapt away then turned and ran from the refectory dakaw fell back like a halffilled sack skcbou diffiam sitting bolt upright stared in puzzlement hule and billika ignored the consternation they had caused laidig sobbing and gasping reeled from the room followed by wust diffiam was the least disturbed he spoke to hule how did you get out by a tunnel said hule wible caused a tunnel to be dug wible came forward the servants are here to be used i used them we dug a tunnel diffiani nodded slowly he reached up took off his cowl in spected it and tossed it into a corner dakaw roaring rose to his feet he struck once at hule knock ing him to the floor then aimed a tremendous blow at wible who stepped back grinning go back to your tree dakaw dig another hole and bury yourself dakaw marched from the inn wust and laidig were finally discovered crouching in a bower pruitt had run south bevond the precincts of the garden and was seen no more in some fashion the episode with the druids had broken a web the guests looking at each other knew that the end of their visit was approaching that soon they would be departing the palace of love gersen stood looking up at the mountains patience was well and good but he might never be so close to viole falushe again he pondered the small clues he had gleaned it seemed reason able to suppose that the banquet hall communicated with viole the imlle of lolv falushes apartments gersen went to examine the portal at the foot of the stairs it showed a blank featureless face the mountainside above was not climbable to the east where crags reared over the sea viole falushe had set a thorn palisade to the west the way was barred by a stone wall gersen turned to look south if he made a long journey cir cling the periphery of the garden he would then be able to climb into the mountains to approach the area from above this was the sort of purposeless activity gersen detested he would be mov ing without knowledge without plan there must be some better method but he could think of none very well then activity he looked at the sun six hours of daylight remained he must go far afield and trust to luck if he were apprehended he was henry lucas journalist in search of information a statement of sufficient force unless viole falushe undertook to use a truthextracting de vice gersens flesh crawled the sensation annoyed him he had become soft diffident overwary reproaching himself first for cow ardice then for willful recklessness he set forth walking south away from the mountains from worlds i have knoiin by l g dusenyi the municipal temple at astropolis is a splendid edifice of red porphyry with a noteworthy altar of solid silver the astropolitans are divided into thirteen cults each dedicated to a distinct supreme deity to deter mine which image sits on high the astropolitans each seven years conduct a tournament of the gods with trials to measure paramount power inaccessible loft iness and ineffable mystery at the first trial wooden godimages are mounted upon onagers each hitched to a heavy log the onagers then are urged around a track and the winning god is credited with paramount power at the second trial the images are thrust into a glass cauldron which is then sealed and inverted the god which floats on high is credited with inaccessible loft mess the images are then concealed behind booths candidates for sacrifice are brought forward and each attempts to guess the god behind each booth the can didate with the lowest score receives unction and the blade while the god who most efficiently conceals his identity is udged ineffably mysterious over the past twentyeight years the god kalzibah has proved himself so consistently and the god syarasis has so often failed that the syaratics are gradually de serting the cult to become ardent kal ibahans the palace of i ovt the garden ended at a grove of indigenous trees of a type gersen had not seen before tall gaunt organisms with pulpy black leaves from which dripped a musty unpleasant sap fearing poison gersen breathed as shallowly as possible and was relieved to reach open ground with no other sensation than dizziness to the east toward the ocean were orchards and cultivated soil to the west a dozen long sheds were visible barns warehouses dormitories keeping to the shadow of the trees gersen walked west and presently came upon a road leading from the sheds toward the mountains no living creature was in sight the sheds seemed deserted gersen decided not to explore them they certainly were not the headquarters of viole falushe across the road was a wild area overgrown with thorny scrub gersen looked dubiously down the road best to travel by the bar rens there would be less chance of discovery he ducked across the road and struck off toward the mountains the afternoon sun shone brightly the scrub was host to swarms of small red mites which set up an impatient whirring sound when disturbed stepping around a hummock a hive or a nest of some sort gersen came upon a bloated serpenthke creature with a face uncannily human the creature saw gersen with an expression of comical alarm then rearing back it displayed a proboscis from which it evidently in tended to eect a fluid gersen beat a quick retreat and thereafter walked more wanly the road veered west away from the garden gersen crossed once more and took shelter under a cluster of yellow bladderplants he considered the mountain tracing a route which would bring him to the ridge unfortunately while climbing he would be ex posed to the gaze of anyone who happened by no help for it he took a last look around and seeing nothing to dissuade him set forth the mountainside was steep at times precipitous gersen made discouragmgly slow progress the sun swung across the sky below spread the palace of love and the garden gersens chest pounded and his throat felt numb as if it had been anesthetized the influence of the noxious blackleaved forest ever higher he climbed the panorama below grew even wider for a space the way became easier and gersen angled toward the east where presumably viole falushe maintained his head quarters motion gersen stopped short from the corner of his the demon princes eyes he had seen what he could not be sure the flicker had come from below and to his right he scrutinized the face of the mountain and presently saw what otherwise might have evaded his attention a deep cleft or fissure with a bridge between two arched apertures the whole camouflaged by a stone wall clutching and straining gersen angled down toward the cleft finally reaching a point thirty feet above the walkway there was no means to descend he could go neither forward nor up nor down his fingers were tiring his legs were cramped thirty feet too far to jump he would break his legs out upon the bridge came a pale stoopshouldered man with a large moist head a clipped shock of blackgray hair he wore a white jacket and black trousers it was the white jacket gersen now realized which had originally drawn his attention if the man should look up if a dislodged pebble should strike the bridge gersen was lost the man moved into the opposite aperture and out of sight gersen gave a fantastic grav itydefying leap to throw himself into the angle of the cleft he thrust out his legs doubled his knees pressing between the walls inch by inch he let himself down gratefully jumping the final six feet he stretched massaged sore muscles then limped over to the western doorway into which the man had disappeared a white tiled hall led back fifty yards broken by areas of glass and occasional doorways beside one of these glass areas stood the stoop shouldered man peering at something which had attracted his at tention he raised his hand and signaled from somewhere beyond gersens range of vision came a heavyshouldered man with a thick neck narrow head a coarse yellow brush of hair and white eyes the two looked through the glass and the whiteeyed man seemed to be amused gersen drew back crossing the walkway he looked up the passage to the east to see a single doorway at the far end the walls and floor were white tile ornate lamps scattered rays and planes of various colors with long stealthy strides gersen went to the far door he touched the open button no response he sought for code points or a lock hole without success the openingmechanism was con trolled from the other side in one sense this was encouraging the stoopshouldered man had come this way and it could only be to confer with whomever sat or stood or worked beyond the door it would not do to attract attention yet gersen must do some the palace of love thing and quickly at any moment one of the two men might ap proach and he had nowhere to hide he scrutinized the door with great care the latch was magnetic retraction was accomplished by an electromuscle the escutcheon plate was fixed to the panel with adhesive gersen searched his pockets but found nothing of utility loping back down the hall he reached up to the first lighting fix ture and twisted loose a decorative metal cusp with a sharp point returning to the door he pried at the escutcheon plate presently snapped it free to reveal the mechanism of the open button gersen traced the circuit and with the point of his metal cusp shorted across the relay contacts he touched the button the door slid aside silent as a whisper gersen passed through the opening into an unoccupied foyer he replaced the escutcheon plate and let the door slide shut there was much to see the far end of the room was ripple glass to the left an archway opened upon a flight of stairs to the right were five cinematic panels each displaying jheral tinzy in various guises at different stages of existenceor were they five different girls one wearing a short black skirt was drusilla way les gersen recognized the expression on her face the droop to her mouth the restless habit of tossing her head to the side another this a delightful imp in clowns regalia cavorted on a stage ajheral tinzy of thirteen or fourteen in the translucent white gown of a sleepwalker moved slowly across an eerie setting of stone black shadow and sand a fourth jheral tinzy a year or two younger than drusilla wore only a barbaric skirt of leather and bronze she stood on a stoneflagged terrace and seemed to be performing a religious ritual a fifth jheral tinzy a year or two older than dru silla walked briskly along a city street gersen glimpsed all this in the space of two seconds the effect was fascinating but he could not spare time to look for beyond the rippleglass wall was the distorted image of a tall spare man gersen crossed the foyer on four silken strides his hand went to the open button of the door he tensed touched the button the door failed to open gersen exhaled a long slow sigh of frustration the man turned his head sharply all gersen could see was distor tion and blur retz back once more he jerked his head suddenly forward the glass was evidently permeable to his vision its lu cas henry lucas the journalist his voice took on a harsh edge there is a need for much explanation what are you doing here the demon princes the answer is obvious said gersen i came here to inter view you there seemed no other way how did you find my office i climbed the mountain jumped down where the walkway crosses the notch then i came along the passageway indeed indeed are you a human fly to traverse the cliff it was not so difficult said gersen there would be no other opportunity this is a serious annoyance said viole falushe do you recall my comments on the subject of privacy i am rigid on this score your comments were addressed to your guests said gersen i am here as a man with a job to do your occupation gives you no license to break laws viole falushe stated in a gentle voice you are aware of my wishes which here as elsewhere in the cluster are law i find your trespass not only insolent but inexcusable in fact it goes far beyond the brashness ordinarily tolerated in a journalist it almost seems gersen interrupted please do not let your imagination dom inate your sense of proportion i am interested in the photographs in the foyer they seem to be the likeness of the young lady who accompanied us on our journey navarths ward this is the case said viole falushe i have a strong interest in the young woman i entrusted her upbringing to navarth with unhappy results she is a wanton where is she now i have not seen her since we arrived at the palace she is enjoying her visit in circumstances somewhat different from yours said viole falushe but why your interest she is nothing to you except that i befriended her and tried to clarity certain issues which she found confusing and these issues were you will allow me to use candor why not you can hardly provoke me more than you already have the girl was fearful of what might happen to her she wanted to live a normal life but did not care to risk retaliation for actions she could not avoid the palce of lovt viole falushes voice trembled is this how she spoke of me only in terms of fear and retaliation she had no reason to speak otherwise you are a bold man mr lucas surely you know my repu tation i subscribe to a doctrine of general equity that he who commits a grievance must repair the effects of his act what ofjheral tinzy gersen inquired hoping to divert vi ole falushe jheral tinzy viole falushe breathed the name dearjheral as wilful and promiscuous as the unfortunate girl whom you be friended jheral could never quite repay the damage she wrought upon me oh those wasted years viole falushes voice quavered grief lay near the surface never could she requite her wrongs though she did her best she is alive no viole falushes mood changed once more why do you ask i am a journalist you know why i am here i want a photo graph ofjheral tinzy for our article this is a matter i do not care to publicize i am puzzled by the resemblance between jheral tinzy and the girl drusilla can you explain this i could said viole falushe but i do not choose to do so and there still remains your intrusion which has shocked me to such an extent that i demand retribution and viole falushe leaned negligently back against an article of furniture gersen reflected a moment flight was futile attack was im possible viole falushe certainly carried a weapon gersen had none galling though the situation might be he must persuade vi ole falushe to change his mind he tried a reasonable approach conceivably i violated the letter of your regulations but what avail is an article on the palace of love without the comments of its creator there is no communicating with you since you choose to keep yourself aloof from your guests viole falushe seemed surprised navarth knows my callcode well a servant would have brought you a telephone unit you might have called me at any time this did not occur to me said gersen thoughtfully no i had not considered the telephone you say navarth knows the code rm divio princfs s certainly it is the same as that which i use on earth the fact remains said gersen i am here you have seen part one of the proected article parts two and three are even more highly colored if we want to present your point of view it is important that we speak together so open the door and we will discuss the matter no said viole falushe it is my whim to remain anony mous since i enjoy mingling with my guests well then he grumbled i suppose i must swallow my outrage it is not ust that you should evade your debt to me perhaps you will not in any event for the moment you may regard yourself as reprieved he spoke a soft word that gersen did not hear a door opened m the foyer go within this is my library i will speak with you there gersen passed into a long room carpeted in dark green a heavy table at the center supported a pair of antique lamps and a selection of current periodicals one wall was lined with ancient books the shelves sliding up or down through floor and ceiling to magazines above and below there was a standard microreference system a number of soft chairs gersen looked around with a trace of envy the atmosphere was quiet civilized rational remote from the hedonistic life of the pal ace a screen glowed to reveal viole falushe sprawling in a chair a light threw his form into silhouette he was no more identifiable now than before very well then said viole falushe so here we are you have been making your photographic records i believe i have several hundred pictures more than necessary to cover the superficial aspects of the palace that which you display to your guests viole falushe seemed amused and you are curious as to what else occurs from a journalistic standpoint hm what do you think of the palace then it is remarkably pleasant you have a reservation something is lacking perhaps the flaw lies in your servants they lack depth they do not seem real i recognize this said viole falushe they ha e no traditions the only remedy is time they are also without responsibility after all they are slaves the palace of iave not quite for they do not realize it they consider themselves the fortunate folk and such they are it is precisely this unreality this sense of faerie that i have been at pains to develop and when they age what then wtiat becomes of the fortu nate folk some work the farms surrounding the gardens some are sent elsewhere to the real world they are sold as slaves all of us are slaves in some wise how are you a slave i am victim to a terrible obsession i was a sensitive boy cru elly thwarted i daresay navarth has provided the details rather than submit i was forced by my sense of justice to seek compen sation which i am still seeking i am a man much maligned the public considers me a voluptuous sybarite an erotic glutton the reverse is true i am why mince matters absolutely ascetic i must remain so until my obsession is relieved i am a man cursed but you are not interested in my personal problems since naturally they are not for publication nevertheless i am interested jheral tmzy is the source of your obsession precisely viole falushe spoke in a measured voice she had blighted my life she must expunge this blight is this not justice to date she has proved unwilling incapable how could she remove the obsession viole falushe stirred fretfully in his chair are you so un imaginative we have explored the matter far enough so jheral tinzy is yet alive yes indeed but i understood you to say that she was dead life death these are imprecise terms who then is drusilla the girl you left with navarth is she jheral tmzy she is who she is she made a dreadful mistake she failed and navarth failed for navarth should have schooled her she is friv olous and wanton she trafficked with other men and she must serve as jheral tmzy served thus it shall be forever and ever until finally there is expiation until i can feel soothed and whole by this time there is a terrible score to pay thirty years think of it the dfmon princfs viole falushes voice vibrated and cracked thirty years sur rounded by beauty and incapable ofenoymg it thirty long years i would not presume to give you advice said gersen some what dryly i need no advice and naturally what i tell you is in confidence you would be ungracious to publish it i would be grieved and forced to demand satisfaction what then may i publish whatever you like so long as i am not mured wtiat of the other events here wtiat goes on at the other end of the hall viole falushe considered him a moment gersen could sense but not see the smoulder in his eyes but he spoke in a light voice this is the palace of love i am interested m the subject even fascinated through the mechanism of sublimation i have an elab orate program of research under way i explore the emotion in artificial and arbitrary circumstances i do not choose to discuss the matter any further at this time perhaps five years from now or ten i will publish a resume of my findings they will provide fas cinating insights in regard to the photographs m the foyer viole falushe jumped to his feet no more we have talked too much i find myself uneasy you have provoked this hence i have arranged a similar uneasiness for you which will go far to soothe me thereafter caution discretion make the most of your time because shortly you must return to reality wtiat of you you remain here no shall also leave the palace my work here is accom plished and i have an important mission on alphanor which well may change all be so good as to step into the hall my friend helaunce awaits you helaunce thought gersen this would be the whiteeyed man slowly with viole falushe watching him from the screen gersen turned and went to the door the whiteeyed man waited in the hall he carried an obect something like a flail a rod terminating m a set of cords he appeared to carry no other weapon remove your clothes said helaunce you are to be chas tised best that you confine your chastisement to words said ger the palcf of love sen revile me all you like in the meantime let us return to the garden helaunce smiled i have m orders be as difficult as you like the orders must and will be carried out not by you said gersen you are too thick and too slow helaunce flourished the flail the cords made a sinister crackling sound quick or you will make us impatient and the punishment will be commensurate helaunce was hard and tough gersen noted obviously a trained fighter perhaps as welltrained as himself helaunce was also thirty pounds heavier if he had a weakness it was not apparent gersen suddenly sat down in the hall put his hands to his face and began to sob iielaunce stared in puzzlement off with your clothes do not sit there he came forward nudged gersen with his foot up gersen umped up with helaunces foot clamped to his chest helaunce hopped backward gersen gave the foot a cruel twist applying torque to omts where muscles could interpose no protec tion helaunce cried out in agony then fell flat gersen wrested loose the flail struck him across the shoulder the cords hissed crackled helaunce muttered if you can walk said gersen be good enough to show me the way there was a step behind him gersen turned to glimpse a tall shape m black garments something splashed purplewhite light into his brain gersen toppled dazed there was half an hour of nightmare gersen slowly regained con trol of his faculties he lay naked in the garden beside the white palace wall his clothes were stacked neatly beside him so much for that thought gersen the project had failed not in disaster for he still had his life gersen dressed himself smiling grimly there had been an attempt to humiliate him it had not succeeded he had paid but pain like pleasure has no duration pride was an entity more persistent gersen leaned against the wall until his brain cleared his nerves still throbbed to the terrible flail there were no bruises no lacerations no more than a few red welts gersen was hungry and here was humiliation indeed he must eat viole falushes food walk through the pleasant garden that viole palushes brain had con the demon prnos ceived gersen smiled again even more wolfishly than before he had known that his life might not be altogether graceful and easy the time was about dusk the garden had never seemed more beautiful fireflies moved in the asmine bushes marble urns glowed against dark foliage as if exuding wan light of their own a troupe of girls from one of the villages came capering past tonight they wore loose white pantaloons and carried yellow lanterns see ing gersen they circled around him singing a gay song the words of which gersen could not comprehend one approached held her lantern to gersens face why so strange guestman why so gray come frolic come oin us thank you said gersen i fear tonight i would frolic very poorly indeed kiss me coaxed the girl am i not beautiful wtiy are you so sad because you must leave forever and ever the palace of love and we will remain and always be young and carry our lanterns through the night is this why you grieve gersen smiled yes i must return to a far world and i am forlorn at the thought but do not let me interfere with your oy the girl kissed his cheek tonight is your last night your last night at the palace of love tonight you must do all you have neglected so far never will there be another time the girls con tinued on their way with gersen looking after them do all i have neglected i wish i could he went to a sunken terrace where guests sat dining navarth crouched over a bowl of goulash gersen joined him an attendant wheeled forth a cart gersen who had not eaten since morning served himself navarth finally spoke whats happened you appear well used i spent an afternoon with our host indeed you spoke to him face to face almost so and you know then his identity mano ethuen tanzel i cant be sure navarth grunted and bent once more to the goulash tonight is the last night gersen said presently so they tell me i will be glad to go there is no poetry here it is as i have always set forth oy comes of its own free will it cannot be belabored look a great palace a magnificent garden the palace of lolt with live nymphs and heroes but where is the dreaming the myth only simpleminded folk find oy here your friend viole falushe would be sorry to hear you say this i cannot say less navarth turned gersen a sudden sharp look did you ask for the girl i did i learned nothing navarth closed his eyes i have become an old man i am ineffectual henry lucas whatever your name cannot you act today i tried said gersen i was not made welcome the two sat m silence then gersen asked when do we leave i know no more than you we will do what we can from the avatars apprentice in scroll from the ninth dimension struggling to the hills crest marmaduke searched for the blasted cypress which marked the hut of the symbologist there stood the tree haggard and deso late and a hut nearby the symbologist gave him welcome a hundred leagues i have come said marmaduke to put a single question do the colors have souls did anyone aver otherwise asked the perplexed symbologist he caused to shine an orange light then lifting the swing of his gown he cavorted with great zest marmaduke watched with pleasure amused to see an old man so spry the symbologist brought forth green light crouching under the bench he thrust his head between his ankles and turned his gown outside to in while mar maduke clapped his hands for wonder the symbologist evoked red light and leaping upon marmaduke playfully wrestled him to the floor and threw the gown over his head my dear fellow gasped marmaduke winning free but you are brisk in your demonstration what is worth doing is worth doing well the symbologist replied now to expatiate the colors ad mit of dual import the orange is icterine humor as well as the mirth of a dying heron the palace of love green is the essence of secondthoughts likewise the mode of the north wind red as we have seen ac companies rustic exuberance and a second import of the red marmaduke asked the symbologist made a cryptic sign that re mains to be seen as the cat said who voided into the sugar bowl amused and edified marmaduke took his leave and he was quite halfway down the mountain before he dis covered the loss of his wallet the last night at the palace of love was celebrated by a fete there was music intoxicating fumes a whirl of dancers from the villages those who had formed attachments made woeful conver sation or indulged in a final frenzy of passion others sat quietly each in his private mood and so passed the night one by one the colored lights blinked and dimmed the folk in white slipped away through the garden gloom one by one the guests took themselves to their couches alone or in the company that pleased them most the garden was quiet dew began to form on the grass to each of the guests went a servant the time has come to leave to grumblings and protests the servants made but one reply these are our orders the air car waits those who are not on hand must walk their way back to kouhila the guests once more were provided new clothing an austere costume of blue black and dark green they were then guided to an area somewhat south of the palace where a large air car waited gersen counted all here except pruitt and drusilla ethuen mario and tanzel stood nearby if one were viole falushe it seemed that now he planned to return to the oikumene with the others gersen went forward glanced into the pilots compartment here sat helaunce the guests were filing into the air car gersen took navarth aside wait why no matter tanzel and ethuen were aboard now mario climbed the ladder gersen spoke hurriedly go aboard make a disturbance pound on the bulkhead shout there is an emergency lock between the saloon and the pilots compartment pull this w dfmon princfs open distract the pilot try not to incite either mano ethuen or tan el they must not be encouraged to interfere navarth looked at him blankly what is the use of this no matter do as i say where is drusilla where is jheral tinzv wtrv are they not aboard yes why are they not aboard i am truly outraged na varth jumped up the ladder thrusting aside the druidess laidig wit he called we are not all present wtiere is zan zu from endu we cannot leave without her i refuse to leave nothing will remove me quiet old fool growled torrance da nossa you do no good navarth raged back and forth lie struck on the forward bulk head pulled on the handle of the communicating door finally he launce opened the door and went aft to enforce order old man sit quietly it is by order that we now leave unless you care to walk the long road alone sit quiet come then navarth said lerand wible you achieve noth ing sit quietly very well said navarth i have protested i have done all i can i can do no more helaunce returned forward he backed into the pilots com partment closed the door gersen waiting to the side struck him over the head with a stone helaunce staggered spun around he saw gersen through eyes blinded by blood and gave an inarticulate cry gersen struck again helaunce fell aside gersen settled himself at the controls up rose the air car up into the light of the rising sun gersen searched helaunce and found two proacs which he tucked into his own pocket slackening speed until the air car only drifted he slid open the door and rolled helaunce out and away in the saloon thought gersen viole falushe must be wonder ing as to the peculiar course helaunce was steering gersen sought around the ocean and presently spied a small island some twenty miles from the shore he circled it and seeing no sign of habitation landed the air car he jumped to the ground going to the saloon port he pulled it open and umped inside everybody out quick and he ges tured with the projacs wible stuttered wtiat does this mean thl palaleoflove it means everybody out navarth umped to his teet gome along he bawled f erybody out uncertainly the guests filed outside mano came to the door gersen halted him you must remain be very careful and do not move or i will kill you tanzel came by and ethuen both were intercepted ordered to sit finally the saloon was empty but for gersen mano tanzel and ethuen outside navarth excitedly harangued the group make no interference you will regret it this is ipcc business i know it for a fact navarth gersen called from the saloon your assistance please navarth climbed back into the saloon he searched mano tanzel and ethuen while gersen stood vigilantly by neither weapons nor clues to the identity of viole falushe were discovered to gersens direction navarth tied the three men to chairs using various oddments of cord strips of fabric and thongs meanwhile the three excoriated gersen and demanded the basis for his per secution tanzel was the most verbose ethuen the most acrimo nious and mano the most enraged all glared and cursed with equal vigor gersen accepted the remarks with equanimity i will apologize to two of you later those two aware of their innocence will cooperate with me prom the third man i expect trouble i am prepared for it tanzel asked in jehus name then what do you vish of us name your third man and have done vogel filschner is his name said gersen otherwise known as viole falushe why pick on us go seek him at the palace gersen grinned not a bad idea he tested the bonds of the three men tightened here reknotted there navarth you sit here to the side watch these three carefully one of them took jheral tinzy from you tell me which one vogel filschner you dont recognize him i wish i could he pointed to mano this one has his shifty eye he indicated tanzeps hands this one has a mannerism i remember in vogel he turned to inspect ethuen and this one has a store of spite and clearly is unhappy nie lmon princes certainly im unhappy snapped ethuen why should i re pice watch them well said gersen we return to the palace ignoring the outcries of the marooned guests he took the air car aloft so far so good but what next conceivably his reasoning was awry conceivably neither tanzel nor mano nor fthuen was viole falushe thinking back over the circumstances of the ourney to the palace he discarded the notion the best method of ingress to the apartments of viole falushe was from above gersen had no stomach for another climb around the cliff he landed the air car beside the stone castle and went back into the saloon all was as before navarth sat glaring at the three captives who regarded him with loathing gersen gave navarth one of the projacs if there is difficulty kill all three i go to look for drusilla and jheral tinzy you must guard them with care navarth laughed wildly wtio can trick a mad poet i know him this instant i intend to keep the weapon at his throat gersen could not restrain a sense of misgiving navarth was not the most stable of guardians remember if he escapes we are lost he may want a glass of water let him thirst his bonds may be too tight he must suffer show no mercy if there is inter ference from outside shoot all three with pleasure very well keep your madness in check till i return gersen went to the door through which three weeks previously the sodden band of pilgrims had entered the door was locked he blasted awav the hardware and entered there was no sound the dank rooms were empty gersen went down the hall descended by the way the girl in blue velvet had taken him and finally found the banquet room now dim smelling faintly of perfume and wine gersen moved more cautiously from the banquet room a way led down to the garden another must lead to viole falushes apart ments gersen checked the walls and finally behind a hanging he found a narrow door of heavy wood barred with metal once again he burnt his way through a spiral staircase led down into the chamber to the back of the circular foyer thepleoi i we gersen searched the room he found a black leather notebook containing exhaustive notes upon the psychology of jheral tinzy and the various methods by which viole falushe hoped to win her it seemed that viole falushe wanted more than love he wanted submission abect quivering abasement derived from a mingling of love and fear so far reflected gersen viole falushe had fallen short in his goal he tossed the portfolio aside on the wall was a telescreen gersen turned a knob drusilla wayles wearing a white robe sat on a bed she was pale thin but apparently unharmed gersen turned the knob he looked out upon a gloomy area of sand among tall rock pinnacles to the back were five dark deodors and a little cabin hardly larger than a doll house sitting on a bench was a girl about fourteen years old a girl almost identical to dru silla she wore a transparent white gown her face had a peculiarly sweet peculiarly pensive expression as if she had only just awak ened from a pleasant dream from the side came a tall nonhuman creature walking on thin blackfurred legs it stopped beside the girl spoke in a thin highpitched voice the girl responded without interest gersen turned the knob again to bring into view a terrace in front of what appeared to be a temple inside could be glimpsed the statue of a divinity on the steps stood another drusilla this one sixteen years old wearing only a kirtle and a copper fillet to confine her hair elsewhere were other men and women similarly dressed to the side was the suggestion of a shore with water be yond gersen turned the knob again and again and again he looked into various environments various types of rooms and cages they contained an assortment of boys girls youths maidens young men and women sometimes separate sometimes together here were viole falushes experiments from which he evidently extracted a voyeurs pleasure gersen saw no more versions of drusilla urgency prickled at his nerves stemming from his lack of faith in navarth he set otf along the hall and crossing the bridge he entered the laboratory section to the west here was the locale of the experiments in cages and chambers behind oneway mirrors gersen found retz the stoopshouldered technician sitting in a small office he looked up startled at the sight of gersen what do you do here are you a guest the master will be displeased hf dfmon princes i am master now gersen displayed the projac where is the girl who resembles jheral tinzy retz blinked halfdefiant hairdoubtful i can tell you noth ing gersen struck him with the gun quick the girl who came here three weeks ago retz began to whine what can i tell you viole falushe will punish me viole falushe is a prisoner gersen leveled the gun take me to the girl or i will kill you retz made a despairing sound he will do terrible things to me no longer retz waved his arms walked down the corridor suddenly he stopped turned around you say he is your prisoner he is what do you plan to do with him kill him and what of the palace we shall see take me to the girl will you leave me here in charge of the palace i will kill you unless you make haste disconsolately retz moved on gersen spoke to him what has viole falushe done to her nothing yet what did he plan an autofertihzation a virgin birth so to speak in due course she would bear a female child precisely like herself jheral tmzy gave birth to her in this way exactly and how many others six others then she killed herself where are the other five ah as to that i cant say retz was lying but gersen allowed the statement to go un challenged retz paused by a door looked craftily over his shoulder the girl is within whatever she reports you must remember that i am only an underling here i only obey orders then youll obey mine open the door retz hesitated a final the palace of love instant with a glance over gersens shoulder down the hall as if hoping against hope for succor he sighed slid back the door drusilla sitting on the bed looked up with alarm she saw gersen her expression changed from astonishment to oy she jumped up from the bed ran to gersen sobbed in relief i hoped youd come theyve done such dreadful things to me retz thought to take advantage of gersens distraction and started to slink away gersen called him back not so fast i have use for you he spoke to drusilla has viole falushe shown him self to you will you recognize him he came to stand in the doorway with the light at his back he did not want me to see him he was savage he hated me he said i had been faithless asked how this was possible since i had promised him nothing he became absolutely cold he said that it had been my duty to wait to maintain my ideals until he had come and even then he said i had played him false at navarths party and also on the journey gersen said one thing is certain then he is tanzel or ethuen or mano which did you like the least tanzel tanzel eh well retz here will show us certainly which is viole falushe will you not retz how can i he has never shown himself to me except behind the glass of his office unlikely thought gersen still not impossible where are the other daughters of jheral tmzy six there were muttered retz viole falushe killed the two oldest there is one on alphanor this one he indicated dru silla was sent to earth the youngest is to the east of the palace where the mountains meet the sea the next is priestess to the god arodm on the large island directly to the east retz said gersen i hold viole falushe a captive i am your new master do you understand this retz nodded sulkily if this is how it must be can you identify viole falushe he is a tall man he has dark hair he can be harsh or soft cruel or easy beyond that i do not know these are my orders to you liberate these poor captives impossible fluted retz they know no other life than their the demon princks peculiar environments the open air the sun the sky they would go mad this is your task then as gently and easily as possible bring them forth i will return shortly and see how well you have done your job further make known to the folk in the garden that they are no longer slaves that they are free to go or to stay mind you i will pen you in closet and punish you for your crimes if you do not obey me i will obey muttered retz i am accustomed to obedience i know nothing else gersen took drusillas arm i worry about navarth we dare not be gone too long but when they returned up through the castle and out to the air car circumstances were as before the three captives were se cure and navanh held the weapon unblinkingly at their heads his eyes glowed at the sight of drusilla what ofjheral tinzy she is dead but she had daughters there are others what has transpired while i was gone talk blandishments persuasion threats of course who was most insistent tanzel gersen turned tanzel a cool inspection tanzel shrugged do you think i enjoy sitting here trussed like a chicken one of you is viole falushe said gersen which i won der well we must undo more of the dreadful mischief performed in the name of love he took the air car aloft cruised slowly east over the moun tains at the oceans edge where the crags submerged into the water a gloomy defile opened upon a narrow gray beach behind was a sandy open area perhaps an acre in extent gersen lowered the air car into the shadows and landed he jumped out drusilla iv the youngest of the group came slowly forward from a fissure to the back two nonhuman nursemaids made angry chattering sounds the girl asked are you the man the man who is coming to love me gersen grinned i am a man true enough but who is the man drusilla iv looked vaguely toward the fissure they have told me of the man there is one of me and one of him and when i see him i must love him this is what i have learned the palace of lw but you have never seen this man no you are the first man i have ever seen the first person like myself you are wonderful there are many men in the world said gersen they told you a falsehood come aboard i will show you other men and a girl like yourself drusilla iv looked around the dreary defile in alarm and be wilderment will you take me from here i am frightened you need not be said gersen come aboard now of course she took his hand trustingly and entered the sa loon at the sight of the passengers she halted in astonishment i never knew so many people existed she examined mano ethuen and tanzel critically i dont like them they have foolish wicked faces she turned to gersen i like you you are the first man i have ever seen you must be the man and i will stay with you forever gersen watched the faces of mario ethuen and tanzel this must make poor hearing for viole falushe all sat stonyfaced glar ing at gersen with equal degrees of detestation except at the cor ner oftanzels mouth a tiny muscle twitched gersen took the air car aloft and flew out toward the largest of the islands almost immediately he spied the temple looming above a village of cane and frond gersen landed the air car in the square while villagers watched in amazement and alarm from the temple sauntered drusilla iii a girl confident and selfpossessed exactly identical to the other drusillas vet in some sense different as the other two were different once more gersen alighted from the air car drusilla iii in spected him with candid interest wtio are you i come from the mainland said gersen i come to speak to you you want a rite performed go elsewhere arodin is impotent i have beseeched him to send me elsewhere among other boons there is no response gersen looked into the temple that is his likeness within yes am priestess to the cult let us go to look at the image there is nothing to see a statue sitting on a throne gersen went into the temple at the far end sat a figure twice as large as life the head ws rudely defaced nose ears chin broken thf demon prinos away gersen turned to drusilla iii in wonder who damaged the statue i did why i did not like his face according to the rote arodin must come in the flesh to take me for his bride i am enjoined to pray to the statue for the earliest nuptials possible i broke the face to delay the process i do not like being a priestess but i am allowed to be nothing else i hoped that after i denied the image another priestess might be appointed this has not occurred will you take me away yes arodin is no god he is a man gersen took drusilla iii into the saloon pointed out mano ethuen tanzel observe the three men does one of them resemble the statue of arodin before you defaced it one of the men blinked yes said drusilla iii yes indeed there is the face of aro din she pointed to tanzel the man who had blinked tanzel cried out here here whats going on what are you trying to do i want to identify viole falushe said gersen why pick on me im not arodin nor viole falushe nor yet beelzebub for that matter im good old harry tanzel of london no more no less and ill thank you to take these ropes from my arms in due course said gersen in due course he turned to drusilla iii youre sure that he is arodin of course why is he tied i suspect him of being a criminal drusilla iii laughed a clear merry sound wtiat a dreadful oke a man like that putting up a statue to himself and calling himself a god what did he hope to gain you me all this effort for me he wanted you to love him to worship him again drusilla ills laughter ran through the ship a great deal of wasted effort and gersen watching closely thought he saw a pink flush seep across tanzels face you are ready to leave here yes who are these other girls who so resemble me the palace of love your sisters how strange yes viole falushe or arodin if you prefer is a strange man gersen took the air car aloft set it to cruising slowly on the automatic pilot while he cogitated still no absolute proof to the identity of vole falushe a twitch of the mouth a seep of color a defaced countenance interesting but hardly incontrovertible evi dence essentially he was no closer to the identity of viole fa lushe than when he set out on the ourney he looked back into the saloon navarth had become bored with his duties and was watching the girls with a halfexpectant halfforlorn expression perhaps by some miracle they would merge to become his own jheral tinzy gersen sifted his courses of action they were few if he had access to one or another of the truth drugs viole falushes identity would emerge swiftly enough there vas no one at the palace of love who could recognize viole falushe probably no one at atar or kouhila on earth navarth knew viola falushes callcode gersen rubbed his chin navarth navarth came into the pilots compartment gersen indicated the communication system and gave instructions navarth grinned from ear to ear gersen went back to the saloon seated himself near tanzel he looked through into the pilots compartment nodded to na varth navarth tapped viole falushes callcode gersen bent forward at the lobe of tanzefs ear sounded a faint whir an almost im perceptible vibration tanzel erked strained at his bonds navarth spoke softly into the forward microphone viole fa lushe can you hear me viole falushe tanzel jerked around to meet gersens appraising stare there could be no more dissembling viole falushe was unmasked a look of desperation came over his face he writhed against his bonds viole falushe said gersen the tune has come who are you gasped viole falushe ipcc gersen made no answer navarth came back so this is he i knew it all the time he inflicted me with chill where is jheral tinzy vogep viole falushe licked his lips you two have plotted to kill me s thf demon princfs gersen and navarth carried him forward into the pilots com partment closed the door communicating with the saloon why cried viole falushe why must you do this to me navarth turned to gersen do you need me no goodbye vogel said navarth you have lived a remark able life he went back into the saloon gersen slowed the air car to a hover he opened the port ten thousand feet below spread the ocean why why why cried viole falushe why do you do this to me gersen spoke in a dry voice you are a monomaniac i am the same wen i was a child the five demon princes brought their ships to mount pleasant do you recall long ago oh so long ago they destroyed they killed they enslaved everything i loved family friends all destroyed the demon princes are my obsession i have killed two of them you will be the third i am not henry lucas the journalist i am kirth gersen and all my life is aimed toward this he stepped toward viole ealushe who made a ter rible wrenching exertion his bonds snapped he lurched flung out his arms and toppled back and out the port gersen watched the long figure drifting down toward the ocean until it passed from sight then he closed the port and returned to the saloon navarth had already released mano and ethuen my apologies to you said gersen i hope you have not been seriously mured ethuen gave him a look of unspeakable dislike mano made a muttering sound in his throat well then said navarth cheerfully wtiat now we will pick up our friends said gersen no doubt they are wondering what is to become of them then what growled ethuen how are we to find our way back to sogdian we have no spaceship gersen laughed were you deceived this is sogdian that is the sun miel how could you not notice why should i a lunatic pilot careened through the cluster for hours a subterfuge zog was no lunatic but he was careless he per formed no acclimatiation routine when he flung open the port he palace of l t there was no difference in pressure or composition the light was the same intensity the gravity was the same the sky was the same color the clouds were of the same shape the flora of the same type i noticed nothing said navarth but i am no space traveler i ieel no shame if i ever return to farth i shall never depart again plrst a stop at the city of kouhila the folk wilt be pleased to learn that they need pay no further taxes at afar gersen found the distis pharaon as he had left it mano wible and da nossa had spaceboats of their own the other guests were conveyed back to the oikumene by the ship which viole fa lushe had ordered for their use navarth and the three drusillas came aboard the pharaon gersen flew them to new wexford and put them aboard the packet for earth i will send you money he told navarth it will be for the girls you must make sure that they are raised properly i have done my best with zan zu said navarth gruffly she is raised wtiat is amiss with her the others will need more care exactly and when i am next on earth i will see you good we will sit on the deck of my houseboat and drink my fine wine navarth turned away gersen took a deep breath went to say goodbye to drusilla wayles she came close to him took his hands wtry cant i come with you wherever you go i cant explain to you but no not now i tried it once to no avail i would be different know you are but there might be worse problems i might not be able to part with you will i ever see you again i dont think so drusilla turned away goodbye she said listlessly gersen took a step after her halted then swung around and went his way gersen chartered a freight earner and took it to the palace of love the gardens seemed wild and less well tended an indefinable gloom had come over the airy structures ihf dtmon princfs retz greeted him with cautious cordiality i have been doing your bidding slowly easily not to disturb or alarm he took gersen on a tour of the special environments he de scribed the weird and intricate thoughtpatterns viole falushe had imposed upon his young victims one by one the victims were emerging into the upper air some astonished some delighted some dazzled and frightened and whimpering to return the villages in the garden had changed many of the fortunate folk had departed others had returned from the backlands with their children in time the palace of love would become a remote farm community gersen could not leave viole falushes books to moulder he loaded them aboard the freighter and consigned them to the care ofjehan addels at new wexford with a final admonition for retz gersen himself departed and flew off through the stars of sirneste cluster back toward the oikumene months later sitting on the esplanade at avente on alphanor gersen saw a young woman approaching she wore fashionable gar ments in the best of taste she obviously had been raised in an atmosphere of gentility and good manners on a sudden impulse gersen stepped forward please excuse me he said but you resemble someone i know on earth are your parents earthfolk the girl listened without embarrassment she shook her head this may seem strange but i do not know my parents i may be an orphan or she made a rueful little grimace something else my guardians receive money to provide a home for me do you know my parents tell me please gersen thought what in the world am i up to why disturb the girl with the details of her background or worse the nightmare she had so narrowly avoided for here certainly was viole falu shes urgent business on alphanor gersen pretended doubt im mistaken i think the resem blance must be a coincidence you could not possibly be the person i thought you to be i dont believe you said drusilla i you know but you wont tell i wonder why not gersen grinned the girl was immensely appealing with a thousand charms and graces sit here on the bench a moment ill the palace of love read you a ballad or two from the works of the mad poet navarth when he wrote them he might have been thinking of you drusilla i seated herself an unconventional way to start an acquaintance but im an unconventional person well then read the poetry the face part aloysius from popular handbook to the planets th edition aloysius vega vi planetary constants diameter miles sidereal day hours mass standard et cetera aloysius with its sister planets boniface and cuthbert is accounted among the first worlds to be colonized from earth and the traveler who enjoys the ambience of antiq uity will here find much to please him contrary to popular assumption the first settlers were not religious zealots but members of the natural universe society who dealt gingerly with the new environment and built nothing at discord with the landscape the nus is long gone but its influence still permeates the system and almost everywhere will be noted a sedate reverence for native customs and textures the axis of aloysius inclines to an angle of degrees from its plane of orbit there are seasonal fluctuations of notable severity mollified somewhat by a dense and moist atmosphere of the seven continents marcys land is the largest with new wexford its chief city the least of the thf option princes continents is gavins land on which is situated the city pontefract it may here be noted that each land during the sac erdotal epochs represented the diocese of a cardinal and bore his name thus cardinal marcys land cardinal bod ants land cardinal dimpeys land and so forth the ap pellative has fallen into disuse and is rarely heard through a policy of low taxes and favorable regulations both pontefract and new wexford have long functioned as important financial centers with influence reaching every where across the oikumene many important publishing houses also make their headquarters at these places includ ing the prestigious cosmopolis magazine religions sects creeds movements countermove ments orthodoxies heresies inquisitions this is the stuff of early vegan history emphatically so on aloysius which de rives its name from the patron samt of the aloysian order the ambrosians who preceded the aloysians founded the city rath eileann beside lake feamish at the center of linliffets land the conflicts between these nominally de votional brotherhoods make a fascinating chronicle indigenous flora and fauna are not particularly note worthy through intensive effort by the original settlers terrestrial trees and shrubs are widespread the conifers es pecially finding a hospitable environment and the seas are stocked with selected terrestrial fish jehan addels after his meticulous habit arrived ten minutes early to the place of rendezvous before alighting from his car he took pains to scrutinize the surroundings the scenery was dramatic but apparently devoid of menace addels found nothing to excite his misgivings to the right stood phrusters inn with timbers black ened by centuries of wind and rain and the dunveary crags be yond rising crag upon buttress finally to disappear behind high mist to the left phrusters prospect confronted threequarters of a full circle and several thousand square miles of territory varying with whims of the weather addels alighted from his car cast a single skeptical glance up the awesome dunveary slopes and walked out upon the observation platform leaning against the parapet he hunched his shoulders the face against the wind and waited a thin man with parchmentcolored skin and a high balding forehead the time was close upon midmorning halfway up the sky vega glowed pale through the mist a dozen other folk stood along the parapet addels subjected each to a careful inspection their flounced and tasseled garments in muted reds browns and dark green marked them for country folk residents of the town dressed only in shades of brown with an occasional black ornament this group seemed innocent addels turned his attention to the pano rama lake feamish to the left rath eileann below vaporous moy valley to the right he frowned down at his watch the man whom he awaited had given precise instructions a lack of punc tuality might well indicate crisis addels gave a sniff to express both envy and disdain for a way of life so much more eventful than his own the time of the appointment was at hand addels noticed a path which originating at the edge of rath eileann far below slanted back and forth up the hillside to terminate at a flight of steps cut into the rock nearby up this path came a man of average stature unobtrusively muscular with rather harsh cheekbones flat cheeks thick dark hair cropped short this was kirth gersen of whom addels knew little except that by some mysterious means no doubt illegitimate gersen had come into the possession of vast wealth addels earned a large salary as gersens legal adviser to date with his scruples such as they were intact gersen seemed well acquainted with ipcc procedures which in times of stress afforded addels a degree of nervous comfort gersen ran up the steps paused saw addels and crossed the observation deck addels took dispassionate note that after a climb which would have reduced addels to a state of gasping exhaustion gersen was not even breathing deeply addels performed a stately gesture of greeting i am pleased to find you in good health exactly so said gersen your journey was pleasant i was distrait i hardly noticed said addels in a measured and meaningful voice but certainly you are enjoying your stay at the domus cf the killing machme interworld police coordinating company h di u prim fs gersen assented i sit in the lobby for hours absorbing the atmosphere tor this reason you remain here at rath eileann not altogether this is what want to discuss with you where ve wont be overheard addels looked right and left you suspect eavesdroppers at the domus up here the risk is at least minimized i have taken the usual precautions no doubt you have done the same have taken all the precautions i thought necessary said ad dels in that case we are almost certainly secure addels only response was a frosty chuckle for a moment the two men stood leaning on the parapet overlooking the gray city the lake and the misty valley beyond gersen spoke the local spaceport is at slayhack north of the lake a week from today the ettiha gatgamyi will arrive he reg istered owner is the celerus transport company based at vire on sadal suud four this ship was at one time the fanutis registered to service spaceways also at vire the registrations are both nom inal the ship then was the property of lens larque and so pre sumably is now addels pursed his lips in distaste in our conversation you mentioned his name somewhat to my distress i must admit he is a notorious criminal quite so and you intend to conduct business wath mv inadvisable he is not to be trusted our business runs along different lines as soon as the ettilia gargantyf arrives i want a lien or some other such instrument placed against ship and cargo so that the ship is impounded without any possibility of departure i want title to the ship attached so that the actual owner not his agent or his legal representative must come here to protect his interests addels frowned you want to bring lens larque here to rath eileann an extravagant hope it is worth a trial he will naturall use another identity lens larque standing before a court of law absurd at the mount pleasint raid vhcre gersul lost home and hmil rht aiititi hid heen employed as i slne trinsport the face quite so lens larque enjoys absurdities he is also avaricious if the action appears legitimate he wont want to lose his ship by default addels gave a grunt of grudging acquiescence i can tell you this at least the most convincing disguise for legitimacy is legit imacy itself there should be no trouble discovering a basis for action spaceships trail a rash of small complaints in their wake the difficulty is one of unsdiction has this ship touched rath eileann before not to my knowledge ordinarily it works the argo fringe addels said in a formal voice i will give the matter my best attention an important point to remember lens larque is not an ami able man for all his tricks and fancies my name i hardly need emphasize this must not be used you yourself would be wise to act discreetly addels ran nervous fingers through his sparse blond hair i dont care to confront him at all discreetly or otherwise nevertheless said gersen the ship must be immobilized here at rath eileann use a writ of attachment or replevin or some such document the real owner must definitely appear or else lose title by default addels said peevishly if the ownership is corporate or vested in a limited society no such result is possible the action is not all that easy gersen gave a grim laugh if it were easy id do it myself i quite understand said addels in a morose voice let me think the matter over for a day or two three days later in gersens chambers at domus st revelras a musical tone signaled an incoming call gersen touched the mon itor button a cascade of exploding asterisks certified that the line was free of interference a few seconds later addels fineboned face appeared on the screen i have made guarded inquiries spoke addels in his most di dactic voice i have obtained definite judicial opinion to the effect that an action of the sort you envisage is valid only if a local citizen has suffered substantial damage that debt or damage having opti mally occurred locally and at a recent time as of now we satisfy none of the requirements therefore we could not obtain a valid writ the demon princes gersen nodded i expected as much he waited patiently while addels pulled at his bony chin and selected words in connection with the ettilia gargantyr itself i have searched records for liens debts and other actions under litigation as ships of space pass from port to port they often incur small debts or inflict minor damages which usually no one troubles to pursue the ettiua gargantyr is no exception two years ago an incident oc curred at thrump on david alexanders planet the captain pro vided a banquet for a group of local freight agents employing ships stewards and other personnel to prepare and serve the meal instead of the gargantyr s mess hall he chose to use a chamber at the spaceport the thrump victuallers guild asserted that such a pro cess contravened local ordinance they registered a claim for lost wages and punitive damages the ship departed before a summons could be served so the action remains in abeyance pending the ships return which is unlikely addels paused to reflect gersen waited patiently addels made delicate adjustment of his thoughts and spoke on the victualler guild meanwhile negotiated a loan with a certain cooneys bank chartered at thrump on the same david alexanders planet along with other assets they pledged the cause of action against the ettilia gargantyr a month or so ago the guild defaulted on the debt and the suit has now been transferred to the interest of cooneys bank addels voice took on a speculative tone it has often occurred to me that your affairs might most flexibly be handled through a bank cooneys bank while essentially sound suffers from a tired old management the stock sells at a reasonable price and you could easily buy control branches might then be established wherever it became expedient to do so for instance at rath eileann the lawsuit could then be transferred so i assume quite correct and a lien could be laid so as to hold the ship here at rath eileann i have made inquiries in terms of hypothetical cases i find that the suit may not be filed either at the city podium nor the land court but only at the court of interworld equity which sits three times a year at the estremont under a circuit propounder i have taken counsel with a specialist in interworld equity he feels that cooneys banks case might well be prosecuted if the ettilia gargantyr arrives at rath eileann its physical presence would pro the face vide in rem jurisdiction he is certain however that no magistrate would issue a mandamus requiring the presence of the ships owner on grounds so trivial that however is the essence of the matter lens larque must come to aloysius i am advised that this cannot be enforced upon him said addels complacently i suggest that we now turn our attention to other matters who is the propounder sitting at the court we cant be sure there are five such magistrates and they travel a circuit around the vegan system the court is not now in session it has just completed its calendar and presumably wont sit again for months exactly in any case the propounder would almost certainly throw out any motion requiring the presence of the gargantyrs owner gersen nodded pensively that is inconvenient after a moment addels inquired well then what of coo neys bank shall i make acquisition let me think things over ill call you tonight very well from city of the mists in cosmopolis may on a map rath eileann shows like a twisted t along the top horizontal from right to left are the ffolliot gar dens bethamy old town the orangery with the domus behind then estremont on a lake feamish islet the ts vertical straggles to the north for miles through the moynal district then drury wigaltown dundivy gara with its dulcidrome and finally slayhack with the space port of all these districts old town exerts the most beguil ing charm despite streaming mists oddsmelling vapors crooked streets crotchety buildings this district is far from dull the local folk wear garments only in shades of brown sand and taupe through the middle tans through oak and other wood into the deepest umbers when they go abroad in the fitful vegalight their costumes against the stone black iron and sooty timbers create an effect of peculiar richness the more so for an occasional dark red yellow or dark blue turban at night old town flickers to the light of innumerable lanterns hung by ancient ordinance before the doorway of every alehouse since the crabbed streets and innumerable little alleys have never been named much less have known the presence of a namesign the stranger quickly learns to steer a course by means of the alehouses lanterns the ambrosian monks first to settle beside lake feamish built in contemptuous disregard for order in ac the face cordance with the hectic fervor of their creed the order of aloysians who came forty years later and who gave the world its name halfheartedly tried to modify old town then lost interest and after establishing the new bethamy quarter gave all their energies to the construction of tem ple st revelras gersen left the domus and sauntered north along the central pa rade of the orangery a formal garden of twenty acres inappropri ately named since among the carefully clipped trees were to be found no oranges but only yews limes and the indigenous green glass tree at the grand esplanade gersen turned east around the bend of the lake and presently crossed over a causeway to the estremont a massive structure of silvergray porphyry built on four staggered levels surmounted by four tall towers and a central dome at the justiciary gersen made a number of inquiries then even more thoughtful than before returned to the domus in his chamber he took paper and stylus and worked out a care ful schedule of times and events which he pondered with care then turning to the communicator he brought the image ofjehan addels to the screen today said gersen you outlined a pro cedure in regard to the ettiha gargantyr it was no more than a tentative idea said addels the scheme breaks down as soon as we reach the estremont the cir cuit propounder would never make us a favorable ruling you are altogether too pessimistic said gersen strange things happen the courts are unpredictable please act along the lines we discussed acquire cooneys bank and immediately charter a local branch then as soon as the gargantyr opens its hatch hit it with every kind of paper you can think of just as you say remember we are dealing with people who are careless of legal responsibility to say the least make sure that the ship is se cure serve the papers with at least a platoon of constables and immediately put the crew ashore pull the powerbar seal the junc tions with a destructionlock chain open the cargo hatch then post a strong guard with at least six armed men on duty at all times i want to make sure that the ship stays down m rath eileann i he demon princes addels essayed a morose pleasantry ill move into the cap tains cabin and guard the ship from within ive got other plans for you said gersen you wont escape so easily remember the court of intelworld equity has unsdiction there wont be another session for months depending on the cal endar we want to give the owner time to appear said gersen make sure that our action alleges malice conspiracy and a delib erate policy of interstellar fraud charges that only the owner can properly deny hell go into the dock deny everything the benchmaster will throw out the case and youll be left to sweep out the courtroom my dear addels said gersen you clearly dont understand my intentions which is ust as well just so said addels bleakly i dont even care to speculate a month later gersen once more met addels on phrusters pros pect the time was middle afternoon mists over the dunvearys had dwindled to a few wisps the landscape showed a stark grandeur to the cold glare of vegalight as before gersen had climbed the trail which led up from the ffolliot gardens at the western edge of rath eileann he stood leaning on the parapet as addels sedately arrived m his car addels crossed the road and joined gersen at the parapet in a heavy voice he said the gargantyf has landed the documents have been served the captain made an outcry and attempted to return into space he was removed from the ship and charged with attempted flight to evade the courts unsdiction he is now in cus tody all precautions have been taken the captain has sent off an information to his home office by this time addels had learned the details of gersens program and had not altogether recovered his composure he has also retained an attorney who presumably is competent and who well may wreak enormous grief upon us all gersen said let us hope that the lord high benchmaster shares our view of the case an amusing concept growled addels let us hope that we will find our terms in the carcery no less amusing from life volume i by unspiek baron bodissey if religions are diseases of the human psyche as the philosopher grmtholde asserts then religious wars must be reckoned the resultant sores and cankers infecting the ag gregate corpus of the human race of all wars these are the most detestable since they are waged for no tangible gain but only to impose a set of arbitrary credos upon anothers mind few such conflicts can match the first vegan wars for grotesque excess the issue concerns in its proximate phase a block of sacred white alabaster the aloysians in tended for temple st revelras while the ambrosians claimed the same block for their temple st bellaw the culminating battle on rudyer moor is an episode to tax the imagination the locale a misty upland of the mournan mountains the time late afternoon with vega darting shafts of pallid light here and there as roiling clouds allow on the upper slopes stand a band of haggard ambrosians in flapping brown robes carrying crooked staves carved from cornb yew below is gathered a more numerous group of the aloysian brotherhood small shortlegged men plump and portly each with ritual goatee and scalp tuft carrying kitchen cutlery and garden tools brother whimas utters a cry in an unknown language down the slope bound the ambrosians venting hysterical screams to fall upon the aloysians like wild men the bat tle goes indecisively for an hour neither side gaming ad hf dfmon pri c s vantage at sundown the ambrosian cornuttr b the creeds rigorous rule sounds the twelvetone call to vespers the anibrosians in accordance with their invariable habit place themselves in devotional attitudes the lo sians quickly set to work and destroy the entire mbrosun band well before the hour of their own devotions and so ends the battle of rudver moor back into old town creep the rew surviving amhro sians in secular harments where eventually they become a canny group oi merchants brewers atchouse keepers an tiquarians moneylenders and perhaps pursuivants of other more furtive trades as for the moysians the order disin tegrates within the century their fervor becomes no more than a quaint tradition temple st revelras becomes the domus grandest of all the vegan hostelnes temple st bellaw is only a sad tumble of mossy stone gersen sat in the public lobby of domus st revelras the ancient nave where cenobites had sweated under the gaze of the gnostic eye patrons of the contemporary domus knew little of gnosis even less of the eye but few could look about the great chamber without awe the wa enng sound of a thousand earold gong marked the hour of late afternoon into the chamber stepped a tall thin young man with a thin keen nose gray eyes of great clarity and an air of launty intelligence this was maxel rackrose local correspondent to cosmopoln now assigned to the assistance of henry eucas the identity gersen used in his role as special writer for cosniopohs maxel rackrose dropped into a chair beside gersen your sub ect is both elusive and sinister all ot which makes for interesting copy no doubt rackrose brought forth a packet of papers after a week of scouring ive turned up little more than common knowl edge the fellow has a genius for anonymity for all we know said gersen he is sitting here in the do mus lobby thats not as improbable as you might suppose rackrose gave his head a confident shake ive ust spent a week with lens larque id smell him out if he were within a mile such convictions were not necessarily to be dismissed out of the face hand thought gersen that large man yonder with the nose piece might he be lens larque definitely not youre sure certainly he exudes patchouli and ispanola but none of the reek lens larque is said to exhale secondly he corresponds to descriptions of lens larque only in that he is big bald and dressed in ugly clothes thirdly rackrose uttered a careless laugh it so happens that i know the man to be one dett mulhan who man ufactures antique tavern lamps for the tourists gersen smiled wryly ordered tea from a nearby attendant then gave his attention to rackroses documents some of the material he had already seen such as an excerpt from the mount pleasant raid by dauday warns published in coj mopolis when the demon princes met to affirm their compact the massive personalities often collided howard alantreesong mediated the disputes in a casual manner attel malagate proved as obdurate as stone viole falushe took positions based upon malicious caprice kokor hekkus while unpre dictable and innovative charmed no one lens larques ar rogance aroused much antagonism only howard alan treesong maintained equability what a wonder that the venture succeeded in any degree whatever it is a tribute to the professionalism of the group the next paper headed lens larque the flagellator was the work of erasmus heupter immediately below title and byline ap peared the drawing of a nearnaked man of immense size with a supple and sleek muscularity the head was small and shaven nar row at the cranium wider at the jaws heavy eyebrows joined over a long drooping nose the face looking out of the picture expressed an inane and lewd euphoria the man wore only sandals and short tight trousers over heavy and unpleasantly meaty buttocks and in his right hand he flourished a shorthandled whip of three long thongs rackrose chuckled if thats our man i think wed recognize him even here at the domus gersen shrugged and read the text the demon princes lens larque is said to be enamored of the whip he con siders it a trusty friend and a convenient instrument for the punishment of his enemies he uses it often to this end judging it preferable to other methods at sadabra he owns a great house with a semicircular room where he sits to take his victual great heaps of hork and pummigum consumed with tankards of must for savor he keeps by his side a fine shorthandled whip with a lash twelve and a half feet long the pommel is ivory and engraved with the whips name panak the reference has never been elucidated to this writers knowledge the lash terminates in a bifurcated flap of leather four inches long the scorpion around the wall stand lens larques enemies manacled to rings and naked as eggs to the buttocks of each is pasted a heartshaped target three inches in diameter to enliven his meal lens larque attempts to snap off the targets with the flutter of his whip and his skill is said to be fine underneath in a different typeface appeared the note the piece duplicated above appeared originally in the ga lactic review and probably is no more than the exercise of a perfervid imagination especially in regard to the illustra tion report makes lens larque out to be a large man but the giggling giant depicted above is hardly a credible rep resentation it is instructive to note that the author lrasmus iieupter dropped out of sight soon after publication of the article and was never seen again one of his associates received a short letter dear cloebe i am hard at work elucidating the meaning of the name panak already i have discovered several clues but the work is not without its little surprises pummiguin a pudding uf vellow meal meal tamarinds ogave jcivit and like fruits served in a thousand variants at restaurants catering to spacemenutoss the human uni verse the face the weather is fine still i would as lief be home in all sincerity erasmus gersen gave a soft grunt rackrose said the skin tingles a bit does it not yes quite so are you still willing to cooperate in this proj ect rackrose winced please dont use inv name as you like gersen examined the next item a sheet of type script apparently the work of rackrose himself the name lens larque is probably a pseudonym criminals tend to use false names and aliases a true name can be traced to a home locale where photographs and intimate connections are discovered secrecy and security are thereby fractured again when the criminal succeeds at his illicit business he ordinarily feels the impulse to return to his home community and there play the magnate among those who despised him in the past the pretty girl who rejected him for a conventional husband he now can patronize her especially if she has lost her good looks and lives in hard circumstances all this is possible only if he is not identifi ably a criminal hence he feels compelled to use a name of operation other than his own these concepts once they are pointed out seem quite obvious still they take us to the question what is the der ivation of an assumed name they come in two varieties first those names selected at random and intended to be nondescript and second those with symbolic significance the latter predominate among criminals of personal force and flamboyance of whom lens larque is an excellent ex ample therefore t assume the name lens larque to be an alias which carries symbolic import i visited the local utcs and ordered a search of all the languages and dialects of the oikumene

deserts at dawn and twilight preying upon ruminants and occasionally a lone man the creature is cunning swift and ferocious but is now rarely seen though as a fetish of the bugold clan it is privileged to fly freely above their domains so much for the lanslarke and on to item no of the attached papers this is the single and only account on rec ord of a meeting with lens larque at a relatively early stage of his career the narrator never identifies himself but would seem to be the official of an industrial concern the locale of the meeting is also indefinite discretion held full sway thl i j gersen turned to item no excerpt from reminiscences ot a peripatetic purchase agent by sudo nommus as published in thm t a trade journal of the met allurgical industry t he authors name as presented is quite evi dently a pseudonym we met at d public eating house a hundred yards down the road from the village the struc ture was an exercise in massive crudity as if some mon strous entity had carelessly piled great concrete blocks one on the other almost haphazard to create a set of rambling irregular enclosures these blocks whitewashed and in the suns full glare fairly dazzled the eyes the spaces within however were cool and dim and once i had overcome my fear of blocks toppling about my ears i judged the effect quaint and memorable making inquiry ot a languid servingboy i was directed to a corner table here lens larque sat to a great platter of meat and legumes the food gave off a great waft of sour spice harsh and offensive to the nostrils nevertheless a purchase agent knows no qualms so i took a seat opposite and watched him as he ate for a period he ignored me as if i were no more than one of the puffbugs drifting lazily about the room i therefore took occasion to measure him on my own terms i saw a large man heavy almost to the point of corpulence cloaked in a voluminous white garment the hood draped close about his face i could see his complexion a rich rus setbrone like the haunch of a bay horse i could likewise discern something of his features which were large but oddly pinched together or even compressed his eyes when at last he troubled to glance at me burnt with a yel low intensity which might have daunted me had i not met many another such gaze in the course of my ordinary work and which most often resulted from avaricious hope no so m this case finishing his meal the man began to speak in phrases selected as if by random and conveying no plausible import was this a novel bargaining trick did he hope to addle the demon princes my thinking under a coil of perplexities he did not know his man as ever i intended neither to be jockeyed nor hoodwinked much less swindled i heeded each word he spoke taking care to make no assents nor dissents lest these signs should be considered to form the basis of a bargain my patience seemed to work an opposite effect upon this strange man his voice became strident and harsh and his gestures cut the air like flails at last i managed to interpose a quiet suggestion into the harangue in connection with our business may i in quire your name the question caught him up short in a baleful voice he asked do you question my fidelity by no means i made haste to reply since the man was obviously truculent i have dealt with many such in the course of my business but none like this surly fellow i continued in an affable tone i am a businessman i merely wish to verify the identity of the person with whom i am dealing it is a matter of ordinary commercial practice yes yes he muttered quite so i pressed home my advantage gentlemen settling to a bargain use conventional manners and it is only polite that we address each other by name the fellow nodded thoughtfully and produced a most remarkable belch redolent of the spice he had consumed since he took no heed of the matter i gave no sign that i had noticed again he said yes yes quite so and then well it is really no great affair you may know me as lens larque leaning forward he leered at me through the folds of his cloak this name suits me well do you not agree on such short acquaintance i could not pretend to hold an opinion now our business what are your offer ings four tons of duodecimate black sg prime qual ity duodeciinates those stable transuranic elements of atomic number in the s and be yond

a bargain he named a price i could take it or leave it i resolved to demonstrate that others than himself could act with dignity and decision without wheedling haggling or feigned outrage i imme diately accepted his tender subject to proving out the qual ity my stipulation stung his vanity but i managed to allay his annoyance in the end he saw reason and became alarm ingly jovial the serving boy brought two great tankards of a vile mouseflavored beer lens larque quaffed his portion in three gulps and by the exigencies of the situation i was forced to do likewise all the while giving fervent if silent thanks to the iron belly and matchless capacity developed by my many long years as a purchasing agent gersen replaced the papers in their folio very good work lens larque takes on substance he is a large fleshy man with a large nose and chin which might now be surgically altered his skin on at least one occasion was reddish bronze naturally he can use skintoner as easily as anyone else lastly his place of origin might well be the world dar sai from the evidence of his name and also the mention of duodecimates which are mined on dar sai rackrose sat up in his chair are you acquainted with wigal town not at all its a coarse and dismal neighborhood with a dozen or more offworld enclaves altogether unfashionable of course still if you like odd smells and peculiar music wigaltown is the place to wan der theres a small darsh colony and they patronize a public house on pilkamp road tintles shade the place is called ive often noticed the sign which reads fine darsh provender that is interesting news said gersen if lens larque is darsh and if he happened to pass through the neighborhood we might expect him to visit tintles shade maxel rackrose glanced over his shoulder even dettmullian begins to look sinister why do you suppose that lens larque is nearby i dont hold any firm opinion still he might arrive at any time mathematical probabilities guarantee at least this much the dpmon princes exactly we should acquaint ourselves with tmtles shade for just this contingency rackrose winced the place reeks with strange odors i won der if im up to it gersen rose to his feet well try fine darsh provender for our supper perhaps well become devotees rackrose reluctantly hoisted himself erect we had best alter our gear he grumbled dressed for the domus wed be remark able at tmtles shade ill disguise myself as a roof mender and meet you there m an hour gersen glanced down at his own garments an elegant loose blue suit a loosecollared white shirt a crimson sash i feel as if im already in disguise ill change clothes and go as myself in one hour pilkamp road in the dead middle ofwigaltown well meet in the street if you go by omnibus get off at noonans alley gersen left the domus and walked north through the dusk along the orangery parade he wore a dark blouse gray trousers caught in at the ankles and soft low boots typical garments of the working spaceman at the esplanade he mounted a transport platform and waited the lake reflected the final glimmers of sunset color rustred ap plegreen somber orange as gersen watched they disappeared and the lake became a gunmetal shimmer illuminated by a few faint lights along the far shore an opensided omnibus approached gersen stepped aboard seated himself dropped a coin in the slot that he might not be ejected at the next halt at the bend of the lake the esplanade became pilkamp road the omnibus slid north through moynal and drury under an end less chain of bluewhite streetlamps the bus entered wigaltown at that ramp nearest noonans alley gersen alighted dark night had come to wigaltown at gersens back but tresses of black rock hunched into the lake across pilkamp road narrow buildings pushed their roofs high to put unlikely shapes and odd angles against the sky some of the tall narrow windows showed light others were dark diagonally across the street hung an illuminated sign the fci iintlfs shade fine darsh provender chatowsies pourrian ahagaree gersen crossed the street from the shadows of noonans alle came maxel rackrose wearing brown corduroy trousers a check ered brownandblack shirt a black vest decorated with tinsel bla zons a loose black cap with a metal bill gersen read from the sign chatowsies pourrian ahagaree do you have your appetite with you not really i am a fastidious eater i may taste a bit of this and that gersen who often had gulped down food he dared not think about only laughed a keen journalist doesnt know the word fas tidious somewhere we must draw the line said rackrose it may be here at tmtles shade they pushed through the door into a hall ahead stairs led up to the upper floors to the side an arch opened upon a whitetiled chamber heavy with a musty stench a dozen men drank beer at a counter tended by an old woman in a black gown with straight black hair dark orange skin and a black mustache posters an nounced exhibitions and novelty dances at rath eileann and else where one of these read the great rincus troupe witness a hundred marvelous feats see the bungles dance and play while the thongs whisde and keen swister day at fuglass hall another whippery ned ticket and the demon princes his lively bungles how they leap how they caper whippery ned sings songs of sliding leather and chides his troupe for errors or insufficient zeal perhaps with a smart tingle of the flick the woman behind the bar called out why do you stand like hypnotized fish did you come to drink beer or to eat food be patient said gersen we are making our decision the remark annoyed the woman her voice took on a coarse edge be patient you say all night i pour beer for crapulous men isnt that patience enough come over here backwards ill put this spigot somewhere amazing at full gush and then well discover who calls for patience we have decided to take a meal said gersen how are the chatowsies tonight the same as always no worse than any other be off with you dont waste my time unless youre taking beer whats this smirk at me will you she seized a mug of beer to hurl at maxel rackrose who alertly jumped back into the anteroom with gersen close behind the woman gave her black mane a scornful toss twisted her mustache between thumb and forefinger then turned away she lacks charm grumbled rackrose she will never know me as a habitue the dining room may surprise us said gersen pleasantly so i hope they started up the steps which like the beerchamber ex haled an unpleasant vapor a compound of strange cooking oils off world condiments and a stale ammoniacal waft at the first landing rackrose halted candidly i find this all a bit unsettling are you sure that we actually intend to dine here if you have qualms go no farther i myself have known places both better and worse rackrose muttered under his breath and trudged on up the steps a pair of heavy wooden doors opened into the restaurant at widely separated tables small groups of men huddled like conspir the face ators drinking beer or eating from platters immediately below their faces a massive woman stepped forward gersen judged her no less formidable than the woman who tended the beer spigot though perhaps a few years younger like the woman below she wore a shapeless black gown and her hair hung in a rank tangle her mus tache was not quite so full with glittering eyes she looked from one to the other well then do you wish to eat yes that is why we are here said gersen sit yonder the woman followed them across the room when thev were seated she leaned forward portentously with hands on the table what is to your taste we know darsh food by reputation only said gersen wtiat are your special dishes a ha those we reserve for our own eating out here we serve chichala and you must make the best of it wtiat of the fine darsh provender you advertise the chatow sies the pourrian the ahagaree look about you men are eating true then that is what you must eat bring us portions of all these dishes we will give them a try as you like the woman departed rackrose sat in glum silence while gersen looked around the room our man is not among those present said gersen at last rackrose glanced skeptically from table to table did you se riously expect to find him here not with any confidence still coincidences occur if he were passing through rath eileann this is where we would hope to find him maxel rackrose surveyed gersen dubiously you are not tell ing me all you know should that surprise you not at all but id like a hint as to what im getting into tonight you need fear only the chatowsies and perhaps the cbtchala an indelicate term in the present context the word metaphorically connotes food prepared tor and served to men he demon princes pourrian if our research continues it might entail danger lens larque is a sinister man rackrose glanced nervously around the room i would prefer to give the fellow no offense he has a rancorous disposition re member erasmus heupter whatever the word panak means i dont care to know the woman approached with a tray here is the beer which men customarily take with their food it is also usual for newcomers to provide a bit of entertainment the shadowbox is yonder a coin will produce a troupe of amusing figments gersen turned to rackrose you are expert in such affairs you shall make the choice with pleasure said rackrose rather heavily he went to the shadowbox read the list of offerings pulled a toggle and dropped a coin into the hopper a shrill voice called out itsjavil natkin and the sly rogues to a clattering music of blocks and chink lepins the entertainers appeared in projected image a tall thin man in white and black diaper carrying a whip and a band of six small boys wearing only long red stockings natkin sang a set of doggerel verses lamenting the faults of his charges then performed an eccentric prancing jig snapping his whip this way and that while the boys hopped whirled and scam pered with extraordinary agility natkin expressing dissatisfaction with their antics nicked his whip at the plump buttocks the boys so stimulated turned frantic somersaults until natkin stood sur rounded by tumbling boys whereupon he threw up his arms in triumph and the images disappeared patrons who had given ear nest attention to the display muttered and grumbled and returned to their food from the kitchen came the blackgowned woman with bowls and platters she thumped them down upon the table here is the food chatowsies pourrian ahagaree eat your fill what you leave returns to the pot thank you said gersen by the way who is tintle the woman gave a derisive snort tintles name is on the sign we do the work we chink the coin tintle keeps his distance if possible id like a few words with tintle the woman gave a derisive snort youd like nothing whatever from tintle hes stupid and dull still for what its worth youll the face find him in the backyard counting his fingers or scratching himself with a stick the woman moved away gersen and rackrose gingerly ad dressed themselves to the food after a few moments rackrose said i cant decide what tastes worst the chatowsies are fetid but the ahagaree is ferocious the pourrian is merely vile and the lady seems to have washed her dog in the beer what are you eat ing more you must do the same we want to establish a pretext for returning here try some of these remarkable condiments rackrose held up his hand i have taken quite enough at least on the basis of my present salary as you wish gersen gulped down a few more mouthfuls then thoughtfully put down his spoon we have seen enough for this evening he signaled to the woman madame our account if you please the woman looked over the platters you have eaten raven ously i will need two or better three svu from each of you rackrose cried out in protest three svu for a few mouthfuls of food that would be exorbitant at the domus the domus serves insipid gutch pay your account or i will sit on your head come now said gersen that is no way to attract a steady clientele i might add that we are waiting to meet a certain member of the bugold clan bah sneered the woman wtiat is that to me a bugold outcast robbed the kotzash warehouse and so now i live here in this place of dank winds and curdled rheum ive heard a somewhat different story said gersen with an air of careless omniscience then you heard nonsense the bugold rachepol and that scorpion panshaw connived together they should have been bro ken and not poor tintle now pay me my coin and so your way this talk of kotzash has put me out of sorts gersen resignedly put down six svu the woman with a tri umphant leer toward maxel rackrose swept up the coins as for the gratuity another two svl will be considered adequate gersen handed over the coins and madame tintle departed rackrose gave a snort of disgust you are far too obliging the womans avarice is matched only by the vileness other cuisine the demon princes madame tintle spoke over his shoulder by chance i over heard that remark on your next visit i will boil up my crotchstrap for your chatowsies once again she swept away gersen and rackrose also took their leave out on the street they stood a moment mist hung over the lake streetlamps north and south along pilkamp road showed as receding aureoles of pale blue light what now asked rackrose is it to be tintle yes said gersen he is conveniently close to hand that vulgar female mentioned a backyard grumbled rack rose we will find it around yonder there up noonans alley the two men walked around the corner of tintles shade up the hill beside a wall which presently showed a gate of metal bars giving on tintles backyard to the rear stood a line of ramshackle sheds one of which showed a light at an upper window someone created a clangor by striking a pan against the wall then lowered a pot on a length of string it appears said gersen that tintle is about to dine the door to the shed opened to reveal the silhouette of a squat heavyshouldered man he ambled across the yard detached the pot from the line and carried it back to the shed rackrose called through the gate tintle hoy tintle over here by the gate tintle halted in surprise then turned and ran spraddlelegged to his shed the door closed behind him the lights were immedi ately extinguished thats all from tintle tonight said gersen the two returned to pilkamp road boarded the next omnibus and rode south to rath eileann old town from the demon princes by carol carphen the author of this monograph as he ponders the de mon princes and their marvelous deeds often becomes con fused by the multiplicity of events to cure this condition he resorts to generalizations only to see ech such edifice collapse under the weight of qualification in basic fact the five individuals have but a single aspect in common their total disregard for human pain thus as we hold lens larque up for comparison to his peers we find no correspondence save in this single quality even that anonymity and secrecy which one might suppose to be a basic element of the craft is in the case of lens larque distorted into something rude and brash so that it seems almost a craving for public attention lens larque at times appears almost eager to exhibit himself still when we sum up what we know about lens larque we discover few definite facts he has been de scribed as a tall man of considerable bulk who through his burning gaze and abrupt movements gives the impression of a passionate and volatile disposition no clear descrip tions of his face are extant according to rumor he is expert in the use of the whip and takes pleasure in so punishing his enemies the essay concludes with the summation the demon prince s once again as i succumb to the allure of generality let me put forward the following propositions the evil magnificence of the demon princes cannot be quantitatively compared on a qualitative basis they can be perhaps intuitively characterized viole falushe is as malignant as a wasp malagate the woe is inhumanly callous kokor hekkus enoys horrifying pranks howard alan treesong is inscrutable devious and very likely insane if the concept is at all applicable to such folk as these lens larque is brutal revengeful and extravagantly sensitive to slights like kokor hekkus he is not un known to sadism in grotesque variation occasion ally one finds references to a reek or coarse effluvium in connection with his person but whether this is psychological aura or actual bad odor is never made clear still lens larque would seem to be the most physically unappealing of all the de mon princes with the possible exception of howard alan treesong whose aspect is unknown trails of rain from a predawn storm swept the north end of lake feamish over rath eileann clouds scudded and raced and let blaz ing shafts of vegalight down upon the gray city so in alternate shine and shadow gersen and jehan addels walked along the es planade toward the estremont addels went stiffly and without enthusiasm his shoulders hunched his face dour and bleak as they neared the causeway he stopped short do you know this is sheer madness but in a good cause said gersen someday youll congrat ulate yourself addels grudgingly proceeded the day im discharged from frogtown pits gersen offered no reply at the causeway addels halted once again you should come no farther we must not be seen together quite right ill wait here addels continued across the causeway the great doors of glass the facl and iron opened before him he entered a silent foyer pa ed in white marble and stelt addels ascended to the fourth floor and marched despondently to the offices of the chief clerk outside in the corridor he halted drew a deep breath threw back his shoulders licked his lips relaxed his face into a mask of serenity and confidence then stepped through the door a marble counter crossed the room at the back four under clerks in dark red gowns scrutmi ed documents they looked up with empty expressions then returned to their work addels gave a peremptory rap on the marble one of the clerks made a sad face rose to his feet and approached the counter what may be your business i want to consult the chief clerk said addels at what time was your appointment my appointment is now snapped addels announce me and be smart about it the clerk spoke a languid word or two into a mesh then ush ered addels into a highceilinged chamber illuminated by a cnstal globe of a hundred facets rose velvet drapes hung across the high windows a semicircular desk in the old empire style enameled ivorywhite with gilt and vermilion accents occupied the center of a pale blue carpet here at his ease sat a balding middleaged man well fleshed and roundfaced with a benign expression like the underclerks he wore a dark red gown as well as a square white cap displaying the official emblem ot llinliffets land as addels stepped forward he rose courteously to his feet counsellor ad dels it is both my duty and my pleasure to serve you thank you addels seated himself in the chair indicated file chief clerk poured tea into a cup of frail beleek and placed it within addels reach most gracious of you said addels he sipped superb lutic gold to hazard a guess with a bit of something to sharpen the edge you have a fine discrimination said the chief clerk lutic gold it is from the north slope with an ounce of black dassawary to the pound for brisk mornings such as this i consider it quite appropriate stclt j precious sid mined from the surraces uf burnt out stars the demon princes for a few minutes the two discussed tea then addels said now as to my business i represent cooneys bank now chartered at rath eileann as you may know we have instituted action against celerus transport company of vire sadal suud four the ship emha gargantyr and others i have conferred with the honorable uuay pmgo who will stand for the ship he is anxious to expedite the case and i quite agree in effect i speak for both parties to the action we request the earliest possible place on the calendar the chief clerk pursing his lips and blowing his cheeks con sulted a document which lay in front of him it so happens that we can schedule a relatively prompt hearing a certain lord high benchmaster dalt has been assigned to the circuit addels raised his sandy eyebrows would that be benchmaster waldemar dalt who benched intelworld court at myrdal on bon iface the same theres quite a piece about him m the legal oh the legal observer eh i have not seen this oumal before its the first issue published at new wexford i received a complimentary copy no doubt by virtue of my office i must find an issue said addels if only to read up on dalt it makes interesting reading they compliment dalt for his precision but they describe him as a bit of a martinet thats my recollection taking up the magazine addels stud ied the article a photograph depicted a harshfeatured man wear ing black and white judicial costume the black frontal fringe of the traditional headdress hanging low across his forehead black eye brows emphasized his extreme pallor a clenched mouth and nar row glinting eyes suggested inflexibility and perhaps severity hmmf said addels thats benchmaster dalt ive seen him in action hes as hard as he looks he put the magazine down the chief clerk picked it up and read aloud sometimes regarded as overabstract and overrigorous benchmaster dalt is by no means a dreamyeyed theorist to the contrary he insists upon full etiquette court officials consider him a stern disciplinarian with a faint smile addels asked and what do you think of that the chief clerk shook his head ruefully he seems a tyran nical old griffin for a fact the face hes not all that old in fact some say he leans over backward on that account yes yes muttered the chief clerk ive heard much the same story from one source or another smarten up your bailiffs said addels provide your stentor the best throat lozenges because benchmaster dalt is coming to enliven your court he watches like an eagle if someone scamps his duty hes flayed to the bone personally id prefer a more af fable judge wont someone else be working the session the chief clerk gave his head a troubled shake youll have to deal with dalt and so will i many thanks for your advice ill warn my bailiffs and benchmaster dalt will have no complaint the two men sipped tea in thoughtful silence then addels said perhaps im lucky to draw dalt after all hes draconic against swindlers and hell cut through technicalities to deal out justice still its a mixed blessing so when will we have our hear i ing maasday next at half morning maasday morning a storm drove down lake feamish piling up whitecaps to pound against the estremont foundations the tall windows of the courtroom admitted only a wet gray light and the three chandeliers symbolizing the three vegan planets glowed at full power the chief clerk sat at his desk wearing immaculate scarlet and black robes with a black cushion hat by the door a pair of bailiffs stood erect alert and mindful of benchmaster dalts reputation for irascibility to the right sat counsellor duay pmgo with his clients to the left counsellor jehan addels with officials of cooneys bank a half dozen casual spectators were on hand for reasons best known to themselves silence held the room only the far whisper of waves against stone could be heard a chime sounded the hour of halfmorning from the rear chamber came lord high benchmaster dalt a personage of middle size spare of physique wearing full high court regalia the head piece fringed his forehead and hung black swafts over his ears looking neither right nor left he mounted to the bench then glanced swiftly around the room his chalkwhite pallor and taut uncompromising features creating an effect of austere elegance across the centuries the rituals of the vegan judicial system had been simplified but were still notorious for symbolic homologies the demon princes the lord high benchmaster no longer rode to the bench in a chair carried by four blind virgins but the bench itself the balance still rested upon a wedgeshaped fulcrum even though most pro gressive benchmasters stipulated stabilizing struts to dampen the quivering needle of justice benchmaster dalt had ordained rigid stabilizers for the balance to hold the needle fixed at equilibrium the stentor appeared on a balcony behind the bench be it now heard oyez this sacred court ruled by lord high bench master waldemar dalt is now in session he threw three white feathers into the air to symbolize the liberation of three white doves holding his arms on high he called let the wings of truth fare far across this land the court oflnterworld equity now sits in session lowering his arms he backed into his alcove and disappeared from view benchmaster dalt rapped with his gavel and glanced at a mem orandum i will hear preliminary statements in the case of coo neys bank versus the celerus transport company the ship ettilia gargantyr its officers and all its lawful owners are the parties at contest present ready for the plaintiffs your lordship said addels ready for the defendants your lordship said duay pingo benchmaster dalt addressed addels be so good as to con struct your complaint thank you your lordship our plea for damages is based upon the following sequence of events on a date which when translated into gaean standard time becomes day of the year at the city thrump on david alexanders planet the owner of the ship ettilia gargantyr maliciously and spitefully conspired with the ships commanding office a certain wislea toom so to defraud the local victuallers guild of moneys legally and rightfully due them and thereupon put their nefarious plan into effect by the simple and shameless process benchmaster dalt rapped with his gavel if counsellor will control his indignation and favor the court with a simple explana he benchmaster who rode the balance so ngidiv that the needle showed no motion in the sl vernacular of the courtroom was said to he stiff of arse while a more restless offlcul under whose shifts and shrugs the needle swung hack and forth might become known as old flitterbntches the face tion of the facts and allow me to decide the applicability of such terms as nefarious and shameless we shall proceed much more crisply with this case thank you your lordship no doubt i anticipate my full pre sentation but we are pleading for punitive as well as actual dam ages on the basis of malice and fraud with premeditated intent very well proceed but remember i am not partial to subjec tive presentations thank you your lordship the defalcation occurred as i have stated the injured parties filed local action however the ettilia gargantyr had vanished as had the celerus transport company in due course the cause of action was transferred to cooneys bank the arrival of the ettilia gargantyr at rath eileann laid in rem jurisdiction in this court and pursuant to our writ of attach ment we prepared a new action the ettilia gargantyr is now im mobilized at slayhack spaceport we pray for actual damages to the amount of twelve thousand eight hundred and twentyfive svu we declare that the owner of the ship through the apparently fic titious celerus transport company maliciously and in arrogant contempt of lawful process conspired with captain wislea toom to the detriment of the plaintiffs assignors we feel that conduct of such description is all too common and merits a vigorous rebuke and this is the basis of our plea for punitive damages you use the term owner of the ettilia gargantyr i abhor circumlocution please identify this person by name i am sorry your lordship i do not know his name very well then rap went the gavel counsellor pingo do you have a statement simply this your lordship the action is monstrous and ex travagant it is a mischievous exploitation of what at worst was a rather trivial oversight we do not challenge that a claim against the ship at one time existed we adamantly deny the competence of cooneys bank to act in this regard and we consider the charges of malice and conspiracy inapplicable you will be given opportunity to demonstrate as much through the testimony of your principals benchmaster dalt sur veyed duay pingos clients the lawful and registered owner of the ship is now present no your lordship he is not the demon princes then how do you expect to defend against the charges by demonstrating their total absurdity your lordship aha counsellor there you insult my intelligence in my ex perience dozens of apparent absurdities have turned out to be un assailable facts i will point out that the action is specific it alleges malice fraud and conspiracy and these charges may not be coun tered by either rhetoric or obfuscation you are wasting the time of this court how long will you need to produce the proper re spondents pingo could only shrug his shoulders one moment your lordship if you please he went to consult his clients who mut tered uncertainly among themselves pingo returned to face bench master dalt your lordship i point out that my clients are undergoing unnecessary hardship due to the costs of operating the ship including salaries insurance berth rental and the like may we post bond as guarantee to the payment of some fair settlement should in fact your judgment go against us and so let the ship be on its way this is only simple justice dalt glared at duay pingo you are appointing yourself in my court as the arbiter and explicator of justice by no means your lordship it was merely a way of speaking an unhappy phrase for which i apologize benchmaster dalt appeared to reflect jehan addels lifting his arm as if to scratch his head muttered into his sleeve specify full value of ship and cargo no bondsman in town or anywhere else will risk so much benchmaster dalt spoke i rule in favor of the defendants request provided that he posts bond to the full value of ship and cargo which would represent the maximum indemnity duay pingo winced that may well be impossible your lord ship then produce your proper witnesses and let us try the case properly you cant have the situation both ways what good is a defense action without facts or pertinent testimony from responsive witnesses get your case together or you must lose by default thank you your lordship i will hold immediate consultation with my clients may i request a short postponement certainly for how long i am not at this point certain i will presently notify the court clerk if such suits my esteemed colleague and your lordship the face i am content said jehan addels so long as the continuance does not exceed a reasonable time very well so ruled let us be quite definite counsellor pingo i require direct testimony from the principal of the case he will be the person who owned the ship at the time of the alleged in fraction together with proof as to his ownership i will not accept depositions proxies or agents so long as this is understood i grant a continuance of two weeks if you require more time please apply to the court clerk thank you your lordship court is adjourned the lord high benchmaster stalked to his chambers the chief clerk mopped his face with a blue kerchief and muttered to a bailiff have you ever seen such a griffin hes a bad one for sure touchy as a blastiffwith boils glad i am that ill never need to face him in court bah muttered the chief clerk belch once in his court and hell order your gizzard toasted im all in a sweat from holding my breath during the evening gersen received a call from jehan addels miraculously addels noted we are still out of jail its a pleasant sensation said gersen enjoy it while you can everything is so fragile suppose a diligent journalist looks in the legal record suppose the chief clerk gossips with someone from boniface suppose he places other cases into the docket gersen grinned benchmaster dalt no doubt will dispense eq uity more properly benchmaster dalt should plead indisposition declared addels remember not all lawyers are fools no need to borrow trouble pingo is sending messages across the galaxy there will be a great disturbance somewhere how true well then what next we wait to see who appears when the hearings resume from dar sai and the darsh by jomville akers the darsh whipdances constitute a highly structured art form i sav this flatly and without qualification after having devoted considerable time to the subect a savage and repellent art form granted an art form grounded in a whole cluster of sexual aberrations ie pederasty flagel lation sadomasochism voyeurism exhibitionism so much is conceded it is an art form to which i personally am not attracted though at times it exerts a certain horrid fasci nation the intricacies of whipdancing totally elude the un initiated during the ordinary routine the whipwielder contrary to appearances seldom mures or even inflicts se rious pain upon the dancers like other apparently horren dous exhibitions a great part is show the thematic material to the outsider seems repetitive and limited and more often than not depends upon a simple tried and true premise the whipmaster and his troupe of prankish unruly or insubordinate bungle boys the variations upon this theme however are intricate subtle often ingenious often amusing and inexhaustibly popular with darsh males darsh females on the other hand observe these spectacles with contemptuous indifference and consider them merely another aspect of masculine fatuity gersen and maxel rackrose alighted trom the omnibus then stood for a moment looking across pilkamp road at tmtles shade the face it presents no braver face by daylight said rackrose in fact i can now discern peeling paint and windows hung all askew no matter said gersen the dilapidation is picturesque and will enhance our lunch today said rackrose i lack all appetite still dont let me deter you from your own meal perhaps something on the menu will tempt you they crossed the street pushed through the door passed the beer counter by and mounted the dank steps to the restaurant only a few tables were in use madame tmtle stood idly by the kitchen passthrough twirling the tip of her mustache lan guidly she signaled them to a table and ambled over to inquire their needs so the two of you are back i never thought to see you again gersen essayed a gallantry we were drawn as much by your colorful personality as by the food what would you mean by that demanded the woman you are aspersing either me or the food either way youll get a pot of slops over your head no offense intended said gersen in fact i can put you in the way of some money if the prospect suits you of all races darsh are most avaricious what is the proposal a friend of mine will shortly be arriving from dar sai or so i expect he is darsh yes the situation is hardly possible darsh men make no friends only enemies this gentleman is if you prefer an acquaintance when he arrives he will surely visit tmtles shade to eat familiar food i want you to notify me of his arrival so that we may renew our acquaintance easily done but how will i recognize him just inform me or my friend whenever a new darsh comes to tmtles shade well its not particularly convenient i cant sort over every odd goumbah who creeps in from the street my curiosity would arouse frivolous comment a peoranve term used by darsh women in reference to men a person of vulgar futile stupidity thr demon princes perhaps tintle himself might be pressed into service sug gested rackrose tintle the woman made a rasping sound in her throat tintles been smirched and broken lies not allowed up here everyone would hold their noses and leave i can barely tolerate his presence in the yard gersen asked how did this come about madame tintle looked around the room then finding no better use for her time condescended to reply it was on the whole a sad misfortune which tintle never earned at the kotxash warehouse tintle was the proud guard but when they came to loot and steal tintle slept rather than guarded and failed to throw the switch all the duodecimates were taken then it was learned that ottile pan shaw the bursar had neglected insurance so all was lost panshaw could not be found so the whole countryside came down on tintle he was fixed under the public latrine for three days and everyone expressed themselves as the mood took them tintle and dar sai no longer could stomach each other so we came to this dreary bog that is the story hmmf said gersen if tintle had been a friend of lens larque affairs might have gone differently the woman eyed him with dour suspicion why do you speak of lens larque he is a famous man infamous rather it was lens larque who robbed the kotzash warehouse why should he be a friend of tintle though that was the accusation then you know lens larque by sight he is a bugold and none of my affair he might be sitting across the room at this moment so long as he finds no fault and pays his account what do i care she looked contemptuously around the room he is not here today that is certain well and good said gersen but back to our arrangement wtien a strange darsh appears lens larque or any other notify me or mv friend maxel rackrose who will take his lunch here every day each time you point out a strange darsh you will be paid two svu point out lens larque and earn ten svu and should you lead me to my friend you shall earn twenty svu madame tintle compressed her black brows in perplexity a the face most unusual arrangement why do you want lens larque most folk would pay ten svu or more to avoid him we are journalists i consider him a prime subject for an in terview should he appear certainly we cannot expect such good luck madam tintle shrugged i have nothing to lose now what will you eat ill take a few bites of ahagaree said gersen the same for me said rackrose but less sulfur and iodine than usual what about chatowsies none today leaving the restaurant gersen and rackrose walked around to the back of the building and approached the iron gate through the bars they saw tintle hunched in the pale sunlight before one of the sheds each of his threeinch earlobes terminated in a dangling metal ornament tintle amused himself by flicking these with his finger and letting them swing gersen called out tintle hey tintle tintle rose slowly to his feet a squat man with coppercolored skin and lumpy features he came a few steps forward then halted to peer in suspicion toward the gate what do you want with me you are that tintle who guarded the kotzash warehouse i know nothing about it bawled tintle i was asleep and innocent in every respect but you were broken it was a gross error and you ultimately plan to vindicate yourself tintle blinked i had not thought so far ahead we would definitely like to hear your version of the case tintle came slowly toward the gate wtio are you asking such questions investigators in the cause of justice i have had enough justice investigate ottile panshaw and break him i will lead the line to the latrine tintle turned and started back toward his shed just a moment called gersen we have not discussed ben efits tintle came to a tentative halt wtiat benefits the dkmon princes first a fee in payment for the value of your time second punishment of the robbers tintle made a sound of incredulous amusement who intends to punish lens larque anything might happen at the moment we only wish to hear details of the case tintle looked from one to the other what is your official status dont inquire too closely high officials cant offer fees tintle at last showed flexibility how much are you offering that depends upon what you tell us five svu at the least that is no vast sum tintle grumbled still i suppose that it will suffice he looked up toward the windows at the back of the restaurant there she stands a great rat glaring down from its hole let us transfer our business to groarys tavern across the way as you wish tintle unharnessed the gate and passed through into the alley shell be sorely vexed to see us going off to the tavern and ill eat slops for a week still lets be away a man must never heed the womans roar black piles emerging from the waters of lake feamish supported the rear deck of groarys tavern the three men took seats at a wooden table tintle hunched forward and gersen thought to per ceive the inkling of a sickly stench imagination tintle a bubble up from the lakebottom slime i believe that five svu was mentioned said tintle gersen put money on the table we are interested in the kot zash robbery remember if the loot was recovered you might well be vindicated and indemnified tintle gave a harsh laugh do you take me for a fool in this life events bend to no such kindly patterns ill tell you what i know and take your money and that will be the end of it gersen shrugged you were guard at kotzash warehouse what exactly is kotzash ottile panshaw formed the corporation the miners brought in duodecimates and placed them with panshaw who paid off m shares of kotzash mutual the shares were ostensibly redeemable in svu at any time so it went and the warehouse at serjeuz bulged the face with packets of fine duodecimate how could lens larque not be tempted some say that ottile panshaw notified him when the warehouse could hold no more so lens larque dropped his great black ship into the compound during the night his villains came bounding into the warehouse and i was lucky to make my escape for surely they would have killed me this consideration failed to quell the general rage they demanded why i the designated guard had failed to protect the warehouse and why the great gate had been left ajar i blamed ottile panshaw but he was absent therefore i was dragged to the central sump and broken a sorry tale said gersen still how do you know that lens larque was responsible tintle gave a fretful toss of the head which set his pendules to jerking enough that i tell you as much it is not a name to be discussed at length nevertheless the guilty man must be brought to justice and your contribution may be of assistance and when lens larque hears of my verbosity what then i dance ten fandangos to the music ofpanak your name will not be spoken gersen brought forth another fivesvu certificate tell us what you know it is nothing very much i am of the dupp clan lens larque is a bugold i knew him well in the old days at natdnaw shade we played hadaul and everyone joined a cabal against him but he had worked a counterstrategy and it was i whose bones were bro ken wtiat sort of man is he tintle shook his head at a loss for words he is a big man he has a long nose and fleering eyes at the kotzash warehouse he wore a thabbat but i knew him by his voice and his fust if he stepped into tintles shade would you know him tintle gave a gloomy grunt i am not tolerated in the shade he could come and go a dozen times id never be the wiser when you played hadaul what name did he use that was long ago then he was simple husse bugold though already he was rachepol hadau a darsh game combining elements ot conspiracy doubledealing cunning trick ery and a general freeforall melee thahhat the darsh hood usually of white or blue cloth fust an odor exuded by darsh men i hf demon princfs you have photographs of lens larque tmtle snorted why should i cherish such mementos he is high i am low he exudes a fust of menander and fine koruna and redoil ahagaree i reek of the sump gersen pushed the money across the table if you should see lens larque be wary claim no acquaintance dont let him rec ognize you communicate at once with maxel rackrose he wrote on a card and pushed it across the table tmtle twitched his mouth in a quick uneasy wince it seems that you expect lens larque we can only hope said gersen he is an elusive man tmtle began to have second thoughts i might not know him now it is said that he has changed himself have you heard how the methlen taunted him he wanted to live in a fine house but the neighbor wouldnt allow it he said he wanted no ugly darsh face hanging over the garden walls lens larque was exasperated and changed his face at once who knows what he looks like now use your intuition what happened to ottile panshaw he crossed to twanish on methel for all i know hes there yet and what ofkotzash does the corporation still function tmtle spat upon the floor i paid m four hundred ounces of good black sand a true fortune and i received forty shares of stock i gambled at hadaul and i now have ninetytwo from a greasy wallet he extracted a packet of folded papers there are the certificates their value ml gersen examined the papers they are bearer certificates ill buy them from you he placed ten svu upon the table what cried tmtle for almost a hundred shares of prime kotzash stock do i seem such a dunderhead each share repre sents not only ten ounces of sand but other values rights options leases he looked askance as gersen picked up the ten svu not so fast i accept your offer gersen slid the money across the table i suspect that you have made the better bargain but no matter if you chance to notice the man whom we have discussed inform us and you will be rewarded is there anything else you can tell me no the face if you supply us more information well pay you well tmtle vouchsafed only a surly grunt he finished his beer at a gulp and departed the tavern with both gersen and maxel rack rose leaning back from the waft of his passage from life volume i by unspiek baron bodissey the evil man is a source of fascination ordinary per sons wonder what impels such extremes of conduct a lust for wealth a common motive undoubtedly a craving for power revenge against society let us grant these as well but when wealth has been gained power achieved and so ciety brought down to a state of groveling submission what then why does he continue the response must be the love of evil for its own sake the motivation while incomprehensible to the ordi nary man is nonetheless urgent and real the malefactor becomes the creature of his own deeds once the transition has been overpassed a new set of standards comes into force the perceptive malefactor recognizes his evil and knows full well the meaning of his acts in order to quiet his qualms he retreats into a state of solipsism and commits flagrant evil from sheer hysteria and for his victims it ap pears as if the world has gone mad at noon on st dulvers day maxel rackrose presented himself at gersens chambers in the domus his manner was subdued he spoke tersely during the last two weeks i have monitored trav elers incoming at slayhack new wexford and pontefract space ports twenty originated in the cora system but only three described themselves as darsh the others are methlen none of the darsh fit specifications three of the methlen might conceiv ably be our man these are the photographs the face gersen looked over the faces none held meaning for him rackrose placed down another photograph with the air of a magi cian performing a feat this man is ottile panshaw who forgot to pay the kotzash insurance premiums he arrived yesterday and is now here at the domus gersen studied the spaceport photograph which depicted a middleaged man thin and frail with a small luxurious paunch a large head with alert lucent eyes a long thin flexible nose a delicate mouth drooping at the corners to either side of a bald forehead hung sparse russet curls his skin had been toned a bitter yellow ottile panshaw wore stylish and ornate garments a square black velvet hat piped with scarlet and silver dove gray trousers a pale pink shirt with a rolled black collar a fawncolored jacket interesting said gersen i hope to ask panshaw a question or two that should be easy enough hes not a hundred yards away getting honest answers might be more of a problem to judge from his face gersen nodded thoughtfully this is not the face of a candid man its also not the face of a man who forgets insurance premi ums yes thats a puzzling situation perhaps the premiums were exorbitant thats not unlikely so close to beyond and so close to lens larque perhaps the insurance officials refused coverage on this theory or which is even more likely panshaw simply pretended payment and put the money in his own pocket gersen once again examined the clever face of the photograph i certainly wouldnt want ottile panshaw in command of my money perhaps he had reason to depreciate kotzash stock rackrose frowned what would induce him in that direction i can think of several possibilities one might be voting con trol of the company if it were bankrupt tintle mentioned other assets leases options and the like i suppose anything is possible gersen reflected a moment then turning to the communicator brought the pale foxy face ofjehan addels to the screen there is a new aspect to our business said gersen the kotzash mutual ihf dlmon princfs corporation based at sereuz on dar sai in the cora system might there he information available at new wexford addels showed one of his rare grins youd he astonished as to what information we can command if this kotzash has done business to the value of one svu with any bank of the oikumene information is on hand i am interested in assets officers control procedure anything else which might seem interesting i will discover what there is to know the screen went dark turning gersen discovered a thoughtful expression on rackroses face for a simple ournahst you exert surprising authority said raclcrose gersen had forgotten his role as henry lucas special writer for cosmopolh no great affair addels is an old friend i see well what shall we do about ottile panshaw watch him closely hire professional help if necessary rackrose said dubiously a man like panshaw will surely notice such attention if so his conduct will be interesting as you like how will i pay the detectives make out vouchers payable by cosmopohs with a sigh of languid despair rackrose stood to his feet and departed presently addelss face returned to the communicator kot zash is a queer business the sereuz warehouse was robbed of ore worth twenty million svu the comptroller had neglected insur ance and the company fell apart no formal bankruptcy mind you the loss was only to the stockholders the stock needless to say is worthless and who owns the stock the kotzash charter was filed at the chanseth bank m ser euz copies subsequently reached the association office here at new wexford it specifies that anyone holding twentyfive percent or more of the shares becomes a director with a vote in proportion to his holdings there are fortyeight hundred and twenty shares outstanding twelve hundred and fifty shares something over egan law prohibited the use of motile spicells and like de ills rioilius penalties attached tu the use ot such equipment and detectives relied upon traditional methods uf surveillance f fce twentyfive percent are registered in the name of ottile panshaw the rest are distributed in unregistered small holdings very strange strange and significant panshaw is the only director he con trols kotzash he must have bought up depreciated stock said gersen certainly he never put up half a ton of duodecimates not so fast panshaw is a man of style wtiy spend hard earned money for worthless stock why indeed i am burning with curiosity kotzash evidently maintains an office on methel the prospec tus lists both sereuz and twamsh addresses kotzash is therefore an mterworld corporation and files a yearly report last years re port listed as assets mining charters leases and exploration rights as far afield as the asteroid granate and the moon shamtra kotzash also owns fiftyone percent of hector transit and trading com pany of twanish who owns the remaining fortynine percent ottile panshaw he would seem as kot ash comptroller to have issued twelve hundred and fifty shares of kotzash stock and paid them over to himself for fiftyone percent of hector transit and trading and what do the records say of hector transit and trading nothing it has never filed a prospectus i find this most confusing said gersen it is not confusing said addels it is merely a case of uq gling and paperwork to ease unscrupulous persons past their re sponsibilities is kotzash stock listed on the exchange board the index indicates a nominal value of one centim per share with no tenders either to buy or sell in essence the stock is dead put out feelers said gersen if any kotzash comes on the market buy addels gave his head a sad shake it is inonev cast into the sea ottile panshaw thinks otherwise he is staying at the domus evidently what amazing there now is cause for conccture i am no less perplexed than you but cake comfort court con venes tomorrow benchmaster dalt allows no e asiveness hell set the matter straight the demon princes if we escape shame and incarceration we walk a tightwire panshaw is highly astute if all goes well panshaw can go his way in peace so far as i am concerned when you say if all goes well do you mean the appearance of lens larque at estremont exactly addels gave his head an emphatic shake i am sorry to say this but you are chasing foxfire maniac brute torturer all these lens larque may be but he is not a fool well we shall see now you must excuse me it is time for benchmaster dalt to take his lunch precisely on the hour benchmaster dalt made a stately entrance into the domus restaurant a rigidly erect man white of skin with black curls massed around his cold and austere face his garments reflected a formal elegance decades out of date heads turned to watch the striking implacable jurist cross the room to his table he consumed a frugal meal of salad and cold fowl then sat in portentous meditation over a cup of tea a thin man of no great stature who had been sitting across the room approached his table lord high benchmaster dalt may i join you for a moment benchmaster dalt turned a leaden stare upon the petitioner then spoke in a dry and measured voice if you are a journalist i have nothing to say the other man laughed politely as if m appreciation of bench master dalts little joke my name is ottile panshaw and i am definitely no journalist he eased himself deftly into the chair op posite benchmaster dalt tomorrow you are hearing cooneys bank versus the ettilia gargantyr et al would you think it an im propriety if i were to discuss the case with you benchmaster dalt inspecting ottile panshaw saw a mature man of slight physique with a large head flexible features and a gracious expression wearing a dapper suit of plum and umber panshaw bore the benchmasters stare with polite aplomb benchmaster dalt finally put a curt question what is your stand ing in the case in an accessory sense i am associated with the defendant but naturally i came to make no importunities the case is extraordi thf h he nary and certain elements may never be introduced formally still they might well illuminate your overall picture benchmaster dalts eyelids took on a languid droop his ex pression became more remote than e er i am uninterested in spe cial representations this goes without saying be assured that i wish only to pre sent a few items ot background mformacion they will carry their own burden of conviction very well speak on thank you sir lo begin i represent the ownership of the ettilia gargantyf hie vessel is under lease to the hector transit company a subsidiary of kotzash mutual a company of which i am the managing director all well and good but the ultimate owner of the ship is a certain lens larque is that name familiar to you he is a notorious criminal txactly he would be loath to stand before a vegan court and identify himself the idea is actually whimsical i therefore suggest that the testimony of myself the functioning owner be accepted in lieu of that ot lens larque benchmaster dalts pallid face altered by not so much as a twitch at the preliminary hearing i ruled that only the owner in actuality at the tune of the alleged tort can offer germane testimony i see no reason to alter this ruling the special quality of this wit ness is quite beside the point and does not affect the ruling quite so said ottile panshaw ith a rueful gnn your point of view is that if lens larque w ished to testify in the vegan courts he should not have become a criminal benchmaster dalt allowed the merest ghost of a smile to bend his lips exactly court convenes tomorrow is this larque person at hand to testify ottile panshaw lowered his voice our conversation is pre sumably unofficial and confidential i can make no such commitment in that case i can tell you nothing your caution implies a great deal i must assume that this person is at hand let us pose a hypothesis if lens larque were at hand would you be willing to take his testimony in camera benchmasrer dalt rrowned i expect that he will testify to ad the demon princes vance his own case reputedly he has looted tortured and mur dered why should he hesitate at perjury can he supply corroboration to his testimony ottile panshaw gave a soft gentle laugh you and i sir for all our disparities are ordinary human beings lens larque is some thing quite different i could not venture to predict his testimony corroboration may or may not exist indeed in your previous rul ing you indicated that you needed only the owners testimony benchmaster dalt considered the case ofcooneys bank ver sus the ettilia gargantyr is obviously out of the ordinary i can only render the most accurate equity possible without reference to the antecedents of the principals it is my earnest goal to try each case on its own terms therefore despite my personal preference for formal proceedings i will undertake to hear this mans testimony in camera you may bring him to my suite here at the domus in two hours time i feel that i am leaning well over backwards in the interests of fairness and equity ottile panshaw smiled diffidently would you come with me now to a place of my choice certainly not you must understand this persons trepidations had he lived a blameless life he could walk with careless step oh his step is careless enough ottile panshaw rose to his feet and hesitated several seconds the corners of his mouth jerked down in a clownish grimace i will do what i can the benchmasters suite the finest and most exquisitely appointed at the domus included a parlor furnished with antique pieces in that style known as dravan commandeer in a massive armchair sat the benchmaster he had elected to wear his robes of office in order to emphasize the solemnity of the occasion his face toned cadaverous white with its lean cheeks hard jaw and short straight nose was in stark contrast with the luxuriant black curls of the ceremonial wig the benchmasters hands strong and spare with straight strong fingers seemed also a trifle incongruous they seemed more the hands of an active man accustomed to the feel of tools and weapons jehan addels sat across the room in an attitude of anxiety clearly he would have preferred to be elsewhere a chime sounded addels rose to his feet went out into the the face foyer touched a button the door slid aside to admit ottile pan shaw and a tall heavyfleshed man in a hooded white cloak under the hood showed a face flat and moonish with ruddybronze skin a lumpy nose heavy lips and round black eyes benchmaster dalt spoke to ottile panshaw you are ac quainted with counsel for the plaintiff the honorable jehan addels inasmuch as all issues conceivably may be resolved here and now i deemed it proper to notify him of our meeting ottile panshaw gave his head a quick birdlike nod i under stand lord benchmaster allow me to introduce a principal in the case i will not utter his name there is no need to embarrass any one to the contrary said benchmaster dalt we are here pre cisely so that identities may be authenticated and unequivocal re sponses be made to questions of fact you sir what is your name i have used many names benchmaster under the name lens larque i assumed ownership of the ship ettilia gargantyr during my time of ownership i have performed no actsunder the influence of malice or vindictiveness i am innocent of the conspiracy alleged by cooneys bank against these statements i lay my great oath we require something more than oaths in cases of this sort said benchmaster dalt counsellor be so good as to summon the clerk jehan addels opened a side door beckoned into the room came the chief clerk wheeling an instrument before him benchmaster dalt said clerk allow this gentleman to au thenticate his statements at once holy law the clerk slid the machine toward the man in the white cloak sir this is a harmless device which reads emanations from your conceptualizer notice this luminous indi cant truth excites a green light falsity is shown by red i will place the register against your temple allow me to shift the hood drawing back in annoyance the man muttered to ottile pan shaw who returned only a halfsmiling halfcrestfallen shrug the clerk gingerly slipping back the hood placed an adhesive patch upon the ruddybronze temple benchmaster dalt spoke counsellor addels ask your ques tions but only to the effect of establishing identity and ascertaining motivation at the time of the alleged tort ottile panshaw said in a silky tone may i suggest holy law s i hf demon princes that exact dispassion might better be approximated if you yourself put the questions i am intent only upon truth so long as counsellor addels pursues truth we must all approve counsellor ask your questions sir you state your name to be lens larque yes this name has been applied to me the mdicant glowed green what is your name m actuality it is lens larque how long have you been known by this name ottile panshaw cried out holy law the fact has been made clear and verified by the mdicant must we incessantly pursue a sterile inquisition holy law i submit that the identification is not yet unequiv ocal i agree continue very good where were you born on dar sai i am darsh an almost foolish smirk widened the mans mouth and what was your born or given name that is a matter of no consequence the red light flickered then the green light glowed odd mused the benchmaster he himself put a question how long then have you been known as lens larque that is not important the red light glowed bright has someone recently within the last week or two fixed the name lens larque upon you the darshs eyes bulged and he made lurching motions with his shoulders that is an insulting question benchmaster dalt leaned sharply forward that is not the proper tone to take either you are lens larque whereupon we come to grips with the case or you are not whereupon you and mr panshaw have committed a most serious impropriety the whole matter is a farce grumbled the darsh accept the fact that i am lens larque and ask your questions benchmaster dales eyes glittered if you are lens larque answer this who were your associates at the mount pleasant raid bah i forget such details what does the name husse suggest to you i have no skill with names h face that may well be you are evidently not the real lens larque for the last time state the identity under which you have lived for the last twenty years i am lens larque the mdicant glowed red and i denounce you and ottile panshaw as conspirators per urers and frauds clerk place these men under arrest take them into custody and lock them in separate dungeons the clerk blew out his cheeks and stepped cautiously forward the pair of you must now consider yourselves m the custody of the estremont stand quietly hold now not a move i represent the full force of vegan law ottile panshaws eyelids drooped in worry and despondency lord high benchmaster i beg your understanding please be aware of the special circumstances benchmaster dalt spoke m cold tones you have seriously preudiced your case i am disposed to find for the plaintiff unless lens larque presents himself at once you may use this telephone to call him i am bored with tricks ottile panshaw showed his sad twisted smile lens larque is notorious for his tricks he paused then continued m an almost confidential tone cooneys bank will never enoy a udgment against lens larque i can state this much what is your meaning ships disappear in not one but by many modes remember the tricks now accept my truly sincere apologies and allow us to leave halt cried the clerk you are in my custody the darsh looked toward ottile panshaw all of them panshaw gave a delicate shrug from which the darsh seemed to derive exact information he stepped back and produced a pe culiar implement a footlong handle terminating in a small spiked knob the chief clerk stood back aghast then turned and ran for the doorthe darsh swung his haft the spiked ball was propelled into the back of the clerks head he threw up his arms and tell forward in the same rhythmic motion the darsh turned swung the haft and the ball darted toward benchmaster dalt jehan addels uttered a croak of outrage and lurched forward only to be tripped by the dapper foot of ottile panshaw the benchmaster had dodged low to the side the proectile struck the wall at his back he ran crouching forward black robes fluttering face white under s thf demon princfs the black curls the darsh drew back a step and flourished the haft benchmaster dalt seized the upraised wrist kicked at the darshs knee thrust an elbow under the heavy red jaw the darsh stumbled to the floor the benchmaster wrenched away the haft the darsh groped and dragged him to the floor they tumbled about the room white robe and black like monstrous black and white moths ottile panshaw skipped here and there holding a small hand weapon he looked toward jehan addels who instantly threw him self flat behind a couch panshaw turned away to stand rapt in astonishment while the languid and elegant unst broke first the darshs wrist then his aw then produced a glittering black silver with which he stabbed the darsh in the back of the neck ottile panshaw halfheartedly pointed his weapon jehan addels watching from behind the couch uttered a sharp cry and threw a bronze vase benchmaster dalt reached for the darshs ballwhip ottile panshaw stepped quietly to the door bowed and departed with the aplomb of a successful conurer the benchmaster pushed aside the darsh corpse and jumped to his feet jehan addels emerged from behind the couch what an appalling situation cried addels if we are discovered with these dead things we will be immured forever in that case we will depart it is the only sensible course the benchmaster removed his wig and doffed the black robes he looked down at the corpses in gloomy dissatisfaction failure the scheme is bankrupt he indicated the huddle which once had been the chief clerk provide well for his km we can at least do that i fear for myself and my own km addels fretted is there to be no end to this violence and these corpses we are vulnerable panshaw from sheer spite may call in the alarm quite so benchmaster dalt must now dissolve into nowhere a pity he was truly an admirable fellow with flair and style good bye benchmaster dalt bah muttered addels you should have been a theatnst rather than an assassin or whatever you consider yourself must we loiter here forever the kindest dungeons are at maudley far worse are the frogtown holes i hope to visit neither gersen flung wig and gown aside lets be gone from here in his own chambers gersen removed the white skintone the face then while addels watched in lambent disapproval he dressed in his ordinary gear addels finally could no longer contain his curi osity where are you off to now the sun is setting dont you ever think of rest gersen in the act of arming himself responded half apologet ically did you hear panshaws hints how cooneys bank should never consider the ettiha gafgantyf a reliable asset how famous is lens larque for his tricks lens larque is evidently close at hand i want to watch his trickery i lack all such curiosity when i think of what i have under gone i am horrified i am a legalist and a financial expert i admit as much but my disregard for the law goes no further i need time to rest i must recover my sense of reality i bid you good evening jehan addels departed the chamber five minutes later gersen left the suite the placidity of the domus seemed untroubled ottile panshaw evidently had not called in an alarm in front of the domus gersen signaled down one of the citys venerable hacks and climbed into the passenger dome he called into the mesh to slayhack spaceport as fast as possible aye sir the hack trundled along the esplanade and around the bend into pilkamp road as they drove the afterglow faded and dusk glimmered across lake peamish through moynal and drury they went and into wigaltown and gersen saw ahead the yellow sign advertising tintles shade the upper windows showed red and yellow lights and flickered with moving shadows merriment tonight at tintles shade from wigaltown into dundivy then gari and finally into slayhack where the spaceport floodlights lit up the sky gersen leaned forward in his seat trying to induce speed upon the lumbering old hack by sheer force of will an explosion of light across the sky a shuddering burst of yellowwhite glare and sec onds later a great belch of sound staring from the cab gersen saw black fragments hurtling across the light upon which his imagi nation put the semblance of human shapes the light subsided into a cloud of roiling smoke the cabdnver cried out in fear sir what shall i do keep going called gersen then a moment later stop here he alighted from the cab and looked across the field in the i hi dfmon princes place of the ettilia gargantyr lay a few smouldering shards gersen stood rigid with rage and dismay predictable he told himself be tween clenched teeth lens larque plays quaint tricks he destroys lawsuit and ship together and collects fall insurance these pre miums ottile panshaw will not have neglected i have become complacent he muttered i have lost my hard edge he swung around in disgust and returned to the cab he asked the driver can you drive out on the field no sir the field is forbidden to us then continue along the road a bit the cab skirted the field in the illuminated area beside the repair shops gersen noticed a swarming group of men apparently in a state of shock or hysteria gersen called to the driver take that access lane yonder toward the warehouses i may not leave the public road sir very well wait here gersen umped to the ground from behind the shops darted a small warehouse truck driven erratically at full speed it fled across the field toward the access lane the men at the shop reacted instantly some pursued on foot others leapt aboard vehicles and so gave chase the truck gaming the access lane bounded at full speed toward the road as it passed under a floodlight gersen saw the drivers face which was wide redbronze and heavy with staring eyes the face of tintle he lacked skill in guiding the truck and drove off the lane into a rut the truck jerked and bumped and slewing to the side overturned tintle was thrown through the air kicking and sprawling he fell half on his back half on his side and lay for a moment inert then laboriously he lurched to his feet threw a wild glance over his shoulder and started at a hobbling run for the road his pursuers caught him under one of the floodlights and in the circle of blue white radiance struck him great blows with fists and metal tools tintle staggered back and forth and fell to the ground the men kicked him and jumped upon his head and body until tintle was bloody ruptured and dead gersen arriving at the scene spoke to a young man wearing mechanics overalls what goes on here the young mechanic turned him a stare halfapprehensive halfdefiant dont you see the wreckage that hulk yonder this man exploded it and half a dozen of our fellows as well bold as brass he drove his truck under the cargo hatch and set down a great the ffce crate it was track thats what it was then he drove off and a minute later the blast all but knocked us down over by the shops there were four guards aboard and six dayshift men going off to their homes gone in the blast overcome by indignation and the importance of the occasion the young mechanic began to blus ter and who are you to come asking why we should capture the drot without troubling to reply gersen turned away he marched back to the hack where the driver waited nervously in the darkness sir where now gersen turned a last look across the field where in the glaring floodlights the group of workmen waving stamping gesticulating still surrounded tmtles corpse back into town said gersen away from slayhack south along pilkamp road into gara and dundivy rolled the cab gersen stared unseeingly ahead along the line of streetlights which curved in a luminous chain all the way back to old town gersens brooding was interrupted by the sight of a sign i in i ifs sh if as before colored lights and moving shadows played along the upper windows tonight while tintle lay dead in slayhack tmtles shade pulsed with jovial activity an eerie emanation tingled the edge of gersens mind for an instant he sat indecisively then called the hack to a halt wait for me i wont be long aye sir gersen crossed the street from tmtles shade came muffled sounds of revelry piping music occasionally a how and yelp of foolish glee he pushed through the entrance the old woman in black looked stonily across the beer hall but spoke no word gersen mounted the stairs to the upper floor passing through the door he round himself behind a row three deep of ranked bodies heads and sloping shoulders silhouetted against the pink illumina tion beyond at the center of the room an entertainment was in progress two musicians on a platform played drums and tweedlepipes be low and visible only in glimpses past bald heads and dangling ear lobes a wizened youth cavorted with a pneumatic dummy dressed as an old darsh woman he sang in a nasal voice urgent and breathless the darsh jargon not altogether intelligible to gersen dirsh nun ind onim use disinctl difftflnt idioms horh rich in epithets the song is phrased m mile lon

bane vll go there nevermore to the refrains the audience gave enthusiastic support stamp ing yelping belching a plangent obbligato gersen sidled behind the spectators toward the kitchen where the view was less obstructed certain folk present wore ordinary vegan garments others the white darsh robe and thabbat two men at a table across the room attracted gersens attention the first massive and curiously still with his features obscured under his thabbat the other a smaller man sat with his back to gersen and made small diffident gestures as he spoke someone thrust at gersen and pushed him about gersen looked into the sardonic face ofmadame tintle so isnt it you the ardent journalist did you come to meet your friend gersen asked politely which friend do you mean madame tintle showed a sly malicious smile which moved her mustache more than her mouth t dont know as to this iskish look all alike to me but maybe youll see him by and by or perhaps you came to watch ned ticket not altogether i thought perhaps to speak to you in connec tion with our understanding for instance are these all regular pa trons tonight who are those men sitting yonder across the roomr iskish darsh jargon for anyone other than a darsh the demon princks strangers fresh in from dar sal could they be the acquain tances you were seeking in this dim light i cant be sure madame tintles smile became an unpleasant grin why not step across and pay your respects a good idea ill do so after a bit have you had news of tintle he was sent out on an errand is that correct tintle is becoming all the rage he danced last night and showed nimble heels the singer finished his song to belching stamping approval madame tintle sniffed in displeasure vile old khoontz is it never fear on the womans floor we eat fresh ahagaree and cele brate tobo the tremulous tyrant it works no better than a bal ance what have we next ticket the snaveler watch with attention you shall be diverted madame tintle lurched away shouldering spectators aside with neither concern nor apology gersen looked back to the two men across the room the slight man almost certainly was otdle panshaw who might be the other a drum rattled out on the floor ran a tall thin man on long thin legs wearing a right costume of mustard and black his arms were lean and corded his long twitching nose drooped over a long pointed chin he flourished a whip snaps and cracks accented his recitation hoy ho now its time for our fun im nikity ticket i first tasted water at wabbers fountain i learned leather from roly tatwyn my whip is whirr its never weary so who wants to dance wholl skip to leather music dainty and delicate here come our dancers in fascination gersen watched the two men across the room one was ottile panshaw the other he hardly dared allow the name to enter his mind might it be lens larque madame tintle emerged from an alcove behind the two men approaching from the side she stood in a posture at once defer ential and contemptuous she leaned forward spoke and jerked her thumb both men turned to look toward gersen who taking warn ing had sidled back into the shadows hoy hoy hoy cried ned ticket to the dancers he snapped the long whip close by their feet creating heavy succulent sounds smartly now smartly dance to music of leather with a kick and a hop thats the way of it show us your heels then flourish the targets the dancers wore right short trousers with scarlet the face s disks sewn upon the seat two of the dancers were darsh boys the third was maxel rackrose who danced with agility hoop hap hup called ned ticket this is how we dance at doodams shade a touch of sweetness the good sweet leather the glossy leather supple and sweet hey hurrah a snap and a snap and a snap snap snap skip now lively there were off for a merry reel around and step twist and step and a taste of the leather oh my soul a fine smart dance we are truly gay hop and skip and a snap snap snap pshaw so soon why must you spoil the fun a snap and a snippet right on the target up now twirl like a graceful fairy exhaustion a fable up on with the dance we cannot halt so soon up bend and sway a smile and a tear tempt with the target a moment to rest ned ticket swung on his heel bowed to the man beside ottile panshaw sir your whip is famous will you join the dance the massive man made a negative signal ottile panshaw cried out we need fresh dancers keen and eager theres one by the kitchen the iskish spy thrust him out on the floor gersen called rackrose this way quick now rackrose glassyeyed and panting turned his head hobbled toward gersen not yet cried ned ticket make ready for the dance gersen sensed a loom behind him he looked to see madame tintle arms outstretched to push gersen slid aside pulled and swung her sprawling out on the floor snatching out his gun he fired toward the massive mans belly his arm was jostled the bolt went astray a fist knocked the gun from his hand dark shapes converged on him rackrose gersen bellowed this way quick now a roaring figure pressed upon gersen he was dealt a buffet on the back of the head he blinked jerked an elbow into a nearby paunch he slipped his left hand into metal fingers dropped a knife into his right hand someone struck him again gersen seized the arm his assailant uttered a rattling gasp as energy jarred his body stabbing slashing gersen reached rackrose hauled him into the kitchen and even at this juncture recoiled at the oily stench four women bawled objurgations gersen seized a cauldron of bubbling sauce and threw it out into the main room evoking cries ot anguish through a side door which gave on the steps came madame tintle eyes glaring she seized gersen from behind and clasped him to s thp dp von princes herself women she bayed bring the sick oil work the grat ers well fry this iskish on the stove gersen touched her with metal fingers she cried out and stum bled backward to tumble down the stairs gersen toppled a rack of condiments upon the women signaled to rackrose quick now they ran down the stairs hopping over the dazed form of madame tintle at the bottom the beer woman came to look in wonder wtiat causes so much turmoil madame tintle has taken a tumble gersen explained you had best see to her come rackrose we must be on our way gersen took a last look up the stairs at the landing the massive man stood pointing a gun gersen slid to the side the bolt passed him by he threw his knife the angle was awkward instead of piercing the mans neck the blade sheared away his dangling ear lobe the man called out in rage and fired the gun again but gersen and rackrose were out the door they ran across pilkamp road to the cab gersen called to the driver quick now back into town at top speed the darsh have all gone crazy the cab lurched and rumbled south there was no pursuit gersen slumped back into the seat he was there twice i tried for his life twice i failed the scheme worked well he took the bait twice i failed i dont know what youre talking about snarled rackrose here and now be notified i can serve as your assistant no longer the salary rackrose spoke in a voice of sarcastic delicacy is not commensurate with my duties gersen was in no mood to lavish sympathy upon rackrose you came away with your life consider yourself lucky rackrose snorted and painfully shifted his position easy for you to talk you were not dancing with ned ticket what a re pulsive business gersen sighed ill see that youre compensated enoy your welts theyve earned you money rackrose presently asked who was that large man in the darsh robes lens larque you tried to kill him certainly why not i failed worse luck thl mci you are a most peculiar ournahst no doubt you are right three days later jehan addels made contact with gersen by com municator taking note ofaddds carefully composed face gersen knew that significant news was in the offing in regard to the ettilia gargantyr said addels in a voice so dry as almost to crackle the vessel was quite destroyed the case at law of cooneys bank versus ettiha gargantyr becomes moot that is my own conclusion said gersen one immediately begins to speculate as to insurance said addels we wonder as to the insuring agency the coverage and of course the beneficiary some facts have now emerged and you may wish to learn them definitely so said gersen what are these facts i find that the policy was negotiated only three weeks ago to a total liability which approximately equals or even exceeds replace ment cost of the vessel and its cargo the insuring entity is coo neys fiduciary assurance a subsidiary of cooneys bank at thrump on david alexanders planet the insured party kotzash mutual syndicate of seqeu dar sai has presented its claim in accordance with company policy compensation has promptly and faithfully been rendered gersen looked at addels with a gloomy expression i own cooneys bank you do and cooneys fiduciary assurance as well then in effect i have paid lens larque a large sum of money this is the case gersen not normally given to emotional demonstration raised his hands in the air clenched his fists and brought them down upon his head he tricked me he is notorious for his pranks said addels primly yes so i understand an ancient proverb stipulates that he who sups with the devil should use a long spoon you would seem to have attempted such a meal with a small dessert fork we shall see said gersen are you ready to leave addels face became blank leave for where dar sai of course i hp demon princes addels half lowered his eyelids and tilted his head sideways in a reedy voice he said important personal affairs prevent me from oinmg you on this venture also a side issue of course dar sal is a wild and savage world where i would surely be uncomfortable yes possibly so after a cautious moment addels asked when do you leave this afternoon there is nothing to keep me here addels said gruffly id waste my breath counseling you to prudence so i will wish you luck im as prudent as necessary said gersen ill be in touch with you before too long part ii dar sai from tourists guide to the coranne by jane szantho dar sai second planet of the coranne cannot be con sidered a pleasant or propitious world indeed the casual observer will at once discount all possibility of human hab itation each hemisphere may be divided into zones almost equally malignant at the poles the winds howl around the vortex of a perpetual downdraft cyclone to deposit inces sant rain slush and snow the consequent groundwaters drain into the bogs an environment of ooze poisonous slimes stiletto bugs uncounted varieties of algae some of which achieve the stature of bushes from the bogs water drains south and north respec tively into the equatorial hot zone the socalled wale some of this water evaporates some sinks out of sight into the sand the wale is pitilessly exposed to the blazing light of cora and seems as vicious as any other environment of dar sai gentle variable winds blow during the day but at night all is quiet on the desert which at this time becomes strangely beautiful a small dead star once coras companion and post humously known as fideske is responsible for human ha bitancy upon dar sai twenty million years ago fideske disintegrated into fragments the largest of which shanitra orbits methel the third planet as a moon some fragments form an asteroidal belt others fell upon methel and dar sai bringing rare and precious elements of high atomic if dpmon princes number the duodecimates on methel these elements are lost on the sea bottoms on dar sai they have become a component ot the desert sands which the wind constant sifts and segregates the first men came to dar sai to mine duodecimate lodes over centuries they evolved into darsh a folk as fierce and perverse as the world they inhabit these first settlers in the main fugitives desperadoes and neerdowells quickly discovered that they could sur vive by day only with the aid of powerful aircoolers or m more primitive circumstances under sheds cooled by trick ling water using riches gamed from duodecimates the darsh erected their famous shades enormous parasols as much as five hundred feet high and sheltering twenty or thirty acres water from the underground aquifers is pumped to the top surface to flow across to the periphery and trickle down in sheets veils and cool mists under these shades live the darsh they grow quantities of food in their garden trays some they synthesize and the rest they import the spices which enliven their cuisine derive from partic ular types of bogalgae some of these spices the ahaga ree for instance is as valuable by weight as good black duodecimate the darsh are not physically appealing to outworlders or iskish to use darsh argon they are largeboned often bulky and in their later years inclined to corpulence their features are heavy and their complexions tend to a raw roan color occasionally with a chalky undertone at puberty the men become entirely hairless the women to the contrary are hirsute and ten years after puberty w ill often grow mus taches in that brief decade between puberty and facial mus tache the girls or kitchets achieve a certain degree of physical charm and are held m great esteem by darsh men of all ages the darsh ear cartilage stretches easily the lobes hang loose and long and sometimes support dangling pendants the men wear white robes and hoods when they go abroad in the daylight small air conditioners pump cold air under these robes the women who never leave the shade misnomer vhich ncicrtheless has achie ed vicje popular usage the face by day wear less voluminous kirtles of maroon orange or mustard which are m particularly disagreeable discord with their complexion darsh children find themselves in an unsympathetic mi lieu they are exploited in all manner of ways they gain neither gratitude nor affection and so develop a remarkable egocentncity which is not dissimilar to pride as if each had declaimed to fate you have abused and mishandled me you have shown me no favor but i have survived i have grown stubborn and strong despite all this pride in the darsh male expresses itself as plam bosh a swaggering willful flamboyance a reckless disre gard for consequence a perversity which automatically conduces to contempt for authority if by one means or another such as public humiliation this pride is fractured or destroyed the man is broken and thereafter becomes almost eunuchoid in women the quality is more difficult to define and takes the form of studied inscrutability whoever wishes to experience human opacity need only attempt jocular inter course with a darsh woman men and women espouse each other for economic accommodation nothing else procre ation is accomplished by a far more adventurous process during nocturnal promenades across the desert especially when mirassoushine is in the sky the system is simple in outline but complicated in detail both men and women aggressively seek out young sexual partners the men way lay girls barely adolescent women seize upon boys not much older to lure the boys out upon the desert the women ruthlessly send out the pubescent girls and so it goes the system has permutations unnecessary now to ex plore in this connection the whipping entertainments may be mentioned these reach elaborate forms in the principal towns and the offworld visitor who witnesses one of these strange rites will be amazed fascinated and no doubt re pelled the characteristic darsh game hadaul perhaps also should be mentioned but this is more common among the backland shades lest the reader cultivate a negative impression of the darsh their virtues must be indicated they are brave the demon princes there are no darsh cowards they never utter falsehoods they would thereby compromise their pride they are guardedly hospitable in the sense that any stranger or off world wanderer arriving at a remote shade is provided food and shelter as his natural right the darsh may confiscate preempt or simply avail himself of any object for which he has an immediate use but he will never deign to pilfer the strangers belongings are safe however should this stranger discover a pocket of black sand he might well be confronted robbed and murdered the darsh admit such acts to be crimes but apply no great moral indignation to the perpetrators in regard to darsh food the less said the better the traveler must adjust himself to a darsh meal as he might a natural catastrophe it avails nothing to pretend relish the darsh themselves know that their food is repulsive and ap parently derive a perverse pride in their ability to consume it regularly there my traveling friends you have in capsule form a sketch image of the world dar sai you may not like it but you will never forget it gersen made the passage to dar sai in a fantamic flitterwing of modest size and appearance the course took him into the back regions of argo navis close to the edge of beyond an area which he had never before visited ahead burnt the white sun cora in the macroscope gersen picked out the two inhabited worlds methel and dar sai in regard to dar sai traffic directions made only a brief refer ence the major settlements are in order of importance serjeuz wabbers fountain dinkelstown and belfeser none of these places provides other than rudimentary facilities for the repair or servicing of spaceships there are neither en try nor departure regulations indeed no central darsh au thority dar sai is to some extent policed by methlen agencies for protection of their commercial interests but away from the four main towns methlen influence dimin ishes at serjeuz a rectangle marked out in white indicates the face the preferred landing site for easiest access to the com mercial warehouses from a height of twenty miles serjeuz appeared as a small mechanism lost on the gray pink and yellow waste as gersen descended details became exact in the morning light of cora and serjeuz was revealed as a cluster of parasols spilling veils of water around the rims the fiasco at rath eileann had receded to the back ofgersens memory where it rankled like a small hidden ulcer looking down at serjeuz gersen felt rekindled emotions the hunters stealth tin gling alertness awe for the nearness of the dire beast lens larques emanations permeated the landscape a hundred times he had cooled himself under the flowing parasols a hundred times in his fluttering white robes he had crossed the desert between serjeuz and the bugold shades conceivably at this very moment he ate and drank at some favorite resort not ten minutes time away in a whitebordered rectangle two dozen spacecraft of various sorts and conditions were at rest gersen landed the flitterwing close beside the shimmering waterwalls the vessel became silent the deck felt solid underfoot local time was midmorning gersen prepared to debark ac cording to the immuno logical index windborne spores from the bog algae germinating in the lungs posed the most significant threat to human health gersen had already dosed himself with prophylactic counteragents he donned a white hooded robe tucked money and bonded identity papers into his pouch made sure of his weapons stepped through the vestibule and descended to the sandy surface of dar sai heat instantly pressed against his face he narrowed his eyes against the glare and set off toward the water wall four darsh burst through the curtain astride dilapidated vehi cles rolling on fourfoot airballs they rode with fine plambosh bouncing and bounding white robes fluttering behind thabbats covered their faces except for metal hemispheres over their eyes which gave them the look of whiterobed insects they seemed not to see gersen and nearly ran him down gersen jumped to the side and shouted a curse at their retreating backs to no effect the four rode to the north toward the shimmer of a lone parasol at the horizon the df vn princes gersen passed through the waterveil into a jungle of vegeta tion growing from trays stacked fifty feet high the lane passed underneath skirted a pair of domed warehouses and ended at a confusion of small heavywalled concrete domes low high large and small domes piled on domes domes impinging upon or grow ing out of other domes domes in clusters of three four five or six these were the socalled dumbles or darsh residences con structed to an architecture at once heavy vital and appropriate to the environment like the darsh themselves vegetation surrounded and overhung each dumble in the ways and alleys wandered small children gersen noticed a group of young boys playing a pushing shoving wrestling game a childs variation of hadaul gersen selected what seemed to be a principal avenue and pres ently passed from under the first parasol to the shelter of a second even loftier and more expansive enclosing an enormous volume of cool anv space the avenue opened into a plaza surrounded by concreteand glass domes built in a style halfdarsh halfinterworld galactic the largest of these housed the chanseth bank the miners in vestment bank the grand bank of dar sai and a pair of hotels the sfennde select and the travelers inn three restaurants fronted the plaza the sfennde garden the travelers inn garden and the olander the sfennde garden catered to a clientele ger sen could not immediately identify the travelers inn garden spreading haphazardly under lime persimmon and sweet amssus trees served a variety of patrons tourists business travelers mis cellaneous wanderers and spacemen a few whiterobed darsh the olander at the far side of the plaza catered only to the darsh of the hotels the sfennde select seemed the most grand the most expensive and presumably the most comfortable the trav elers inn while perhaps more relaxed seemed a trifle shabby ger sen once again inspected the folk in the sfennde garden they were a handsome people darkhaired with clear pallid olive com plexions and regular features they wore formal garments of a style strange to gersen like the sfennde select itself they seemed in congruous to the surroundings of dar sai gersen could more easily have imagined them at a fashionable resort on a remote world at a time either in the far past or far in the future intrigued gersen decided to take lodging at the sfennde se lect he crossed the plaza and sauntered through the garden res ihl face taurant the patrons pausing in their conversations turned to watch him with a cool curiosity he found not altogether flattering he entered the lobby which under an oysterwhite ceiling oc cupied the entire ground floor from a central pool grew a tree with black and orange leaves small birdhke creatures hopped through the branches dived into the pool fluttered once more aloft whistling soft flutehke tones the reception desk occupied an alcove to the side gersen approached the clerk a sallow young man with an austere visage turned gersen a quick sideglance then studi ously focused his attention upon the ledger in which he had been making entries gersen said in a gentle voice at your convenience please summon the reception clerk i wish to engage a room or better a suite the clerk spoke in an even monotone we are unable to offer accommodation we are completely booked try the travelers inn or the olander gersen wordlessly turned away and departed the sfennde se lect the folk in the garden seemed not to notice him he crossed the plaza to the travelers inn a hostelry with a character totally different from that of the sfennde select the travelers inn had been constructed m the darsh manner with heavy reliance upon improvisational insights the three curving rows of parabolic arches the eight intersecting domes the rotundas upper decks and balconies had been assembled in a spirit of adventure and lent the edifice a definite flavor of plambosh the entry led through thick walls into a lobby practical rather than sumptuous at a circular reception desk worked a thin sandyhaired man with a thin jaw and long chin he greeted gersen with a courteous if perfunctory sa lute your wishes sir a suite the best available i expect to be staying several days perhaps a week or even longer i can suit you very well sir i have in mind a fine airy bedroom with a sweeping view across the plaza there is a splendid lavatory a parlor carpeted in green frieze and generally excellent furniture if you wish to make an inspection mount the staircase turn right into the first corridor and enter the blue door trimmed in black gersen visited the rooms and found them to his taste return ing to the reception desk he paid over a weeks rent to formalize his occupancy the demon princes the clerk was favorably impressed we are happy to secure your patronage sir i am reassured said gersen at the sferinde they wanted nothing to do with me no mystery there the sferinde is a methlen resort they cater to no one else enlightenment came to gersen so those are the methlen they seem quite exclusive exclusive is the proper word if holy symas in all his splen dor came down to the sferinde with a retinue of doublewinged mantics and trumpetplaying cherubs mounted on lions theyd send the lot trooping across to the travelers expect nothing better of the methlen the clerk both voluble and alert might prove a valuable source of information reflected gersen he asked why do they come to dar sai in the first place some have business interests others are sheer tourists youll often see a contingent out in travelers garden inspecting the lower classes still theyre not vicious or even odious their wealth allows them to play at life everything is a dramatic game at serjeuz they are all effete aristocrats with the poor unwitting darsh as clods and varlets the clerk made a tolerant gesture still what of it all i too am supercilious now and then one would never believe it said gersen graciously oh i have become easier over the years remember i must deal with every lout and mooncalf who chooses to show me his face just as i am doing now for many years my nerves were like electric wires then i discovered the first axiom of human accord i accept each person on his own terms i keep a close tongue in my head i offer opinions only when so solicited what a remarkable change dissension vanishes novel facts emerge digestion flows like a wide river your ideas are interesting said gersen i would like to dis cuss them later but now i think i will try your restaurant very good sir i wish you a pleasant meal gersen stepped into the garden and selected a table with a view across the plaza he touched a button and the tabletop became an illuminated display of the food and drink on order a waiter stepped forward gersen pointed to one of the depicted items what is this the face that is our sunday punch it is enlivened with three tots of black gadroon rum and a half gill of secret elixir the day is still somewhat young what is this that is a simple swizzle prepared from fruits and pale elixirs that sounds more practical what is this that is tourist ahagaree especially modified to suit the off world taste and this those are parboiled nightfish fresh from the bogs i will have simple swizzle ahagaree and a salad at your order gersen sat back in his chair and contemplated the surroundings the plaza extended to a bank of trees with leaves of a rich nutmeg brown beyond rose the shafts of distant parasols in certain areas veils of falling water obscured the view in others he could see to the far edges of serjeuz cosmopolitan architects using standard materials and darsh motifs had created most of the structures around the plaza with the notable exception of the travelers inn which seemed authentically darsh the waiter wheeled up a trolley loaded with covered salvers the ahagaree was placed on the table with flanking side dishes to the left went the salad to the right a beaker of simple swizzle the waiter withdrew gersen tasted with caution and found tourist ahagaree definitely more palatable than that served by madame tin tie gersen ate a leisurely meal then sat musing over a pot of tea from his pocket he brought a memorandum prepared by jehan addels and submitted to him immediately before his departure from aloysius it started off briskly kotzash mutual is an operation formulated by an ingenious trickster with considerable financial expertise also evident is a cruel impudence and the utter

recently collected a handsome insurance payment and didroxus mining and exploration kotzash would seem underpriced except for the fact that the exec utive director is ottile panshaw the situation has its interesting aspects but i would not care to explore them at close range i wish you good health and longevity and urge caution upon you both out of personal esteem and consideration of selfinterest since i would have to look long and far to find work as remu nerative with my very best respects ja gersen put away the letter leaned back in his chair and sat in profound cogitation the way to lens larqueled through ottile panshaw perhaps via kotzash mutual at this moment the stuation was even and serene like a pond on a windless day the great fish lurked hidden beneath glassy reflections to force him to move to lunge to display himself the water must be disturbed out into the garden stepped the receptionist to stand blinking this way and that gersen raised his hand the receptionist ap proached a wiry little man sandyhaired with a thin face and wise heavylidded brown eyes either bowlegged or lame so that he walked with a swaggering hop sit down said gersen may i offer you a sunday punch or would you prefer something less conspicuous thank you the receptionist turned to the waiter ill take a gill of that good engelman yellow he turned back to gersen you enjoyed your meal yes indeed the management seems to understand outworld tastes they ought to by this time theyve been at it for years what of yourself youre not native to dar sai certainly not i was born at svengay on caph tv a lively little world have you ever visited there no my closest approach would be the mizar system or per haps dubhe im not certain of the distances the dfmon princes i see youve had your share of wandering among the stars where is your home may i ask usually i can make a guess but in your case i am baffled i was born in a world you have never heard of as a boy i was taken to earth by my uncle and where did you live on earth we never stayed long in one place i know london well and san francisco noumea melbourne wherever my uncle chose to educate me gersen smiled faintly as he remembered the style of his uncles instruction i am also well acquainted with alphanor and the concourse in general may i inquire your name i am kirth gersen as you know i am daswell tippin at your service a person of no preten sions speaking of pretensions i was interested to hear you speak of the methlen they are a people unfamiliar to me they are a group of overwealthy bashaws and not particularly interesting said tippin i seldom have dealings with them their money comes from duodecimates and they are here principally to look after their interests for all i know they are indeed glorious superb and exquisitely sensitive had i these attributes i might also avoid tourists darsh and other vulgarians do the methlen themselves mine duodecimates certainly not show one a shovel hed call it an implement they buy sell deal in options leases futures and all mining fi nance and of course they all have vast investments what ofkotzash mutual was that a methlen operation daswell tippin darted gersen a swift sharp glance then gave a snort of disgust to the contrary kotzash mutual was advertised as a counter to the methlen a way to beat them at their own game it cost me six hundred good svu then you must know ottile panshaw by sight no more said tippin with a prim sniff he still keeps his office yonder under skansel shade hes not considered a swindler and a scoundrel ive heard hard talk but what can be proved nothing tip pin drained his goblet and set it down with a thoughtful clink ger sen raised his finger to the waiter two more of the same please thank you said tippin i seldom take drink hut today i find myself in the mood the pace i enjoy your conversation said gersen the kotzash affair is intriguing in itself is the name of the robber generally known tippin looked right and left people use a dreadful name lens larque one of the famous demon princes gersen nodded i know his reputation hes darsh so im told tippin again glanced right and left apparently so a bugold rachepol i dont like to use his name it falters on my tongue he is a trickster with a humor like that of the devil sclamoth who puts the heads of sons in their mothers ovens come now said gersen lightly a name is no more than a word words are without substance wrong declared tippin with intense fervor words are what magic is made of have you not read farsakars cantrip mech anisms no then you know nothing of words gersen who lacked any large interest in the subject made an offhand gesture we live in a world of solidities i fear the man and his whip not the words lens larque and panak tippin frowned down into his goblet well no great matter one way or the other he is human and a darsh how the methlen would love to take him he is their bugbear he in turn bears the methlen a grudge have you visited methel not yet twanish is their spaceport and first city the methlen cant abide the odor of ahagarec and darsh must keep to a special down wind quarter isnt this a strange and wonderful universe i believe that i might enjoy another half gill of this excellent liquor gersen gave an appropriate order to the waiter the methlen lost nothing in the kotzash calamity nothing whatever the darsh and small speculators such as myself we are the victims and ottile panshaw neither lost nor gained i wouldnt know he disappeared for months but now he is back in serjeuz i saw him only yesterday he appears wan and unhealthy understandable after such a catastrophe what might be the value of your own kotzash holdings rachepol a person driveniua friini his niti e shade an outcast a homeless wanderer more often than not i cnminil thi demon princes i own twenty shares twenty times zero is still zero gersen leaned back in his chair frowned up at the underside of the parasol he reached in his pouch and brought out twenty svu i have a foolish habit of speculation ill buy your shares for an svu apiece tippins thin jaw slackened he frowned down at the certifi cates then turned a suspicious sideglance toward gersen spec ulation usually has a basis of hope mine is based on caprice you do not seem a capricious man suppose lens larque indemnified kotzash i would profit that is forlorn thinking if ever i heard any no doubt youre right gersen reached out to reclaim the money but tippins skinny hand was there first not so fast why shouldnt you enoy your whims no reason whatever where are your shares up in my rooms ill bring them to you at once he hurried away and presently returned with the shares money changed hands i have access to other kotzash shares said tippm im not quite sure how many but ill also sell them at this price gersen leaned back with a sour grin be absolutely discreet dont tell anyone that an offworlder is buying kotzash shares theyll suspect a swindle and raise their price i wont buy and therell be profit for no one do you understand this chain of events in every detail except one which is why you are buying the shares aside from caprice of course caprice and let us say altruism tippm leaned back with a morose sneer one is as plausible as the other please advance me some working capital a hundred svu will suffice for today you will surely take all and any kotzash shares at one svu apiece surely and definitely gersen produced the money one fi nal stipulation under no circumstances approach ottile panshaw tippins eyes shifted his shares are as good as any he owns more shares than i care to buy discretion is abso lutely necessary do you agree to this well yes of necessity still i fail to understand caprice thf face caprice is a blanket which cannot cover every bed i took you for a man fixed upon grim fact gersen held up a packet of svu notes these are my facts call them grim if you like you have made your point tippm rose to his feet ill re port back later today he departed the garden and at skipping trot set off across the plaza summoning the waiter gersen paid his account where is dmdar house yonder sir under skansel shade notice the great dome lust left of the shaft thats dmdar house tippm had gone toward skansel shade gersen decided to fol low from the darsh habitat by stuart sobek in cosmopohs dar sai hard by the sun cora is hot and and around the equatorial band where the sands are rich with duode cimates over the centuries a race of hardy men and women have learned tricks to defeat coras heat while mining wealth from the sands these are the darsh a race of ten thousand oddities by day they enoy the shelter of vast metal umbrellas which spill veils of water from their brims the famous shades of dar sai unprotected out on the wale a man will die of heat and sunblister in minutes under his shade he enjoys cool greenery and icy sherbets the darsh are not a merry folk nor prone to philo sophic insight still they concentrate on the essence of every instant and display a curious propensity for enjoying that particular quality by experiencing its antithesis their food is seasoned with vile condiments so that they may better savor cool pure water they drink offensive teas and beers if only to exemplify this typical perversity which they value for its own sake their erotic relationships are of a quality to alarm placid dispositions and apparently are based upon hatred and contempt rather than mutual regard gersen passed under the water veil which separated central shade from skansel shade the flow a drizzle of misty droplets felt cool on his face and no more than dampened his garments he thepcl proceeded to the skansel plaza under trees and foliage past struc tures ageworn and shabby in contrast to the cosmopolitan mo dernity under central shade the folk peering from the dumbles were urban darsh distinguished from desert darsh by soft slippers light robes and a sallow undertone to their complexions still with heavy noses anvil jaws and dangling jeweled earlobes gersen halted at the edge of skansel plaza tippm was nowhere visible a few assiduous tourists wandered among the shops and booths buying curios from darsh women with wooden faces and black mustaches or doggedly drinking darsh beer at outdoor places of refreshment all in all thought gersen a quaint and picturesque scene tainted only by the psychic proximity of lens larque to the right rose dmdar house a massive pile of low flat domes intersecting in curving slanting arcades across the second level a large sign read the mining journal serjeuz dar sai comprehensive news of desert mine and shade ottile panshaw maintained an office at dmdar house daswell tippm had set off in this direction while gersen had no wish to confront ottile panshaw at this particular instant it might be wise to check upon tippins reliability he sauntered up a ramp and into dmdar house the foyer paved with livercolored tile and rank with a smoky odor gave upon a pair of dim corridors a flight of steps ascended to the upper levels gersen consulted the directory ottile pamhaw mining eaifi ties and leases was designated as the occupant of suite at random gersen chose one of the corridors and found a set of tall green doors numbered at the door numbered gersen paused to listen he thought to hear a murmur of voices he put his ear to the panel either the occupants had stopped speaking or the chamber was vacant gersen moved away fearful of discovery adjoining offices so he noticed were separated by footthick concrete walls there would be no eavesdropping into ottile panshaws office except through door or window gersen departed dmdar house at a nearby kiosk almost con cealed by the foliage of a kumquat tree a squat old lady with a nie dfmon princes bush of black hair and a remarkable mustache sold sweetmeats ournals maps and general oddments gersen bought a copy of the mining joumal and stood leaning negligently against the kiosk to the wall were pasted advertising placards one over the other an accretion of years the most recent read extravaganza of tricks and dancers panko wapshot he dances a duel against the four armed snaveler bungles and chelts a merry farce the four scorpions and the drunken sna veler see them at their tricks and pranks miffet and his wonderful sandmachine a notable invention other farces and displays at twinkners plaza under twinkners shade on the th day of dirdolio another placard tattered and faded announced remarkable display of snavelry presenting whippity ticket and the inept bungles jumping jipsum and the unwilling chelts caliogo and offish the mad khoontz catches an imbecile snaveler with other amusing tricks poses and acrobatic feats toward the front a glossy new placard printed in green and yellow announced grand hadaul at dinkelstown the face daffleday the th day oimirmone gersens attention was distracted b the appearance ot a meth len girl coming from the direction of central shade gersen watched her first with detachment then interest then fascination loose black curls framed her face which at the moment was intent and preoccupied but which on other occasions would seem to be a vivacious instrument of expression she wore a kneelength gown of a dark green stuff and carried a large gray envelope she moved with a auntv carelessness which with her pale faintly dusky skin short straight nose and delicate chin suggested a background of heedless privilege to gersen she exactly represented that existence from which his circumstances ex cluded him and which occasionally stirred bittersweet longings in his consciousness passing the kiosk the girl turned gersen an incurious glance then ran up the ramp and into dmdar house gersen watched her out of sight her figureslender and shapely without soft adiposity was most appealing he heaved a heartfelt sigh and gave his attention to the mmmg journal en minutes passed the methlen girl emerged from dmdar house and marched down the ramp meeting gersens gaze she turned him a cool stare elevated her chin a trifle and set off in the direction of central shade gersen smiled his crooked smile folded the ournal and once more entered dmdar house again he approached suite as before he seemed to hear subdued voices and then the scrape ot furniture gersen retreated quickly down the hall and took refuge in the shadows behind a buttress from suite carne two men one was daswell tippm the other a tall darsh with a square hard featured face a strong physique and long earlobes instead ofrohe and thabbat he wore a conventional nutmegbrown tunic with pale blue breeches and black ankle boots the two departed dmdar house after a moment gersen rol lowed out into skansel plaza but they had entered one of the tree shrouded byways and could not be seen gersen returned the way he had come back through the veil of mist and out upon central plaza he crossed to the travelers inn and glanced into the lobby daswell tippin was not at the desk gersen went out into the garden the tune was nou middle the demon princks afternoon the air felt warm and heavy falling water created a soporific murmur those folk still abroad moved at a languid pace and these were for the most part tourists gersen seated himself at a table beside the plaza suddenly there was much to think about he brought out addels letter referred to the text and copied off a list ottile penshaw chanseth bank nihel cahouse others gersen performed a few calculations were he to acquire all the chanseth bank stock and all that owned by nihel cahouse he could claim the executive directorship of kotzash although he would still fall short of a majority holding jehan addels candid avowals of cowardice amused gersen smiling he looked up and once again met the eyes of the methlen girl by chance passing in front of the travelers garden gersen could not fail to notice her look of cleanliness and perfect health she also seemed selfwilled and haughty compressing her mouth she darted gersen a sidewise glance of annoyance and continued on her way gersens smile became a lame grimace glumly he looked after her delightful and superb thought gersen if some what irascible through whim or curiosity she looked back over her shoulder noting gersens continued attention she tossed her head in contempt and marched off across the plaza my status in this case is not at all in doubt reflected gersen looking beyond the girl he saw the facade of the chanseth bank one of the more splendid structures of central plaza the girl entered the bank and was gone from view but gersen already had refocused his mind the chanseth bank held one thousand shares of kotzash mutual stock time might well be of the essence now that daswell tippin for better or worse had become his as sociate gersen rose to his feet and set off across the plaza a formal garden flanked the approach to the chanseth bank four tall pointane trees each a perfect teardrop stood surrounded by a low hedge of russet crackleberrv gersen passed under an arch into a large cool area paved with blue tile to his right a balustrade of carved alabaster enclosed the working area to the left spiral col the fcf umns supported a screen set with crystal tenses the far end of the chamber was a lounge area where sat half a dozen methlen of various ages including the girl gersen previously had noted now in company with an older man observing gersen her aw dropped in surprise she turned quickly away and spoke earnestly to her companion gersen smiled sourly and went to the counter a minute passed then another gersen became restless he spoke to a clerk this is the chanseth bank i presume the clerk responded in a neutral voice quite so who is the managing director may i inquire your business i want to discuss a financial transaction our business is almost wholly commercial since we are affil iated with no other bank we cash neither checks nor credit vouch ers my business is of some importance be so good as to summon your managing director he is that grandee yonder the gentle adario chanseth at the moment you will notice that he is importantly occupied oh that young lady is a person of distinction that is his daughter the gentle jerdian chanseth you may take up your business as soon as he is disengaged my business transcends idle chatter with a girl declared ger sen he left the counter and approached the lounge two tall men displaying identical bristling mustaches came to meet him each seized one of his arms and marched him swiftly toward the en trance here here gersen complained what are you up to get out and stay out said one of the men never molest a methlen lady it will go poorly with you said the other i have molested no one gersen protested you are making the methlen term iiniiw signifies a sums considerably more elevated thm that connoted bl the term gentleman lrnin implies digniu punctilio e clusit social poise and an unthinking masten of methlen etiquette he methlen gne lip seruct to the fiction that anv methlen rank on even terms with am other hence they ue a single honorific here rendered bv the cilntk in actual taci social distinctions are nr rial reflecting factors far too numerous and hiihrle to he considered here parenthetically it may be noted chai the methlen are highly susceptible lo ridicule and humiliation their civil and lnmmal penalties reflect this sensitnm ih dimon princes a mistake he pulled back and resisted their impetus but they seized him by the back of the trousers frogmarched him to the entrance and sent him flying into one of the crackleberry hedges gersen rose to his feet brushed leaves and trash from his gar ments and returned into the bank the two gentlemen astonished by his persistence stepped for ward gersen said crossly please stand back my business is with the gentle adano chanseth not yourselves he sidestepped the two men and approached chanseth who had turned away from the gentle jerdian well then what is the meaning of this affair gersen produced a business card which he gave to chanseth at vour convenience i would like to discuss some business with you the honorable kirth gersen read chanseth presi dent cooneys bank rath eileann aloysius he gave a dubious grunt what is your business with me must we discuss it here things go differently at cooneys bank if you came to discuss a business matter with me i would not have you thrown into the hedge there has obviously been a mistake said chanseth in a frosty voice if you will be good enough to elucidate even an inkling of your business i can at least inform you as to whether i am the proper person to consult as you wish said gersen frankly i am here to solicit your advice my bank has substantial interests in the metallurgical field and we are hoping to establish branches both here and at twamsh we are interested in duodecimos and duodecimate stock let us discuss this matter privately chanseth led him through a plasmatic film into an office he indicated a chair of bent whitewood sit if you will chanseth himself remained standing ignoring chanseths rather pointed rigidity gersen relaxed into the chair in a casual voice he said the methlen method of greeting a business associate is definitely unique chanseth responded m a measured tone my daughter re ported that you had eyed her in an impudent manner grinning and leering so she put it not once but several times after following her to skanse shade and back then here to the bank i therefore ordered you ejected the face if anyone other than your daughter had made the complaint said gersen i would think her vain and giddy chanseth clearly uninterested in gersens opinions gave a grim nod this is a barbaric aorld never doubt it the darsh are an mdescnbably vulgar race they are brutal and violent as well you may consider sereuz peaceful and orderly so it is but only because the methlen tolerate nothing else we are on the alert for impudence and your conduct whatever its nature incurred a quick rebuke there let the matter rest please explain your reasons for consulting me certainly the collecting and marketing of dar sai duodeci mates is evidently an inefficient process i suspect that these oper ations could be rationalized perhaps through a central agency to the benefit of everyone your assessment is correct said chanseth the duodecimate business is unstructured and disorderly but the miners are darsh and not disposed to disciplined conduct still said gersen they would appreciate the convenience of a single stable agency perhaps a cooperative system could be evolved chanseth gave a bark of humorless laughter if you wish to be assaulted broach this topic to a darsh miner kotzash mutual was ust such a syndicate the darsh miners took stock certificates for their ore the warehouse was robbed and the certificates are now worthless ive heard something of this said gersen if kotzash were revived and in some way made good outstanding claims a very expensive procedure still i may take up a few shares of kotzash at the very least i would gain a presence in the community chanseth nodded thoughtfully walking behind his desk he seated himself possibly so i hold a few shares a thousand in fact which ill sell at a fraction of their face value gersen gave an indifferent shrug id have no need for more than a few hundred if that many what is the board price on these shares im not sure rather low i daresay no doubt well ill take up your shares at a strictly nominal price fifty svu should be adequate the demon princes chanseth raised his eyebrows are you serious for a thousand shares each on the face worth ten ounces of duodecimate ten ounces of nonexistent duodecimate each is worth exactly nothing quite so unless someone undertook to indemnify sharehold ers yourself for instance you must evaluate that possibility for yourself still fifty svu is a trifling sum gersen heaved a sad sigh i will pay a hundred svu and no more chanseth went to a cabinet brought out a folder which he placed before gersen there are your shares they are to the interest of the bearer no transfer document is necessary gersen paid over a hundred svu money thrown away of course i agree how did you come into their possession chanseth grinned they cost me nothing whatever i traded them for an item equally worthless shares in a defunct mining cor poration that would of course be didroxus mining and exploration chanseth eyed him sharply how did you know the laes lists didroxus mining as a kotzash subsidiary but indicates no didroxus assets correct the only asset is mining rights on shanitra the methel moon that would seem a valuable concession chanseth showed his cool smile shanitra has been explored a hundred times over it is no more than a lump of pumice i traded nothing for nothing your trade brought you a hundred svu youre a clever man chanseth again showed a brief wintry smile ill offer you some free advice worth considerably more if you envision a branch of your bank here or anywhere else on dar sai for that matter reject the notion there is no business for you our trade is almost entirely methlen youd get none of that and the darsh rarely use banks ill keep your advice in mind gersen rose to his feet con vey my respects to your daughter a pity that she suffered distress on my account on the first occasion ill personally make amends the face s please do not trouble yourself said chanseth she has al ready forgotten the incident in any event we very shortly return to methel he performed a curt bow good day to you sir gersen departed the office in the lounge the gentle jerdian sat with a friend nibbling confections gersen nodded politely but she stared unseeingly past him gersen went out upon the plaza not far away a dusty blue dendron spiked with white and red blossoms arched over an out door cafe gersen found a table in a shadowed niche and was served a pot of tea he sat considering the possible phases of the future they made a bewildering tangle a maze in fact at whose center crouched a sinister figure gersen smiled at the extravagance of the image lens larque crouched somewhere certainly he might be that bulky man munching a custard bun across the cafe gersen had no way of knowing like all the demon princes lens larque con cealed his public identity through the maze led a single thread of several strands kotzash mutual syndicate ottile panshaw di droxus mining and the shanitra exploration and development leases and now conceivably daswell tippin why had tippin almost instantly and despite gersens admonitions gone directly to the offices of ottile panshaw who was that quasidarsh tippin had met there the next twist along the kotzash strand would seem to lead to nihel cahouse oflnkins shade who owned six hundred kotzash shares how had cahouse gained so large an interest equivalent to three tons of black sand no matter what his methods it would be wise to reach him in advance of daswell tippin or anyone else at the thought of tippin gersen made a restless movement the enlistment of tippin might well have been a serious mistake originally he had seemed a useful agent for the collection of small holdings but tippin might now have his sights set on larger trans actions who then was cahouse and where was inkins shade a shop sign nearby caught his eye the desert trading post equipment for the tourist travel information thf dpmon princes expeditions and excursions arranged and conducted witness an authentic hadaul in safety and comfort gersen went to look into the front window the display fea tured articles designed to expedite desert travel motor bubbles skimmers darshtype robes insulated boots and undersuits air conditioning packs and like merchandise a rack of books maps and pamphlets was flanked by a pair of easels the first supported a poster entitled notice to tourists with an appended text the second displayed a poster printed in dramatic green and yellow grand hadaul at dinkelstown daffleday the th day ofmirmone one of the great games of the year an event not to be missed travel in comfort with our experienced guide and witness this typical darsh spectacle gersen entered the shop and bought a book entitled the clans of dar sai a folio of maps and a pamphlet guide to the shades he took his purchases back to the table under the tree he spread out the map a strip three feet long by a foot wide tinted various colors over an underlying base tone of sandy yellow the limiting areas at top and bottom tinted green were labeled bog and were otherwise featureless the four principal towns serjeuz wabbers fountain dinkelstown and belfeser were indicated by black stars smaller settlements by large black dots isolated shades by small dots places of historical interest tourist spectacles and the like stranglers gantry the tournaline towers scor pion farm bagshilly plain the skutch were marked by the hid crosses or dotted outlines tinted areas some large some small indicated clan domains gersen located bugold region and bugold shade somewhat to the north and two thousand miles east of sereuz looking up from the map gersen noticed das well tippin hopping and trotting across the plaza with a look of worried concentration on his face his eyes darted right and left but he failed to notice gersen in the shadows with interest and amusement gersen saw him enter the chanseth bank the inter view between tippin and adano chanseth would gratify neither keeping halt an eye on the bank gersen folded the map and looked into the clam of dar sai the first chapter outlined the early his tory of dar sai the building of the shades the formation ot the clans the second third and fourth chapters described the typical circumstances of a clan its interpersonal relationships procreative habits caste distinctions and recreations in the fifth chapter the game hadaul was analyzed at length the author tending to the belief that the games of any specific society could be viewed as a micro cosm of the society itself from the bank came daswell tippin his gait perceptibly less brisk he looked nervously in all directions walked listlessly to the care and seated himself with his back to gersen not ten yards away a waiter approached tippin gave a terse order and was served a small glass of carbonated punch which he sipped as if it were a medicinal draught with a nervous gesture he reached into the pocket of his jacket and brought out a sheaf of papers gersen saw them to be certificates very like those he had bought trom chan seth iippin counted through the sheaf with fidgeting fingers gersen rose to his feet walked up behind tippin reached over his shoulder and took the certificates from tippms suddenly pal sied hand good work said gersen ill take these now and pay you tonight carry on he returned to his seat tippin uttered a small choked protest he half rose rrom his seat then slowly subsided gersen counted the certificates six of twenty shares five often shares and eight singles in all tippin watched him wordlessly a moment then slowly turned and hunched over his drink the curve of his back eloquent of angry reproach gersen added up his shares plus he now i hi upmon princes commanded sufficient shares to qualify as a director even executive director ifottile panshaw continued to hold only shares not a realistic hope at tippms table appearing as if from nowhere stood the tall darsh gersen had noticed at dmdar house he dropped into a seat beside tippin who spoke a single terse sen tence the darsh uttered a disgusted expletive and glanced in con tempt tow ard the bank he put a brusque question to tippin who gave his head a helpless shake and offered a placatory explanation which prompted the darsh to another curse tippin made a meek comment which failed to ameliorate the situation the darsh umped to his feet and strode off across the plaza tippm watched him go then looked sidewise toward gersen who returned a cold stare tippin hopped over to gersens table attempting a sedate and businesslike manner he settled into a chair those shares were not intended for you who were they intended for no matter you must return them small chance of that ill pay you your money if you want it i want the shares i had taken them in trust for that darsh gentleman who is he wtiat is his sudden interest in kotzash shares his name is bel ruk i dont know why you want the shares and i dont know why he does he wants them only because you told him that i wanted them exactly contrary to my instructions tippin twisted his mouth in a wincing grimace no matter those shares are mine and i want them back you bought them for me and im keeping them do you want your money gersen counted out svu there it is tippin picked up the money with indecisive fingers this im poses a great inconvenience upon me you shouldnt have gone to dmdar house you made the inconvenience for yourself tippm grunted i was at one time panshaws associate thats the truth of the matter i have no choice in what i do bel ruk also works with ottile panshaw i suppose thats the way of it withorfor for thats my guess how many more shares can you locate the face none i am finished with this business tippin umped to his feet like a nervous bird he peered through the foliage as a party of young methlen settled at a nearby table he looked down at gersen do you know what the darsh mean by rachepop ive heard the word it means cropear thats the same as outcast bel ruk is a rachepol he has no conscience he is a skillful killer if you value your life leave sereuz tippin departed the cafe and limped at best speed across the plaza gersen returned to his reading a few minutes later one of the methlen at the nearby table umped erect and approached gersen a tall young man with fine black eyebrows a long nose and a spare patrician cast of countenance sir a moment of your time certainly said gersen what do you want i am puzzled by your conduct i request an explanation there is little to explain my conduct is as you see i sit here drinking tea and reading this book which i bought at the shop yonder it describes the habits of the darsh that is not the conduct i had in mind please explain i refer in essence to your traffic m kotzash shares the basic principle is buy low sell high why not make inquiries of the gentle adano chanseth he is skilled in these affairs and can give you far more information than i the young man seemed not to hear i am concerned with your acts of misrepresentation and to the suspicions which you have gen erally aroused gersen smiling shook his head i cant go into such vague matters we would sit for hours defining our terms and i for one have not so much time to spare the young mans voice rose in pitch you have instigated an odd series of events i want to know what more you intend for a fact i dont know and now please excuse me gersen returned to his reading the methlen took a half step forward gersen sighed and began to gather his books a second person approached the table aldo the matter is really of no consequence come we want to discuss the excursion looking sidewise gersen saw a lower torso clad in soft dark green raising his eyes he discovered the upper parts and face of jerdian chanseth the w mon princes aldo never taking his eyes from gersen said crisply this man is devious for a fact i find him barely civil well what of that things are as they are do you hope to alter his nature even andropes can be guided perhaps i should have a word with the constables a prod with the truncheon might do wonders for this fellows disposition or it might make him more surly than ever leave him to crouch in his lair why concern yourselp it is not so simple his manipulations already are a source of trouble to your father well then let me talk to him perhaps he will conduct himself gracefully i think not this is a gentlemans affair jerdians voice took on an edge aldo stand aside or better go back to the table i will wait here said aldo with glacial dignity gersen had followed the conversation with only mild interest asjerdian dropped into the seat vacated by tippm he rose politely once more seated himself this is an unexpected pleasure may i offer you tea i am kirth gersen by the way no tea thank you why are you here at serjeuz i could give you a dozen answers said gersen i travel a great deal i like to explore odd corners of the galaxy i am inter ested m exotic peoples like the darsh and the methlen i consider them picturesque the gentle jerdians lips curled gersen could not decide whether she was irked or amused you are evading me not at all there is far too much to tell send this fellow away and we will spend the rest of the day together and perhaps the evening as well aldo stiffened and drew back i have never heard such astounding nonsense jerdian come along this mans impertinence is tiresome jerdian turned him an expressionless glance and aldo became abruptly silent jerdian spoke to gersen in a silken voice you have represented yourself as a banker true you are like no banker i have ever known your instincts are sound the usual banker is diffident and the face ruthless only when the odds are on his side what in fact is your opinion of me if anything i think of you as the man who has ust swindled my father gersen raised his eyebrows odd your father was sure that he had exploited my innocence aldo cried out these remarks verge upon slander they will bring you to grief gersen said to jerdian why not ask this gentleman to leave us he is like a raven at the feast jerdian looked thoughtfully toward aldo then returned to ger sen unless you care to speak candidly our conversation has come to an end gersen made a contrite gesture perhaps ive been evasive but i stand in awe of aldo his threats and interjections inhibit me jerdian turned suddenly ado please go back to the table for a fact it is hard to think with you looming over my shoulder as you wish aldo stalked away gersen signaled the waiter bring us a new pot of tea or better a flask of spondent flux and two glasses jerdian drew back disassociating herself from gersens conviv iality i dont care for anything in a moment i must get back to my friends why bother to come at all you evidently find me detestable the remark amused jerdian she laughed and became more winsome than ever gersen felt a sudden throb to love jerdian chanseth and with her correspondingly in love would be a fasci nating circumstance jerdian perhaps sensing something of gersens mood spoke in a carefully neutral voice i will explain my interest it is perfectly simple the kotzash scandal involved the notorious lens larque when we hear the word kotzash we are instantly on edge understandable then why are you buying kotzash shares its a tactical matter and not at all discreditable if i explained to you youd tell your father who would tell a dozen others and i would be inconvenienced jerdian looked off across the plaza then she said and you are not connected with lens larque definitely not if i were id hardly advertise the fact hi demon princes jerdian gave her shoulders a halffrivolous halfdisdainful shrug you seem very much aware of him so do you for good reason he is our local bugbear in fact we have had an unpleasant little adventure involving lens larque of course he is darsh of the deepest dye and rachepol to boot do you know that word it means outcast something of the sort the darsh make a great ceremony and cut off one of the culprits ears i cut off the other said gersen jerdian erked her head around what did you say what was the offense that cost lens larque his ear jerdian put on a face of cool dignity lens larques offense evidently was one which polite methlen girls considered either un imaginable or unspeakable i am not acquainted with the details and still you have given me no information gersen picked up his goblet and squinted through the facets of the crystal with the representative of chanseth bank i am close mouthed and evasive with someone whose personality could be considered charming stimulating even endearing id have many things indeed to tell jerdian again gave her frivolous shrug you are definitely im pertinent and very forward her voice gersen noted seemed neither peremptory nor bit ing she added thoughtfully i had reason to complain of you ear lier today you misunderstood everything i looked up from a letter which amused me and saw you but i neither grimaced nor leered then i saw the chanseth bank and went there to transact business but instead was eected jerdians dignity had almost evaporated well then what of dmdar house surely you followed me how is that possible i was there before you arrived well true but even now you are expressing yourself in per sonal terms i cant help but notice that you are fascinating to look at and pleasant to talk to shall i go on please do not trouble yourself jerdian rose to her feet you are indeed a strange man i cant decide what to make of you the face gersen stood erect on better acquaintance you may be less skeptical our acquaintance has no prospects if you are interfering with lens larque he will have you killed he is not yet aware of me there is still time not really im returning to methel directly after the dm kelstown hadaul are you still likely to be alive i hope so will i see you before then i dont know jerdian went back to her table aldo and her other friends had been covertly watching at once they put questions to which jerdian gave absentmmded responses presently the group went off toward the sfennde select hotel cora slid down dar sais chalky blue sky trembled on the horizon became red and oblate then quickly disappeared leaving a lemon yellow afterglow hundreds of miles to the north and south high flakes of cirrus glinted vermilion then purple then faded from sight with the coming of dusk the desert air cooled the serjeuz water veils dwindled to random drops and the evening breeze moved through the domes without impediment with the cessation of falling water serjeuz seemed oddly silent and the whiterobed darsh moving across the plaza were altered into mysterious crea tures of intrigue one of the whiterobed shapes was gersen carrying a soft bag containing what might be considered the tools of his trade as he passed from central shade into the even dimmer precincts ofskan sel shade he reflected that if jerdian chanseth could be with him now and know his various accoutrements she would consider him a strange man indeed just as well that jerdian was somewhere else thought gersen presumably safe in the polite environs of the sfennde select hotel just as well or even better if he could put her definitely out of his mind by no reach of the imagination could she ever become part of his precarious life for which she herself predicted a sudden end the idea at once saddened him and keyed him to his highest level of competence he approached dmdar house alert as a hunt ing beast with all his faculties conscious and subconscious moni toring the environment he halted in the shadows beside the vendors kiosk the pro ihf drmon princes prietress had gone home leaving her wares and coin dish exposed for the convenience of anyone who might choose to serve himself gersen waited five minutes passed dindar house showed only three lights on spikes atop the three highest domes through the night air sounds arrived from far distances clear as the small voices issuing from an earphone he heard a distant raucous outcry quickly stilled and somewhat closer the electronic din of darsh music a mindless thumping twanging and wailing these sounds only emphasized the quiet of dindar house gersen left the deep shadow quiet and soft as a wisp of smoke he slid up the ramp and into the entrance hall here again he paused to listen but now the outside sounds were muffled and nothing could be heard but dead silence he flicked on a flashlight swept it up the hall and saw as before moldy concrete heavy archways old varnished wood he dimmed the light to a glimmer walked on long soft strides down the hall to the tall green door opening into the offices of ottile panshaw carefully he examined doorway door lock and latch in a ten dril of light but found no sign of alarm or monitor he tested the door unlike most darsh doors this was securely bolted with a lock proof against manipulation significant thought gersen locks were discovered only in conjunction with objects of value the darsh are not prone to petty theft indeed away from the towns thievery is virtually unknown murder facetoface and robbery especially in connection with duodccimates is rather more common but still considered d vile crime the perpetrator when appre hended is first whipped raw then chained out among the rocks where he becomes prey to the lancilark gnawbugs and scorpions the crime considered most vile b the darsh is the then either of anothers desertroller or his water supply the penalties entail flogging then staking out at the bottom ot the towns cesspit s a note of possible interest the otfense which occasioned lens larques election from bugold shade was the theft of an air conditioner from the corpse of a man who had drunkenlv fallen into poisonous cactus the crime vss considered repulsive but not su perlatively heinous husse bugold is he was then known suffered the loss of an earlobe and was hipped awa from bugold shade as another sidelight it might be noted that jerdian chanseth lacking exact infor mation as to the nature of husse bugolds transgression automancalh imputed to him that sin regarded most reprehensible hy the methlen i e unnatural sexual conduct ac tivity which the darsh take for granted hence her reaction lo gersens question i he full scope of comparative criminology is morbidly fascinating and is discussed not only in book of baron bodisseys monumental exegesis of the human condition but also in more specialized works such as karen millers intelplawtuiy cii m cansef and cofiwjttvvie or theodore pedersens peuanf souh richard peitu in ptopifi of the coranm discusses die almost polar sociologies ofmethel and dar sai at length the face he retreated to the entry ramp and once again appraised the surroundings across the plaza a pair of beer gardens shrouded under foliage showed clusters of green and white lamps no one walked the plaza gersen jumped up on the slanting face of a but tress edged over a dome and down upon another curved surface which extended past a line of windows gauging distances gersen identified that window opening into ottile panshaws office and approached along a convenient slope of the dome unlike other windows of the row a grating ofvondaloy tubing guarded the open ing which was additionally closed off by a pane of heavy glass there would be no easy entry here the room was dark within gersen tried to illuminate the in terior with his flashlight but was baffled by reflections he retreated a few steps to the next window this open to the night careless whether someone might or might not intrude ger sen flashed his light within discovering what might be the head quarters of an import agent this office and that of ottile panshaw at one time had functioned as a suite a case of books pamphlets and samples blocked off the interconnecting door gersen stepped into the office slid aside the case and examined the door it hung on hinges and opened toward gersen he turned the knob and pulled the door held firm secured by a bolt in ottile panshaws office gersen gave his attention to the hinges they were interlocking and semiconcealed impossible to disassemble without destroying the door gersen examined the door itself lockpicking was not one of his special skills still he felt a modest confidence in his abilities but there might be an easier way the door opened toward him the bolt or latch therefore was only as secure as the fastening holding it to the door gersen put his knee to the wall gripped the doorknob turned pulled exerting legforce with his knee a slight splintering sound and the door opened gersen al lowed it to move only a few inches he ran his torch around the slit seeking broken alarm wires none were visible which meant little gersen knew a dozen invisible methods to guard a door he also had encountered chambers charged with lethal gas to smother the unwary intruder gersen sniffed the air but discovered only the rancid scent of long human occupancy unlikely in any event that thk demon princes ottile panshaw as a regular precaution would poison the air of his office he eased open the door and flashed his light around the room he saw only what he had expected greenish brown walls a desk table three chairs cabinet and an incongruously expensive communicator gersen worked deftly and quickly he inserted a trifle of re ceptor tape into the angle between doormolding and wall where it became for all practical purposes invisible using a pressure can ister he sprayed a trail of conductive film from the tape around the door casing into the adjoining office and around the walls to the window returning to panshaws office he repaired the bolt he had broken loose as best he could reinserting the fasteners into their sockets to casual inspection the bolt and its socket were once more securely attached gersen now turned his attention to the desk on the top lay a folder marked impoftant confidential which seemed to contain a sheaf of papers gersen thought it a somewhat ostentatious invita tion and bv extension of logic a generalized danger signal prudent withdrawal became instantly necessary gersens sensory apparatus tensioned to an almost painful level at this same instant received a signal gersen paused not a second to analyze the warning he slid through the door held the bolt hack against its spring tension closed the door whereupon the bolt struck into its socket and the door was apparently secure gersen pushed the display cases back into place then went to the door into the hall he placed his ear against the panel no sound he eased the unlocked door open and at once he heard the shuffle of footsteps along the hall he closed the door shot home the latchbolt and ran to the window stand ing in the shadows he peered out and there at the back of the dim area below stood a man in a dark cape and a soft slouch hat gersen thought to recognize the posture and dimensions of ottile panshaw gersen drew back out of range of panshaws vision should he be wearing nightglasses he touched his detector to the conductive trail he had sprayed upon the wall and turned high the volume for a moment he heard nothing then the sound of moving hardware the creak of the opening door again silence as the room was sur veyed next footsteps and then a soft voice apparently speaking into a transceiver nothing no one here soft and faint in response came panshaws voice has there been disturbance the face apparently nothing perhaps a false alarm im coming up watching through the window gersen saw panshaw move off toward the front gersen immediately stepped through the window and out upon the surface of the dome again he touched the detector to the con ductive trail presently he heard panshaws voice what caused the alarm lumen impact brief and lowintensity silence then again panshaws voice cautious and thoughtful nothing seems disturbed peculiar i wonder about that man still i am often oversubtle he may be exactly as he represents himself that in itself is an oversubtle idea possibly true we have a mystery on our hands which will annoy big bird but first things first which i measure by what is likely to cause bird the least vexation in this case cahouse comes first the fellow at travelers inn must wait his turn a grunt then cahouse is not at inkins shade i may be out several days looking for him go your best speed but get the work done it will be at your own initiative i am leaving at once for twanish so soon you had better stay here and collect shares i do as i am told well so much for a false alarm i see nothing to keep us here a moment the door into littos i believe it has been forced the paint is broken a mumble of words which gersen could not distinguish then the shuffle of hurried footsteps gersen ran back across the dome dropped down upon the en trance ramp gained the shadows of the kiosk before turning the windows of both offices showed light as gersen watched a dark shape appeared briefly at littos window then disappeared gersen returned the way he had come crossing central plaza he noticed a troupe of musicians in the sferinde gardens they played for a large group ofmethien all wearing an evening costume of yellow and white the men with pale blue sashes gersen watched a moment then smiling a trifle wistfully he continued to the travelers inn behind the reception counter stood daswell tippin the sight of gersen brought a curious expression of surprise and concern to the demon princes his face gersen approached the desk why do you look at me like that tippin blurted someone called asking for you not five minutes ago i thought you were in your room and said as much who called well he gave no name panshaw no ruk i see well no great affair i am going to my room now so you were only five minutes wrong a trivial period do you agree i agree absolutely where will i find nihel cahouse at inkins shade hes fogle clan many fogies live at inkins shade what if he is not at inkins shade tippin threw out his hands he might be anywhere do not mention my interest in cahouse to anyone your interest in cahouse is taken for granted growled tip pin id be telling nothing new still keep a quiet tongue in your head indeed indeed indeed my tongue is as secret as if it had been torn out gersen went up to his chambers which he inspected carefully then installing alarms of his own across doors and windows he bathed went to his couch and slept from peoples of the coranne by richard pelto the darsh espouse each other only through calcula tion the women judge the weight of the mans duodeci mates the men taste the womans cooking and test the comfort of her dumble so are darsh marriages made the two probably will not engage in sexual congress both will surely go out on the moonlit desert to pursue their amatory affairs the marital relationship is formal and cool each party knows what is expected of him or her and even more keenly what he or she expects if thwarted the woman re taliates with rancid ahagaree or scorched pourrian the man in his turn will throw less duodecimate upon the table and spend his time at the beer gardens in the morning an hour before corarise the woman awakes the man who sullenly dons his dayclothes and goes to look at the sky he utters a phrase of rather hollow op timism in loose translation it will be good and sets off to his sift the woman looks after him with a dark phrase other own go to it fool late in the day the man returns as he steps under the shade he takes a final glance around the sky and says again in rather hollow tones asi achih which means and so it went the woman watching from the shadow of her dumble merely chuckles quietly to herself the demon princes gersen awoke at dawn rays of coralight flashing across the de sert nearly parallel to the surface cast long black shadows across the plaza looking from his window gersen thought of rigelhght also white and brilliant at the distance of alphanor rigelhght seemed cool brittle crackling with overtones of violet coralight received at closer range sizzled and stung gersen dressed in loose gray trousers a striped blueandwhite singlet airpad sandals conventional hotweather garments across the human universe using the communicator he called the mining journal and learned that the offices would not be open for yet another hour descending into the empty lobby gersen went out into the garden where he found only a few conscientious tourists he break fasted upon tea fruit pastries and cheese imported across unknown distances as he left the garden water began first to drip then to fall in veils from the parasol rims day had started m earnest coras assault must be thwarted gersen went directly to dindar house ignoring the fusty halls of the first floor he ascended to the premises of the mining journal a room long and wide dominated by an enormous relief map of the wale along one wall the front counter showed a checkerboard surface of asper and ade and supported to the right a rack of glass vials containing the various fractions of black sand with small disks of the corresponding metals below and to the left a faultless cube of pyrite a foot and a half on the side a man of middle years grave deliberate and wearing an urbane gray beard came to the counter sir your needs i represent cosmopolis said gersen ive been sent out to do a short series on dar sai and the darsh my budget allows for the hiring of a local aide hopefully someone from your staff my staff consists mostly of myself but ill be glad to assist you as a hireling or otherwise excellent my name incidentally is kirth gersen i am evelden hoe what sort of thing are you doing perhaps a set of biographical sketches ive been told to look up a certain nihel cahouse possibly resident at inkins shade hoe pulled at his beard i know the name hmm i cant quite recall the connection lets check the index come along this way if you will hoe took gersen into a back room this is our library so to the face speak our index is in fair shape if its appeared in the journal well find it hoe seated himself before a buttonboard and screen nihel cahouse here he is i remember the story now shall i give you the gist of it or do you care to read the news piece id ust as soon hear it from you cahouse is a fogle out of inkins shade and a sandminer at a place called jamile wallow he located a rich sift and won over a thousand ounces of sand he went back to inkins shade and found a hadaul in progress or maybe he simply went back for the hadaul which is more likely he bet like a man inspired and when the day was over hed won five thousand ounces a princely fortune at this time kotzash mutual was a going enterprise the kotzash comptroller a certain ottile panshaw happened to be on hand cahouse converted his sand into six hundred kotzash vouchers two days later the kotzash warehouse was looted nihel ca house lost everything and became the topic of a sad news item where is he now still at inkins shade hoe touched buttons heres a followup on the screen appeared a brief paragraph nihel cahouse the erstwhile millionaire has returned to the desert hell go back to jamile wallow and seek another sift thats a fairly recent item said hoe about three months old how will i find jamile wallow its west and southerly ill show you on the map good but first another topic lens larque who stole ca houses sand hoes face became still and guarded that is a name we men tion very quietly at serjeuz still he is dar sais most famous citizen and hed certainly be the subect of one of my stories hoe showed an uneasy smile understandable he is an amaz ing man incidentally he dislikes unfavorable publicity and he has far connections in short he is not a man to be trifled with so i am told have you ever met him not to my knowledge i hope never to do so what about photographs are any in your files the dkmon princes hoe hesitated then muttered probably not nothing useful our conversation is naturally confidential said gersen the mining jowfial will not be quoted nor named as a source still cosmopolis needs a picture in fact it would be worth fifty or even a hundred svu gersen placed down a certificate hoe touched it with tentative fingertips then regretfully drew his hand away i have no recent photographs but only a few days ago i happened to notice something in an old picture i dont know whether or not its what you want show me the picture with a glance over his shoulder hoe pushed buttons he spoke in a suddenly brassy voice what i am about to show you is a collection of quaint old clanpictures recorded over many years where would you like to start with the bugold clan certainly this is the oldest photograph on file it was re corded almost two hundred years ago look at those people arent they a picturesque sight in those days the bugolds were something of an outlaw clan perhaps they show us their most ferocious ex pressions here is something more recent possibly thirty years old the bugolds again and almost demure by comparison on this side stand the bungle boys over here are the kitchets as they are called during these fleeting transitory months the darsh women are at their best look at this girl with her straight body and flash ing eyes she is really quite handsome now these are the young bucks no longer bungles but not yet fleshed out into the full reek of darsh manhood look at this one in particular i dont know his name but i am told that he later committed a theft and became what the darsh call rachepol wtio knows what has happened to him do you care to look at other photographs later by all means id certainly like copies of these two they make a most interesting study hoe depressed a toggle and facsimiles fell into a tray there you are sir thank you gersen tucked the photographs into his pocket hoe did likewise with the money im in something of a rush just now said gersen show me jamile wallow or better give me the coordinates and ill be on my way the face hoe touched buttons and handed the printout to gersen will you be returning soon in a day or so our conversation is of course confidential that goes without saying in both directions naturally hoe escorted gersen to the door until our next meeting my good wishes at the tourist shop gersen rented a latemodel skimmer and desert wear a process which undertaken through the instrumentality of a languid clerk took an extended period gersen envisioned bel ruk fleeting through the stars toward jamile wallow and became ag onized with nervous frustration which he managed to dissemble at last he was given freedom of the vehicle he jumped into the cockpit pulled up the cowl arranged the sunscreen over his head then took the craft aloft he swept through the veil of water up at a slant away from the clustered parasols of serjeuz away to the west he fixed the autopilot to the coordinates of jamile wallow pulled the speed control far back and relaxed into the seat below slid the desert in a thousand subtle variations a gravel plain sand dunes breaking against outcrops of black tuff an area of wind scoured canyons a plain of pale sand heaving in mounds and swales around a settlement of three parasols fotheringay shade according to the map on the northern horizon stood a solitary parasol duggs shade an hour passed and another cora kept pace with the skimmer bearing gradually to the north as the skimmer slanted south below another lonely shade uninhabited and derelict gannets shade according to the map no water flowed over the parasol the vacant dumbles hunched under a tangle of seared brambles and skeleton trees on the map a red circle indicated its dead condition gersen looked along the course to jamile wallow which was marked by a small red asterisk still an hour away gersens mood grew taut depending upon cahouses where abouts gersen calculated that he had either an hours advantage over bel ruk or a disadvantage of two or three hours if bel ruk had preceded him to jamile wallow his mission became dangerous at the horizon appeared a low plateau and where a low ravine cut down to the desert floor jamile wallow gersen saw a make the dfmon princes shift parasol fabricated of arafin tubing and metalcoated membrane the structure had been damaged the parasol tilted drunkenlv to the side dripping random gouts and spatters of water the parasol shaded three shacks one had partially collapsed two were in little better condition fifty yards south in full coralight beside a corroded clutter of mining equipment stood a toolshed built of algaic planks gersen lowered the skimmer and drifted around the shade per ceiving no signs of life he made a second circle then landed the skimmer behind the cluster of huts he lowered the cowl and was instantly struck by a waft of hot desert air he listened a for lorn plash of dripping water a sighing ot wind in the trusswork of the parasol otherwise silence the heat began to prickle at gersens skin he pulled the hood up over his head and activated the aircooler over his eyes he fitted translucent metal hemispheres and slipped his feet into desert shoes alighting from the skimmer he surveyed the landscape to one side the desert spread stark and far to the other a hopper a rickety conveyor and a heap of dun sand indicated the site of cahouses workings overhead the sagging parasol spilled an irregular trickle of water nihel cahouse was nowhere to be seen and gersen felt a hollow sense of defeat he went to peer into the stone huts to discover only trash and a few trifles of dilapidated furniture the fourth shed fifty yards south evidently housed the power module the wellhead and the water pump gersen started across the open space to investigate a moving glint in the sky caught his attention he froze to a standstill and instantly identified the object as an approaching aircraft ap parently a skimmer similar to his own gersen ran back under the parasol in excitement and exhilara tion if eel ruk were aboard the skimmer he evidently had not yet found nihel cahouse gersen jumped aboard his own skimmer jerked at the controls and slid it behind the pile of tailings he threw several broken sheets of arafin roofing over the skimmer achieving a reasonable camouflage he armed himself with his pro jac and hand gun and dodged behind the tailings pile here he alarmed three scorpionlike creatures each a foot long mottled certain types of bog algae when compressed and heated liberate a gun which upon cooling hinds the matri into a waterproof m a l the face white and tan with orange underhodies they erected rows of glint ing scales glared from hooded emerald eyes waved whipstings and began a purposeful sidelong encirclement gersen destroyed them with quick pulses from his hand gun creating three small tinkling explosions gersen looked up into the sky the approaching skimmer was hidden behind the parasol his place of concealment he decided was short of satisfactory crouching and trying to merge into the hillside he ran out to the plank shed ducking around to the back he hopped high and twisted in midair and barely avoided stepping into a hollow crowded with a dozen basking scorpions the stings jerked erect emerald eyes flashed and blinked gersen killed them with a single pulse of power then dodged behind the shed overhead hung the skimmer a craft enameled green and black somewhat larger than gersens rented vehicle it slid under the parasol and dropped to the surface two men in darsh desert gear alighted their faces hooded and disguised by metal eyeguards were unrecognizable so too however was otfile panshaw whose frame was distinctively slight the two men stood looking glumly about the shade much as gersen had done swinging close their hoods to maximize the effect of the cold air they walked to the huts after a glance within they stood pointing here and there and discussing their findings gersen won dered what could interest them they clearly had no expectation of finding nihel cahouse what then the kotzash shares at the third hut the two men became intent one pointed with an air of satisfaction he entered and emerged with a metal box obviously of great weight he set it down threw back the lid touched the contents gave his head a shake which could indicate almost anything the other man closed the lid carried the box to the skimmer his comrade looked toward the planked shed he gave a peremptory signal the two crossed the sunlit area to the shed one flung open the door looked within and jumped back with a startled exclamation gersen at the rear put his eye to a crack by the light entering through the doorway he glimpsed the interior the second man approached whats here the man first on the scene waved his hand as you see a typical darsh mannerism constantly repeated the demon princes a achih the place stinks it swarms with the devils they create their own stink ah how putrid well there are no papers here not so fast the shrig wants twelve hundred vouchers six hundred from here we had best be diligent give him the hundred you have already gained and the news that no more are to be found it may come to that bah cahouse would never keep the paper out here if he troubled to keep it at all ha ha cahouse the mad reveler he probably threw it high into the sansuun with a curse he was noted for his noble curses so im told hell utter his great curses never again lets be away from this squalid place weve got the sand to share theres profit to the day after all the shrig wants his vouchers and he speaks with a heavy voice i am bel ruk but i am not without fear even fear cannot force the appearance of nonexistent vouch ers true lets look once more in the huts the two turned away and walked toward the shade behind them a voice spoke gentlemen stop in your tracks do not look around death is close at your backs the two men jerked quivering to a halt slowly raise your hands higher walk forward toward the base of the parasol do not look around ten minutes later gersen had arranged matters to his satisfac tion the two men had declared their names to be bel ruk and cleander they stood with faces to the trusswork hoods pulled over their eyes and bound tight by bands of cloth similar bands of a darsh expieuve of fatalistic acceptance so be it or thats the way it goes the darsh do not gracefully or philosophically accept misfortune they are good grumblers asi achih indicates the final recognition of defeat or as m this case the inexorable force of destiny larva of a bog animal notable for its sinuous dancing gait upon a pair of caudal feet the shrig stands four to five feet high and emits a yellow phosphorescence at night the shrig dance hv the hundreds across the hog to create an eerie and fascinating effect here the word is used m a deprecatory sense to typify a dileruntish impractical fellow out of touch with reaiit sansuun the evening breeze which follows the sun around the planet the face cloth but from their own garments secured their arms to the truss work when to gersens critical eye both men were helpless he made an inspection of their persons removing their hand guns and bel ruks dagger at their skimmer he investigated the box they had taken from the hut it contained black sand to the weight of perhaps fifty pounds on the seat of the skimmer rested bel ruks pouch within gersen discovered kotash certificates to the ag gregate of shares which he took into his own possession he returned to his two captives both of whom had been sur reptitiously twisting at their bonds i hope that you are taking a goodnatured view of this situation said gersen in a sense this is your lucky day i am taking some kotxash shares which i found in a pouch yonder in exchange i have left ten svu since the shares are totally worthless you actually have reason to rejoice i am also taking cahouses black sand neither oleander nor bel ruk had comment to make i prefer that you do not struggle against your bonds said gersen if you broke loose i might be forcedto kill you oleanders shoulders sagged bel ruk stood rigid and unforgiv ing gersen watched them a moment then returned across bright sand to the toolshed bel ruk and cleander had left the door ajar sunlight shone on a rumpled heap of gristle and dry bones among shreds of white cloth nihel oahouse apparently had died while attempting to repair his pump perhaps by electric shock scorpions by the doxens ranged in a circle they had cut away cahouses garments to feast upon his corpse as bel ruk and oleander had remarked the stench within the shed transcended all ordinary degrees of fetor gersen went to the hopper found a shovel returned to the shed and half dragged half scraped the remains of nihel cahouse out upon the sand the scorpions tinkling in rage made sorties with emerald eyes glaring gersen killed them with the flat of the shovel eventually both corpse and scorpions had been removed ger sen strolled back under the shade and examined his captives bel ruk asked in a flat voice how long do you intend to keep us here not long now be patient gersen returned to the shed the stench had eased somewhat and the scorpions were gone gersen gingerly entered first he the demon princes threw the master switch on the power panel then turned to look at what he had seen through the crack nihel cahouse had used his kotzash shares to paper the walls of the toolshed the adhesive had deteriorated in the heat to a granular crumble the certificates peeled away without difficulty gersen took the salvaged documents back under the shade and counted them shares with the shares taken from bel ruk his holdings now totaled an even gersen returned to his prisoners bel ruk chafing his bonds against the metal had almost won free without comment gersen made the bonds once more secure gentlemen said gersen i am about to depart bel ruk has demonstrated that the effort of an hour or so will break you loose bel ruk blurted a question why do you take my kotzash shares they are worthless in that case why do you carry them bel ruk said in a rough voice at serjeuz a crazy iskish pays money for trash kotzash shares are suddenly in demand said gersen per haps that earless rogue lens larque is about to bring back the money he stole bel ruk and cleander maintained an uneasy silence gersen watched them a moment then carrying the chest of black sand to his skimmer he departed jamile wallow at serjeuz with cora half below the horizon gersen dropped the skimmer down upon the sand beside his fantamic flitterwing he transferred the coffer of black sand and his kotzash shares aboard then slid the skimmer through the water veil and back to the rental agency crossing the plaza to the travelers inn gersen waited until tippins attention was diverted then slipped past and up to his room he bathed changed into fresh garments and returned to the lobby he allowed himself to be noticed by tippin who signaled him to the desk good evening said gersen yes no doubt where have you been all day gersen fixed tippin with a long level stare tippins gaze shifted gersen asked wtiy are you interested inquiries have been made said tippin peevishly words like steal theft pilfer have a most biting connotation in the darsh context the face by whom by bel ruk if you must know and not ten minutes ago he thinks that you robbed him out in the desert gersen asked in a flat voice how could i rob bel ruk if i was in my room all day i dont know were you in your room do you know differently i dont know one way or another this is the first time youve seen me today yes of course and i just came down from my room that is true then tell bel ruk that to your knowledge i never left my room all day but are these the facts cried tippin fretfully to the best of your knowledge they are indeed gersen turned away and went out into the garden he settled himself at a shadowed table and dined without haste from the lobby came daswell tippin he searched the garden saw gersen and approached at an agitated trot flinging himself into a chair he said in a tragic voice bel ruk has threatened my very existence he claims that i conspired with you he calls me robber he says that he will take me out to sangwy shade do you know what that means nothing good apparently it means those cursed darsh whips and dont sneer such af fairs occur to my certain knowledge when did bel ruk make his threat not five minutes ago i spoke with him by telephone i told him that so far as i knew you had not been gone from serjeuz he became furiously angry where is he now i dont know here at serjeuz so i suppose look here a moment gersen produced the list furnished by jehan addels when you took up those shares for me who did you buy from mark off their names sangwy shade an isolated settlement on the sheol barrens inhabited b ruftuns rache pols and fugitives at sangwy shade the purchasing agent sudo nonimus met with lens larque an episode he chronicled m reminiscences of a peripatetic purchase agent thf demon princes tippm glanced along the list without any great interest he marked with a stylus this one this one this one with a gesture of revulsion he threw down the stylus this is madness if bel ruk sees me hell take off my skin today he had a hundred shares on his person where did he get them tippm stared at him aghast so you did indeed rob him i took up property to which he had no right after all lens larque looted the kotzash warehouse but that is not darsh logic whispered tippin at sangwy shade we shall dance together he turned sideways and searched the plaza ill have to leave sereuz i can live here no longer where do you want to go home to svengay i had a bit of trouble long ago but surely its forgotten now then there is no problem take the next ship out tippm held out his hands what shall i use for money ive been keeping a woman shes bled me dry gersen scribbled a note on a piece of paper brought out a hundred svl and handed both to tippm take this letter tojehan addels at new wexford on aloysius hell pay you a thousand svu and find a job for you at new wexford if you so choose i advise you not to tell the woman you are going although its none of my affair if she bled you dry here shell do it again elsewhere with numb fingers tippm took the money and the note thank you your advice is sound yes very sound ill leave tomorrow theres an outbound packet dont tell anyone youre going said gersen just go yes exactly wont there be a great surprise when they find me gone back to the kotzash shares where did bel ruk get his hundred shares well twenty he got from me he picked up the others along melby sift mark them off this list tippin studied the schedule and made a number of marks i cant be sure of these whats left is out along the deep wale and a few along scumby barren you wont find anyone at home now theyll all be up to dinkelstown for the grand hadauls and thats where bel ruk will be if he wants more kotzash the face what does panshaw want with kotzash when you say panshaw you are saying lens larque then why does lens larque want kotzash tippin searched the plaza i have no idea panshaw thinks lens larque is crazy he had trouble with the methlen and nou he wants his own back of all men alive he is most to be feared imagine an insect in human form look now here comes bel ruk sit quiet he wont harm you hes only interested in me hell take me away refuse to go say nothing obey none of his orders tippin made an asthmatic whimpering noise gersen looked at him in disgust control yourself bel ruk entered the garden and marched at a stately pace to gersens table with exaggerated delicacy he drew back a chair and seated himself i intrude on no private conversation none whatever said tippin in a quavering voice i must introduce you kirth gersen this is bel ruk an important man of dar sai with a wild attempt at facetiousness he added you ha e much m common you both are interested in finance oh we have much more m common than that said bel ruk he shrugged back his hood to reveal his bony bronze face massive cheekbones and cropped ears noting gersens gaze he said yes its true i am rachepol my clan dealt harshly with me still i took vengeance and i cannot complain he signaled the waiter bring me a quart of beer and these gentlemen to their taste nothing for me said gersen tippin said cautiously ill have a tot oftivol bel ruk examined gersen with a deliberation almost insulting kirth gersen eh and where is your homeworld alphanor along the concourse and you are taking up kotzash shares wtien i can get them cheaply are you selling i have none to sell after suffering robbery and shame at our hands today surely you are mistaken said gersen ippm has hinted something to this effect im not sure whether or not i ha e con vinced him if he is convinced he is more of a fool than i cake him for i hf demon princes let us discuss our business one item at a time he held out his hand first return my shares gersen smilingly shook his head impossible bel ruk withdrew his arm and turned to tippm you have strained our bonds of friendship not at all tippm protested by no means never we shall discuss the matter again bel ruk lifted his tankard of beer and swallowed half at a gulp the remainder of the beer he threw casually at gersens face from vast experience gersen had recognized the pattern of events bending to the side he avoided most of the beer in the same motion he lifted the table thrust it at bel ruks chest and toppled him backwards bel ruk fell sprawl ing across the garden the waiter gingerly approached gentlemen what is the mat ter bel ruk has had a bit too much to drink said gersen take him away before he injures himself the waiter helped bel ruk to his feet then picked up the table and set it into its place gersen stonily watched bel ruk who stood considering his op tions finding no obviously profitable course bel ruk turned and departed the garden tippm said in a sick voice hes going for his gun no hes got other concerns theres no way back for me now gloomed tippm its ei ther sangwy shade or go and never return gersen gave tippm a certificate for fifty svu settle my ac count here through tomorrow i may also be leaving tippm asked in dull confusion where are you going im not quite sure gersen jumped to his feet excuse me now im in a hurry he ran up to his room picked up items of equipment return ing below he left the hotel and ran off across the plaza and under skansel shade in skansel plaza he halted to look up at dmdar house lights showed from the windows ofpanshaws office there was no time to be wasted he climbed up over the entrance scaled the sloping roof and sidled to the window giving on littos office he brought out his detector touched the controls to the conductive trail he had sprayed only two nights before bel ruks guttural voice the face sounded immediately m the earphone not all so easy i here scattered here and there around the wale theyll be at the dmkelstown for the hadaul most of them but thats not necessarily to the good growled bel ruk these sitters arent fools theyll smrf a plot and go for full re coy cry i hat may well be heres an idea cry out a hadaul and post a stake the challenge can be a hundred kotzash shares let the roblers collect the shares for us bel ruk grunted vnd then when theres a winner panshaws voice dripped sarcasm must i plan out every de taip you were glib enough in regard to gersen or whatever his name that is a different tale gersen will not be at the hadaul bel ruk vented a gusty snort so you say and if he is i hat again is at your discretion the bird would like a word with gersen tell the bird to come out to the hadaul let him show his famous techniques maybe hell come over without mv instructions to comment upon your work bel ruks voice was suddenly dubious do ou really think so no i do not he is obsessed with his wonderful scheme bel ruks voice came somewhat easier so lonn as he works his tricks he diverts his energies theyll not be diverted if he loses kotzash i can only do m best gersen is not inexperienced still he neglected to kill me when he had the chance panshaw chuckled he regards you as no great threat bel ruk said nothing well then said panshaw do your best from here i cannot guide your feet while you walk you are reputedly skillful in the robles t fight in your own hadaul and come away with the post pot the idea already had occurred to me rubles the hadaul ticki the post pot the accumuldtion ofchjilent menus rhi iltnrs prize the demon princes one way or another collect at least seven hundred shares then whether or not gersen took cahouses shares well be se cure now i will go back to my couch twanish time is a taskmaster the cursed methlen start the day at sunrise just when good thieves like you and me are ending it oh why must i pay the price for the birds social yearnings if it were not so funny i could cry for grief all this is beyond my understanding grumbled bel ruk its nothing to do with me just as well youd be less effective than ever someday panshaw in one hand i will squeeze your neck into a thin stalk someday bel ruk i will poison your vile beer unless of course we lost kotzash and the bird gives us both to panak bel ruk made a dull sound and the conversation was over gersen waited a moment on the chance that bel ruk might make other communications but the office remained silent and gersen presently went back the way he had come gersen flew eastward in the fantamic flitterwing the desert below in the blaze of coralight showed swaths and smears of color pink ocher a whitish yellow like talc mixed with sulfur to ward the horizon the colors stratified like sediments into pencilings of cinnamon brown graygreen plum with occasional harsh scratches where ledges of black rock broke through the surface gersen crossed a region of low dunes a line of rosered buttes beyond extended a plateau overgrown with desert flora silky coral jutting ears of honeycomb yellow sandtripe tinkleweed purple magmold at far intervals parasols spilled water over lonely communities where old darsh custom persisted in the purest form bunters shade ruph shade itchy nolas shade so read the names on the map then where terwig waste began the shades were seen no more terwig waste a smoldering basin of liverred pumice once described by an impressionable travel writer as the floor of hell exposed to daylight ended against a bonewhite palisade beyond the ground lay twisted and gashed in a vast badlands of winderoded sandstone and then once again the desert spread away to north south and east finally the five parasols of dinkelstown appeared on the horizon gersen approached and circled the town on the landing area at the western periphery rested an assortment of vessels two small cargo ships five spaceyachts of various quality scores of desert skimmers aircars and carryalls gersen landed close behind the water wall he changed into darsh robes armed himself and disembarked heat struck his face the demon princes he made haste to penetrate the water veil and found himself in a cluster of dumbles from which issued pungent odors and loud voices by crooked ways he came to a plaza far less grand than central plaza at serjeuz a single hotelrestaurant offered modest hospitality to the offworld visitor around the edge of the plaza beer gardens under flipflap trees served the needs of darsh holidaymakers in front of the hotel workmen made final arrangements for the hadaul circles had been painted upon the paving two small grandstands and several sets of serried benches offered seats of vantage to spectators gersen crossed the plaza to the hotel in the garden sat a dozen methlen jerdian chanseth was not among them the hotel could offer gersen no accommodation these are the days of the clan meetings said the clerk in a curt voice sleep out in the bushes like everyone else gersen returned to the garden not ten feet distant stood bel ruk in conversation with a foxfaced young darsh bel ruk wore iskish clothes with a white sash around his head to hide his muti lated ears his back was halfturned gersen moved past without attracting his notice he halted behind a sprawling nephar tree and watched through the blackgreen foliage bel ruk spoke with force and urgency he brought a packet of svu from his inside pocket and slapped it against his hand in ca dence with his words the young man nodded with earnest atten tion finally bel ruk gave the young man the packet and made a curt gesture the young man flicked his fingers in the darsh signal of assent and departed across the plaza gersen paused five seconds then followed at a discreet distance the young darsh marched at the striding plambosh gait across the plaza through a jungle of vegetation past a dozen dumbles under the veil of a second parasol finally into a second plaza where he joined a group who sat drinking from iron pots he spoke and presently money changed hands iron pots were tilted and emptied and all departed leaving only the young darsh gersen had fol lowed gersen seated himself on a hummock in the shade of a plantain bush an insect crawled up his leg slapping and shaking gersen dislodged the creature and took himself to one of the beer gardens he settled into an inconspicuous seat was served beer in an iron pot the face an hour passed then one of the group returned with a sheaf of what gersen thought to identify as kotzash shares gersen rose to his feet walked out into the plaza made a show of looking around the tables then advanced upon the table which he had been watching without formality he seated himself my name is jaide bel ruk will have mentioned me there is a change in plan enemies are watching him and he wishes to dissemble you must now work through me how many shares have you taken up sixteen so far this was the man whom gersen had followed your name i am delfin he indicated the man who had brought in the shares this is bartleman very good bartleman said gersen go out again find more shares for us bartleman showed no haste to obey it is not so easy folk consider me either a fool or a sharper i have my dignity to con sider what is undignified about paying good money for worthless paper its not worthless if someone wants to pay for it this is the general feeling especially in connection with kotzash well then offer more money delfin give him money to work with delfin grudgingly counted out twenty svu gersen took the shares folded them and tucked them into his pocket money is draining away delfin grumbled ruk told me to bring him shares and hed give me more money ill handle that end of things said gersen he brought out the list which jehan addels had prepared a certain lampeter con trols eightynine shares find him at once and buy his shares as cheaply as possible bartleman said sullenly i wont get them for twenty svu and where is my commission gersen paid over ten svu of his own money bring me the eightynine shares and youll make sure of a commission bartleman gave a skeptical shrug and moved away gersen said to delfin remember you will be working through me under no circumstances approach bel ruk it could bring the wrath of a certain bird down on your head do you un derstand the di vion princfs perfectly if you so much as see bel ruk give him a wide berth do all your business with me this is clear another of delfins couriers appeared with nine shares delfin gave him another ten svu of bel ruks money and sent him out again gersen added the shares to the first in grand total to go one by one the couriers returned bringing back a total of shares bartleman returned a second time somewhat crestfallen he spoke in a morose voice the rumor is out everyone has become suspicious no one wants to sell those people who already sold are now angry they call me a sharper they want their shares back not possible said gersen what oflampeter there he sits in valts arbor drinking beer bartleman pointed across the plaza that old man with the crooked nose he says hell sell for full value no less full value we dont pay that kind of money for worthless paper explain that to lampeter ill do exactly that gersen once more considered his list do you know feodor diamant he is well known he controls twenty shares find him buy his shares if possible if not bring him here as you say bartleman once more moved away gersen stepped across the plaza to valts arbor and approached the old man with the crooked nose you are lampeter i am that man who are you if not an iskish i am iskish certainly as an idle pastime i collect worthless securities really no more than a whim do you have any use for your kotzash shares none whatever in that case perhaps you will give them to me if you prefer i can make a token payment say ten svu for the batch lampeter pulled at his nose and turned gersen a broad gap toothed grin it is my experience that when someone wants to buy the merchandise has value i will sell at what they cost me no less gersen exhibited astonishment that is totally unreasonable thefad we shall see if i collect i am vindicated if not i am no worse off than before do you carry these shares on your person naturally not i considered them worthless until no where are they in my dumble ust yonder let us go for them if you guarantee to say nothing of the transaction ill pay you eightynine s u eightynine svu that offer is almost insulting you are try ing to cheat me of two thousand svu lampeter observe me closely what do you see lampeter who had already taken several pots of beer inspected gersen with an unsteady vision i see a greeneyed iskish who is either a sharper or else crazy i prefer that you think of me as crazy now ask yourself how many times in the few scant years left to you will a crazy iskish offer you money for worthless trasrr never again i have no doubt that is why must exploit this particular occasion on this particlar occasion two svu a share is the limit full value or nothing gersen made a signal of defeat ill pay quarter value and that is my best offer i am running low on cash lampeter drank beer then put down the iron pot and rose to his feet come along with me i am being defrauded but i can waste no more time he lurched off along a path which led through the ungle and halted beside the dark entrance into a dum ble one moment he entered to emerge with a greasy envelope here are the shares wtiere is the money gersen took the envelope withdrew the certificates and counted eightynine shares good enough come with me i dont carry so much money on my person he led the way to the water well along the boundary lane then out through the water to his fantamic fhtterwmg he unlocked the port motioned lampeter up the ladder lampeter looked at him in suspicion wtiere are you taking me nowhere i cant pay you out here m the hot sun well be swift my beer is going flat gersen brought out the box of black sand he had taken from he d mon princes bel ruk at jamile wallow eightynine shares at a quarter value is two hundred twentythree ounces in a grumbling voice lampeter declared a preference for cash to which gersen paid no heed he weighed out ounces of black sand which he poured into a canister and gave to lampeter con sider yourself a lucky man i cant avoid curiosity why do you pay good black sand for worthless trash that i was about to throw away gersen calculated i need at least two hundred fortyeight more shares find them for me and ill explain why i want them youll pay in black sand not at quarter value i dont have so much sand i doubt if so many shares can be had at dmkelstown still lets go back to valts arbor bring the box well see what can be done my rnend jeus owns ten or twenty shares maybe hell agree to sell bring your friend jeus to the beer garden across the plaza where i now must return gersen took leave of lampeter and reomed delfin his couriers between them had taken up only thirtyone additional shares which gersen took m hand bartleman however had with him a short fat man with round black eyes and a parrotbeak nose this is fat odo said bartleman he carries fifteen shares of kotzash well sir what is your price asked gersen i have about all i need for my purposes still ill listen to your offer the price is printed on the certificates said odo so is the signature ofottile panshaw both are a waste of ink i wont sell why should i be hoodwinked by an iskish i am no worse off than an hour ago goodbye just a moment fifteen shares ill pay a quarter value no more impossible goodbye these are my terms oh well pay half value today i will be generous gersen finally settled for forty ounces of black sand fust as lampeter brought up his friend jeus as old gaunt and drunk as lampeter himself lampeter pointed out gersen with a grand flourish there he sits the crazy iskish who pays black sand for kotzash the face here are my shares cried out jeus there are eighteen only but pay me a hundred ounces in all generosity the rate is somewhat less said gersen twenty ounces for the lot the bargaining attracted attention soon gersen was sur rounded with persons who either held a share or two and wanted full redemption or persons now angry who had already sold at lesser prices gersen scraped the box clean of black sand but ac quired only another fortythree shares his total holdings now were shares with another shares needed the darsh now stood around him eagerly flourishing their shares but gersen could only shake his head i have no more sand and no more money until i cash a bank draft the asking prices began to descend gersen now so near to his goal became correspondingly anxious he turned to delfin give me what money you have left it is only five svu said delfin in view of the large sums being thrown about this is scanty payment for the days work bartleman has thirty svu for which he has not accounted nor will he ever go back to bel ruk for more money i hardly dare already i have spent too much but that gives me an idea write out this note prices are very high return another two hundred svu by the bearer delfin delfin somewhat dubiously wrote the note the circumstances were puzzling but who was he to question the mad iskish now said gersen send it off to bel ruk who will surely send back the money hardous here a moment delfin gave hardous the note go to the hotel garden there you will find a rachepol wearing a white head sash with an emerald clasp give him this note he will pay over money which you are to bring here hurry gersen now on tenterhooks ran around the circle of those who had been offering shares he took as many of them as he could reach give me yours and yours and yours collect from delfin or meet me tonight at the hotel delfin knows me well he will vouch for me tomorrow you will be paid or perhaps even tonight if bel ruk provides the money some of the shareholders numbly surrendered their shares oth ers jerked back gersen could waste no more time he beckoned tup demon princes to delfin come along to the plaza let us make sure that bel ruk is on hand to pay the money they halted under the foliage looked across to the hotel gar den into which hardous was just now entering bel ruk sat in obvious impatience at a central table hardous tendered him the note bel ruk snatched it open and read for a moment he sat silent then heaved himself to his feet he spoke to hardous the two left the garden and set off across the plaza gersen spoke soberly to delfin i suspect that events are not going well for bel ruk he seems out of sorts avoid him if he sees you he will demand an accounting and what could you tell him nothing keep your distance and well all be the easier for it delfin said in a concerned voice there is a great deal here which i dont understand no doubt but do as i say and as soon as i cash a bank draft you will profit delfin again became moderately sanguine that is a gratifying prospect at least good then i am assured of your cooperation at every point of the circle the metaphor so gersen recognized was abstracted from the language ofhadaul and was not altogether reassuring i need let me count another one hundred twenty shares at least tonight i want you to go everywhere the news will be out shares will cer tainly be offered to you perhaps the entire one hundred twenty tonight not possible mirassou floats high kitchets run the desert and i run close behind and who runs behind you asked gersen haha ive been chased by some fast ones tonight is a night to beware are you going out let me advise you the kitchets romp among the chailles but every shadow conceals a khoontz the less agile man who is usually not quite so discriminating goes out on differy downs but he often comes home stiff and surly because the kitchets have the upper hand and make their own choices ill keep your advice in mind said gersen what of tomor row tomorrow its hadaul and that will occupy the day kotzash must wait the face still dont stand aside if kotzash shares are offered take them up on my account and keep well clear of bel ruk at the moment he may well be annoyed with all of us delfin again became subdued behind your words i divine a larger meaning i will certainly avoid bel ruk and now i wish you good evening and a happy night on the desert gersen went out to his fantamic flitterwing where he counted his shares and locked them into a cabinet he changed from the darsh robes into loose gray trousers and a blouse striped in dark green and black he made sure of his weapons and sauntered back under the parasol the time was dusk the water flow was quiet and dinkelstown lay open to the desert gersen approached the hotel garden and halted in the shadows to take stock of those who sat at the tables a dozen tourists as many darsh of evident substance a group of young methlen with two older women of refinement and dignity from the hotel came jerdian chanseth wearing a soft white gown she passed close to where gersen stoodhe called out in a quiet voice jerdian jerdian chanseth jerdian halted looked wonderingly to where gersen stood half lounging against a tree she paused turned a quick glance toward the methlen group then approached what are you doing here im looking at you and grateful for the opportunity jerdian made a mocking sound between her teeth sssssss you are gallant in your phrases she looked him up and down you are more relaxed more easy than the grim bankerswindlerspace wanderer of serjeuz you seem almost a young man that cant be im at least six years older than aldo still at this moment i dont feel at all grim why at this moment must i explain i am standing here with you and i find you bewitching more gallantry jerdian despite a cool little laugh seemed not displeased words are cheap you already have a spouse and a large family nothing of that sort whatever i have no one but myself how did you become a banker i bought the bank for a special purpose but a bank costs money are you a wealthy criminal im certainly not a criminal at least not altogether the dp vion prnc es then what are you in all truth and candor a space wanderer is really the best description kirth gersen you take pleasure mystifying me and i detest secrets then jerdian added m a voice dictated by her methlen training still your secrets are no concern of mine quite right gersen looked away across the plaza out upon the dusky desert in fact i should not so much as talk to you i succeed only in tantalizing myself jerdian stared at him a minute then uttered a sudden laugh what marvelous dramas you enact the picaresque adventurer the banker who outswindles my father the patrician in languid gar ments and now the lovelorn boy wistful and noble renouncing his love gersens own amusement was somewhat more constrained i dont recognize myself m any of these roles a reckless mood came over him almost an intoxication come over here where well be secluded he took her arm and led her to a table at the far dark side of the garden she walked stiffly halfresisting and seated her self in a posture tentative and prim she looked at gersen coldly now all disdainful methlen i can only stay an instant we are mak ing an excursion out on the desert and i must help with the ar rangements the desert is said to be beautiful by night especially by moonlight are you walking indeed not we have hired a charabanc now i must go my interest in your affairs is really most casual our feelings complement each other since i didnt want to tell you anything jerdian made no move to rise and why not you might tell someone else and cause me no end of trouble jerdian scowled so you think i prattle of everything i know to my friends not necessarily but as you yourself point out our interest is casual you might easily make an idle comment which eventually would reach the wrong ears ill take you to your friends he rose to his feet jerdian perversely refused to move be so good as to sit down in effect you are asking me to leave which is far from flattering wtiere is your vaunted gallantry now the face gersen slowly resumed his seat i vaunted no gallantry i ust spoke impulsively you show very little concern for my vanity said jerdun crossly your vanity is quite safe in my hands said gersen may i express myself frankly jerdian pondered a moment well there is no one here to stop you gersen leaned forward took her two hands in his the truth is this i have a spaceship outside i would like nothing better than to take you away with me and make love to you across all the constellations of the universe but i cant indulge myself even m the speculation indeed and again from idle curiosity why not because i have work to do which is urgent and dangerous jerdian asked mischievously would you give up your work if i agreed to come with you dont even suggest such things my heart stops beating when i hear you the gallantry is now back m full force gersen bent forward across the table jerdian made no move to draw back with their faces only inches apart gersen halted then drew abruptly back he felt jerdians hands twitch in his after a moment gersen said if you recall at serjeuz we spoke of lens larque jerdian regarded him with pupils dilated he is the most evil man alive you mentioned an unpleasant episode what happened it was nothing important simply an incident we live in a district known as llalarkno one day a darsh wanted to buy the house next to ours my father is not partial to the darsh he hates the smell of their food he cant tolerate their music he cried out m a passion go away leave this land you may not buy the house do you think i want to look up every day to find your great darsh face hanging over my wall be off with you the darsh walked away later we learned that it was lens larque himself wtiat did he look like i hardly noticed i have the impression of a large man with ihf dfmon princes long arms he had a big smooth head with a black mustache his skin was brownish pink pale darsh color you havent seen him since not to my knowledge he never forgets a harm so goes the lens larque legend and he is famous for clever tricks he can trick as he pleases we maintain a careful security because we are so close to beyond but why are you interested m lens larque i hope to destroy him first i must find him so i buy kotzash to attract his attention jerdian stared at gersen m awe and wonder she started to speak but a tall shape loomed over them aldo his head tilted some what back mouth set m an austere droop he bowed jerkily to jerdian if you please your aunt the excellent mayness is anxious that you should om her very well ill come at once gersen spoke to aldo you are planning an excursion out on the desert that is correct where are you planning to go we are visiting the chailles aides tone was now icy come if you will jerdian gersen said the darsh both male and female will be out m force that is no concern to us so long as they stay out of our sight they may even cause you annoyance we have hired a charabanc the driver declares that there will be no slightest inconvenience in any event we are methlen the darsh will keep their distance he went to stand by jerdian slowly she rose to her feet and walked away like a somnambulist gersen sat brooding for a time then went out to his space boat he paused beside the boarding ladder he stood looking to the east across the desert where the rising moon already illumi nated the sky small groups of people slipped out from under the shade riding vehicles or going afoot women and girls apart from the youths and men on a dilapidated airbuggy came delfin with three ot his comrades wearing light robes and gay headsashes they passed close beside gersen who hailed them delfin brought the face the airbuggy to a bouncing halt gersen moved forward how goes the evening so far very well have you located any more shares no as you suggested bel ruk is unhappy with todays events he intends to whip both you and me first he must catch us said gersen then he must raise his whip true in any event you will find no more kotzash in dm kelstown bel ruk has ordained a great hadaul to a prize of a thou sand svtj the roblers must challenge with either a hundred svu or twenty shares of kotzash needless to say all remaining kotzash will go to finance the challenges a pity said gersen still you did your best and cleverly you are a tnckish man but why do you keep us talking the kitchets are drinking moon light one of his comrades added along with every old swagbottom of the wale as well look yonder cried delfin in a voice of mirthful amazement there go the constipated methlen out to enjoy the moonlight notice the man who drives the charabanc that is nobius a trick ster as sly as yourself gersen acknowledged the compliment do you expect that nobius will trick the methlen delfin made a jocular sign there is a tender kitchet named farrero she is guarded by three enormous khoontzes nobius vows that tonight he will take farrero how he will do this while driving the methlen charabanc remains to be seen we must be off there rises the mirassou kitchets are running the sand and dreaming delicious dreams hoy off we go cambousse give us power the buggy trundled off on soft wheels gersen turned to look after the charabanc already a dark blur far across the sand uneasy and fretful annoyed by his own conflicting urges ger sen watched the charabanc disappear methlen affairs were none of his concern except the comfort and dignity of a certain jerdian robleri participants at a hadaul i he rubles are the concentric rings ot a hadaul field painted yellow green and blue the sitvr cambousse pittaugh the sand sprite and leino the grandmother are ele mentals of the darsh mvtholog tiil dfvion princfs chanseth toward whom he felt a whole range of emotions pro tective and otherwise well there was no help for it with a muttered curse gersen climbed into the vessel opened a side port swung out davits and grounded the utility boat he pulled a helmet over his head and clamped a nightseeing panoptic to the visor into the side rack he stowed a pair of weapons then stepping aboard he took the boat into the sky mirassou floated free of the horizon a great silverwhite disk subtle and serene which nevertheless proected an ardent force the wale became a place where events otherwise unthinkable be came not only conceivable but reasonable gersen as always aware of at least two levels of consciousness within his mind was amused to find himself no less susceptible to mirassou than delfin he slanted his boat somewhat to the south of the charabanc and drew abreast at an altitude of a thousand feet pulling the panoptic down over his eyes he switched on the nocturnal phase turned up the magnification the charabanc with its passengers seemed only yards away with splendid garments and moonlightpale faces the meth len seemed a company unreal a troupe of pierrots on a frivolous escapade gersen watched in fascination halfsardonic half envious in all ten methlen rode the charabanc three young men sat along the stern seat four girls a pair of older women and aldo occupied the side seats jerdian frail and wanseeming sat far for ward turned somewhat away from the others influenced perhaps by mirassou gersen felt a swelling of exhilaration for his own es capade on this moonlit night high in the front on the coachmans bench nobius rode in a comfortable slouch occasionally glancing back at his passengers in easy condescension the older ladies whenever they chanced to notice him became annoyed by what they conceived to be insolence and made haughty gestures signaling nobius to mind his driving commands which nobius totally ignored to augment the antic mood of the expedition over the silken sands moved the charabanc ahead and some what to the side stood the chailles a decayed volcanic crag rising from a shoal of ledges and outcrops one of the older ladies gave nobius new instructions signaling him to veer away from the chailles nobius gave obsequious acquiescence twitching the con trols to change course but as soon as the ladys attention was di the face verted he swung the charabanc back toward the rocks scanning the chailles gersen detected the flicker of white darsh robes other folk had gone out to enjoy mirassou the methlen ladies once again noticed the proximity of the chailles instantly and with vehemence they ordered nobius to bear away and again nobius politely complied with the order only after a moment cunningly veering the craft back to its original direction his destination seemed to be a rocky hummock perhaps twenty feet high standing free a few yards from the principal ledges on top of the hummock stood a kitchet quiet and pensive looking south across the sands nobius suddenly curved the charabanc smartly about acceler ated and drove it into the sandy avenue between the hummock and the main ledges of the chailles the ladies expostulated sharply nobius blandly paid them no heed then suddenly pretended to hear bringing the charabanc to a halt ust under the hummock he turned in his seat as if the better to hear instructions the ladies spoke briskly and made agitated gesticulations which nobius attentively acknowledged he turned in his seat but now something had gone wrong with the machinery the chara banc lurched forward a few yards then halted even while nobius diligently worked switches and levers at the stern of the charabanc the three young men rose questiomngly up in their seats nobius desisted from his efforts and sat wanly watching to the side out from the shadows lurched three heavy figures in black gowns they umped forward each seized one of the young meth len men on the rear seat about his middle and carried him flailing and squirming off into the darkness nobius crouched and became tense from the shadows under the hummock came a fourth figure even more massive than the others she umped aboard the charabanc seized aldo and despite his shouts carried him away instantly nobius bounded from the charabanc and up to the top of the hummock he seized the kitchet led her down the far side and off into the dunes stunned by events the methlen ladies rose dumbfounded in their seats in the shadows and on the ledges was further motion the swirl of white robes then a sudden rush to the charabanc and aboard the first to arrive seized the girls and the next less en the demon princes thusiastically possessed themselves of the chaperones and all re treated to their preferred places the man who had seized jerdian carried her out into the desert ignoring both her outcries and her blows a hundred yards out among the dunes he halted and lowered her to the sand a flying platform landed beside them gersen stepped off jerdian made a sound of incredulous joy and relief the darsh assumed an attitude of menace be off with you i am about to entertain this kitchet speaking no words gersen pointed a hand gun at the mans feet and burnt the sand into a molten puddle the darsh jumped back in fear and fury gersen lifted jerdian to her feet and put her aboard the boat an instant later they were in the air leaving the disconsolate darsh staring after them at no great altitude the boat drifted southward over the dunes jerdian from time to time looking askance at gersen presently she said in a husky voice im grateful to you i dont know what else to say how did you happen to be so promptly to hand i saw you on the charabanc the driver is notorious i came out to protect you from his tricks even though you had not asked me to watch over you im glad that you did jerdian drew a deep sigh she looked back toward the black rocks and made an odd sound something between a sob and a laugh my aunt mayness and my aunt eustacia are back there cant we help them somehow then by implica tion she answered her own question i suppose nothing too dread ful will happen whatever may happen its already in progress gersen re moved his helmet and placed it in a locker he allowed the boat to drift low only thirty feet above the dunes jerdian leaned back in the seat and looked off across the sand she showed neither anxiety nor any urgent desperation to be elsewhere in a soft thoughtful voice she said the desert is a very strange place by moonlight it gives off an enchantment like a dream place no surprise that it works so much mischief im very conscious of this said gersen he put his arm around her shoulders and drew her close she looked up and went limp against him he kissed her again and again the boat drifted low and grounded upon a sand dune the two sat quietly looking out over the moonlit sand presently jerdian the face said i am unutterably surprised to find myself here with you and yet perhaps not really surprised i cant help thinking of everyones outrage what will they say tomorrow will i be the only one returning with my virtue intact gersen kissed her again not necessarily ten seconds passed then jerdian said in a husky whisper but i do have the option yes indeed said gersen you have the option jerdian stepped from the boat and walked a few feet out along the dune gersen came to stand beside her presently she turned to face him again they embraced gersen spread the white darsh cloak down upon the sand and on the ancient dunes of the wale in the light of mirassou they became lovers the moon reached the zenith and sank beyond the night was becoming old slowly the magic was dying gersen took jerdian back to dinkelstown then returned to the charabanc the four young men sullen and disheveled stood to the side one of the chaperones and one of the girls sat silently in the charabanc as gersen approached the other chaperone appeared through a cleft in the rocks wordlessly she climbed aboard the charabanc gersen came forward they looked at him with suspicious stares i happened past and was able to help jerdian chanseth said ger sen she is back at the hotel and you need not worry about her one of the older women aunt mayness said grimly we are sufficiently worried about ourselves we all have had beastly expe riences aunt eustacia said in a voice somewhat more moderate i sup pose that we must be philosophical we have suffered outrage but no irreparable damage let us be grateful at least to this extent that is hardly my present emotion snapped aunt mayness i was set upon time after time by a gross beast smelling of beer and that intolerable food the man who attacked me also smelled poorly otherwise he was almost courteous if the word is at all appropriate eustacia you are far too bland i am most of all tired if jerdian is back at dinkelstown that leaves only millicent and helen to be accounted for here they come now together let us leave this awful place the demon princes and what of our reputations cried aunt mayness in a brassy voice well be the laughingstock of all llalarkno not if we bind ourselves to secrecy how can we have these bestial darsh punished if we hold our tongues gersen interposed a remark i doubt if you will be able to punish the darsh they assume that if you go out on the desert by night your purpose is procreation the guilty party is your driver he played you a merry trick aunt eustacia said this is the sad truth so we might as well accept it let us just pretend nothing happened this man knows the darsh know ill say nothing said gersen the darsh may make a few jokes among themselves but probably thats as far as it will go one of you men show some spirit drive the charabanc back to din kelstown aldo grumbled if youd been through what i have youd lack spirit too ill not go into details none of us is happy with the nights events snapped aunt mayness now get up into the drivers seat and be brisk about it i am more than anxious for a bath from games of the galaxy by everett wright the chap ter entitled hadaul hadaul like all good games is characterized by com plexity and the multiple levels upon which the game is played the basic apparatus is simple a field suitably delineated and a certain number of players the field is most often painted upon the pavement of a plaza occasionally it will be constructed of carpet there are many variations but here is a typical arrangement a pedestal stands at the cen ter of a maroon disk the pedestal can be of any configu ration and customarily supports the prize money the diameter of the disk ranges from four to eight feet three concentric rings each ten feet in width surround the disk these are known as robles and are painted from in to out yellow green and blue the area beyond the blue ring is known as limbo any number of contestants or roblers may partici pate but usually the game starts with a maximum of twelve and a minimum of four any more creates excessive con gestion any less reduces the scope of that trickery which is an essential element the rules are simple the roblers take up positions around the yellow roble all now are yellow roblers as the game starts they attempt to eject the other yellow rob lers into the green roble once thrust or thrown into the green a robler becomes green and may not return to the demon princks yellow he will now attempt to eject other green roblers into the blue a yellow robler may venture into the green and return into yellow as a sanctuary similarly a green roh ler may enter blue and return to the green unless he is ejected from blue bv a blue robler a game will sometimes end with one yellow robler one green robler and one blue robler yellow may be disin clined to attack green or blue green disinclined to attack blue at this stage no further play is possible the game halts and the three roblers share the prize in a ratio yellow receiving the or half share green or blue may wager new sums equal to the yellow prize and by this means once again become yellow a process which may con tinue until a single robler remains to claim the entire prize rules in this regard vary from hadaul to hadaul at times a challenger may now propose a sum equal to the prize the previous winner may or may not decline the challenge ac cording to local rules often the challenger may propose a sum double the prize which challenge must be accepted unless the winner has suffered broken bones or other se rious disability these challenge matches are often fought with knives staves or on occasion whips not infrequently a friendly hadaul ends with a corpse being carried off on a litter referees monitor the play assisted by electronic de vices which signal crossings of the roble boundaries conspiracy is an integral part of the game before the game starts the various roblers form alliances of offense or defense which may or may not be honored tricks crafty betrayal duplicity are considered natural adjuncts to the game it is surprising therefore to note how often the tricked robler becomes indignant even though he himself might have been intending the same treachery hadaul is a game of constant flux constant surprise no one game is ever like another sometimes the contests are jovial and goodnatured with everyone enjoying the tricks sometimes tempers are ignited by some flagrant act of fal sity and blood is wont to flow the spectators wager among themselves or at major hadauls against mutualization agencies each major shadestages several hadauls each year the face on the occasion of their festivals and these hadauls are con sidered among the prime tourist spectacles of dar sai gersen slept in his space vessel and awoke to find cora halfway up the sky he lay still a few moments already the events of last night had lost reality what ofjerdian no longer intoxicated by the moonlight nor emotionally vulnerable by reason of her rescue how would she feel gersen bathed and dressed today in ordinary spacemans gear he armed himself with care not knowing what the day might bring he ran through the heat under the water veil and went to the hotel garden the methlen were already at their table jerdian turned him a quick half smile and gave her fingers a secret flutter gersen was reassured she felt no regrets the other methlen paid him no notice as gersen made his breakfast he watched the methlen the young men were surly and taciturn the women seemed more se rene but spoke in measured voices only jerdian showed good spir its for which she received reproachful glances at last the group finished their meal jerdian crossed to ger sens table he jumped to his feet sit down with me i dont dare everyone is a bit edgy and aunt mayness has her suspicions im not worried since with her they are automatic when can i see you tonight jerdian shook her head were staying for the hadaul because thats why we came then well fly back to serjeuz and tomorrow over to llalarkno then ill visit you at llalarkno jerdian smiled wistfully and gave her head a shake everything is so different in llalarkno will you feel differently i dont know it would be better if i did right now im in love with you ive thought of you all night and all this morning after a moment gersen said i notice that you say im in love with you rather than i love you jerdian laughed you are very perceptive there is a distinc tion i love something im sure of that perhaps its you perhaps who knows what she searched his face are you offended its not exactly what id like to hear still i often wonder thk demon princes about myself am i a man or a motivated mechanism or an absurd distorted idea jerdian laughed again theres no question in my mind you are quite delinitely a man jerdian called aunt mayness in a cold voice come along we are going to the grandstand jerdian gave gersen a wan smile and walked away gersen watched her go an ache at the base of his throat foolishness he told himself sophomoric nonsense he was languishing like a schoolboy he could allow himself no emotional attachments until the work which obsessed his life was done he followed the methlen to the center of the plaza where now a crowd milled around the robles the hadaul was about to start the most characteristic of all darsh spectacles an activity somewhere between a game and a gang fightgiven savor by tricks broken faith and opportunism in short a microcosm of darsh society to make convenient provision for spectators was a concept for eign to darsh philosophy those who cared to watch were forced either to use the makeshift grandstands to perch upon the sur rounding structures or to crowd close to the fence which sur rounded the robles on a post hung a set of boards listing participants in the various hadauls gersen could not read the looping darsh script he ap proached the registration booth and attracted the clerks attention which is bel ruks hadaul that would be the third round the official tapped one of the placards the challenge is a hundred sw or twentyfive kot zash shares how many challenges have been made so far nine how much kotzash a hundred shares not enough thought gersen he needed at least shares he looked in distaste toward the robles and the grandstands crowded with whiterobed darsh fastidiously aloof in a section reserved for tourists sat the methlen gersen gave a fatalistic shrug the game was strange to him the darsh would be quick to take advantage of an iskish still a hundred shares would bring him close to control of the company he paid over the last of his money a the face single hundredsvu certificate here is mv challenge for bel ruks hadaul the clerk drew back incredulously you intend to compete in the robles sir you are iskish and i only tell you for good nature but you are risking broken bones there are strong and notorious trickers going into bel ruks hadaul it will be an interesting experience does bel ruk himself take part he has guaranteed a thousandsvu prize but he will not fight if the challenges exceed a thousand sw he will profit but the kotzash shares are part of the prize exactly so the challenges including the shares go on the prize board then put my name on the placard as you wish the bonesetters sit under yonder red nag gersen found a vantage where he could look over the field the roblers for the first turn had now appeared twelve young men wearing correct hadaul attire short trousers of white canvas a sin glet of brown gray or pale red cloth slippers a headcloth tied so as to gather up dangling earlobes the roblers walked around the periphery of the blue pausing to talk together sometimes con fidentially mouth to ear sometimes exchanging no more than a jocular word occasionally small groups formed to listen while tac tical theories were expounded another robler might join such a group to hear plots not to his liking whereupon anry words would be exchanged and on one occasion a small scuffle from a nearby dumble came the referees four old men wearing embroidered redandblack vests each carried a sixfoot wand ter minating in a puffejector the chief referee additionally bore a glass bowl containing the prize in this case a sheaf of svu certif icates he went to the central disk and placed the prize upon the pedestal the referees took up their positions the chief referee struck upon his chestgong with a heavy metal thimble the contestants desisted from their conversations and ranged themselves around the yellow roble the chief referee spoke i now command an ordinary hadaul of craft and force a ban upon all wields and weapons and a pri e of one hundred svu vouchsafed by the trustworthy luke lamaras i now ring the seventeensecond bell he rapped his chestgong the demon princes the players began a restless shuffling motion sidling to positions from which they hoped to gain advantage again the chief struck a tone from his chestgong six sec onds the players crouched darted glances right and left extended their arms in formalized postures two sharp tones from the chestgong play the players moved to the contest some fast some deliberate some would attempt preagreed stratagems others would betray the same three converged on one massive man to hurtle him into the green in a rage he dragged one with him and swung him danc ing across and into the blue the referees at once used their wands to mark the two with colored fluffs wrestling butting tripping hurdling one by one the players were ejected from yellow into green from green into blue from blue into limbo and away from the game some players used agility others massive strength a favorite ploy running around the robles to attack an adversary from the back kept the game in constant motion in general the game seemed goodhumored the players chortled at a clever thrust or a particularly stealthy attack from the rear but as fewer and fewer players remained in the robles and the prospect of winning the prize became ever more possible the mood became more intense faces became strained and corded lunges verged on the ferocious two players in the blue began to exchange blows as they struck out at each other a third player darted out of the green and thrust both into limbo the combatants continued to flail away at each other not too skillfully so gersen noticed until a referee ordered cessation on the grounds that they dis tracted attention from the hadaul finally there remained a single player in the green and a larger heavier player in the blue green ran along the boundary feinting and dodging while blue limped back and forth pretending pain fatigue and despair green however thought better of venturing into the blue preferring a certain threefifths of the prize to the strong possibility of none blue at last began to hurl taunts hoping to infuriate green into recklessness green stood stockstill consid ered a careful moment then turned to the chief referee as if about to request termination of play blue turned away in disgust in stantly green lunged at his back to thrust him into limbo the chief referee struck three tones on his gong terminating the game and the face the entire prize went to that resourceful robler who had deceived his opponent the basic theory of the game was simple gersen decided flex ibility vigilance and a wide field of vision were almost as important as strength and weight the thrusts twists throws and pushes showed him nothing new if he could avoid the concerted effort of four or five adversaries he felt that his chances were at least fair he went to the referees hut where he discovered that his costume while eccentric and substandard could not be judged illegal except for his boots one of the referees rummaging in a box discovered a pair of dirty old slippers which gersen fatalistically strapped to his feet returning outside gersen saw bel ruk at the registration desk he seemed angry and agitated gersen deduced that he had looked down the list of roblers and there had seen the name kirth gersen bel ruk moved aside and spoke to a tall strong man in roblers costume a conversation reflected gersen which undoubtedly con cerned himself the second game for a prize of two thousand svu went with considerably more zeal and less joviality than the first the victor was a certain dadexis a middleaged man thin sinewy and wick edly clever he was immediately challenged by a frustrated young robler who had been ejected early in the bout dadexis now with the option of weapons chose afflocks that implement with the pronged ball at the end of an elastic thong which pleased the chal lenger not at all but which he must now use or forfeit his challenge stake the spectators rose to their feet and pressed so close to the robles that the referees decreed an empty periphery around the field of play the chief referee rang his gong the contestants took up their positions and the challenge match proceeded the bout was short and devoid of either blood pain or drama to the annoyance of the spectators the canny dadexis in a practice flourish swung his afflock with such frightening skill that the challenger became suddenly gloomy the contest started dadexis sidled and dodged easily avoiding the effect of his opponents weapon then snapped out his own thong the ball curled around thehaft of the others afflock dadexis jerked and the challenger was bereft dadexis grinned flourished his afflock around the field and at four gong the dpmon princes tones from the referee went to pick up his now augmented prize while the challenger walked away gersen looked toward the grandstand and discovered jerdian she had risen to her feet with the others the better to observe the challenge bout now she settled in her seat between her aunt may ness and aldo what would she think to see him thrusting and bumping slinking sliding and lunging in the robles with the darsh at the very least mused gersen she would be perplexed the contestants for the third hadaul gathered around the field among them so gersen noted that man whom he had noticed with eel ruk the chief referee spoke into his microphone a hadaul of one thousand svtj guaranteed by the generous bel ruk eleven contes tants have challenged with six hundred svl and one hundred twentyfive shares of kotzash they include experts from several clans and even an iskish feeling slightly ridiculous gersen went out to join the others around the robles one hundred twentyfive shares if he won the hadaul he won kotzash mutual syndicate at once a stocky roundfaced man came to consult with him have you ever played hadaul before no said gersen i expect i have a lot to learn too true well lets arrange a compact i am rudo you i and slash yonder are undoubtedly the three weakest players here if we work together we can cut down the odds good idea said gersen wtio is the strongest throngarro yonder this was bel ruks confidant and mize the great heavy man lets first eject throngarro then mie agreed easier said than done of course our pact holds until these two are ejected gersen now entering into the spirit of the game looked around for other possible allies pie was again approached by a stalwart young man who exuded that reckless swaggering manner known as plambosh you are gersen i am chalcone you wont win of course nor will i but lets ally ourselves against furbil yonder hes rude and vicious and best ejected early why not said gersen id also like to eject throngarro im told hes dangerous the face true enough furbil then throngarro and we guard each other at least until the green or even blue agreed agreed then heres how we thrust furbil you feint him from the side when he turns to deal with you ill leg him from the rear you push and hes tumbled sound tactics said gersen ill do my best a moment or two later furbil came to confer with gersen youre the iskish well good luck to you but youll want more than luck i suggest that we work in duo im agreeable to anything that will keep me in the game good see that young chap yonder thats chalcone an in solent rascal but quick and deft heres how well ditch him from opposite sides well close on him you drop in front of him ill swing him and away he goes halfway into the stands first throngarro said gersen hes the most threatening of the group oh very well throngarro first with the same tactics then chalcone if were still in the robles no fear there so long as we work together three more contestants approached gersen suggesting ploys and cooperations of various kinds to which gersen gave a general acquiescence on the theory that any advantage was better than no advantage whatever among the spectators he glimpsed bel ruk and for an instant met his baleful glare gersen also took occasion to glance toward the methlen to find jerdian watching him in total bewilderment the chief referee marched to the central pedestal and there arranged the challenges packets of svu certificates and folded kot zash shares the chief referee pounded his chestgong contestants as sume your positions the eleven men moved into the yellow roble a gong i call thirtyone seconds the contestants began to move here and there hoping to achieve favorable angles of attack against those adversaries they considered the most critically dangerous another gong i call seventeen seconds the demon princes the contestants crouched looked right and left hopped warily away from obvious thrusts six seconds then play hadaul eleven men created a swirl of motion gersen noticing thron garro sidling purposefully toward him moved away behind thron garro appeared chalcone he caught gersens eye made a sign and thrust at throngarro who turned to fend off the attack gersen moved in thrust and throngarro was greened now furbil ex claimed chalcone remember our compact you make the feint there he is quick now gersen obligingly feinted at furbil who recoiled against chal cone who seized his arm and attempted to swing him into green furbil deftly retained his footing and using their joint movement greened chalcone gersen came behind thrust and furbil also stumbled into the green at the same instant a massive force struck gersen from the side the vast bulk of mize whose methods were brutally simple he merely walked around the yellow shouldering everyone he met into green by sheer luck gersen chanced to catch hold of skish backing away from another adversary by greening skish gersen retained his balance and remained in the yellow ger sen signaled to rudo and indicated mize sensing the joint attack mize put his back to the center table swung his great arms in menacing circles come at me then if you dare gersen seized one of the arms and was almost jerked from his feet at the same time rudo his erstwhile ally seized him around the waist from behind and attempted to hustle him from the yellow gersen jerked his head back into rudos nose he broke the grip and dived behind the great bulk of mize here he put his back to the pedestal raised his feet thrust and sent mize lurching toward the green into which he was assisted by rudo his nose streaming red furious and roaring mize charged at throngarro who nimbly gave way four of the green roblers seized on various parts of mize lurching dancing cursing roaring he was thrust through blue to ward limbo but threw himself backward kicked and so escaped gersen stood back to assess the situation throngarro and mize the two most formidable adversaries had been ejected from yellow where he remained with four others each of the five with throngarro and mize ejected could now realistically envision vic tory and so became correspondingly more cautious there were the face no more alliances either to be honored or betrayed each man was reluctant to commit himself for fear of attack from the rear gersen noticed that the other roblers were regarding him with wary respect an iskish who had survived so long must be a man to take seriously from the corner of his eye gersen saw rudo and a certain hement exchange a few words then rudo sidled toward gersen does our compact still hold of course said gersen then dexter is next the tall squinteyed man you come at him from the side ill pass him and catch him in a crotch constric tor and out he goes on the ready gersen as instructed sidled toward dexter at the same time watching hement just as he came within arms length of dexter hement lunged toward him as did dexter and smartly from be hind his erstwhile ally rudo gersen had been expecting the ploy he pulled dexter into hement threw rudo head over heels into the green then seizing dexters leg heaved him into the green just as a flying body struck him from behind gersen bent reached over his head jerked and his assailant toppled on top of dexter in the green as they staggered erect both were seized and blued hement somewhat tentatively seized gersens arm and tried to swing him gersen hacked feinted reached heaved hement hurtled into the green and gersen was now left alone in the yellow save for a single other a bulky young man who had retained yellow principally by staying out of everyone elses way gersen advanced upon him he retreated gersen stalked him around the ring once then twice whereupon the young robler could retreat no further to be chased three times around the ring meant automatic ejection into the next roble warily the two came together gersen extended his arm the other gingerly took his wrist essayed a pull gersen fell forward applied an armlock swung the young man around and marched him hopping and squirming to the green gersen was now alone in the yellow he might if he chose venture into green or even blue and still return to yellow unless in the green he were forcibly ejected into blue or in the blue thrust into limbo but he felt no interest in participating in green or blue contests where theroblers now anxious and angry had abandoned temperate conduct they struck kicked butted and kneed with gasping roaring cursing abandon gersen leaned the demon princes against the pedestal and watched the activity throngarro in blue had come to grips with rudo gersen watched throngarros tactics with interest he was undoubtedly a skillful fighter quick strong and resourceful he was still no match for mize whose sheer bulk made him almost impregnable at the thought of facing mize one to one gersen grimaced he probably would win by striking and hacking and attempting to close mizes eye but he would surely suffer sprains and bruises possibly broken bones or even a broken neck throngarro had eected rudo he now gave his attention to mize forming a cabal with a pair of other blues he attacked mize the three men were erked around like ants on a beetle finally more by luck than design they caused mize to stumble into limbo where he flung himself prone and beat the ground with his fists throngarro meanwhile took advantage of the situation to thrust out the two who had assisted him with mize gersen glanced around the ring of spectators he encountered bel ruks baleful glare and let his gaze swing past he looked toward the methlen and for a flickering instant caught jerdians eye he could not read her expression her aunt mayness called to her and jerdian looked away the hadaul reached a static level in blue stood throngarro in the green chalcone and in the yellow gersen if the hadaul as of now terminated the prize would be divided gersen spoke to throngarro and chalcone ill take the kot zash shares you two can divide the money six hundred svu is this agreeable to you both chalcone calculated i agree throngarro started to speak then looked back at bel ruk who gave his head a stern shake throngarro reluctantly said no the whole prize must be shared out gersen signaled chalcone up close to the yellowgreen bound ary lets make a compact which i guarantee to honor if you will make the same guarantee what do you have in mind let us both go into blue and eject throngarro then i will return to yellow and you to green i will take the kotzash and you can take the money all six hundred svu i agree to this compact mind you said gersen this is a contract of honor not a fhe rcl hadaul ploy if ou break our promise will take the matter most seriously you can trust me can i trust you tor this single occasion es very well you go in on the left i on the right ith an arms length between us and we will push him out backwards agreed with no more ado gersen stepped into the green then into blue with chalcone beside him hrongarro waited in a crouch conceiving his best hope lay in attack he sprang out at chalcone hoping to tackle him around the middle and hurl him around and run him out into limbo gersen hooked his arm whereupon chal cone seized the other arm gersen kicked the back of throngarros knees throngarro collapsed but as he did so kicked chalcone in the groin and chalcone went down bent double throngarro kicked at gersen who seized ihrongarros ankle and twisted throngarro screamed as the ligaments tore he struggled to roll over and away gersen turned the ankle again throngarro was forced to roll once again up to the ery edge of limbo where m a frenzy he struggled and lurched lashing out with his free foot he kicked gersen in the side gersen turned the ankle again thron garro screaming in despair rolled out into limbo gersen stood back panting chalcone had gained his feet but stood crouched in pain pressing at his lower abdomen i he two considered each other chalcone with glazed eyes gersen returned into yellow and chalcone hobbled back into recn gersen called to the chief referee give me the kotzash shares grve chalcone the money and the hadaul is ended fhe chief reteree asked chalcone are you agreed to this di vision yes t am more than satisfied so let it be he spoke into his microphone for the first time m my recollection and perhaps m all the annals of our glorious game an iskish has won at a maor game in combat against the best ofdar sai i now call out tor challenges does anyone challenge the victory of this redoubtable iskish bel ruk stood talking furiously to i hrongarro who sat on a bench his sprained ankle already swollen lhronarro merely shook his head bel ruk savagely turned away i challenge he shouted hoarsely it is i bel ruk and we shall fight with whips weapons are at the option of the challenged as well you th demon princes know said the chief referee do you challenge both chalcone and gersen no i challenge gersen alone the chief referee gave the s tj certificates to chalcone go in pride hom this hadaul i do so and i give honor to gersen who plays with great skill chalcone took the money and hobbled gratefully off the field bel ruk marched forward he gave the referee two svu here is double the value of one hundred twentyfive shares of kotzash which are known to be worthless the referee stood back in disapproval you yourself placed a value upon these shares of four svu each by no means i guaranteed a prize of a thousand svu i agreed to allow twentyfive shares to represent a hundred svu if gersen wishes to surrender the one hundred twentyfive shares to me i will pay him five hundred svu otherwise he will lose his life as i will kill him if he opposes me you take a stern attitude said the referee well gersen what is it to be bel ruk is challenging your kotzash and your life and all it costs him is a misery two svu if you wish to withdraw evidently bel ruk will pay you five hundred svu for your kotzash and you will have spent a profitable day i must inform you that bel ruk is notoriously skillful with his whips and weapons your chances are not at all good still you may specify which weapons if any are to be used gersen shrugged if i must fight him i will use either knives or bare hands as he wishes knives cried bel ruk i will undertake to cut him apart one of the referees tendered a tray in which rested a pair of daggers with black wooden grips and doubleedged blades almost a foot long gersen took one of the knives and hefted it the blade a long thin triangle broad at the grip made for a lack of that balance which gersen preferred still he decided it would do well enough certainly it was not a weapon designed to be thrown which implied the absence of such skill among the darsh he looked up in the stands to find an expression of fascinated horror onjerdians face the chief referee spoke the bout will be fought within the robles and will continue until one of the parties m contention in the f i dicates surrender either by throwing up his hands or by crying out or by vacating the robles or until he is unable to proceed or until i cry a halt the bout will be tree there are neither regulations nor limitations you may take up positions in the yellow on op posite sides of the pedestal the bout will begin at the fourth gong strike and continue until i intervene when it must come to an instant halt on pain of three days in the cesspit so guard your ardor and stop fighting at my command since i will have no lei surely carving up of a disabled man these words were accom panied by a meaningful glance toward bel ruk three retreating or pursued circuits of the pedestal also constitute surrender i now sound the thirtyone second gong take your places gersen and bel ruk faced each other across the pedestal seventeen seconds bel ruk waved his blade back and forth enoying the feel of death i have been waiting for this occasion i am not averse to it said gersen tell me did you go out on the mount pleasant raid mount pleasant that was long ago so you were there bel ruks only response was a cold grin i can now kill you without compunction said gersen six seconds gentlemen flourish your weapons at the next gongstrike make your engagement the seconds marched past traversing that mysterious boundary which separates future from past the gong sounded bel ruk advanced around the pedestal kmfe low and held as if it were a sword gersen waited in a slouch then threw the knife at bel ruks heart the blade skimmed fair to its target struck with metallic clink rebounded and fell to the ground bel ruk evidently wore a vest of dympnet sequins under his singlet the referee made no protest apparently the vest was considered a legal accessory as soon as the knife struck the ground bel ruk kicked it toward limbo simultaneously gersen sprang forward and bel ruks atten tion was diverted the knife slid to a halt ust inches inside the blue bel ruk thrust gersen ducked sideways to the left and hacked with his hand at the side of the burly neck and punched at bel ruks left eye bel ruk hacked at gersens ribs the blade cut ihf dpmon princes through his blouse and laid open six inches ot skin blood ooed forth in a rage gersen caught bel ruks arm applied a lock tripped bel ruk and using bel ruks own momentum broke the elbow joint bel ruk gave a grunt the knife dropped from his limp fingers but he groped with his left hand seized the haft and cut up back wards plunging the knife into gersens thigh gersen stood back aghast had he become so clumsy he now bled from two wounds he would soon go limp and weak and then he would be killed not yet he hacked at bel ruks neck once again as bel ruk attempted to break away and stab gersen caught bel ruks left arm but could not apply a lock bel ruk erked away to stand panting his right arm limp his left eye almost closed bleeding from ribs and thigh gersen limped over to his knife bel ruk rushed after dagger held high for a downward thrust ger sen caught the upraised arm then reached down to catch bel ruks knee as it erked up toward his crotch he heaved bel ruk tottered back and gersen retrieved his knife bel ruk mouth open nostrils distended eyes bruised came staggering forward gersen threw the knife a second time it plunged almost to the hilt into bel ruks corded neck bel ruk fell to his knees and with a final effort almost a reflex threw his knife at gersen the point dropped the edge cut gersens hip bel ruk sagged forward and the weight of his body drove the dagger entirely through his neck and the point issued six inches from the nape i declare the hadaul ended called the referee gersen is the winner his prize is one hundred twentyfive shares of kotzash and two svl gersen took the certificates and staggered from the robles a surgeon led him to a nearby dumble and attended to his wounds one hundred twentyfive shares of kotzash gersen now owned shares over half he controlled kotzash mutual gersen emerged from the dumble to find that bel ruks corpse had been carried away he looked up into the stands the methlen had departed apparently having seen enough gersen limped away from the area and out to his spaceship he climbed aboard secured the hatches took the vessel into the air and east toward sereuz he face gersen spent the night in his spaceship drifting over the desert in the morning he landed beside the serjeuz water veils impelled by caprice he dressed in loose trousers of black twill a white linen blouse and a dark green sash the costume that a wealthy young aristocrat of avente on alphanor might wear on a promenade he hobbled through the morning sunlight under the water veils then out upon the plaza the garden at the sfennde select was almost untenanred at the travelers inn a few early tourists sat at break fast gersen went into the lobby at a telephone he called the sfer inde select and asked to be connected to mistress jerdian chanseth presently her soft voice came from the speaker yes who is it kirth gersen wait a moment while i close the door kirth gersen why did you do what you did everyone believes you insane i needed a hundred and twenty more shares of kotzash now i control the company but the risks you took i couldnt avoid them were you worried for me of course my heart was in my throat i didnt want to watch but i couldnt not watch everyone says that bel ruk was a noto rious assassin extremely skilled with weapons they think that you must be the same thats not the case can i see you i dont know how were leaving for llalarkno at once and aunt mayness is with me every moment shes certain already that something is wrong with me where are you at the travelers inn yes ill come across i can risk fifteen minutes ill meet you in the garden where we sat before wtiere i first decided that i was in love with you do you remember i remember ill be right there gersen went out to the garden two minutes later jerdian ap peared she wore the same dark green gown in which he first had seen her he rose to his feet she came into his arms and they kissed once twice three times this is so pointless said jerdian this is the last time ill ever see you the demon princes so i tell myself but i find it hard to make myself believe it somehow you must find a way jerdian looked over her shoulder id be in disgrace if i were found here with you gersen was a trifle nettled by the remark would you mind so very much well yes at llalarkno we maintain very exact images what if i came to llalarkno jerdian shook her head our world is small everyone knows everyone else and we must live up to expectations it makes for a happy existence usually for a long minute gersen looked at her then he said if i could offer you a happy serene life i wouldnt listen but i cant assure you of anything but anxiety travel to strange uncomfortable places and perhaps danger not in the foreseeable future so goodbye tears welled up injerdians eyes i cant abide that word its like death sometimes i wish youd just carry me to your ship and fly away with me id not resist or cry out id be thrilled with happiness it would be wonderful for a while but i cant do it id only bring you grief jerdian rose to her feet blinking against the tears i must go gersen stood up but made no move toward her she hesitated then came to him and kissed his cheek ill never forget you she turned and walked from the garden gersen sat back in his chair the episode was finished he would forget jerdian chanseth as quickly and as thoroughly as pos sible he was now in a hurry panshaw still would not know of bel ruks death nor of gersens new status as kotzash majority stock holder he used one of the two svu he had won from bel ruk to buy his breakfast then returned to his ship into a case he packed a set of tools then limped hurriedly to dindar house under skan sel shade he went directly to panshaws office as before the door was locked gersen brought tools from his bag cut the lock free and thrust open the door careless of any alarm which might be set off with ottile panshaw offplanet and bel ruk dead there might be no one to heed such an alarm he entered the room which as before smelled stale and rancid he heard hurrying footsteps in the hall two men looked the face through the door gersen gave them a cool inspection wtio are you and what do you want here one of the men said sharply i am manager of this building mr bel ruk has asked me to keep a lookout against intruders how dare you break into this office i control kotzash mutual this office is my responsibility it is my right to enter and do as i like with or without a key bel ruk said nothing to me of this nor will he ever bel ruk is dead the managers face became grave that is sad news not for any honest man bel ruk was a scoundrel he de served worse than he got now please go away i intend to examine the kotzash records if you care to inquire about me i refer you to adario chanseth at the chanseth bank as you say sir the two men withdrew and after a whispered consultation in the hall departed gersen started with the file cabinets then went to the shelves then explored the desk he found records of kotzash dealings of ore acquisition and the corresponding distribution of share vouch ers information which at one time he would gladly have possessed now it meant nothing he discovered copies of leases licenses and mineral exploration rights granted to kotzash all worthless so he had been assured he made a parcel of these and set them aside the desk yielded nothing of interest whatever gersen looked around the office one last time it had harbored ottile panshaw bel ruk and almost certainly lens larque the air still seemed tainted gersen departed dindar house he went directly to his fan tamic flitterwing and a few minutes later was gone into space part methel is from peoples of the coranne by richard pelto methel the enchanted planet where a folk superb handsome proud and splendidly dressed live in privilege ostentatious privacy and the often irritating conviction of their own superiority arrogance a word functionally apt when applied to the methlen carries far too many incorrect connotations and quite misrepresents the ingenuous charm of this people even their servitors and functionaries the socalled mon grels regard the methlen with an amused and even ap preciative tolerance which while often wry is seldom bitter for the student of the human condition and its infinite permutations the methlen are a fascinating case their his tory is relatively uneventful methel was located for and chartered to the membership of aretioi an exclusive club of zangelberg on stanislas tracts of land were allocated among the membership the remainder of the planet was designated a wilderness reserve many aretioi who came from zangelberg to visit remained in residence and all enormously augmented their wealth by dealing in duode cimates with great dedication the methlen have kept their world private and remote a spaceport at the service city twanish is the single depot of ingress or egress the pop ulation of methel is small twenty thousand methlen in habit llalarkno perhaps as many more keep to their the demon princes country estates twanish is in effect an enclave inhabited by fifty thousand mongrels offworlders of many varieties a mixed race indeed which includes the occasional result of a methlen nonmethlen liaison and a large colony of darsh who undertake menial tasks llalarkno is more like an outsized village than a town the wonderful methlen homes are sacred to the families who inhabit them each is named each owns a reputation or an atmosphere or a mood which is unique and well known in these houses the methlen perform their rituals play their games and undertake the pageants which provide variety and color for their lives tournaments of a hundred sorts theatricals opera cycles pavanes classical panto mime the spectacles progress in their seasons there are roles for everyone drama is the grand motif of methlen existence part of the game is to pretend that all other folk of the oikumene are primitive or at best uncouth the more perceptive methlen recognize the game for what it is a fantasy or frivolity to be enjoyed for its own sake others hold the concept to be a fundamental truth the methlen in general lack awareness of their propensities they tend to overstate to make grand gestures to adopt flamboyant postures every instant becomes a new tableau where they arrange themselves to best advantage however and withal the methlen are a hardheaded people who make few mistakes and will not allow an extravagance to proceed to where it becomes inconvenient eight forts orbited methel at a distance of half a million miles following procedures specified in space pilot and gazetteer gersen declared himself to one of these forts he was boarded and exam ined by a methlen lieutenant and a pair of cadets and presently cleared for entry he was assigned a landing plat at twanish space port and a traffic channel for the guidance of his autopilot the fortress authorities departed the fantamic flitterwing dropped away toward methel a globe solemn and magnificent showing like mottled velvet dark blue and green in the coralight to the side drifted the moon shanitra an angular lump of sinter the face the color of ash an object to which gersen controlled exclusive rights of mineral exploitation for whatever these were worth the traffic control drew him down to twanish the single city of methel and landed him on that plat assigned to him at twanish spaceport the time was midaftemoon through the ports came cora light clear and lucid but lacking the brutal impact ofdar sai cora light gersen stepped out upon the soil of methel jerdian chanseths world in the west twanish showed a set of glassandconcrete struc tures cantilevered out from one two or several loadsupporting columns to create an effect of airy solidity beyond rose a wooded upland llalarkno to the north the land was planted to crops and orchards to the south a parkland of meadows and enormous old trees heaved up to become a long range of ancient mountains a serene and pleasant prospect thought gersen he crossed the field by a path of cemented sinter to the space terminal a po lygonal structure of black metal and glass with acentral tramcand control tower a sign directed him to a counter where a uniformed clerk noted his personal particulars into an information bank thus extinguishing a small yellow light on a display board evidently the completion of a verification procedure initiated at the space fortress a public conveyance carried him into the center of town at the commercial hotel he was offered room and bath adequate to his needs his most immediate concern was money of which he had none whatever he placed a telephone call and discovered the local correspondent of cooneys bank which gersen immediately visited and where he was tendered a thousand svu on his letter of credit at a kiosk he bought a map of the city then took a seat at a nearby sidewalk cafe a waitress came to take his order gersen pointed to a table where a man sat with a frosty pale green formulation what is that gentleman drinking that is our crosseye punch sir its fruit juice sweet spirits of arrack and bangleberry rum frozen and whipped bring me one of the same said gersen and settled back to observe the inhabitants of twanish these were mostly mongrels folk of various types but all wearing similar garments jackets striped vertically in dark or muted colors with black trousers or skirts the the demon princes effect was one of formality and punctilio there was a scattering of offworlders salesmen agents and a few tourists gersen also saw darsh wearing claycolored breeches and white blouses or white pajama suits and methlen set apart by their dark hair and olive complexions their clothes and an indefinable ease of manner an interesting mix of people thought gersen the waitress brought a chilled flask of crosseye punch gersen opened his map of the city which he saw to be of no great extent the streets and places of twanish were carefully limned and labeled but that area to the west designated as lla larkno showed no detail whatever the methlen abodes and their avenues of ingress apparently were not to be exposed to the vulgar gaze gersen gave the faintest of shrugs methlen vanities were none of his concern the crosseye punch was a success at a signal the waitress brought a second goblet this should be ample to your needs sir she told him earnestly it is strong drink and a stranger will not realize its authority until he attempts to stand erect sometimes these are known as tickets to redemption because when folk take more than is necessary they become obstreperous and must be pun ished i appreciate the warning said gersen how are these ob streperous ones punished that depends upon the offense but often they are locked arm and leg into clouts and children are allowed to pelt them with soft fruit which often so i fear is spoiled and bad the girl gave a shudder of distaste i for one never want to be made a public mock nor i said gersen would you please bring me the tele phone directory certainly sir gersen turned the pages and immediately found the entry kot zash mutual skohune tower followed by the telephone code gersen called the waitress and paid his score and where is skohune tower look yonder sir across the park notice the building with the tall center portal that is skohune tower gersen sauntered across the park and approached skohune tower a structure of eight levels the floors of white concrete the walls of glass the loadbearing members four columns of black the face metal a far cry from dindar house at serjeuz for a bankrupt and debtridden concern such as kotzash mutual skohune tower would seem a startlingly expensive address from somewhere had come money the ettilia gargantyrs insurance settlement the sale of plundered kotzash duodecimates gersen crossed the avenue and entered the groundlevel foyer a glassenclosed area between the four columns a directory in structed gersen that kotzash mutual occupied chamber on the third level gersen considered the options open to him he might walk into the kotzash offices and assert control a forthright act which certainly would arouse the notice of lens larque there might or might not be a corresponding advantage for gersen cer tainly he wanted to act before panshaw learned of bel ruks death which could only be a matter of hours gersen crossed the foyer to the business office where he dis covered a whippetthin mongrel with keen features and alert black eyes wearing the orthodox black trousers a jacket striped in black brown dull mustard and maroon and glossy black shoes a brass counter plaque read udolf tester manager gersen identified himself as the field representative ofcooneys bank we are seriously considering a branch here at twanish said gersen in his most solemn voice ill need a business address and an office here might well serve my needs i would be most happy to oblige you said testel who seemed not only keen but also somewhat pompous and self important our occupancy is close to total still i could offer you a suite on the second level or a single room on the fifth he produced charts and indicated the premises to which he referred gersen took the charts studied them a moment then examined the thirdfloor plan kotzash mutual occupied a single room be tween a single room occupied by irie pharmaceutical imports and the threechamber offices ofjarkow engineering the third level would suit me best said gersen what is available here nothing whatever a pity either of these offices would exactly serve my needs gersen indicated and are the tenants permanently es tablished i wonder if they might be induced to move to the fifth floor testel bridled at this somewhat highhanded proposal i am the option princks certain that they would not he said stiffly mr coost of irie is quite set in his ways mr panshaw in works with jarkow en gineering neither could consider moving of this i am sure in that case ill look at the fifth level office said gersen if youll give me the key ill make a quick inspection allow me to show the office said testal it is no trouble whatever i prefer to look the place over alone said gersen then i am not distracted in forming my opinions just as you like said testel in a nasal voice he slid open a drawer selected a key number to the right as you leave the lift gersen rode the ascensor to the fifth level the kev a strip of laminated metal controlled the lock through varying permeabilities to magnetic fields such a key could not readily be duplicated and would not facilitate entrance into or gersen never theless had noted the drawer in which the manager kept his spare keys gersen made a quick inspection of then returned to tes ters office on the ground floor and gave over the key ill inform you of my decision presently we shall be happy to serve you said testel in a backstreet gersen located a locksmiths workshop where he bought three blank keys similar to those used at skohune tower and had them engraved respectively with the numbers and he then returned to the spaceport and his ship where he packed several types of eavesdrop equipment into a case when he confronted panshaw with the new circumstances the ensuing con versations might well lead directly to lens larque or at the very least provide some indication as to his whereabouts back at the commercial hotel he dropped off his equipment the time was now dusk and possibly too late to advance his pro gram any further gersen nevertheless felt restless and on edge imminence was upon him events were converging he crossed the park to skokune tower thinking to make a reconnaissance ifot tile panshaw were on the premises who knows where he might lead when he departed from the park gersen counted windows still showed light mr coost of trie pharmaceuticals worked late was dark ottile panshaw would be enjoying the evening elsewhere the offices the face of jarkow engineering were also dark gersen crossed the street and looked into the foyer the door into the business office stood ajar and the diligent udolf testel still stood at the counter frown ing down at a ledger gersen went to a telephone in the far corner of the foyer he called testels office and heard the sharp declaration skohune tower managers office gersen pitched his voice at a quavering halffalsetto mr tes tel come at once to the roof garden theres mischief going on you must put an end to it come quickly eh cried testel whats all this who is calling please gersen had broken the connection he went to stand where he could watch across the foyer testel came from his office on the run his expression eloquent of concern and vexation he jumped upon the ascensor and disap peared from view gersen crossed to testels office went behind the counter and slid open the key drawer he removed keys from the slots labeled and replaced them with the blank keys he closed the drawer left the office crossed the lobby and departed skohune tower pleased with his evenings work gersen dined at the medallion restaurant which advertised classic cuisine authentic dishes in the style of the grand masters gersen only mildly interested in abstruse gastronomy put himself at the mercy of the waiter who handed him a card edged in silver and black this is our grand repast of today sir highly to be recommended gersen read hors doeuvres of ten worlds broth with aloe nuts and water flowers in the style of benitres capella vi gratin of pink nard with cress and whitebait as served by sigismond at the grand hotel avente alphanor prime cutlets of the fivehomed darango imported from the oxygen marshes cuenos notos the demon princes dumplings of belsifer root with saffron in the style of farewell station miriotes relish of mushroom dry saute chilled pineapple and mango chutney from the gardens of old earth salad of herbs and greens dressed with oil of mediterranean olives and alsatian vinegar frivols flimsies flapdoodles as purveyed along the esplanade at avente coffee from the sunnyrain highlands krokinole brewed to the instant in a porcelain pot and served with a tot of mascarene rum in the style of fat hannah at the copus spaceport the menu will be enhanced by five excellent wines appropriate to each service the price of thirty svu placed this meal in the luxury category well why not gersen asked himself and instructed the waiter you may bring me this grand repast at once sir the dishes were well prepared garnished expertly and served with a flourish perhaps they were indeed authentic and so it seemed to gersen who had dined at many of the listed localities and often had taken a tot of rum at fat hannahs on copus the clientele so he noticed was at least halfmethlen what ifjerdian chanseth were to wander in wtiat would she think what would she do gersen wondered what he himself might do nothing probably he left the restaurant and strolled along the principal avenue oftwanish a treelined boulevard known as the mall which after a sweeping curve around redemption park veered up into lla larkno few vehicles other than cabs moved along the streets the methlen system of control so gersen would learn was simple they the face imposed high licensing fees and built no roads except in the near vicinity of twanish on impulse gersen signaled down a cab a small softwheeled vehicle with the passenger compartment to the front and the driver mounted behind where to sir llalarkno said gersen just drive around a bit you have no destination in mind sir quite right take me around llalarkno and bring me back here well i suppose it can be done now that its dark the meth len and you wouldnt know being an outworider are jealous of their privacy they dont like to see great charabancs loaded with tourists trundling about llalarkno so long as its not illegal ill risk the trip as you say sir gersen climbed into the passengers compartment the driver inquired any particular place that you wish to see sir do you know the residence ofadario chanseth indeed sir the chanseth house is named oldenwood when we pass oldenwood please point it out to me very well sir the cab rolled off along the mall around redemption park and up the incline toward llalarkno weeping acacia trees obscured the lights of twanish almost at once gersen felt himself in a new environment the road turned off across a wooded upland winding among the methlen homes gersen perhaps prejudiced by his appraisal of adario chanseth had expected splendor and display somewhat to his surprise he found rambling old mansions built so it was clear for no purpose other than to please those who lived there he glimpsed verandahs grown over with flowering vines lawns and pools fairy lanterns floated through the gardens tall windows of many panes glowed golden the folk who lived in these homes thought gersen would cherish them as if they were things alive children would never want to leave but the eldest son must inherit and heartsick or not the others must leave gersen who barely remembered his childhood home grew melancholy he could own such a home if he so chose as spacious and comfortable as any of these the expense certainly was no obstacle only the style of his thk demon princes life which made such a notion no more than a farfetched day dream a pleasant daydream nevertheless upon which his mind lingered where would he choose to live if circumstances so ar ranged themselves not on alphanor certainly nor anywhere along the concourse nor on any of the vegan worlds where such houses as these would not sit comfortably perhaps on old earth or even here on methel with jerdian chanseth the idea improved as gersen considered it impossible however gersen called up to the driver wtiere is oldenwood we are drawing near there parnassio the house of the zanies there andelmore offloristys and there is oldenwood stop just a moment gersen stepped down from the cab and stood in the road in a mood of even deeper melancholy he con sidered the house where jerdian had lived her life the windows were dark except for a few watchlamps the chanseths had not yet returned home the driver spoke notice the house just yonder thats moss alrune and a fine house indeed it belongs to an old lady the last of the azels shes priced the house at a million svu and wont take a dit less do you know of lens larque the great corsair naturally one day he came wandering through llalarkno just as you now are doing and saw the house he decided to buy after all whats a million svu to lens larque he strolled through the gar den examining this and that smelling the flowers tasting the ber ries adario chanseth happened to be abroad in his own garden and spied the strange man he called out hey there what are you up to in that garden im looking this property over if its any of your affair said lens larque ive decided to buy adario chanseth roared out be damned to that ill never tolerate your big darsh face hanging over my garden fence not to mention your stinks and smells get out of llalarkno and stay out lens larque roared back be damned to you ill buy where i like and put my face where i like chanseth rushed into his house and called the security guards who of course hustled lens larque off the prop erty and there it still sits vacant as ever with no one willing to pay the million svu and what ensued with lens larque wtio knows they say he went off in a rage and whipped a dozen boys to soothe his feelings the face and hes still on methel again who knows no one recognized him for lens larque while he dickered for moss alrune his name was only mentioned later through the trees gersen could only glimpse moss alrune on the lake beyond a glittering trail reflected from the moon shanitra gersen climbed back into the cab which proceeded around llalarkno through copses and dells across moonlit glades past the great old houses to which gersen paid no further heed the cab returned down the incline and into the mall the drivers voice intruded upon gersens musings wtiere do you wish to go sir gersen considered haste was of utmost importance but he felt tired and out of sorts tomorrow morning would serve his purposes well enough take me to the commercial hotel the muon is named after a grotesque clown in the methlen opera bouffe from people of the coranne by richard pelto the twanish mongrels reacting to the exclusivity of the methlen aristocracy have developed a countersociety which is orderly genteel and circumspect perhaps it should be noted here that mongrel is not a methlen term the methlen take note of only three sorts of people methlen all other folk except the darsh and the darsh the term mongrel was initiated by the tivamsh scribe facetiously to characterize the varied origins of the twanish citizenry the term came into vogue as an ironic reference to methlen pretensions a oke which of course passed the methlen completely by mongrels prefer to ignore their economic dependence on the methlen they like to think of themselves as ener getic and hardworking entrepreneurs with a general mul tiracial clientele their society is essentially middle class and controlled b an exacting and fastidious etiquette everything considered mongrel fantasies are no less flagrant than those of the methlen if of defensive origin mongrels like to think of the methlen as frivolous vain selfindulgent and overbred m contrast to their own dig nity common sense and stability the methlen pageants are considered extra agant ostentatious and faintly ridic ulous as might be an array of strutting peacocks neverthe less methlen activities are the source of endless gossip among the mongrels and every methlen ofllalarkno will the face be recognized by name when he or she comes down into twanish the two peoples with their contrasting cultures live harmoniously the mongrels affect a contemptuous disdain for methlen frailty the methlen pay the mongrels no at tention whatever gersen arose early and took his kit to skohune tower the foyer was empty and silent the door into udolftestels office was closed gersen rode the ascensor to the third level he passed without so much as pausing ottile panshaws predilection for traps and alarms made his present errand impractical at he halted and after a glance up and down the corridor inserted his key the door slid aar gersen looked into the offices ofjarkow engineer ing he saw a large reception room with a glasswalled secretarys office to the left and a hall to the right giving upon a glasswalled drafting room and a pair of private offices the chambers were empty gersen entered closed the door behind him the reception room contained a couch two chairs a table and shelves displaying models of spacemining equipment carriers diggers grinders centrifuges hoppers conveyer systems the secretarys cubicle backed upon ottile panshaws office from his case gersen brought a driveneedle and drilled a small hole deep into the wall into the hole he inserted a probe so that the tip made contact with the outer skin of the wall in ottile panshaws office under the secretarys desk he attached a recording machine inside a black box which he connected to the probe with conducting films he removed the back plate from the secretarys telephone console brought wires up from the black box and attached them to ter minals inside the telephone he had worked quickly and efficiently the time was still early but as he replaced the back plate to the console the door opened and into the reception room came a young woman in secretarial costume a black skirt and a crisp prim blouse candystriped in purple red and white the secretary herself seemed not at all prim m fact she was saucy vivacious and pretty with blond curls fluffing out from under a white cap at the sight of gersen she stopped short and who might you be communications technician miss said gersen your line has been showing irregular pulses ive ust set it right the demon princes indeed the girl crossed the reception room and tossed her handbag into a chair ive noticed something of the sort especially on our calls out to shanitra everything should proceed even and smooth now theres one little pan which often corrodes we generally can fix it in five minutes and be gone before anyone arrives to work but today ive been delayed fancy that well im early this morning ive got some letters of my own to write do you work all night just when im on call i only work parttime in fact ive been on methel only a month oh wheres your world im originally out ofalphanor along the concourse id love to visit the concourse ill be lucky if i get as far as dar sai dog bite it the girl was very composed thought gersen and full of spirit and also far from unattractive working for a spacemining firm as you do id think you might be called on to travel everywhere the girl laughed im just a receptionist mr jarkow barely sends me to the store on errands i suppose i could travel with him under special circumstances if you know what i mean but im not that sort gersen picked up his case well i must be getting along he hesitated as i sav im a stranger in town and i know absolutely no one would you think me bold if i asked you to meet me this evening perhaps we could go somewhere pleasant for dinner the girl threw back her head and laughed a trifle too loudly you are bold indeed we mongrels are a very proper folk and im not so sure as to what you have in mind nothing more than what you can easily cope with said ger sen attempting an ingenuous grin which had he known it only twisted his dark face into a cunning leer the girl failed to notice are vou married no indeed i really should say no and indignantly she turned gersen an arch sideglance but well why not why not indeed wtiere and when shall i meet you oh lets say the black barn which is very gay with dancing galore are you a nimble dancer well no not really the face well repair that lack at the tone of the evening hour ill wait just bv the red door understood except for how to find the black barn my faith you are a stranger indeed everyone knows the black barn ill find it without trouble but let me ask your name lully inkelstaff tell me yours kirth gersen what an odd name it sounds quite medieval did you learn your trade on alphanor partly and partly here and there across space gersen took up his case id better go were not supposed to make calls during business hours i wouldnt want to annoy mr jarkow youre too late said lully inkelstaff i hear him in the cor ridor still hes not one to worry overly much he hardly notices anything except me i must say the outer door slid aside into the office came two men the first gaunt and gray with narrow shoulders and a thin melancholy face the second tall ponderous and heavyfeatured with a pasty complexion and a profusion of unsuitable golden ringlets he wore a loose and untidy mongrel suit black trousers a jacket striped black green and orange which went ill with his complexion the thin man went directly into the drafting office jarkow paused to rake gersen up and down with a cold stare he turned to lully who said in a cheerful voice good morning mr jarkow allow me to introduce my fiance dorth koosin jarkow gave gersen a nod lacking in amicability gersen bowed politely in return after which jarkow stalked off to his office lully put her hand to her mouth to stifle a titter the thought came to me on the instant on occasion mr jarkow attempts familiarities and i wanted to discourage him without a great drama sometimes he is really quite peremptory i hope you dont mind not at all said gersen i am glad to be of service but now i must go ill see you this evening gersen left the office and went directly to chamber the headquarters of kotzash mutual he tried the door and found it locked gersen rapped on the panel but no one responded gersen reflected a moment then descended to the ground thf demon princes floor consulting the directory he learned that evrem dai legal consultant and factuaryatlaw occupied suite gersen rode the ascensor to the fourth floor and went to suite a clerk took him to an inner office where evrem dai sat at a desk gersen succinctly stated his business evrem dai as gersen had expected wanted several days in which to fulfill the requirements but gersen insisted not only upon haste but immediacy and evrem dai after a moments thought prepared a document he then used his communicator spoke to several clerks and finally to a portly gentleman at an enormous desk fabricated from black et and gold evrem dai displayed gersens kotzash shares and the document he had prepared the portly gentleman made an acquiescent mo tion evrem dai put the document into his communicator where it received a transmitted signature and seal gersen paid a not inconsiderable fee and left evrem dais of fices he descended to the third level arriving ust in time to see ottile panshaw stepping into room gersen ran forward and catching the door before it slid shut entered the office panshaw looked around with an expression of mild inquiry sir you are ottile panshaw panshaw squinted at gersen head to the side do i know you i have the impression that somewhere we have met have you recently visited dar sal perhaps we met there perhaps what is your name and what is your business i am a speculator my name is jard glay and i am the con trolling stockholder of kotzash mutual indeed panshaw thoughtfully started for his desk gersen said a moment mr panshaw i am now your employer you are a paid employee of kotzash mutual yes that is so then i prefer that you use this chair while we talk panshaw smiled wryly you still have not demonstrated that you are in fact the controlling stockholder gersen produced the document prepared by evrem dai i have here an official attestation to this effect together with a u dicial order that you immediately relinquish into my custody all documents records and correspondence pertaining to kotzash business together with all assets including money stocks interests contracts real property incidental property in short everything the rtce panshaws smile had become tremulous this is a most pe culiar circumstance naturally i am aware that you have been ac quiring kotzash stock may i inquire as to your motives why do you trouble to ask you would believe nothing told you panshaw shrugged i am not so skeptical as you appear to believe no matter said gersen what is your nominal position here at kotzash managing director who is the principal stockholder after myselp panshaw said guardedly i hold a rather large block of shares and what is the principal business of kotzash now essentially exploration for duodecimates be so good as to elaborate panshaw made a delicate gesture there is nothing much to tell you kotzash controls various charters and exclusive rights and we are trying to exploit them specifically how and where at the moment we are concentrating upon shanitra who has been making these decisions i naturally who else where is the money coming from again panshaws delicate gesture the subsidiaries have yielded good profits which you have not distributed among the shareholders we desperately need working capital the managing director must allocate funds to his best judgment i intend to look carefully into every phase of kotzash as of now i want all activities suspended you seem to be in a position of authority said panshaw suavely you need only give the necessary orders exactly do you intend to continue in your present capacity panshaws sensitive face became creased with perplexity you have surprised me i need time to assess the situation in short you refuse to cooperate with me please murmured panshaw do not force unnatural mean ings upon my remarks gersen went to the desk i o one side rested the communicator screen and coding buttons behind stood a small filing case for fhe df vn princes current records much if not most of kotzashs ramifications would be filed only behind the fragile forehead of ottile panshaw panshaw sat in a melancholy reverie gersen watched him side long now somewhat annoyed in a sense he had outwitted himself to give panshaw scope to conduct a telephone conversation pre sumably with lens larque he must leave panshaw alone in the office thereby risking the destruction or alteration of kotzash rec ords an acceptable procedure suggested itself he spoke in a rea sonable tone of voice these changes must come to you as an unpleasant shock suppose i give you a few minutes to consider your position that would be most gracious of you said panshaw allowing no more than a trace of irony into his voice ill stroll up and down the corridor a time or two said ger sen sit at your desk if you like but please do not interfere with the records naturally not said panshaw indignantly do you take me for a scoundrel gersen left the office leaving the door pointedly open he sauntered to the ascensor then back looking through the open door as he passed as he had expected panshaw was talking ear nestly into the communicator gersen could not see the screen which no doubt was blank in any case gersen walked on to the end of the corridor and back and panshaw still occupied himself on the communicator though now he frowned in nervous dissat isfaction gersen made another tour of the passage and when he passed the door again panshaw sat leaning back in his chair placidly pen sive gersen stepped into the office have you reached a decision yes indeed said panshaw my legal adviser tells me that only two honorable courses of action are open i can either depart the office on the instant or i can hope to continue in a paid capacity with the company i feel that i would only defeat my own purposes if now i withdraw in a fit of pique sensible of course said gersen am i to understand that you plan to cooperate with me that is correct provided that we can come to financial terms the face before i can make an offer i must know more about the com pany its resources commitments and assets understandable said panshaw to start with allow me to tell you this your instincts are superlatively keen i blame myself for folly and vacillation long ago i should have made sure of a controlling interest i neglected to do so and now i must accept the penalty with as good grace as possible gersen listened for that barely perceptible falsity which indi cated a speakers awareness of an eavesdropper he heard nothing if circumstances warrant i will retain your services at an appro priate salary for the moment please produce a comprehensive list of kotzash assets panshaw pursed his lips such a list does not exist we have a few thousand svu in the bank which bank sweechams just along the street what of companies subsidiary to kotzash panshaw hesitated we have working arrangements here and there gersen interrupted let us put an end to this foolishness you are congenitally unable to tell the truth except i suspect under duress i have done a certain amount of research i know of hector transit for instance and i know of the settlement for the ettiha gargantyr where is this money panshaw showed neither discomfort nor embarrassment most of it has gone to pay jarkow pay him for what explorations on shamtra we are making a massive effort why according to reports shanitra carries somewhere a monster lode of duodecimates we have been trying to locate it shamtra carries no duodecimates said gersen the meth len would have won it long ago panshaw gave an urbane shrug new lodes of duodecimates are constantly discovered not on shamtra kotzash is now under my control and i dont want kotzash money wasted stop the explorations at once easier said than done certain phases have already been funded well get a rebate is there a contract he demon princes no ive worked on a basis of trust with jarkow then perhaps hell be reasonable now order an immediate halt panshaw again gave his urbane shrug then rose to his feet and left the office gersen immediately went to the communicator and made contact with jarkows office the decorative image of lully inkelstaff appeared on the screen gersen had blinked off the com municators eye and she looked in vain to see who was calling she spoke jarkow mining who is calling please gersen kept silent after a moment lully nicked off her switch gersen however still controlled the line incoming to the jarkow offices he tapped a code against the microphone to activate his recorder playback first a crackling sound steps as panshaw entered the office and a moment later his own appearance and his initial conversation with panshaw then the sounds of his departure from the office and almost at once panshaws voice into the communicator news at this end bel ruk failed ive ust had a visit from the new control hes got a writ in response came a harsh voice which sent quivers along ger sens nerves who is he he calls himself jard glay ive seen him on dar sai i cant quite recall the circumstances hes an odd fellow i cant make him out a brief silence then again the ominous voice play him easy watch him in a day or two ill have him taken up then well leam who he is it might be better to act at once said panshaw cautiously he could cause trouble suppose he knows of didroxus mining or the hector transit account or theremus he could block us out financially how could he know hector transit is a matter of record on aloysius the accounts are all at sweechams work up a set of transfers dated yesterday kosema will handle the matter without difficulty i can do that easily enough still something about this fellow alarms me there he is now watching me from the corridor let him watch as soon as i show the face ill deal with him but first i must show the face the face very well panshaws voice lacked conviction in the meantime cooperate with him to a point discover what hes after perhaps hell teach us something to our profit in four days or perhaps five well put an end to him as you say gersen tapped a code to his eavesdrop device cut off the com munication then rose to his feit and v ent to the door panshaw should have returned from his visit to room h this time ger sen went back to the communicator and once more called jarkows office this time he allowed lullv to sec his face its i your fiance remember me oh yes but tell me is ottile panshaw in your office he left ust a moment ago thank you lomght at the black barn dont forget i wont gersen left the office descended to the ground floor and went out to the street a hundred feet north he saw a sign sweetchams bank commercial services interworld transfers gersen ran to the bank and entered through tall glass doors an attendant approached sir how may i assist you who is mr kosema that is his office yonder t the moment he is busy the matter concerns me ill ust step over gersen crossed the lobby and entered kosemas ofhce a pink pudgy man with a round face and a pouting pink mouth sat at a desk opposite ottile panshaw he had been frowning down at a paper he looked up with a nervous erk ottile panshaw smiled sadly gersen took the paper from in front of kosema he sav it to be an order transferring funds in the total of s u from accounts described as kotzash theremus kotzash hector transit kotzash s didroxus mining and kotzash wundergast interests the benehciary of the order dated yesterday was the basramp investment company gersen stared at kosema are you participating with ottille panshaw in felonious grand theft the demon princes of course not spluttered kosema i was about to inform mr panshaw that i could not help him how dare you suggest such a thing i could suggest it to the authorities i could show them this order which is on a sweecham form absurd kosemas voice cracked and quavered you have no reason to suspect lack of fidelity gersen gave a sardonic snort look at these documents i am managing director of kotzash yes so it appears well mr panshaw has perhaps failed to inform me panshaw rose to his feet i must be on my way you will wait said gersen sit down if you please panshaw hesitated then resumed his seat mr kosema i now notify you that mr panshaw has no fur ther authority m regard to kotzash moneys i will challenge any drafts which you pay from this moment onward unless they bear my signature kosema gave a curt bow i understand perfectly i assure you yes your unassailable fidelity come along panshaw ottite panshaw followed gersen out to the street a moment he said let us go sit on that bench yonder the two crossed the mall to the park and seated themselves upon a bench you are an amazing man said panshaw i fear that your acts will cost you dearly how so panshaw shook his head i will name no names but i will tell you what i am now about to do in two hours a black arrow packet leaves methel bound for saudal suud i plan to be aboard take my advice and depart aboard the same vessel when a person whose name i cannot bring myself to utter discovers that you have taken almost five million s us of money he regards as his own he will treat you in a way i do not care to think about i am surprised that you warn me panshaw smiled i am a thief a swindler an extortionist i am a thoroughgoing scoundrel but when my selfinterest is not in volved i am apt to be decent even generous i am now taking flight in a panic that this man will blame me for your deeds you will never see me again unless you om me aboard the anvana syntfo otherwise you will be carried a vay to a secret place there you will slowly and carefully be flayed tell me where to find this man i will put an end to him panshaw rose to his feet i dont dare so much he never forgets a wrong as you will learn do not ride in a cab change your hotel every night dont go back to the kotzash office theres nothing there to interest you he chose the office onl because it was next to jarkow did you order jarkow to halt operations my word carries no weight with jarkow tell me where have we met before at rath eileann in the estremont and at the domus do you remember benchmaster dalt ottile panshaw raised his eyes to the sky goodbye he walked rapidly away through the park from life volume iii by unspiek baron bodissey i am constantly startled and often amused by the diverse attitudes toward wealth to be found among the peoples of the oikumene some societies equate affluence with criminal skill for others wealth represents the gratitude of society for the per formance of valuable services my own concepts in this regard are easy and clear and i am sure that the word simplistic will be used by my critics these folk are callow and turgid of intellect i am reassured by their howls and yelps for present purpose i exclude criminal wealth the gar nering of which needs no elaboration and a gamblers wealth which is tinsel in regard then to wealth luxury and privilege are the perquisites of wealth this would appear a notably bland remark but is much larger than it seems if one listens closely he hears deep and far below the mournful chime of inevitability to achieve wealth one generally must thoroughly exploit at least three of the following five attributes a luck b toil persistence courage c selfdenial the face d shortrange intelligence cunning improvisational ability e longrange intelligence planning the perception of trends these attributes are common anyone desiring privilege and luxury can gain the precursory wealth by making proper use of his native competence in some societies poverty is considered a pathetic mis fortune or noble abnegation hurriedly to be remedied by use of public funds other more stalwart societies think of poverty as a measure of the man himself the critics respond what an unutterable ass is this fellow unspiek i am reduced to making furious scratches and crotchets with my pen lionel wistofer in the monstrator am poor i admit it am i then a churl or a noddy i deny it with all the vehemence of my soul i take my bite of seedcake and my sip of tea with the same relish as any paunchy plutocrat with bulging eyes and grease running from his mouth as he engulfs ortolans in brandy krokinole oysters filet of darango fivehorn my wealth is my shelf of books my privileges are my dreams sistie fael in the outlook he moves me to toothchattering wrath he has in flicted upon me personally a barrage of sheer piffle and maundering insult which cries out to the heavens for atonement i will thrust my fist down his loquacious maw better i will horsewhip him on the steps of his club if he has no club i hereby invite him to the broad and conven ient steps of the senior quilldrivers although i must say that the inksters maintain a superior bar and this shall be my choice since after trouncing the old fool i will un doubtedly ask him in for a drink mcfarquhar kenshaw in the gaean thk demon princks the shrubbery behind gersen rustled he ducked fell off the bench in a crouch when he turned his small gun was in his palm the nozzle protruding between first and second fingers a gardener in white coveralls looked at him in wonder sorry i startled you sir not at all said gersen i am a nervous man so i noticed gersen moved to another bench and sat where he could see in all directions he long had felt himself a man apart from all others with a certain destiny often he had known horror and rage and pity but fear when it entered his mind came strangely gersen examined himself with detachment fear had affected tintle daswell tippin ottile panshaw and now himself well why not fear the thought of a flaying with lens larque wielding panak was horrid enough to frighten a corpse gersen sat motionless discouraged and despondent the sources of his mood were clear enough he had become enamored ofjerdian chanseth he envied the methlen their beautiful homes both emotions had broken against his harsh and obsessive purposes like waves breaking against a rock and now with panshaw gone his single link to lens larque had frayed to a broken strand or two one of these strands was jarkow or he could allow himself to be captured and taken to visit lens larque at which thought his skin crawled gersen reviewed the events which had brought him to twanish they led from rath eileann and tintles shade to serjeuz din kelstown and finally to methel he had expended vast exertion but what had he achieved nothing of consequence what had he learned only that lens larque for reasons unknown had engaged jarkow engineers to an unreasonably thorough investigation of the moon shanitra so then he asked himself gloomily what next he had not yet inspected panshaws office which in any event was probably a waste of time indeed panshaw had specifically told him so with no great enthusiasm gersen returned to skohune tower and room sliding back the door he scrutinized the room which already felt disused and dead to capture a man the easiest method was nar cotic gas gersen sniffed the air which smelled fresh enough he checked the door casing for sensors looked along the rug for a hump which might indicate a mine the rug itself might be woven the face of explosive fibers which would upon contact break him into frag ments carefully he entered the room and avoiding the rug sidled to the desk using elaborate precautions he explored panshaws files where he found the various leases enabling certificates licenses and grants which originally had been declared kotzash mutuaps only assets most carried a terse notation written in red ink worth less the shanitra lease awarded kotzash mutual sole and exclu sive rights to explore test develop and exploit all valuable substances present upon the surface or within the interior and prohibited all other persons agencies and entities including manned or unmanned mechanical devices from trespass upon shanitra for the term of the lease which ran for the term of twenty six years interesting thought gersen if not particularly illuminating the key question remained unanswered why would lens larque invest so much time and money on shanitra gersen found nothing more to interest himthe details of pay ments made to jarkow or other engineering firms were nowhere in evidence presumably they resided in a bank computer gersen called sweechams bank and after a series of formalities with which he patiently complied he was rendered the code which controlled kotzash financial records for half an hour gersen studied the information presented to him and in the end knew little more than before although the magnitude of payments made to jarkow came as something of a surprise for over a year kotzash had honored monthly invoices from jarkow in sums ranging from svu to svu the payments then dropped off to svu whatever the search it seemed to be dwindling and phasing out on sudden thought gersen looked into the city directory jar kow engineering must necessarily maintain an equipment yard em ployment and bookkeeping facilities transport docks even a warehouse in the directory under jarkow gersen discovered four entries a residential address for lemuel jarkow another for swiat jar kow jarkow engineering in skohune tower and jarkow corporation yard on gladhorn road gersen put away the directory leaned back on the chair and tried to formulate a plan of action ottile panshaw had served as a the demon princes kind of indicator registering the presence of lens larque as a buoy marks the location of a reef with panshaw gone gersen himself became the key to lens larques whereabouts m the same sense that a stakedout lamb is the key to the presence of a tiger gersen winced far better that he seek out lens larque than that lens larque seek him out the only investigation which seemed even remotely propitious was contained in the question why did lens larque invest so much effort on shanitra jarkow might know but jarkow would certainly tell gersen nothing the melancholy draftsman might also know jarkows em ployees those who had worked on shanitra might know gersen prickling with the need for action jumped to his feet he crossed the room slid the door open a trifle looked up and down the corridor which was empty he descended to the street gladhorn road according to his map angled away from the mall and curved to the northeast a cab swung to the curb and halted as if soliciting his custom gersen continued along the mall and presently glanced over his shoulder the cab old and quite ordinary distinguished only by a faded white stripe around the skirt moved out into the traffic and was gone the driver had been a bulky flatfaced man of uncertain age and unknowable racial background gersen performed a set of procedures designed to frustrate any tracer mechanism which might have been put upon him on glad horn road he stepped into a clothing store where he brought gray twill trousers a pale blue shirt a belted brown jacket and a black cloth cap which he donned on the spot leaving his former gar ments on the premises he went out on the street now in the guise of an artisan gladhorn road curved to the east past small shops and mis cellaneous enterprises rooming houses taverns restaurants dim stores dealing in curios apothecaries barbers public clerks at the outskirts of town gersen came upon the jarkow corporation yard where jarkow maintained his equipment conveyors rotary torches gantrys vertical stabbers thrusts loading pods a pair of mobile cranes to one side stood a row of small buildings the first showed a sign employment office across the doorway hung a second sign no hiring today beyond were a payroll office and tool warehouses then a small landing field on which rested a pair of weatherbearen personnel carriers and a heavy cargo lift for want of a better occupation gersen entered the employ ment office behind a counter sat an old man with a scarred brown face sir i saw the sign said gersen does that mean therell be no hiring tomorrow thats my guess said the clerk were ust closing down a big ob and theres nothing else on the boards in fact weve laid off most of our crew whats the ob you just finished big exploration job up on shanitra did they find anything friend whatever they found im the last man theyd tell gersen turned away and sauntered back out to the street op posite he noticed a ramshackle building decorated with extraordi nary lightning bolts of black and white on a background of brick red the roof supported a large sign as garish as the building itself a crescent moon with a naked girl reclining in the concavity she held aloft a goblet of pale liquid from which floated electric sparks the sign displayed a legend siaruandirers in gersen crossed the street fhe music of a euphonium played with gusto and decision waxed louder as he approached in his tarings across the oikumene gersen had known manv such taverns where he had witnessed many strange events and heard many odd tales not a few of them true he entered a long lowceilinged room heavy with beer mmes in the far corner a hatchetfaced old woman in a gown of black tinsel her skin toned white her hair dyed blue played the eupho nium at the other end was the bar a single slab of petrified wood in between groups of men and a few women sat at wooden tables alone at a table to the back sat a large darsh brooding into a huge tankard of ale gersen went to the bar a shelf to the rear displayed a multitude of beer mugs imprinted with as many emblems gersen saw a num her of familiar labels veigence and true companion from alphanor oblademe and old subtefjaneafi from copus smade oun from smades planet bass ale hmano tuskef ancho steam from earth mahogany select from derdyra edeiff impschen from bogardus ger sen felt himself in the presence of old friends in the spirit of the the demon princes time and place he requested a flask of the local brew hangrys white ale which he found eminently palatable turning he looked around the room at a large trestle table sat a group of men whose conversation identified them as employ ees ofjarkow engineering they had consumed considerable beer and spoke in loud positive voices making no effort to dissemble their opinions told motry that if he wanted me on that mankiller hed have to give me back my swamper and also some kind of shroud to bar the dust he promised and i ran the dingus for a month and got scabs and rednose and all else and then i find that motry gave my swamper to old twaidlander who runs that little trinozzle about two hours a day and never dirties a finger mocrys a strange one you got to handle him right well i dont work for jarkow anymore and i might just ex plain things to motry hes still up on the job with the technician the two of them can blow each other up for all of me gersen took a seat at the table you gentlemen all work for jarkow an instant silence while he was appraised by six pairs of eyes one said curtly not now the jobs washed out so i was told at the hiring office one man said you arrived on the scene about a year late another grumbled you didnt miss much bad food low pay and claude motry for superintendent and no bonus gersen said thoughtfully not much chance of a bonus unless they found a lode of black sand they couldnt find black sand because theres none out there everybody knows that except the rich lunatics who paid the bills gersen suggested maybe they werent looking for black sand maybe not but what else is there to look for another argued even so and irregardless they never did a proper exploration all shallow tunnels no deep probes where theyd hope to find sand is deep and nowhere did we tunnel deep more of a mesh or a network as if they were looking for something shallow the face out in section d we went down a good half mile before we made our horizontals gersen spoke for a round of drinks and the workers gave him their cordial best wishes somewhat to the side sat a young man wearing workmans breeches with a fine green jacket and yellow shoes in a quiet voice to no one in particular he spoke a single word twittle one of the workmen nudged gersen watch this now watch the darsh gersen looked at the darsh who as before sat staring into his beer pfit said the young man in yellow shoes the darsh brought his hand to the tankard and began to flex heavy red fingers prat said the young man the darsh lowered his head between his shoulders but still did not raise his eyes the young man jumped to his feet and went to the door along the street came a stout gentleman with a moony face a pair of glossy mustaches wearing a fine mongrel suit phut said the young man and quickly ran off down the street the darsh jerked to his feet and lumbered out the door the stout gentleman attempted to move aside but the darsh seized him threw him to the ground kicked his round rump poured a mug of beer over his head then slouched off down the street the gentleman in the black suit sat up to stare in perplexity this way and that slowly he rose to his feet shook his head in wonder and continued on his way the workers returned to their conversation the strangest job i ever worked said one ive mined twentysix asteroids and never wasted ten minutes on such a block of pumice all surface scum so i told motry he wouldnt listen he never cared one way or another so long as jarkow paid his wage not jarkow somebody bv the name ofkotzash whatever they had us boring like weevils through cheese and now theyre satisfied at last a newcomer had come to stand by the table dont be too sure we just got finished today laying out ropes ofdexax motry and the technician are arranging the wires once they blast motry says well go back and tunnel some more i asked him motry what i hp dfmon princes in the name of delilahs hind leg are we looking for then i could keep my eyes peeled he ust give me his sarcastic grunt and says when i need your advice ill ask for it take it anyway mr motry i say its free and he says free advice is worth what it costs and how come youre standing here advising instead of work ing because mr motry ive finished my ob then punch out your ticket and take the carrier down to land the job is done for now so i come on down and just now got my pay theres nobody left up there but motry and jarkow and a couple of technicians rigging some kind of radio contact gersen sat a few minutes longer and presently decided that the workmen knew no more about the shamtra project than he did himself he took his leave and returned up gladhorn road the way he had come at the clothing shop he resumed his usual garments and walked along the mall to the commercial hotel before en tering his room he took careful precautions for fear that someone might have visited him leaving an unpleasant surprise he found nothing out of the ordinary he took his lunch in the hotel restaurant hardly noticing what he ate during the last few hours much had occurred but nothing from which he could derive meaningful information he left the restaurant and went out on the mall watching to right and left he saw nothing to threaten him unless was that cab with the white stripe around the skirt the same cab which had accosted him earlier he could not be sure he crossed the mall and went into the park for ten minutes he walked the gravel paths wondering what to do next lens larque was somewhere near at hand perhaps in a space vessel perhaps on methel itself gersens mind had become tired he was bored with his prob lems and saw no way to escape them on impulse he went out to a side street where he signaled down a passing cab one which displayed no faded white stripe around the skirt he told the driver take me out to llalarkno as before the driver made difficulties thats like a big private park the methlen dont like visitors in fact they put probation points against any cab they catch with tourists tm not a tourist said gersen i am an mterworld banker and a man of great importance all very well sir but the methlen draw no such distinction the face gersen produced a fivesvu certificate i am also able to pay the fare as you say sir but if i am approached and notified then you must pay the impositions agreed said gersen take me to oldenwood the chanseth house the glades and dells of llalarkno worked magic upon gersens nerves as he looked off at the halfhidden houses his fears and compulsions began to seem unreal at oldenwood the driver slowed the cab the chanseth res idence sir stop ust a moment said gersen the driver reluctantly obeyed gersen threw open the door and stood up on the boarding flange past a bank of flowering shrubs and a sprawling candlenut tree a lawn sloped down to oldenwood somewhat beyond the house gersen glimpsed a group of young people dressed in white yellow and pale blue they seemed to be watching a game perhaps tennis or badminton played beyond gersens range of vision come sir said the driver in a voice of urgency banker or even mterworld financier they wont like you peering and staring they have a mania for privacy these methlen gersen returned into the cab drive over to moss alrune as you wish sir at moss alrune gersen descended from the cab and despite the drivers anxious protests walked around the grounds appraising the house the meadow which sloped down to the lake the surrounding trees he heard no sound but a faint trilling of insects gersen returned to the cab take me back into twamsh thank you sir gersen alighted at the cannacrux bank where he arranged for the purchase by cooneys bank through its affiliate the canna crux bank of that property known as moss alrune from the estate agent representing cytherea azel from the avatars apprentice in scroll from the ninth dimension on that fateful afternoon the very skies showed por tents a lurid gloom in the east a cloud of meaningful shape over ymmyr marsh in the west since dawns first flush marmaduke had paced the par apets overlooking the horde which cloaked mamnguez plain everywhere showed the flux of sinister purpose along shadim road manciples drove their warwagons cham river could not be seen for barges loaded with en gines tormentors and gibbets halfway up the yar swarmed the multitudes from north to south their beacons flashed at last holy bermssus in stately robes stepped out upon the parapets he raised high his arms m benign salute but the hordes expressed a hateful sound which mingling from all quarters produced the dull wavering roar of stormy surf bermssus shook his head in sorrow and drew somewhat back for moments he gazed across the plain stroking his beard marmaduke reverently came forward holy sir it seems that we two stand alone against this vindictive mul titude bernissus uttered words it is well marmaduke stood back in perplexity most excellent the face illuminate my ignorance if you will how may we find sat isfaction in these lonely conditions bernissus spoke words in good time all will be made known i am grateful for the assurance said marmaduke in sheer truth this odious horde has unnerved me feltaw cannot prevail were the words even though he has wrought a great and busy mischief holy appodex allow me to enumerate the victims of his cruel hoax of the horde now pullulating across the plain all are either devanants or oblatics with the excep tion of ten thousand cathars many know syllables of the unspeakable name yonder stand the purple myrmidons yonder the hypogrotes oflissam yonder the glames who at least show us the etiquette of facing forward inasmuch as they go into battle with naked backsides the swans of porving cluster around their magnates they menace us with standards on high i recognize obus of thraw vil nisser the red cockatrice pleighborn flynch and sand sifer of hutt not ten days ago they burned blue incense at fanes along the wayvode once more bernissus moved forward to stand in maj esty the wind blowing back his robes and white beard rais ing arms on high he issued a slogan which whirled down manmguez plain and broke against the yar in flashes of lightning the enemy quailed but presently took courage and thrust high their standards they shouted the de cretals must be altered we nominate felfaw for the col umn bermssus falsest of the false must be cast down bermssus spoke gentle words not all are malign in this case bad leads good the swords of both sorts are long and sharp declared marmaduke i fear that these noble parapets must burst asunder with only the two of us on defense where are the faithful where helgebort and the indefatigables where nish and nesso and little mouse wtiere the vervils their destinies lie elsewhere were the words they are the cadres they will teach and counsel they will declaim the panticles and prepare the onset of the second realm so let it be i hp dlmonprinos blessed bernissus what must be my role in the days to come each plays his part i go now to the oratory to devise an irresistible slogan to send these poorackals reeling for the nonce you must patrol the parapets post high the stan dards dislodge ladders defy the foe i will do all needful declared marmaduke staunchly but beneficence make haste the enemy awaits only the sign all will be well with deliberate tread bernissus de scended to the sacred chamber the sign came down the legions gave a tremendous yell and advanced upon the parapets marmaduke called into the passage beloved bernis sus the sign has come down from achernar the legions are upon us their swords are thricehoned steel they carry lances catapults and warhooks they raise ladders to scale the parapets i have posted the standards my slogans have created havoc but i am one against eight hundred thou sand i will necessarily be cut into minute pieces as each warrior vents his zeal upon my single corpse ineffable the time is at hand marmaduke listened but heard no response anxiously he descended the passage and called the holy name but his voice rang hollow through empty chambers down to the uttermost foundations he went and through a seephole crawled out upon the marsh he fled to the north and pres ently overtook bermssus who with robes gathered high and with thewed legs thrusting back the mire made pon derous but steady progress north toward warram forest gersen descended from his room to the lobby of the hotel and looked out the front windows into the street three cabs stood at the curb apparently waiting for custom the first which showed a weathered white stripe around the skirt was driven by a swarthy flatfaced man with black curls and ears clipped to points gersen seated himself where he could watch the street a man and a woman left the hotel fhey approached the first cab but were refused service they tried the second and then the the face third with similar results and finally hailed a cab cruising along the street three cabs in a row each equipped with a tank of narcogen possible thought gersen quite possible indeed he stepped from the front door and stood a moment before the hotel as if in cogitation from the corner of his eye he noticed that all three drivers had become alert gersen paid them no heed he crossed the mall and walked into the park from behind a copse of snuffbrush he watched the cabs the first remained in place the second and third slid hurriedly away around the mall gersen returned to tlie mall a hundred yards west of the hotel where he nagged down a passing cab definitely not one of those which had been waiting in front of the hotel take me to the black barn said gersen the cab swung about and instead of climbing the incline toward llalarkno turned south and out into the country the black barn stood m the middle of a field a half mile from town a circular building with low plank wall and a vast conical roof surmounted by a black iron weathervane in the shape of a crowing rooster lully inkelstaff had not yet arrived the sun sank behind the far hills leaving a sky of tangerine and gold and now lully inkelstaff appeared wearing a blackand white gown with a great puff of red gauze pinning the blond curls at the back of her head she greeted gersen with a cheerful wave of the hand i dont think im too late ust a few minutes perhaps which is quite good for me have you been inside not yet i thought id better wait here for you just as well its so easy to miss connections it happens shame fully often and must i admit u im usually to blame shall we go ln i think youll be amused everyone likes the black barn even the methlen theyre always here in force wait till you see their strange dancing but come lully took gersens arm with an almost affectionate cordiality as if they had been friends for years if were m luck my favorite table will be waiting for us they passed through a pair of ironbound plank doors and into a foyer furnished with dilapidated old farm implements to right and left were stalls from which protruded the heads of simulated farm animals a ramp led down into the main chamber past a pair of rickety old wains hundreds of tables encircled the dance floor with a the demon princes bandstand to the back now occupied by a pair of musicians in an imal costumes playing tamboura and oboe lullv led the way to a table which gersen found no different from any other but at which lully settled herself with an excla mation of happy satisfaction youll think me silly but this is my good luck table ive had such merry times here were sure to have a wonderful evening you make me nervous said gersen perhaps i wont match up to the occasion then youll be annoyed with both me and the table im sure not said lully ive decided that we shall enjoy ourselves and the table had best mind its manners definitely a brisk and determined young woman thought ger sen best that he also mind his manners lully cocking her head to one side seemed to divine something ofgersens misgivings she said breezily on the other hand trag edy might stalk us anything is possible we might fall down while were dancing dancing inquired gersen in alarm lully seemed not to hear and then id simply have to try another table until this one decided that the old ways were best are you hungry yes indeed so am i let me order because i know exactly whats good by all means said gersen whatever you wish first well have a dish of relishes and some pickled smelt then chipes with black sauce with a double dish of ramp savouries and cottrell cutlets does that suit you perfectly the chirret is very good here but perhaps you prefer beer what is chirret its a very nice damson cider and not at all strong sometimes folk make such fools of themselves trying to dance after drinking black barn beer chirret then by all means although as to the dancing lully already was signaling a waitress like all the other waiters and waitresses she wore festival peasant costume a voluminous blackandgreen blouse over a blue skirt with red stockings and black gaiters lully ordered decisively specifying exactly how the dishes should be prepared and served almost immediately the wait the face ress brought a jug of chirret and next dishes of nuts salted sea flakes and pickled smelt were early said lully the crowd hasnt really arrived in an hour therell be almost too much activity and well hardly find room to dance first well eat and talk tell me all about yourself and the places youve been gersen laughed uneasily i hardly know where to start anywhere will do ive become interested in eidolology and i cant at all understand your skarmatics theyre contradictory you would seem an unusual man to the contrary im very ordinary clumsy and awkward as well i dont believe a word of it incidentally have you decided to settle here at twanish i do hope so gersen smiled thoughtfully reflecting upon moss ahune sometimes im tempted to do so lully sighed it must be wonderful to travel the stars ive never been anywhere how many worlds have you visited i dont know exactly ive never counted dozens and dozens at least im told that every world is different that spacemen even if they dont know where they are can look at the sky smell the air and instantly pronounce the name of the planet can you do that sometimes but id be fooled as often as not tell me about yourself do you have brothers and sisters three of each im the oldest and the first to take a job ive never before considered marriage ive always had such jolly times it seemed a shame to change gersens sensitive antennae quivered and jerked he became more uneasy than ever i also intend to avoid marriage for the foreseeable future tell me about your job lully wrinkled her nose it was nicer before the kotzash job i liked old mr lemuel jarkow very well indeed mr swiatjarkow is not above making himself familiar do many darsh come in to see mr jarkow not many very few in fact perhaps a large darsh came in with mr ottile panshaw lully pursed her lips shrugged i dont remember is it im portant ive seen mr panshaw somewhere before i think on dar sai the demon princes very likely kotzash was originally a darsh company these are such mysterious questions in fact youre a mysterious man i wouldnt be surprised if you were with ipcc are you of course not if i were id hardly be allowed to advertise it to the first pretty girl who asked thats true still you certainly dont seem an ordinary tech nician when im offduty my personality changes said gersen in a strained attempt at facetiousness lully examined him with great intentness why have you never married has no one ever selected you gersen shook his head i wouldnt dare ask anyone to the kind of life i lead after a thoughtful moment lully said attwanish its custom ary for the woman to suggest marriage to the man which is only proper etiquette its different elsewhere so im told yes thats quite true gersen sought for some way to change the subject i see some darsh over by the entrance do they come to the black barn of course theyre asked to sit over yonder under the ven tilator where their odor wont offend anyone lully watched the two darsh sidling across the room theyre almost barbarians they never dance but just hunch over their tables gulping food where do the methlen sit over beside the bandstand they usually come in carnival cos tumes its a rather foolish fashion with them such a strange folk always playing games acting out parts pretending and sky larking no doubt its great fun if youre wealthy and live in lla larkno i should think so would you like to marry a methlen small chance in fact id never dare to ask one theyre ever so persnickety dont you agree yes indeed they have their own customs of course but no real etiquette would you marry a methlen girl if she asked you it depends on the girl said gersen his mind elsewhere he hurriedly amplified his remarks naturally i dont expect to marry anyone lully gave his arm a little pat of admonishment youve got a good job now its time that you settled yourself the face gersen smilingly shook his head im definitely of the wrong temperament look there comes the orchestra lully glanced at the musicians its denzel and his seven barnswallows a most peculiar name since they are only five i dont like it when things are misrepresented still they are quite proficient especially at steptoes and prances wtiat are your favorite dances i dont know any dances whatever how odd no patterns no jigs no gallops not even a slow march we certainly must remedy that its simply shameful i could never ask you for marriage lully broke into laughter on the other hand i might go lame then where would i be with a jigging husband here comes our food and we dont want to think of marriage on empty stomachs the orchestra consisting of flatsoon basspipe guitar dimple horn and tympanillo struck up a tune and folk went forth to dance the multiplicity of their techniques amazed gersen to the first tune they performed an intricate whirling reel punctuated by kicks and leaps to the next tune they coursed back and forth in a hopping loosekneed glide to the third tune they practiced a series of evolutions ending with four dancers backs pressed together and arms thrown back performing a highkneed runninginplace ex ercise gersen commented upon the versatility of the dancers lully looked at him with wideeyed wonder i forgot that youre not a dancer we do dozens of steps its considered hacky to dance the same step twice wouldnt you like to learn a simple little polka well no not really kirth gersen youre really a shy man its time someone took you in hand i think that well just prescribe dancing lessons for you starting tomorrow gersen sought for an adequate reply but was distracted by the arrival of a group of methlen as lully had remarked most of them wore pierrot costume with pompons on their white hats and long slippers with turnedup toes they trooped gaily to that area re served for their patronage presently some came out to dance keeping well apart from the mongrels they used a variety of steps dancing in pairs in a fashion far less energetic than the mode of the mongrels i hf demon princes gersen scanned the group but saw no one he recognized meanwhile lully talked or this and that pointing out acquaintances explaining dance techniques commenting upon the delicacy of the chipes and the excellence of the smelt gersen tried to divert the conversation tojarkows office with little success at the conclusion of the meal with the orchestra playing a merry tune and the dancers performing an intricate interweaving at a fast skipping pace lully became restless she turned shining eyes upon gersen tomorrow evening ill teach you this step gersen shook his head i cant possibly be on hand lully spoke in a reproachful voice you are seeing another girp of course not scoffed gersen i have a business appoint ment then the next night ill prepare a little supper and we can make a good start id make a poor student said gersen in fact i suffer from dizzy fits dancing would certainly bring them on you are joking with me said lully sadly you are seeing another woman there can be no reasonable doubt gersen searched for new excuses but was interrupted by the arrival of one of lullys friends a young man wearing a stylish suit of tan and black why arent you dancing he asked lully the orchestra is at its best my friend doesnt dance said lully what surely he wouldnt want you to waste your evening come theyre starting stampede of the gollnvogs do you mind lully asked gersen not at all lully and her friend went briskly out upon the floor and soon were participating earnestly in the dance gersen watched a mo ment without great interest his mind wandered he leaned back in his chair contemplating the stagnant state of his affairs doubts indecisions reverses hindered him everywhere he had lost the initiative against lens larque who indeed was now moving against gersen himself the danger had become imminent so far he had evaded the rather casual attempts to capture him no doubt they would become more direct if lens larque grew impatient a silver of glass projected from across the street would instantly abate the the face nuisance created by gersens activities as of now lens larque would seem only irked and resentful gersen might expect possibly another day before lens larque set to work in earnest gersens reverie was interrupted by the arrival of a second group of methlen he wondered if jerdian had returned to lla larkno and he wondered if he would see her almost as he thought her name she turned and he saw her face like her friends she wore carnival costume a snug white garment covering her from neck to feet with blue pompons down the front eccentric slippers and a conical white hat topped by a pale blue pompon pulled at a tilt halfway down across her dark curls she looked so fresh and appealing and innocently gay that gersens heart rose up in his throat without troubling to think he rose to his feet and crossed the room she turned her head and saw him for a moment they looked eye to eye her party had now started off across the room jerdian hesitated darted a quick glance after her friends then came to where gersen stood in the shadows she spoke in a husky whisper wtiat are you doing here for one thing ive been hoping to see you gersen put his hands under her arms drew her close and kissed her after a mo ment she disengaged herself and drew back i thought id never see you again gersen laughed and i knew that you would do you love me stilp yes of course i dont know what to tell you can you leave your group and go off with me now it wouldnt be possible id cause a scandal she looked across the room in a moment my escort will come to find me hell think youve gone to the rest room perhaps so what an undignified pretext for meeting a secret lover can i meet you later tonight when youve left here jerdian shook her head were planning a midnight supper for guests i couldnt possibly escape then tomorrow at noon very well but where you cant come to oldenwood my fa ther would be ungracious in front of moss alrune on the side facing the lake the demon princfs she looked at him in surprise we cant meet there its a private property nevertheless its vacant and no one will molest us very well then ill be there she looked over her shoulder now i must go again she looked over her shoulder quick she stepped close to him and raised her face they embraced ger sen kissed her once twice then breathless and halflaughing she pulled away until tomorrow noon she went quickly off after her party gersen turning met the shocked and unfriendly gaze of lully inkelstaff just emerging from the passage leading to the ladies rest room wordlessly she swept off to the table she had shared with gersen snatched up handbag and cloak and marched away to join her friends gersen gave a rueful shrug at the very least ive avoided tomorrows dancing lesson gersen paid off the score and departed the black barn to one side a half dozen cabs awaited passengers the cab first in line carried a faded white stripe along the skirt gersen casually turned away and stood as if awaiting someone from within how had he been tracked to the black barn had he been tagged with a tracer perhaps a daub of stuff which in response to a search ray returned a signal tonight he would scrupulously bathe and change all his clothes tonight if he arrived at his hotel alive most definitely he would use none of the cabs along the rank gersen sauntered slowly back and forth with an air of a man preoccupied arriving at an area where he could no longer see the cabs he ran off down the road to twanish the night was clear and dark constellations strange to gersen hung in the sky and showed the road as a pale ribbon with dark fields to either side as gersen ran his body seemed to come alive his whole soul expanded this was the existence he was meant for and where he felt easy running through the night across a strange world with danger behind and himself the very embodiment of retaliatory danger his vapors and dreary misgivings were gone he felt the gersen of old against the sky loomed a tall copse of trees gersen stopped short to listen from the black barn now almost a quarter mile distant he heard the whisper of music and saw the lights of a cab gersen looked to the side of the road op posite the trees he saw a shallow ditch and beyond a clump of weeds he jumped the ditch and flung himself flat behind the weeds the cab came at speed lights blazing along the road coming to the dfmon princfs abreast of the trees the cab stopped abruptly almost beside gersen but the attention of the driver and occupants was fixed upon the trees not the clump of weeds which barely concealed gersen the driver spoke in a soft voice hes not down the road he couldnt have come much farther from the compartment stepped three men gersen could see only their silhouettes in the glow reflected back from the headlights the driver spoke again hes hiding in the trees unless he took to the fields one of the passengers a short squat man spoke in a plangent bass turn so the lights shine into the trees the driver did so backing the cab almost into the ditch the short squat man said ang around to the right dotty around to the left keep out of the light get him alive thats important bird wants him alive gersen rose up from behind the weeds soundlessly he jumped the ditch climbing the two steps to the control booth he thrust his addertongue stiletto into the nape of the drivers neck pincers cut the vertebral nerve inducing instant death gersen lowered the corpse into the footspace and seated himself at the controls the short man stood in the road to the left of the cab a man with whom gersen wanted earnest and candid conversation three minutes passed gersen sat with his silver pistol in hand waiting ang and dofty emerged from the trees they walked for ward into light from the cab ang a crooked angular young man with a long highbridged nose and a short black beard dotty burly and babyfaced with eyes peering through slits gersen had often met their like beyond in disreputable backstreet taverns or working at their trade as now the short squat man took an impatient step forward noth ing hes not there said ang gersen waited until the two were close in front of the cab then with neither qualm nor compunction he discharged his weapon once twice driving splinters of explosive glass through the fore heads of ang and dotty and once again at the short mans elbow as he spun around the short mans gun dropped upon the road gersen umped down from the drivers seat im the man youre looking for the face the short man said nothing but stared at gersen his face con torted in pain gersen spoke in the most casual of voices have you ever seen a man die by cluthe no yes you can choose cluthe or ill shoot you in the head which shoot whispered the short man then answer my questions if you had caught me what were you to do with me bind you with tape and take you to a shed then what i would call for instructions who gives you instructions the short man merely stared gersen stepped forward his hand in a glove he raised his hand extended his arm quick the bird lens larque you said the name where is he now i dont know i take my orders by radio from the direction of the black barn came new lights the short man lunged toward gersen who shot him accurately in the forehead gersen carefully replaced the fearful glove in its socket then turning away saw in the reflected light a weathered white stripe around the base of the cab he ran oft down the road toward twanish the cab from the black barn finding its way obstructed halted gersen pausing to look back over his shoulder saw the driver and occupants alight to stare in horror at the corpses at the capricorn cafe overlooking redemption park halfway be tween the commercial hotel and skohune tower gersen sat with a pot of tea assessing the events of the evening his mood he was pleased to note had become less troubled activity had flushed the stagnant channels of his mind the four killings he regretted only that he had teased so little information from the short man he thought ofjerdian and felt a warm excitement he thought oflully and laughed aloud under lullys desk at jarkow engineering reposed the recording apparatus he had installed so short a time before directed into the kotzash office it now served no purpose the demon princes much more advantageous if it could record conversations at jar kows office gersen looked toward skohune tower which at this hour showed only the dim illumination of night bulbs gersen finished his tea he went to the hotel picked up his bag of equipment returned to the street and sauntered across the park to skohune tower the lobby was empty he rode the ascen sor to the third floor and using his key to room entered the offices ofjarkow engineering just inside the door he halted to listen no sound no indication of human presence he stepped into lullys cubicle where he found and detached the recorder unit optimally so he decided the sound probe should be located in jarkows office gersei installed the microphone under jarkows desk where he discovered a set of implements which startled him gersen recalled an old aphorism he who sups with the devil should use a long spoon jarkow working as he did with lens larque had installed several versions of the long spoon where it could help him most gersen worked quickly and efficiently and in half an hour ar ranged the system to his satisfaction with the recorder attached to the kotzash telephone and microphones at vantage places around the room he packed his tools and started to leave but at the draftmans office stopped short he opened the door and looked in to find the usual paraphernalia plotting machines superficial in tegrators automatic scnbers a pattern library work in process lay spread out on a table page after page of charts columns and rows of figures each page carried a notation section a section b with the last page labeled section f under the table gersen saw a pair of peculiar obects the first an irregular mass of chalky sub stance about a foot in diameter the surface had been marked off into approximately one hundred areas each labeled in black ink after the same scheme as the pages had been labeled the second obect was an expanded replica of the first made of a light trans parent substance and similarly limned into small areas under the surface ran a myriad scarlet threads curving bending twisting humping in no obvious order or pattern most odd thought gersen he picked up the object looked at it this way and that most odd most curious gersen gave a sudden cry of uncontrollable laughter was such remarkable and magnificent foolishness possible he the face thought back across the months and a hundred items of informa tion suddenly ranged themselves into coherent order gersen replaced the transparent object he took his case and left the offices ofjarkow engineering he had achieved his purpose conversations to be recorded in jarkows office could not fail but be interesting without incident gersen returned to the hotel the tattletale he had arranged on the door to his room was in place and undis turbed gersen entered closed and locked the door bathed and went to bed gersen spent a restless night faces floated through his mind lens larque the caricatures drawings and blurred photograph poor broken tintle and his spouse daswell tippm ottile panshaw bel ruk lully inkelstaff jerdian chanseth in the morning gersen ordered breakfast up to his room then assailed by doubts ate none of it dressing with care he descended to the ground floor slipped out upon the mall went to the cap ricorn cafe and there took his breakfast today was to be an im portant day at noon to moss alrune and jerdian later who knows possibly a meeting with lens larque he returned to the hotel and went up to his room the tattletale had been disturbed putting his ear to the door gersen heard a set of odd sounds with the most exaggerated delicacy he slid the door aar to find a cham bermaid setting his room to rights he entered bade her good morning a few minutes later she withdrew gersen immediately went to the telephone he called the kotzash office and activated the recording device to his ear came those four conversations which had been recorded that morn ing first a call from zerus belsamt of stellar fortress security association requesting conversation with mr jarkow sorry said lully in a pert voice mr jarkow is not present when do you expect him i dont know sir perhaps tomorrow please mention that i called and ill try again tomorrow very ell sir next to be heard was a call from jarkow inquiring for ottile panshaw he hasnt been in sir what jarkows tone was sharp has he left a message the demon princes not a word no ones called but a mr zerus belsaint who wants to consult you a mr zerus who mr zerus belsaint of the stellar fortress security association may i tell him when youll be able to see him ill be in this afternoon late but i wont talk with belsaint hell have to wait if panshaw calls have him come to the office and dont let him leave yes sir gersen next listened to lullys private conversation with a friend where he learned more than he cared to know lully de scribed her previous evenings adventures using images and meta phors which gersen found unflattering and with a methlen girl would you believe it lullys voice was pitched in tones of outrage i cant imagine what sort of a man he is i gave him a most awful look simply withered him then i went off with nary we danced three suites and a great gallop and thats not all on the way home we came upon a frightful murder in fact four murders of a cab driver and three passengers they lay around the road like so many dog carcasses ive had a night i wont forget who was the methlen girl that giddy chanseth bit you see her everywhere yes i know of her the conversation ended and the final call came through from motry jarkows works superintendent mr jarkow please hes not here yet hell be in later today im just down from shanitra i called in to report final check out he can pass the word on to his principals will you give him the message certainly mr motry dont forget now naturally i wont forget in fact ill put a note on his desk this minute thats the system quite proper my girl ill look into the office tomorrow morning very good mr motry ill tell mr jarkow thereafter the line was dead gersen sat back in the chair and reflected today must be the day he looked out the window the weather was cool with coralight slanting down from an autumnal sky the uplands of llalarkno showed indistinct through haze the the face town the park the entire landscape seemed suffused with a mel ancholy serenity which gersen found consonant with his own mood problems had been solved mysteries had revealed them selves to an effect so ludicrous cruel and wild that gersens mind veered away gersen considered the conversations he had overheard jarkow expected important visitors during the afternoon who could they be his thoughts shifted to jerdian chanseth and brought him a twinge of hollow uncertainty what would she be thinking now this very instant gersen so astute crafty and resourceful found himself besieged by doubts and anxieties he saw her as he had seen her first in her dark green frock and dark green stockings the dark hair curling over her ears and across her forehead her only notice of him had been a haughty glance how different now their rela tionship gersens heart melted within him he checked the time less than an hour to noon not too early to set out for moss almne gersen considered the cabs waiting nearthe hotel unlikely that any of these could be considered threats nevertheless he crossed the park and flagged down a cab cruising the street as always he discovered resistance and the driver consented to the journey only when gersen agreed to sit far back in the shadow of the interior where he could not be seen in the road by moss alrune gersen alighted and paid the fare the driver wasted no time in departing gersen walked back along the road to the entrance arch great trees of a type unknown to him overhung the stone wall and cast a dapple shade the air was still and silent to right and left of the arch stone pillars supported the busts of nymphs cast in bronze their eyes looked unseeingly down at him he passed under the arch and into the grounds the driveway curved up to a broad portico beyond a path led off around the house into the gardens where gersen so far had not explored he walked among confections of flowering shrubs and carefully groomed trees and presently came to a low stone wall on the other side spread the grounds of oldenwood gerson looked out across the lawn now occupied by a pair of small darkhaired girls naked except for white skimmer hats decorated with flowers they saw gersen and paused to stare their frolicking became more se date presently they ran off to a more secluded area the demon princes gersen turned back the way he had come wondering if ever his own children would run so blissfully across the lawns of moss alrune he went around to the front of the house on the steps satjerdian looking pensively across the water she rose to her feet he put his arms gently around her and kissed her she acquiesced without fervor for a few minutes they stood then gersen said have you spoken of me to your family jerdian laughed sadly my father does not think well of you he hardly knows me shall i go talk to him oh no hed be frigid i really dont know what to say all last night i thought about you and myself and all this morning im still confused ive been thinking too i see three possible courses we can take leave of each other finally and forever or you can come away with me now if you like tomorrow well leave methel and go off across space jerdian sighed and gave her head a slow dismal shake you dont know what it is to be methlen im a part of llalarkno just as if i had grown here like a tree id be forever lonely away from my home no matter how much i loved you or i could stay here on methel and make my home here with you jerdian looked at him dubiously would you really do that for mer i have no other home llalarkno appeals to me why shouldnt i live here jerdian smiled ruefully its not all that simple outworlders arent often made welcome if ever were very exclusive as im sure you know ive already arranged that part of it we already own a home here on methel gersen nodded moss alrune i bought it yesterday jerdian looked at him in amazement the price was a million svtj i thought you well a poor adventurer a spaceman so i am after a fashion but hardly poor i could buy a dozen moss alrunes and not even notice it im bewildered i hope you dont think the worse of me for not being poor the face no not really youre more of a mystery than ever why did you risk your life fighting that great darsh at hadaul because it had to be done but why tomorrow ill tell you everything today the time isnt quite right she looked at him searchingly youre not a criminal or a pirate im not even a banker jerdian looking past gersen became rigid a furious voice called out hoy there fellow what are you doing here jerdian whatever is this without waiting for an answer adario chanseth signaled to a pair of burly footmen take this fellow and pitch him into the street the footmen advanced confidently a moment later one lay facedown in a flower bed the other sat nearby numbly holding his bleeding face gersen said you threw me out of your bank mr chanseth but this is my properly and i dont care to be molested wtiat do you mean your property i bought moss alrune yesterday chanseth uttered a harsh laugh you bought nothing very much have vou read the llalarkno charter no then you are in for a surprise llalarkno is a private domain and retains basic own ership in perpetuity you bought no title you bought what is in effect a lease which must be validated by the llalarkno trustees i am one of these i dont want your outlander face hanging over my garden wall staring at my children no more than id tolerate that darsh blackguard gersen looked at jerdian who stood with her hands twisting and tears running down her cheeks chanseth glanced at her so thats the way of it eh a romantic drama well put the role away and out of your head youre a wayward little creature your imag ination leads you into situations which you cant control the drama is over here you must stop it is time you were learning propriety go home at once just a moment said gersen he went to jerdian and stood looking down into her tearstained face you dont need to obey him you can come with me if you choose to do so jerdian said in a low voice hes probably right im a methlen the demon princes and ill never be anything else i suppose i might as well face up to it goodbye kirth gersen gersen bowed stiffly goodbye he turned to adano chan seth who stood stonily nearby but could find no words to express his feelings he turned on his heel strode down the drive passed under the arch and the bronze nymphs gazed down with blind eyes the road was empty gersen walked southward toward twan ish with the grounds of oldenwood to his right he turned a single glance across the sloping lawn the two little girls now wearing frocks noticed his passage and paused in their play to watch ger sen continued through the quiet woods at last down the slope to the mall and around to the capricorn cafe he felt hungry thirsty tired and depressed he threw himself down at a table and made a meal of bread and meat then sat with a pot of tea staring across the park the episode had run its course emotions hopes gallant re solves all past and gone like sparks on the wind the pattern gersen reflected was that of a simple tragicomedy in two acts tensions conflicts confrontations on dar sai a brief interlude while the settings were shifted a surge to the climax at moss alrune the dynamic thrust to the production had been pro vided by gersens folly how absurd to think of himself against the bucolic background of moss alrune participating in the methlen frivolities no matter what his wistful yearnings he was kirth ger sen obsessed by inner imperatives which might never be satisfied the drama was ended the tensions had resolved the matters at conflict had settled into equilibrium with a ponderous lurching finality gersen managed a bitter smile as he sipped his tea jerdian would not suffer very long or very painfully gersen rose to his feet and went to the hotel he bathed changed into spacemans gear he called his recording device and heard another of lullys personal calls to a nary balbroke and another call from jarkow again inquiring after ottile panshaw in a sharper voice than before hes not called mr jarkow very strange hes not in the office next door the office has been empty all day sir very well i wont be m until late afternoon ive got some important business you go home at your usual time if panshaw calls leave me a note the face yes mr jarkow gersen switched off the communicator he looked at his chro nometer lully would presently be leaving the office gersen made his preparations checking and recheckmg with meticulous patience satisfied at last he departed the hotel and walked across the park arriving at skohune tower ust in time to see lully trot briskly out upon the street and march off up the mall gersen went into the building rode the ascensor to the third floor and went directly to room he put his ear to the door no sound inserting his key he slid the door open and surveyed the interior the rooms were empty he stepped into the reception room and closed the door he went tojarkows office and looked inside empty as before gersen crossed the hall to the drafting room and seated himself to the side he waited half an hour passed the shafts of coralight en tering by the west windows began to approach the horizontal gersen grew tense the seconds went past with an almost au dible thudding he became tired of sitting he went to stand where he could look through the glass partition both toward the outer door and by turning his head into jarkows office the situation was not to his satisfaction he felt overly conspicuous closing the door he dropped to his knee and with his knife cut a small slit m the lower panel allowing him a slantwise view intojarkows office steps in the hall gersen listened a single man whoever might be jarkows important visitor he had not yet arrived the door slid back into the outer orfice stepped jarkow ger sen standing behind a cabinet watched through a niche in a stack of books jarkow came into the office carrying a small case he stopped looked into lullys cubicle scowled an ugly harshlooking man thought gersen rendered even more so by his elaborate blond hair piece but by no means a man to be taken lightly muttering under his breath jarkow went heavyfooted to his office gersen dropped to his knees and out ot sight looking through a slit gersen saw jarkow go to his desk where he opened the case and brought out a black box surmounted by an amber button jarkow placed the box in the precise center of the demon princes his desk then went to sit in his chair he leaned back turned to look moodily out of the window across the park toward llalarkno gersen stepped out of his hiding place and into the halljarkow heard a sound he jerked about to see gersen entering his office his heavy eyebrows lowered his yellowgray eyes became narrow for a moment he and gersen stared at each other gersen took three slow steps forward so that he stood almost in front of the desk finally jarkow spoke well who are you my name is kirth gersen have you ever heard of me jarkow gave his head a jerk i know something of you i took kotzash away from panshaw i instructed him to halt all proceedings on shanitra presumably he notified you jarkow nodded slowly he did so indeed why have you gone to such effort to begin with i wanted the kotzash money yesterday i transferred almost five million svu to my own account jarkows eyes narrowed even further in that case i will render my bill to you dont trouble yourself jarkow seemed not to hear the remark he took the black box from the center of his desk and moved it to the window ledge beside his chair so what do you want with me a few moments conversation are you expecting company perhaps well have time for a chat let me tell you something about myself i was born at a place called mount pleasant which was subsequently destroyed by a syndicate of slavers one of the group was a certain lens larque a murderer thief and general black guard this lens larque is darsh and originally bore the name husse bugold he became an outcast a rachepol and lost an ear his other ear he lost only recently at tintles shade in rath ei leann how do i know i cut it off myself madame tintle probably cooked it into next days ahagaree in jarkows eyes yellow lights were flickering he rose suddenly to his feet in a wellmodulated voice he said your language of fends me inasmuch as i myself am lens larque i am aware of this said gersen i have come to kill you lens larque reached under the lip of his desk we shall see who kills whom first i will break your legs he squeezed but no the face answering fan of power spurted forth gersen had disconnected the circuitry during his visit lens larque muttered a guttural curse and from his pocket drew a weapon gersen fired his own pistol exploded the weapon out of lens larques hand lens larque roared in pain lurching around the desk he threw himself forward gersen swept up a chair thrust it into lens larques face lens larque thrust it aside with a sweep of bullstrong arms gersen stepped close kneed lens larques abdomen slapped the back of lens larques neck with his right hand he stepped back ducked a massive blow then kicked lens larques knee pulled him off balance and sent him sprawling to the floor where the blond hairpiece fell away to reveal a ridged skinbald scalp and vacant earholes gersen leaned on the edge of the desk and pointed his pistol at lens larques midriff you are about to die i wish i could kill you a dozen times panshaw betrayed me panshaw is gone said gersen he betrayed no one then how did you know me i saw your face in the other room i know your plan and why you used kotzash all to no avail lens larque clenched his muscles and tried to seize gersens feet but performed only a feeble cramped movement he stared up at gersen wtiat have you done to me i have poisoned you with cluthe the back of your neck is now burning your arms and legs are already paralyzed in ten minutes you will be dead as you die think of the harm you have inflicted upon innocent people lens larque gasped the box yonder give it to me no i take pleasure in thwarting your plans remember mount pleasant there you killed my father and my mother take the box whispered lens larque pull the guard back press the button no said gersen never lens larque began to thrash across the floor as his viscera knotted and cramped gersen went to the reception room and waited the minutes passed the sounds continued as lens larques muscles coiled knotted and pulled in different directions his breath came in stertorous gasps after nine minutes he lay the demon princes twisted in a grotesque contortion at ten minutes he ceased to breathe and a minute later he was dead gersen sitting on the reception chair drew a deep breath and released it he felt old sad and tired time passed gersen rose to his feet went back into that room he had known asjarkows office twilight was deepening to night over llalarkno rose the moon shanitra in its full phase gersen picked up the black box he held it a moment weighing it feeling its power contrary impulses thrust at him he remem bered adario chanseths austere face gersen laughed mirthlessly lens larque had labored long to achieve his most sardonic trick should such toil and expense be wasted especially since gersen shared all of lens larques motivations no said gersen of course not he slid back the guard sleeve and put his finger on the amber button he pushed the surface of shanitra erupted chunks fell away with majestic deliberation fragments sprayed in different directions a cloud of dust created a nimbus glowing in the coralight the dust dissipated the disrupted material settled into new configurations the irregular surface of shanitra had now taken on the similitude of lens larques face the earlobes long the scalp bald the mouth twisted into a leer of idiotic mirth gersen went to the communicator he called oldenwood and was put into contact with adario chanseth chanseth peered at the screen who is calling go out into your back garden said gersen theres a great darsh face hanging over the garden wall gersen broke the connection he left skohune tower and went to the hotel where he paid his bill and departed a cab took him to the spaceport he went out to his fantamic flitterwing climbed aboard and departed the planet methel from the book of dream raise your eyes stranger to that ageworn rampart which confronts all else there stand the paladins stern grave serene each is one each is all at the center is imrrur of the graces he

grounds though of all the paladins he can be most generous he lusts after fair women and they deny him at great risk to their dignity should they make complaint or give chiding his redress is even more fulsome when finally he lea es the demon princes the bed their voices are still and they look longingly after him green mewness stands beside loris hohenger expert in skills is mewness he can

those who stand brooding yonder from the demon princes caril carphen we turn the focus of our attention upon howard alan treesong his wry exploits and the incredible virtu osity of his organizational genius at the outset let me in all candor confess my awe and perplexity i do not know where to start he is possibly the greatest rogue of all if in that perfervid ambience surrounding the demon princes such niceties of comparison carry any shred of conviction certainly he is attended by the most extravagant contradic tions his cruelty is wanton and horrid so that his occa sional magnanimities are cast into sharp relief judged by the elaborate methodtcalness of his programs he would seem passionless absolutely logical against a different per spective he is seen to be volatile and as frivolous as a circus clown he is a mystery and his ultimate purposes cannot even be guessed howard alan treesong a name of magic instilling dread and wonder what precisely is known of him the few nodes of fact are made ambiguous by a luminous dust of rumor he is declared to be the most solitary person alive by other reports he is the ultimate ruler of all criminals his person is said to be unremarkable tall thin with well shaped if gaunt features and pale gray eyes of exceptional clarity his expression is often described as droll and his manner vivacious he dresses most usually in ordinary gar ments without ostentation by all accounts he enjoys the company of beautiful women none of whom seems to profit from the association either spiritually or financially to the contrary the romances of which anything is known all end tragically if not worse the demon princes the events which finally brought howard alan treesong to bay ran an erratic course twisting forking making confused halts and unlikely linkages a consequence of the mystery in which treesong shrouded himself according to the few extant descriptions tree song stood rather taller than ordinary with a luminous gaze a broad forehead a narrow jaw and chin and a foxy rueful mouth his manner was usually described as gracious with a metallic undertone almost every account mentioned a curious field of suppressed en ergy or unpredictable extravagance and in one case the word madness was used treesongs obsession with mystery extended far no photo graphs representations or likenesses were known to exist on or off the public record his origins were unknown his private life was as secret as the far end of the universe he regularly disappeared from public notice for years on end treesongs zone of operations encompassed the oikumene he rarely ventured beyond he was known to have used for himself the title lord of the overmen gersen picked up the track of howard alan treesong essen tially by dint of abstract reasoning pure deduction in the classical pattern using information supplied by one walter koedelin an oldtime associate and now a senior officer of the ipcc the two met in sailmaker beach to the north of avente the metropolis of alphanor first among rigels concourse of worlds chancys tea house at the top of sailmaker beach overlooked a thousand small houses shops taverns and a small plaza used by a hundred kinds of people each structure was washed a different color pale blue pale green lavender pink white yellow and each cast a stark black shadow to the crackling rigelglare far below could be seen a small crescent of beach beyond the thaumaturge ocean soft dark blue extended to the horizon where floated pin nacles of white cumulus the allusion is perhaps explained in a paragraph from an interview in which freesong stated men exploit animals to their needs and think nothing of the process socalled criminals exploit die ordinary ruck to their needs in die same manner employ ing equal morality hence criminals are properly to be known as overmen inteiworld police coordinating company originally a small bureau collecung and collating information for the various police organizations of the oikumene gradually ex panding diversifying and undertaking special missions at last to become die largest and most efficient lawenforcement agency of the human universe the book of dreams at a table shaded under a dense growth of dark green memaris sat kirth gersen and walter koedelin a sandyhaired pink skinned man somewhat more stocky than gersen with a short nosed bigjawed face like gersen he wore spacemans dark blue and gray the costume for folk who hoped to avoid attention the two men drank rum punch and discussed howard alan treesong in the company of gersen koedelin spoke without restraint what is he up to now thats a real puzzle ten years ago he called himself lord of the overmen in effect king of thieves exactly he licensed every illicit act from far edge to tan giers old socco one rime howard walked a backstreet in bug town on arccurus iv and a mugger jumped out howard asked are you registered with the organization no i am not then youll not get a cent from me and im also turning you in for a fink koedelin drained his goblet of rum punch and looked up at the dark green foliage from which depended strips of pink blossoms splendid place for microphones i wonder who is listening to us no one according to chancy its hard to be certain nowadays still the organization isnt all that strong around here gersen raised his hand two more of the same so tree song is no longer lord of the overmen hardly that but he gave up detail work to sublords quite some time ago howard only looks in from rime to rime and runs his eye over the books benign fellow so what is he up to now koedelin hesitated calculating his response then made a fatal istic gesture and drew himself forward theres no harm in telling you although if the story gets wide circulation well be embar rassed it may not even be true koedelin looked right and left dont let it go any further certainly not ipcc administration is rather loose that you know there is a board of directors and a presiding officer who is now artur sanchero five years ago his confidential aide died in an accident a close friend recommended a man named jethro cope for the job and after the usual background check cope was hired cope proved the demon princes very efficient so much so that sanchero had less and less work to do and now began a strange process the directors began to die by disease by accidents by murder and suicide sanchero or more accurately jethro cope recommended new directors who were thereupon voted into office jethro cope always handled the vote and counted the ballots he put seven men into the ipcc board of directors and needed only six more to achieve a voting majority he probably would have gotten them had not one of the new directors who called himself bemus carlisle en countered an agent who recognized him to be sean mcmurtree of dublin ireland a highclass blackmailer to make a long story short mcmurtree was quietly expunged but not before he mentioned a name can you guess the name he mentioned howard alan treesong quite right the agents went looking for jethro cope but he was gone and never returned what of the other six new directors three were killed one disappeared two are still there they have no record they claim innocence and the other directors wont vote them out very noble very corrupt or very frightened take your choice to be lord of the overmen and chief of the ipcc both and at the same time thats like a beautiful dream no matter which side youre on alas indeed treesong is a sly devil id still like to carve up his liver what of photographs not one to be found so we still dont know what he looks like koedelin gave a grunt of derisive disgust people who dealt with cope remember long blond curls a bushy blond beard and mustache an affable manner and since then nothing hes gone invisible i forgot to mention that three years ago an order went down to the library to void all material pertaining to howard alan treesong on the grounds of inaccuracy this was done now theres very little on tap all successful criminals at some time return to their home the book of dreams towns somewhere out there treesong was born and raised doz ens of people must know him well maybe after three years new material has come in koedelin leaning back in his chair ruminated a minute or two ill check over my sources and let you know where are you stay ing at the miramonte ill look in about noon if thats convenient on the following day at precisely noon koedelin joined gersen in the observation lounge of the hotel miramonte on aventes esplanade its as i suspected said koedelin theres not a clue as to his origin he first appears on earth as a young man robbing banks swindling extorting committing murders organizing a strike force hes competent at his trade still its amazing how little we know of him as a human being declaring himself pressed for time koedelin left shortly after gersen went out to walk on the esplanade which for ten miles paralleled aventes superb white sand beach the harms treesong had inflicted upon gersen were now over twenty years old when treesong had only just attained his full criminal stature since this time his exploits had become ever more grand a wraith of insight nickered through gersens mind he went to lean on the balustrade three years ago howard treesong had dropped from sight this man who had tried to be simultaneously king of thieves and chief director of the ipcc was certainly not now idle some where he plotted new schemes more monumental than any before gersen considered a number of possibilities deeds of cruel magnificence ingenious abominations shame visited upon all hu manity none of gersens constructions seemed plausible or worth the effort evidently so gersen told himself he lacked treesongs gorgeous if wild and savage imagination gersen here referred to the book the criminal mentality by michael diaz at mount pleasant an agricultural settlement on the world providence a consortium of five master criminals the socalled demon princes had dropped out of the sky to enslave die enure population killing those who resisted kirth gersen and his grandfather escaped and thereafter in gersens life there had been room for little but preparation for retaliation and revenge s the demon princes gersen returned to the hotel and telephoned koedelin re garding the subject of our conversation it would seem that some thing dramatic should be coming to the surface about now what would answer that description koedelin could cite nothing definite ive been thinking along similar lines waiting so to speak for the other shoe to drop no matter how hard i listen i hear only utter silence the three populated vegan worlds were aloysius boniface and cuthbert during the first explosion of peoples they had been settled by religious orders each more fanatic than the next in the sixteenth century of the space age the sacerdotal flavor yet lin gered especially in the public buildings converted from temples during the bums rush pontefract on aloysius a small city notable mainly for its in cessant mist by some trick of fate had become an important pub lishing and financial center in the oldest section of town dominating st paidrigh square stood the ancient bramville tower now headquarters of cosmopolis a journal of news photo graphs and short essays the magazines contents sometimes pro found often dramatic or even sentimental were directed to the attention of intelligent middleclass folk across the entire oiku mene kirth gersen through the manipulations of his financial advi ser jehan addels had acquired a controlling interest in cosmopolis in the guise of henry lucas special writer he used the offices as a convenient headquarters arriving in pontefract gersen went to dine with jehan addels at his splendid old mansion in ballyholt woods to the north of pontefract during the course of the dinner gersen mentioned howard alan treesong and his peculiar invisibility addels instantly became tense you speak naturally only from casual interest well not altogether treesong is a scoundrel and a criminal his influence reaches everywhere tonight burglars might break into this house and steal your memlings and van tasals not to mention your rhodosi rugs objects of this quality might go di rectly to treesong himself addels nodded somberly it is a serious matter tomorrow i will submit a memorandum to the ipcc the book of dreams it can do no harm addels glanced suspiciously toward gersen i hope that you take no personal interest m this man probably to no great extent addels uttered an angry ejaculation under his breath please do not include me in these investigations not to the slightest de gree my dear addels how can i avoid coming to you for advice my advice in this case is succinct and definite let the ipcc do their job that is excellent advice and i will assist them in this work as much as possible and i know that you will do the same of course of course muttered addels at the cosmopolis library gersen searched in files for references to howard alan treesong these were voluminous and told gersen little that he did not know and nothing of the topics which were his chief concern treesongs place of origin and his present whereabouts treesongs pictorial likeness was conspicuous by its absence at the end of a disappointing day gersen for no reason other than simple persistence riffled through the contents of a file labeled miscellaneous sort discovering nothing to his immediate interest a pair of trays marked file and discard caught his eye the file basket was empty the discard basket contained a large photograph almost a foot square depicting a party at a banquet five men and two women were seated three men stood somewhat to the back at the top someone had scrawled h a treesong is here with numb fingers and a prickling skin gersen stood staring at the photograph the camera had recorded a fall circle from the center of a circular table so that each member of the group was depicted from the front though none was looking directly at the camera and perhaps no one was aware that the picture was being made in front of each place stood a curious little semaphore display ing three colored flags and each place had been served a silver dish containing three purplebrown objects about four inches high ap parently the first course to the banquet aside from the scrawled notation across the top the photo tiil dfmon princps graph lacked further legend except for a number printed at the bottom the diners were of various ages and races all projected a con ndent air the effluvium of position and wealth they were identi fied by place cards unfortunately turned away from the camera gersen looked from face to face which might be howard alan treesong his description fitted more or less loosely perhaps tour of the men a file clerk approached a aunty young man wearing a pmkandblack striped shirt with baggy brown trousers in the local style he gave gersen a glance which while respectful and affable also contained the shadow of a sneer around the cosmopohs offices gersen was regarded as a man of questionable talents rummaging through the garbage eh mr lucas everything is grist for the mill said gersen this photo graph which you were about to throw away where did it come from oh that affair it arrived a few days ago from our starport office the watch and ward society at its annual glut or some thing similar is it useful probably not still its rather quaint i wonder who h a treesong might be one of the local gobboons the ladies are absolute frumps nothing here for our readers that i assure you but gersen was not to be discouraged from our starport office you say which starport incidentally there must be at least a dozen starport on new concept marhab six again the flavor al most undetectable of condescension around covmopolis no one un derstood how henry lucas had gained his job and even less how he held it gersen was indifferent to the opinions of his colleagues how did the photograph get here it came in the last mailbag when youre finished throw it back in the trash theres a good fellow the clerk went off about his duties gersen took the photo graph to his private cubicle and called the personnel office who is our representative at starport new concept starport is a zone headquarters mr lucas the onal super intendent is ailett mayneth the book of dreams gersen discovered upon looking into universal travel routes that direct connections between aloysius and new concept were non existent if he wished to travel by passenger packet he must expect three stopovers at junction points and three changes of ship with consequent delay gersen closed universal travel routes and replaced it on the shelf he rode out to the spaceport and boarded his fantamic flit terwmg a serviceable and competent space cruiser with a small cargo hatch and accommodations for four a vessel larger than his distis pharaon and more comfortable than his armmtor starship in the late afternoon of the day on which he had discovered the photograph gersen departed aloysius with vega hanging cold in the sky on his port quarter he gave appropriate coordinates to the automatic pilot and was whisked off toward the middle reaches of aries during the voyage he studied the photograph at length and slowly the banqueters took on a static twodimensional life of each male face gersen asked are you howard alan treesong some answered indignantly in the negative others held their own counsel and several seemed to return a brooding challenge as if to say who i am what i am interfere at your own peril and one of the men gersen examined ever more often with increasing fascination glossy chestnut hair framed a philosophers forehead hollow cheeks were joined to a gaunt aw by a sheath of corded muscle the thin tender mouth was twisted as if in recollection of a mischievous joke a face strong and subtle sensitive but not soft the face of a man capable of anything so thought gersen ahead glowed marhab off to the right wheeled the planet new concept and its three moons from civilized ideas and civilized worlds by michael yeaton as the student reflects upon the development of the newlv settled worlds he notices an odd and ironic circum stance recurring so often as to seem the rule rather than the exception the ideal program by which each new so ciety is shaped by some as yet unenunciated law of conduct begins to generate its own obverse or opposite impulse which in due course overcomes the original scheme hu man perversity the malice of fate who can say in any event the examples are everywhere for instance consider the world new concept arriving at new concept gersen located starport and landed at the space terminal a sleek car riding a monorail shuttled him the five miles between the terminal and starport gersen was thereby afforded a view of the new concept fells here overgrown with heavy dark blue turf in the middle distance the dark blue gave way to maroon and beyond purple a mile from the terminal the monorail skirted an area of moldering white ruins originally an intricate complex of structures in the neopalladian style almost a small city now the columns were chippedbroken or toppled the roofs had partly collapsed the oncenoble entablatures were stained and streaked at first gersen thought the ruins uninhabited then he noticed movement here and there and a moment later saw a pack of gangling animals loping across a oncegrand plaza the ruins fell behind the monorail entered starport and came the book of dreams to a halt at a central depot at an information booth gersen learned the location of the local cosmopolis office a suite in a tenstory tower a few hundred yards from the depot and set out on foot starport seemed a city of no distinction whatever except for the lemonyellow sunlight and the flavor of the atmosphere ger sen might have fancied himself in an outer suburb of avente on alphanor or any of a dozen quasimodern cities of the oikumene the folk wore garments similar to those of avente and the cities of earth whatever new concept had originally been intended was now no longer in evidence presenting himself at the cosmopolis office gersen approached a counter behind which stood an elderly man with a keen birdlike cast of countenance bright blue eyes and a crest of gleaming silver hair he was thin taut and carried himself with a stern and exact posture somewhat at odds with his garments which were casual a bright blue turtleneck shirt of lightweight velour soft beige trou sers and sandals of dark suede he addressed gersen in a formally terse voice sir your requirements i am henry lucas from the pontefract office said gersen i would like a few moments with mr ailett mayneth i am he mayneth looked gersen up and down henry lu cas i have visited the pontefract office and i cant remember hear ing your name i carry the title special writer said gersen i am in fact a generalpurpose roustabout whenever theres a job too dull or uncomfortable for anyone else im assigned to it i see said mayneth and what is so dull and uncomfortable here at starport gersen displayed the photograph mayneths manner changed at once aha so that is how the wind blows i wondered what would happen so you are here to investigate that is correct hmm perhaps we can make ourselves more comfortable shall we go up to my apartments whatever you like mayneth conducted gersen to an elevator which lifted them experienced space travelers become sensitive to the variations of a breathable atmo sphere discriminating between inert gses oxygen levels and complex organic exudations peculiar to eierv individual planet in the air of new concept gersen noted a muscv peppery redolence evidently rising from the blanket of rurf which cloaked the fells s the demon princes high to the top floor mayneth slid open his door with easy in difference gersen entered what he recognized to be the domicile of a connoisseur of judgment and so it would seem wealth in all directions he saw beautiful objects of various eras and as many places of origin many of the objects gersen could not precisely identify for instance a pair of earthenware lamps glazed a dull graybrown possibly ancient japan in regard to the rugs he knew somewhat more by reason of an episode in his early career he recognized a pair of persian rugs glowing serenely in the sunlight a quiiqun a mersilin from the adar mountains of co pus several small gypsy rugs probably from the khajar realm of copus a satinwood case displayed a group of myrmidense porce lains and a casual arrangement of precious old books bound in shagreen and hornskin since i have nothing better to do with myself said mayneth halfapologetically i try to surround myself with beautiful objects i fancy myself as a shrewd trader and i enjoy nothing more than to prowl the country bazaars of some remote little world this is my socalled study the books in here are exclusively from earth a miscellany i fear but sit down if you will mayneth touched a gong with his fingers producing a plangent tone a servant ap peared a young girl of odd appearance thin and supple as an eel with a shock of curly white hair slatecolored eyes in a small pinched face a small pointed chin and a thin lavender mouth she wore a short white smock and moved with a curious lithe sliding gait she watched the two men attentively without any trace of selfconsciousness gersen could not identify her racial stock he thought that if she were not feebleminded her rationality was surely of a most unconventional sort mayneth hissed between his teeth touched the palm of his hand held up two fingers the girl backed away she returned al most immediately with a tray two goblets and two squat bottles mayneth took the tray the girl was gone in a whisk of fluttering smock mayneth poured our excellent swallowtail beer he served gersen and picked up the photograph which gersen had placed on the table a very strange affair this he seated himself drank a dainty swallow of beer a woman came into the office and i inquired her business she stated that she had valuable infor mation which she wished to sell for a substantial sum i seated her in my office and looked her over her age was about thirty a bit the book of dreams run to seed just short of blowsy still she seemed respectable if in a dreadful state of nerves she was not a local woman she stated that she had come directly from the space terminal and that she desperately needed money i looked her over once again even more carefully but i could not place her background mayneth took a meditative sip of beer i noticed one or two small points still he shrugged as if to dismiss the problem she began to work up her proposition she said she was able to offer an item not only unique but highly valuable not her exact words of course she was so nervous as occasionally to be incoherent i tried a bit of whimsy rather sophomoric really youve brought me the directions to a cache of hidden treasure she became angry are you interested in what i have to offer mind you i want a fair price i told her that id have to see to judge immediately she be came cautious it was quite a game finally i said madam show me what you want to sell otherwise i cant spare any more time she asked me in a whisper have you heard the name howard alan treesong yes indeed he is lord of the overmen dont say that although its true i have his photograph how much will you pay lets see the picture no first you must make me a good offer im afraid i became a bit lofty i asked her how can i buy something until ive seen it is it a good likeness indeed its a good likeness he is about to commit a mass murder i said nothing and finally she produced her merchandise mayneth indicated the photograph i examined it carefully then said this is admittedly an excellent picture but which is tree song i dont know then how do you know hes here i was told so by someone who knew he might have been joking if so he was killed for his joke really yes really may i inquire your name the demon princes is it important in any event i wont give my proper name where was the picture taken if i told you that other people would suffer madam be practical consider the circumstances you show me a photograph one of the persons so you say is treesong but you cant point him out to me that proves im honest i could easily point to anyone in the photograph that man there for instance quite true as a matter of fact hes my own choice all this aside and conceding your own honesty how do you know that the picture is authentic someone has been killed who why with out these details the picture has no particular value she thought a moment or two can you guarantee confiden tiality naturally one of treesongs aides is named ervin umps his brother was a waiter at the restaurant where the picture was taken he was also my husband he spoke with ervin and discovered that tree song was at the banquet the photograph is automatic for the restaurants records and my husband took this copy which he left in my keeping he told me only that treesong was in the picture and that treesong had murdered everyone else present the pic ture he said was very valuable that same night he was killed i knew that id be killed too whether i gave up the photograph or not so i left at once and thats all i can tell you and where is the restaurant i wont tell you its not necessary that you know i dont understand youve told me everything else i have my reasons thats where the matter rested we had a long discussion about the price i explained that i was taking her on trust that the photograph might not be worth a hollow dinket she agreed but wouldnt yield an inch i asked how much do you expect me to pay i want ten thousand svu that is out of the question wtiat will you offer i told her id risk a hundred svu of company money and fifty of my own she started to leave i decided that i couldnt risk letting the book of drrms the picture get away i offered another hundred and guaranteed that if cosmopolis used the picture shed be paid two hundred more she caved in give me the money i must leave here at once the picture is dangerous i paid her off she ran from the office and i saw no more of her mayneth filled the goblets with swal lowtail beer what happened next mayneth cleared his throat i inspected the picture with great care i found few clues the clothes are diverse and suggest a va riety of backgrounds they seem to be lightweight which indicates a warm local climate those little semaphores i cant understand them nor can i identify the food you hinted at one or two details in connection with the woman so i did her clothes were standard but she spoke with an accent around the stars youll hear a thousand accents and dialects it is one of my interests and my ear is fairly keen i listened care fully but i could not place her particular speech what else at the corner of each eye she wore a little blue shell ive seen these before but i cant connect them with any particular place she never mentioned her name mayneth pulled on his chin her husbands brother is ervin umps she might or might not use the same name possible not necessarily probable my own feeling still i became curious and decided to make inquiry at the spaceport and i did so although the trail by then was three days cold i checked passenger lists asked questions and to make a long story short i found no umps she apparently called herself lamar medrano she transferred aboard the ship at a place called virgo junction out on spica six i checked the place in universal travel routes a dozen different liners touch there i doubt if she could be traced away from virgo junction when did she leave new concept possibly never how so she booked passage to altair aboard a green star packet the samarthi tone departing three days after her consultation with me i checked around the hotels and found her at hotel diomedes tup dfmon princes where she had stayed two nights they remembered her well be cause she skipped without settling the bill odd sinister i made further inquiries at the diomedes and learned that she had become acquainted with a certain emmaus schahar a salesman in sports equipment from krokinole one morning scha har paid his account and departed lamar medrano went out the previous night and never returned gersen gave a dour grunt as to this schahar whsit of him a saturnine fellow soft spoken with plenty of money hes not now in starport he left on the gacy wonder one of its waypoints is virgo junction interesting very much so i dont know whether or not to be reassured you wonder why mr schahar did not call on you exactly schahar might conceivably be an innocent salesman with only ordinary interest in lamar medrano conceivably assuming that schahar is not an innocent salesman lamar medrano might have become fearful and fled so that she is now hiding somewhere on new concept possible thirdly lamar might have died before revealing where she had taken the photograph perhaps she convinced schahar that she had put it in the mails possibly she had two copies of the photograph schahar con sidered his mission accomplished and is now pleased and happy gersen laughed when howard treesong reads cosniopohs sometime in the near future schahar will not be so pleased and happy he brought out stylus and paper wrote a few words placed five hundredsvu certificates on top pushed all over to mayneth your expenses and a bonus for constructive activity please sign the receipt so that i may recover from the central bursar thank you said mayneth that is indeed generous of you perhaps you will take lunch with me it will be a pleasure mayneth touched the gong the whitehaired girl appeared mayneth made signs and sounds the girl slid off easy and soft of the book of hrmms i motion she returned with beer paused to watch as mavneth filled the goblets peering in fascination at the foam her lavenderpink tongue darting in and out of her mouth she loves beer said mayneth i wont allow her anv because she becomes agitated shell lick all the foam from our empty gob lets daringly the girl hooked some foam from gersens goblet with her finger and put it into her mouth mayneth slapped her hand without any great vehemence and the girl umped back like a play ful cat she hissed at mayneth who hissed in return and gestured the girl departed passing through the door she bent to arrange a tassel in the fringe of the rug gersen noted that under the short white smock she was nude mayneth sighed and swallowed half a goblet of beer ill be leaving new concept before long i came originally as a collector the original settlers created many beautiful things hand illuminated books grotesques musical instruments notice that gong yonder it sounds to no more than a touch the best are supposed to sing even before they are touched some were ex ported but the best were hidden in caves ive explored a thousand miles of caverns acquisitiveness conquering my claustrophobia gersen leaned back in his chair and looked out across the tells the sun stood at its zenith across a low ridge in the middle distance ran a pack of animals gamboling and curvetting on long lank legs they darted into the shadow of a thicket and began to graze on a growth of green sedge this doesnt seem a particularly wll managed world said gersen i dont see any signs of agriculture its been tried the feeks destroy crops before they get started theres no keeping them out short of poison which is pro hibited i noticed classical ruins out near the space terminal do they represent the new concept the original structures were the gift of a mad philanthropist the new concept was dietary vegetarianism in fact mixed with stints of meditation for fifty years the settlers lived in the great temple of organic unity they ate alfalfa sprouts collard greens and odd bits of the native vegetation the human form is wonder fully adaptable the settlers adapted all too well and there they are now mayneth pointed to the pack of lank animals gra mg under the demon princes the thicket having their lunch speaking of lunch we might as well go examine our own mayneth led gersen to his dining room where the white haired girl stood staring in fascination at the table sudden illumi nation came to gersen she is one of the locals mayneth nodded they leave babies lying out on the fells simple forgetfulness i suspect sometimes theyre brought in and trained more or less successfully catch them early and theyll learn to stay clean and walk on their hind legs tiptoe here is a clever one she serves beer and fluffs pillows and generally behaves her self shes fascinating to look at said gersen is she well affec tionate its been tried with generally poor results said mayneth are you curious touch her where well to begin with on the shoulder gersen approached the girl who swayed back blinking her great gray eyes gersen reached out his hand she uttered a quick spitting hiss and sprang back mouth open to show sharp teeth hands raised and fingers curled gersen drew back grinning i see what you mean her opin ions are very definite some of the local lads use a bait of molasses candy said may neth they like it and while theyre eating they cant bite well heres our lunch shell go away now because she cant tol erate anything but lettuce and occasionally a bit of boiled carrot such is the dark side of vegetarianism from life volume i by unspiek baron bodissey i often reflect upon the word morality the most troublesome and confusing word of all there is no single or supreme morality there are many each defining the mode by which a system of entities op timally interacts the eminent entomologist fabre observing a mantis in the act of devouring its mate exclaimed wtiat an abominable custom the ordinary man during a days time may be obliged to act by the terms of a half dozen different moralities some of these acts appropriate at one moment may the next moment be considered obscene or opprobrious in terms of another morality the person who let us say expects generosity from a bank efficient flexibility from a government agency open mindedness from a religious institution will be disap pointed in each purview the notions represent immorality the poor fool might as quickly discover love among the mantises gersen returning to aloysius landed at dunes spaceport a few miles south of pontefract the time was late on a dark purplegray afternoon mist blowing in from bottleglass bay almost obscured the demon princes the terminal buildings gersen bowed his head and walked to the depot across a boardway of weathered seawood he rode first by underground train then by taxi to the mansion ofjehan addels his financial adviser and general business factotum in ballyholt woods addels greeted him with his usual air of sour disapproval which gersen believed to be a mask for esteem and possibly even affec tion though this might be asking a bit too much from addels whose views of man and the universe were filtered through a life time of mistrustful cynicism addels looked the part with a gaunt yellowish face a tall thin forehead a long thin nose with a trem ulous tip his hair was scanty and yellowbrown his eyes a bland pale blue gersen went to his usual room bathed dressed in garments left on a previous occasion he dined with addels and his numerous family in a grand dining room at a table illuminated by candles the tableware was antique silver and they ate off ancient wedge wood after dinner the two men returned to addelss yampangpane ed study and sat before a fire with coffee served from a silver coffeepot gersen displayed the photograph to addelss consternation i had hoped that you were finished with this sort of thing not quite said gersen what do you think addels feigned stupidity regarding what we want to identify treesong and discover where he makes his headquarters and then perhaps well bring him to justice bah and perhaps someone will get himself killed by being hung on a hook a mile in the air which was what happened to poor newton flickery a shame that well we must hope for the best therefore i hope that you will have nothing to do with this business here let me throw the photograph into the fire gersen ignored him and for the hundredth time studied the photograph which is treesong how can we identify him addels said crossly hes one often persons the others must know him or at least know themselves treesong can be identified by eliminating the others first we must identify the others the book of dreams why not each must have many friends and acquaintances but let us talk no more of this foolishness gersen wandered the crooked old streets of ponteftact he sat in small irregular squares planted with boxwood and wallflowers he idled along valleys smelling of age and wet stone he took several meals at a restaurant suspended over bottleglass bay on rotten black pilings he saw little of addels except at the stately dinners which ad dels considered a basic element of civilized existence addels refused to discuss gersens preoccupation and gersen had only small in terest in the highly profitable dealings by which addels augmented gersens wealth on the fourth day gersen settled upon a method to increase the leverage of his single tool to the utmost for several years the cosmopolis directorship had contemplated a companion magazine to be known as extant much of the preliminary work had been done the new journal would rely heavily upon cosmopolis produc tion and distribution facilities with an editorial policy intended to appeal to a livelier and less sedate readership than that ofcosmopolis through a linkage of holding companies gersen owned cos mopolis outright now he ordained the instant existence of extant overnight it came into being copy long prepared entered printing machines and extant surged out through the cosmopolis distribution adits to the far edges of the oikumene to increase its impact on the market this first issue would be given away free it featured a remarkable contest certain to attract the attention of all its readers a photograph on the cover depicted ten persons at a banquet the caption read who are these folk name them correctly and win svu the inside cover added qualifying details only the first three contestants to identify all the depicted faces would win prizes should no one name all persons correctly then those three persons identifying the largest number of faces would receive the prize six additional rules stipulated the prizes to those who were first or among the first correctly to identify fewer than all the faces entries the demon princes were to be mailed to extant corrib place pontefract aloy sius such entries would be adjudicated by members of the extant staff wherever periodicals were sold extant impinged on the eye the more so for the prominent overprint on its cover free at refuges on the frozen salt tundras of irta under the lime trees of duptis major at halts along the cableways of the midor mountains at kiosks along the grand boulevards of paris and oak land on alphanor chrysanthe olltphane and krokinole and every other world of the rigel concourse extant in spaceports barber shops jails hospitals monasteries bordellos construction camps extant millions of eyes saw the faces usually with only casual in terest not a few studied the photograph with care and even fas cination and took occasion to write letters to contest editor extant two persons especially separated by lightyears of space saw the photograph with startled amazement the first sat frowning through his window as he pondered the significance of the contest the second occasionally sounding a rather harsh chuckle took pen in hand and addressed a letter to contest editor extant gersen decided to move into town closer to the extant office ad dels recommended the penwipers hotel it is convenient to your office and quite the best address in town very respectable his gaze lingered thoughtfully upon gersens costume in fact in fact what nothing whatever you will be made comfortable at penwip ers they take good care of their guests i will call to make arrange ments they seldom accept new clientele without favorable recommendation the facade of penwipers hotel six stories of carved brownstone and fluted black iron surmounted by a flemish mansard roof of green copper tiles overlooked old tara square an inconspicuous portal opened into first a foyer then a reception hall with the lounge to one side and the dining room to the other gersen reg istered at a counter of carved brown marble supported by pilasters and corner columns of glossy black gabbro the receptionists wore formal morning clothes of oldfashioned cut how oldfashioned gersen did not immediately appreciate the style in fact had the rook of driams changed by not so much as a buttonhole since the hotels opening eleven hundred years before at the penwipers and in pontefract generally tradition yielded grudgingly if at all to novelty gersen waited while the registration clerk quietly consulted the head porter the two glancing at gersen from time to time the consultation ended gersen was conducted to his suite the chief porter led the way an assistant carried gersens small handbag a third carried a velvet box at the door the chief porter opened the box withdrew a damask cloth scented with lavender with which he briskly wiped the door handle which he then twitched with thumb and forefinger the door opened gersen entered a set of high ceilinged rooms famished in a style of austere comfort something short of luxury the porters moved swiftly around the room adjusting the placement of furniture wiping surfaces with their scented cloths then departed swiftly and quietly as if they had merged into the shadows the chief porter said sir the valet will attend you at once to assist with your wardrobe the wateris already drawn for your bath he bowed and prepared to leave one moment said gersen is there a key to the door the chief porter smiled benignly sir you need not fear in trusion at penwipers possibly not but for instance suppose i were a jewel mer chant carrying a parcel of gems and a thief wished to rob me he need merely saunter to my room open the door and divest me of my wealth the chief porter still smiling shook his head sir such a ter rible thing could never happen here it would simply not be tol erated your valuables are quite safe dont carry any valuables said gersen i merely suggested a possibility the inconceivable sir is rarely possible i am totally reassured said gersen thank you thank you sir he drew back as gersen extended his hand the staff is adequately paid sir we prefer to accept no gratui ties he inclined his head crisply and departed gersen bathed in a sunken tub carved like the reception desk from a block of brown marble he emerged to find his belongings packed neatly into a bottom drawer of an ancient wardrobe the valet deeming his garments unsuitable had laid out new sedate the demon princes dark brown trousers a lavenderandwhite striped shirt a cravat of white linen crash a kneelong coat of black twill pinched at the shoulders belled at the hips in rueful resignation gersen dressed in the new garments if nothing else jehan addels would be pleased gersen descended to the lobby and crossed to the main en trance the chief porter stepped forward to intercept him a mo ment sir i will fetch your klapper he tendered a large black velvet hat with a wide rolled brim a coil of dark green and a small stiff brush of black bristles gersen looked askance at the hat and would have slipped past had not the doorman contrived to position himself between gersen and the door youll find the air a bit brisk sir it is our pleasure to assist you in the use of appropriate attire that is kind of you said gersen thank you sir allow me to arrange the hat just so af ternoon wear will be laid out for your use at the stroke of the second gong the weather portends a drifting wet mist with showers later in the day in the foyer gersen paused to glance at himself in the mirror who was this somber exemplar of old pontefract gentility who stared back at him never had he worn a disguise more deceptive gersen wandered along the crabbed streets under tall narrow fronted buildings across the ubiquitous small squares each with its boxed beds of wallflowers pansies native bulrastia and st olafs toe from time to time the mist parted to allow a shaft of vega light down to glisten on wet stone and infuse a sudden gush of color into the flower beds at a public telephone he called jehan addels and arranged a meeting at the extant office at addelss convenience that will be in one hours time said addels i will be there gersen turned into corrib place a short street somewhat wider than ordinary and paved with slabs of polished granite dovetailed each to each and laid down long ago as an act of penance by the estebanite monks corrib place occupied the oldest part of pontefract old town to one side the ancient estebanite monastery had been converted into commercial suites the structures opposite built of age darkened mace and ganthar wood bound with brackets of black the book of drilms iron stood tall and gaunt and compressed often with upperstory bays overhanging the street with time to spare before his appointment with addels gersen sauntered along corrib place looking into shops which here af fected a special eclat and offered only goods of distinction and el egance fancy pastries and imported sweetmeats rare gems pearls from the local rorqual crystals won from dead stars gloves cravats gaiters kerchiefs perfumes philtres magic duhamel oil bibelots curios portfolios ot antique art giotto and goslwane william snyder and william blake mucha dulac lindsay rackham niel sen durer dore david russell gersen paused ten minutes to watch a pair of puppets at a game of chess the puppets were ma holibus and cascadine characters from the comic masque each had captured several pieces each in turn after deliberation made his move wtien one captured a piece the other made gestures of rage and agitation maholibus made a move and spoke in a creaking voice checkmate cascadine cried out in anguish he struck himself on the forehead and toppled backwardoff his chair a mo ment later he picked himself up the two arranged the pieces and started a new game gersen entered the shop bought the chessplayer puppets and ordered them delivered to penwipers one of the rare occasions of his life when he had encumbered himself with a trivial article strolling along corrib place gersen found himself opposite the offices of extant publications he paused by the window of the horlogicon to study a timepiece seemingly fashioned from puffs and swirls of mist with spots of colored light designating the time interesting but impractical thought gersen jehan addels turned into corrib place and approached placing his feet carefully one before the other the time was several minutes early he stopped beside gersen to catch his breath and inspect the extant offices after an incurious sidelong glance he ignored gersen and continued peering toward the extant offices gersen spoke sir are you expecting someone addels swung around stared in hemusement my dear fellow i failed to recognize you gersen smiled a wintry smile the hotel has allowed me the use of these clothes they feel that my ordinary attire is a bit too ordinary addels spoke in a precise voice a person makes a statement the demon princes about himself with his clothes a genteel person wears genteel clothes to establish his status and status whether we like it or not is a key factor in human interrelations gersen said at the very least i am provided an excellent dis guise addelss voice rose a quick tone or two why should you need a disguise we are dealing you and i with a remarkable man he is a ruthless murderer but at the same time a paragon of gentility who could lodge without qualm at penwipers hotel addels gave a glum grimace you surely dont expect him here i dont know what to expect we are publishing his photo graph which he has been at great pains to conceal please do not use the word we so loosely but i agree that the contest will attract his attention that is part of my plan he will wonder who is interested m him and investigate addels sniffed or he might simply decide to destroy the enure building i think not said gersen first he will want to discover the facts he will try to infiltrate your organization it will be very dif ficult to forestall him i wont even try in fact ill make it easy risky business what good can come ofit his infiltration in effect becomes our infiltration we will lure him close then work to arrange a meeting you will be the inter mediary by no means never not in a million years i expect no danger until after he satisfies his curiosity addels refused to be convinced that is like telling a staked out goat that the tiger will not bite until after he sniffs around a bit i wonder if the parallel is quite exact regardless i do not intend to participate in this scheme i have had my fill of scares and frights my proper work lies else where just as you say we will make our plans accordingly the book of dreams addels was not et reassured when do you expect him to k act as soon as he sees the photograph he will then send someone here to investigate or possibly he will arrive on the scene himself we still have a few days to prepare the lull before the storm muttered addels gersen laughed dont forget we are laying the plans not treesong come along ill take you to lunch at penwipers if you think theyll allow you in the dining room on the door of the extant offices appeared a sign notice to the public staff is now being engaged temporary help is required to assist with pho tograph identification contest it is preferred but not essential that ap plicants make appointments for an in terview an applicant upon entering the extant offices found himself in an anteroom divided by a counter i o the left was a door with a notice reading contest processing room authorized personnel only the door to the right was imprinted editorial offices at the counter the applicant would be met by mrs millicent ench a brisk darkhaired lady of middle age who invariably wore day after day a long black skirt a pale blue blouse with a red sash a cap with a red visor glossy black shoes which laced up past the ankles mrs ench performed a screening process turning away those applicants who were patently unsuitable others she sent into the adjoining room where the filled out an application form un der the eye of the personnel manager this was mr henry lucas who from the evidence of his clothes fancied himself a patrician of the most refined gentility his features were good if a trifle harsh the demon princes his mouth was wide thin and crooked black ringlets were arranged with care across his forehead and down past his sallowpale cheeks after a casual word or two with the applicants henry lucas seated them in cubicles back to the room and asked them to re spond to a questionnaire the cubicles and desks were apparently improvised and roughly constructed for the occasion actually they concealed and disguised exceptionally sensitive sensors and stress gauges which recorded every slight tremor of the applicant each flicker of his eye every variation of blood pressure every alteration of brainwave pattern the findings when collated were indicated as colored lights at gersens desk and colored marks upon a facsim ile of the questionnaire gersen had composed the questionnaire with care in order that the responses and their associated reactions should provide the max imum information even though the questions in themselves seemed innocuous the first questions were straightforward in order to establish normal circumstances and to calibrate the equipment name type of employment desired local address birthplace se age name of parents father addrp mnrhpr armrp occupation of father mother rirthnlapp of father morhpr the next group of questions so gersen calculated would place a rather greater strain on other than a legitimate applicant how long at local address local references list at least two these people may or may not be consulted in regard to your character and competence previous address if any the book of dreams list at least two persons who have known you at this address your address previous to address noted above if any list at least two persons who knew you at this address note you will understand that under the circumstances extant must diligently ensure the integrity of its personnel the following questions were intended to exert maximum stress upon any person intending deception if nonresident why have you come to pontefract give specific reasons do not generalize contest personnel must necessarily he impartial examine the photo graph here depicted which is submitted to the contestants do you know or recognize any of the persons herein write in the boxes of the persons you do not know fill in solidly the boxes of the persons you do know aaaddnaoaa what is his her name or their names the demon princes what are the circumstances of your acquaintances please be specific if engaged when can you start work in due course applicants for employment presented themselves to the office students from saint griegands seminary and the celtic academy and as many middleaged women with time on their hands gersen rigorously applied his sensors to each applicant in order to adjust the mechanism and to establish the accuracy of his methods apart from a few fluctuations and trivial exceptions his system of colored imprints certified the innocence of each ap plicant of these mrs ench who also supervised the judging pro cedure selected a group to process the beginning flood of entries each envelope as it entered the office passed through a numerator to establish the priority of its reception gersen himself opened and examined a number of envelopes but found a wide disparity of response lacking all consistency on the afternoon of an uncommonly sunny day gersen re turned from lunch to encounter among the applicants a slim slight redhaired girl in whom he took an immediate interest for at least two reasons in the first place she was very pretty in a style at the edge of the unconventional her face rather wide of forehead and cheekbones slanted across flat cheeks down to a small chin and a curving pink mouth which even when still seemed to express in triguing possibilities her grayblue eyes under dark lashes were clear and direct she was perhaps a trifle smaller than average but constructed of apparently durable material she was engagingly sun tanned as if she spent much of her time outdoors she might have been a student from one of the local institutions but gersen thought not he noticed her first through his window standing across the street wearing pale gray trousers black sash and a pale gray cape not at all in the local mode she stood a moment with a bleak expression on her face then squared her shoulders crossed the street out of range of gersens vision a moment or two later mrs ench allowed her into gersens office the book of drkms gersen gave her a brief stare the bleak expression had van ished she now seemed composed and here was the second reason for gersens interest there was a third rising from his subcon scious and perhaps most important of all she spoke in a pleasant husky voice with the trace of an accent gersen could not identify sir you are offering employment to qualified persons said gersen i suppose that you are aware of the extant contest ive heard something about it we need temporary clerks to help with the contest and we are also hiring permanent personnel she considered his remarks gersen wondered whether her art lessness was real or most carefully contrived he took care to ac centuate his halfdebonair halfsupercilious formality she offered a polite suggestion perhaps i could start as a contest clerk and then if i do well you might consider me for a permanent job that is certainly possible ill ask you to fill in this form which is selfexplanatory please answer all questions she glanced at the questionnaire and uttered a soft sound under her breath so many questions we consider them necessary do you investigate all this for everyone you hire gersen spoke in a flat voice a great deal of money is involved in the contest we must ensure that our personnel is absolutely honest i quite understand she took the form and went to the booth gersen pretending to occupy himself with paperwork touched a switch and watched a pair of desk screens as the redhaired girl filled in the questionnaire to the left appeared her face tu the right the questionnaire and colored lights to indicate the verdict of the stress detectors she had started to write name alice wroke sex female the question as to gender and its response certifying a self evident condition calibrated the instruments at base level con ceivably as in the case of a man disguised as a woman the question might generate stress thus distorting the interpretation of every other reading in addition to the coloredlight indicators a graph the dpmon princes recorded responses in terms of absolute units anomalous responses might therefore be identified in practice the colorcoded indexes had provided reliable information blue lights now signified that alice wroke had truthfully declared her name and her gender al though before she wrote her name the light flickered into pink for a moment as if she were debating the use of a false name the warnings from his subconscious were apparently vindicated sur prising he had hoped for treesong to attempt infiltration of ex tant but that the infiltrator should be someone like alice wroke was quite unexpected gersen felt a surge of primitive excitement the game had begun with his own pulse accelerated gersen watched alice wroke write responses to the questions he had framed age a clear blue light no dissimulation type of employment desired here alice hesitated the color wavering from blue into blue green indicated indecision rather than stress she wrote clerical or journalistic work i am qualified for either as she wrote the final sentence the bluegreen verged momen tarily into green as if perhaps she were not as sure of her qualifi cations as she professed she still hesitated and the green gradually became sharper and more acid she added to her re sponse however i am prepared to work in any capacity and do whatever is required of me as she considered the next question the color shifted back to bluegreen indicating a heightened state of consciousness by general convention age and almost all other units of duration were reckoned by terrestrial standards the book of dreams local address the color shifted not an iota alice wrote st diarmids inn this was a large cosmopolitan hotel at the heart of the city frequented by tourists and offworld travelers considerably less pres tigious than penwipers but not without distinction and certainly not inexpensive alice wroke would seem to be in no immediate need birthplace blackfords landing terranova denebola v name of parents father benjamin wroke address wild isle occupation engineer mother eileen sversen wroke address wild isle occupation accountant these questions were negotiated without stress except in re gard to fathers occupation where the light glowed yellow green now commenced those questions which were intended to apply pressure upon a dissembler hoiv long at present address alice had defused this question by identifying her residence as a transient hotel still the indicator shifted into the bright green as she wrote two days local references list at least two mahibel wroke the blawens gungold street sean paldester dingle lane tuorna the demon princes on this response the indicator glowed placidly blue the first was evidently a relative as might he the second who resided at tuorna a nearby village your previous address if any the blue brightened to green flashed momentarily into yellow watching alices face gersen saw her compress her lips then lean forward with a determined expression simultaneously the indicator swung back through green toward blue she wrote wild isle cvtherea tempestre the references were jason bone wild isle jade channifer wild isle to the next question inquiring as to previous address she re sponded without tension nd avenue blackfords landing terranova de nebola v as references she cited dain audenave rd avenue willow tarras th avenue the following questions were those designed to exert maximum pressure if nonresident uhy have you come to pontefract the book of dreams as alice studied the question the indicator glowed yellow and flickered into orange her tension diminished the indicator re turned to green she wrote to secure employment turning the page alice discovered the photograph of the con test and the question do you know or recognize any of the persons here depicted the indicator light glowed yellow then orange she deliberated a moment and the color became yellow green presently she filled in all the boxes with s at box the light glowed pink she quickly turned the page to avoid looking at the photograph and her tension diminished slowly into green what is his or her name or their names the light glowed vermilion alice answered the question with a dash what are the circumstances of your acquaintance the light glowed red alice answered with a second dash ifengaged when can you start work the light cooled quickly into green and greenish blue as if in relief at once the questionnaire now was complete as alice reread it ger sen watched her face this slender redhaired girl was the instru ment of howard alan treesong conceivably she knew him by another name and in this case she might or might not know his reputation in due course the truth would become known ger sen rose to his feet and sauntered across the room she looked up with an uncertain smile ive just finished fhp dtmon princfs gersen glanced at the responses this looks to be in order youre originally from terranova it appears yes my family moved out into virgo five years ago my father is well a consultant at wild isle have you ever been there no i understand its rather a different environment than here gersen contrived to speak in a voice of tired disapproval alice encompassed him with a glance expressionless save for a nicker of wonder she responded without intonation yes its a kind of dreamland not altogether real out of idle curiosity why did you leave alice shrugged i wanted to travel and see something of other worlds do you intend to go back i hardly know at the moment im only interested in working for extant ive always wanted to be a journalist gersen paced slowly back and forth hands behind his back a figure of pompous elegance lie spoke in a ponderous voice allow me a moment to consult mrs ench ill find what positions are open certainly sir gersen wandered through the contest room where a dozen clerks processed great stacks of contest envelopes he checked the computer readout thirteen persons already had identified number seven as john gray and ten knew number five as sabor vidol identifications which might well be considered definite the tall gaunt man with the philosophers forehead and the foxy aw was known by a variety of names bentley strange fred framp kynl kyster mr wharfish silas sparkhammer arthur artleby wilton freebus a dozen more gersen returned to his office alice wroke had moved to a chair close to his desk gersen halted to look at her admiring the pleasant accord between her orangered curls and her dusky ivory tan skin she smiled why are you inspecting me so gersen spoke in his most pompous and nasal voice if nothing else miss wroke you are indeed a most decorative bit of work though i will ask should you choose to enter our employment that you dress a bit more sedately then i am to be hired tonight we will check your references and i am sure that they the book of drkws will reinforce my favorable opinion of you i suggest that you report for work tomorrow at the second gong thank you very much mr lucas alices smile conveyed no great emotion if anything she seemed strained and disheartened where will i be working at the moment mrs ench is adequately staffed however i need an assistant to manage the office when i am out i believe that you are well equipped to handle the job thank you mr lucas alice rose to her feet she turned gersen a glance over her shoulder flirtatious demure puzzled sad and apprehensive in equal proportions she departed the office gersen looked after her curious most curious a former colleague recalls howard alan treesong then about eighteen years old when they worked at the philadelphia factory of the elite candy company he was restless and fluid and unpredictable like a puddle of quicksilver on a table but i always got along well with him he seemed mild and rational certainly he was clever and amusing and he had an inclination for wild practical jokes sometimes he carried the mischief too far much too far one day he brought in a box of dead bugs cock roaches bumblebees beetles and carefully fixed up a box of chocolate creams each candy containing a big bug he put it out for shipment and said to me with a faraway look on his face i wonder who will receive my little surprise but that wasnt what got him fired there was a foolish old lady named fat aggie who always wore hightopped black shoes which she took off when she sat down to work howard stole the shoes and filled them to the brim with peanut fondant in one and our supreme molasses taffy delight in the other then put them back under aggies chair that trick cost howard his job i never saw him again in the morning alice wroke appeared at the extant offices wear ing a skirt and jacket of a soft blue stuff which clung lovingly to her slender haunches a black ribbon confined her orange hair coming through the old black wood doorway she made an arresting the book of drkms picture she was intelligent enough to realize as much so gersen felt assured the costume was hardly as conservative as that which he had suggested but he decided to let the matter rest he gained nothing by exaggerating his role as a pompous frump alice wroke who seemed not only intelligent but perceptive might not be de ceived good morning mr lucas said alice in a soft voice what do you wish me to do this morning the valet at penwipers had laid out for gersen gray trousers with a lavender pinstripe a black frock coat pinched at the shoulders flaring at the hips with a white highcollared shirt and a blackandlavender striped cravat to which the chief porter had added a black hat with a foppish sideslanting brim and a purple ribbon in the costume gersen felt cramped and constricted he needed only to hunch his shoulders to split the coat down the back his discomfort and annoyance together with the need to hold his chin high over the stiff collar imposed upon him a manner which might easily be interpreted as priggish disdain for the commonalty with whom he was forced to associate well so be it thought ger sen he said in a voice to suit his costume miss wroke i have taken counsel with mrs ench and temporarily at least you will be assisting me in the capacity of private secretary i am discovering more paperwork than i care to handle and if i may say so you add a colorful accent to an otherwise drab office alice wroke gave a small involuntary grimace of annoyance which amused gersen a most peculiar situation alice wroke were she intimately associated with howard alan treesong must be a wicked woman indeed hard to believe gersen invented work to keep alice occupied and went out to check the tabulations incoming mail now filled a bin six clerks opened the entries examined the contents entered the information into the rational izer gersen went to the readout screen at the end of the room which only he and mrs ench were allowed to use he touched a button to call up the tabulations to date nineteen persons now had identified number as john gray of four winds on alphanor his identity might be regarded as certain the same could be said for number sabor vidol of london earth number sharrod yest of nova bactria and num ber a gieselman of long parade espandencia algenib ix number was known far and wide across the oilumene by a variety the demon princps of names kyril kyster timothy trimmons bentley strange fred framp silas sparkhammer wilson wtiarfish oberon number was named twice as lan bilfred of the pallas technical institute at pallas alcyone gersen returned to his office remembering as he passed through the door to reassume the role of henry lucas during his absence alice had reconsidered her tactics now the better to manipulate this overdressed dunderhead she thought to try breezy affability perhaps even a bit of flirtation good enough thought gersen why not i wonder if i have read any of your articles mr lucas your name is very familiar possibly miss wroke quite possibly do you have special subjects you write about crime vice dreadful deeds alice looked at him askance really gersen realized that for an instant he had let his mask slip he made an airy gesture someone must write such things how else is the public to know but you hardly seem the sort to be interested in such things oh what topics would you consider appropriate for me again alice turned him a glance of wary speculation civilized things she said brightly the best restaurants for instance or the wines of earth or lily milk or si shi shim dancing gersen gave his head a sad shake those arent my subjects what of yourself oh im not expert at anything this si shi shim dancing how does it go well one needs the proper music gongs water flutes a kur daitsy thats a rather repulsive trained beast which squeals when its tail is pulled the costumes are mostly feather anklets but nei ther the dancers nor the audience seem to mind actually i cant do it well if at all oh come im sure youre overmodest how does it go please mr lucas suppose someone looked into the office and saw me gyrating about what would they think quite right said gersen we must set an example of de l a precious ceramic ware produced along the susimara islands of yellow sun planer the book of dreams corum at least during working hours where are you staying now im still at st diarmids alice wrokes response was guarded and cool youre here alone that is to say you have no local friends or relatives i am quite alone mr lucas why do you ask simple curiosity miss wroke i hope that you are not of fended alice gave a tolerant shrug returned to the work which gersen at some effort had contrived for her at noon a caterers van arrived at the premises lunch was served to mrs ench and her clerks in a small refectory to gersen and alice wroke in gersens office alice expressed surprise at the arrangements why dont we all eat together im curious as to how the contest is going gersen gave his head a magisterial shake that is not possible my superiors have stipulated maximum security especially in view of the rumor rumor what rumor is that a notorious criminal has interested himself in the contest thats the rumor personally i am skeptical still who knows weve even arranged sleeping accommodations here for our clerks they wont leave the premises until after a winner is declared it seems a bit exaggerated said alice who is the notorious criminal its absolute rubbish declared gersen loftily i refuse to dis seminate such nonsense alice became haughty im really not interested and during the lunch she retreated into herself from time to time darting opaque glances toward gersen after lunch gersen invented more work for alice then carefully set the slantbrimmed hat on his head ill be gone an hour or so very well mr lucas gersen went to the penwipers hotel from his room he called st diarmids inn miss alice wroke please after a pause the receptionist replied miss wroke is not cur rently in the hotel sir i believe shes in room no sir its room fhe demon princfs is any other member of her party in the room shes alone sir will you leave a message no its nothing important thank you sir gersen assembled various articles of gear packed them in a case to forestall difficulty at the front desk he changed into af ternoon wear then departed the hotel at this time of day afternoon tea break the dank old streets of pontefract were crowded with men in flarebottomed brown and black suits and buxom pinkfaced women in voluminous patterned skirts and black capes gersen soon arrived at st diarmids inn he entered and surveyed the lobby but saw nothing he could con sider consequential he approached the registration counter and pretended to make calculations on a sheet of paper the clerk watched a moment then approached sir may i oblige you gersen wrote several numbers on his paper while the clerk watched in perplexity i need a room for several days or a week during the numerologists congress mathematical vibrations in dicate number and i will engage this room gersen placed an svu on the counter and the clerk hastened to consult a readout screen a pity sir that room is already engaged then i must have either or i can oblige you with room sir it will serve adequately i am aldo bnse established in room gersen went to the wall and placed a microphone against the paneling from came no sound in the corner he dropped to his knees drilled a minute hole and inserted a nearinvisible audio pickup he attached a recorder which then he coupled to the telephone he placed the recorder in a drawer opened the circuit made tests and departed returning to his office he entered stalked across the room carefully doffed his hat placed it on a shelf then he favored alice with a stately nod to which she returned a demure murmur and a quiet sideglance from under her long dark lashes gersen settled himself at his desk with a grunt sat frowning into space for five minutes as if deep m thought then he rose to his feet went out into the passage and so to the workroom the clerks were at the full tide of work gersen looked over the book of drea ms the current listing at the rationalizer identification of all the sub ects could now be considered complete save for number who was known by a variety of names as yet no one had used the name howard alan treesong gersen went back to his office alice looked up from her desk how goes the contest extremely well from a promotional standpoint response ex ceeds our proection by seventeen percent but no one has won the grand prize not yet why did you use that particular photograph gersen went to his desk and seated himself with the gravity of a judge he spoke m his nasal voice i have never thought it ap propriate to ask alice pulled in the corners of her mouth but said nothing after a moment gersen put the tips of his fingers together tt think that i can inform you in absolute confidence of course that all our subects except one have been correctly identified alice gave an indifferent shrug im not all that interested mr lucas come now said gersen heavily facetious lets not have our noses out of joint i believe you mentioned that your home is cyth erea tempestre for several years now yes i understand that people conduct themselves most informally on cytherea alice considered im not sure i know what you mean by in formally isnt there often let us say a bit ofexcess yes thats occasionally true tourists often misbehave when theyre away from home some of the worst offenders are from pontefract gersen laughed alice watching him sidelong thought the id iot iv human after all have you ever visited the wild isle casinos im told people gamble away vast sums of money they can hardly expect to win gersen said with plangent severity the money they lose lines the pockets of notorious criminals so ive heard said alice my father lines his pockets so to ihf dp un princts speak at the casinos but i dont think that he is a notorious crim inal i should hope not is he a gambler to the contrary he designs gambling machines and adjusts them so that they fleece the gamblers he finds his work entertain ing ive heard him say that he lacks all sympathy for gamblers he considers them selfindulgent foolish and lazy if not psychotic alice inspected gersen with an innocent expression hope that youre not a gambler mr lucas i wouldnt care to hurt your feel ings rest easy miss wroke i am neither vulnerable to casual dep recation nor a gambler in regard to the contest which one has not yet been properly identified gersen said evenly number six when will the contest be over i dont know gersen looked at his watch i have no further work for you today miss wroke you may leave at any time thank you mr lucas alice slipped on her acket and went to the door she paused and gave gersen a tentative smile will there be anything more tonight mr lucas no thank you miss wroke ill see you in the morning alice departed gersen went out into the contest room and stood watching the operatives then he returned to his office re moved his coat and subjected walls windows floor ceiling and all the contents of the room to a slow and expert inspection had the need arisen he could have carried detection devices to measure the quiver of energy flux but the process might well attract attention to his vigilance high in a corner of the ceiling he noticed a few strands of web which might have been spun by a spider something the eye would slide away from unheeding after five minutes of scrutiny he decided that the web indeed was the work of a spider and brushed it away he sat in his chair collar open cravat loose and reflected the time was now late afternoon gersen went out into the workroom to find that the evening shift had come on duty he watched a moment then adjusting his garments for the street departed the office and strolled through cool evening mist to penwipers the doorman acknowledged his arrival with a grave bow the the book of drems footman hurried forward to take his hat and to assist him up the stairs as if he were a centenarian gersen went up to his rooms he removed his coat and seated himself at the telephone he hesitated hand in midair he gave a snort of sour mirth eavesdrop devices at penwipers unthink able to make absolutely sure after all the doors were innocent of locks he tested the premises with his detector the specifications of which he himself laid down the room was clean of spy cells gersen went to the telephone and called room at st diar mids inn mr bnse is not in stated his answering device please leave a message gersen spoke a code word to activate the recorder a musical tone notified him that material had been recorded and announced the time of the reception only half an hour previously the first sound was alices voice mr albert strand please thank you madam an institutional voice thought gersen a moment later hullo alice hello mr sparkhammer i tish alice also tush remember here i am the gentleman albert strand of the wambs county strands sorry does it make any difference wtio knows the voice was airy we are dealing with clever people not that we cant deal with them but let us nurture our advantages boldness power stealth decision let these be our watchwords dont forget fear said alice in a soft bitter voice and of course fear so then what have you learned this was a rich voice under exquisite lilting control gersen listened with rapt attention alice responded in a voice almost without expression this morning when i arrived at work mr lucas told me i vas to be his private secretary oh dear me i had not reckoned upon that so then what of mr lucas he is careful about security extremely so am not allowed into the contest room today i tried twice while he was out but mrs ench turned me away i asked mr lucas how the contest was i hp dp mon princes going and he became insufferably pompous he said that everyone in the picture had been identified except one number six no one as yet has come near winning the prize and that is all im afraid so mr lucas says very little hes a silly over dressed fool but rather a cunning fool if you gather my meaning perfectly still it seems that he is not impervious to your rather remarkable charms well im not sure well then find out we cant waste time i have important commitments in the near future ill do my best mr strand alice hesitated then said ac tually youve never explained exactly what you want me to find out havent though mr strands voice became briefly acrid and venomous find out why they are using this specific picture when and where did they get it theres something going on something in back of this contest and i want to know what the conversation ended on the following day alice made her second report mr strand i am here alice i dont have much to tell you today was much like yesterday i tried to talk about the contest but mr lucas wont answer my questions he just sits and looks down his nose at me time is becoming critical alice mr strand spoke in a harsh hissing voice curiously at odds with his mellifluous tones of the day before i want results you know the circumstances alices voice became dull ill try again tomorrow you had better try something effective but i cant think of anything he is totally secretive take him to bed its hard to be secretive without any clothes on mr sparkhammer i mean mr strand i cant behave like that i wouldnt know how tush alice everyone knows how mr strand chuckled and his voice lost its menacing rasp rising in pitch to become gay quick and almost brittle in quality if you must you can and indeed you must mr strand really i dont the book of drea ws alice you make such an affair of it all its most simple you smile at him he takes you to dinner one thing leads to another and presently you find yourselves without your clothes mr lucas is panting like a beached haddock you start to snivel my dear alice cries mr lucas why at this ecstatic moment all these tears because mr lucas i am sad and afraid you are only trifling with me isnt it true not so alice i am ardent cant you tell the thought of your orange curls on that white pillow yonder sets me aquiver feel my pulse trifling never i am deadly in earnest but you treat me like an outsider wtly cant you truly dem onstrate your regard for me i am ready and anxious to do so not in that fashion i want your full trust and esteem for instance when i show a natural interest in office affairs such as the contest you turn away your head this is why i am sad hrrumph harra i wouldnt want so petty a matter to come between us tomorrow at the office no henry you might become cold again you must tell me now to prove your faith well its really a simple matter and so out come all the secrets in a great vulgar belch in the morning tired but happy you communicate what you have learned to me and all will be well otherwise here mr strand paused otherwise and his voice dropped half an octave i can offer no such assurance i see you can handle the job i suppose so remember time is of the essence as i have a commitment which cannot be disrupted a gathering of old school chums in fact so please put your best efforts into this project in the manner which i have outlined after all you were brought here to ponte fract for precisely this function ill do my best mr strand your best im sure will be adequate the conversation ended there was silence in the room from fauna of the vegan worlds volume iii the fish ofaloysius by rapunzel k funk gaid also known as the nighttram this is a splendid fish of a lustrous black color often reaching a length of twenty feet the body is exceptionally well shaped with an almost round cross section the head is large and blunt with a single visual bulb an aural pod and a wide mouth which when open displays an impressive dentition imme diately behind the head and almost to the tail grows a row of dorsal spines to the number of fiftyone each tipped with a lummophor which at night emits a bright blue light by day the gaid swims beneath the surface where it feeds upon wracken borse and similar creatures at sun down the nighttrain rises to the surface and cruises steadily with all lights aglow the pelagic voyages of the nighttrain remain a mys tery the fish peregrinates on a direct course as if to a spec ified destination this may be a cape or an island or perhaps an unmarked station in the middle of the ocean upon reaching its destination the nighttram halts floats quietly for half an hour as if discharging cargo or taking on pas sengers or awaiting orders then it swings about with ma jestic and ponderous deliberation it hears a signal and sets off once more to its next destination which well may be five thousand miles distant the book of drea ms to come upon this noble fish by night as it cleaves the black waters of the aloysian oceans is a stirring experience indeed gersen felt restless on edge he went out into the evening and wandered the crooked streets of pontefract somewhat to his surprise he found himself at st diarmids inn he halted and looked along what was by pontefract standards a garish facade of pale blue and purple tiles gersen moved on across mullawney square into portee old town a tawdry district of tav erns odd shops artists studios fnedfish booths and discreet brothels each showing an illuminated greenglass globe in accor dance with ancient law presently he arrived at the waterfront he stood looking across bottleglass bay to the far lights of port rufus a breeze brought him the smell of the aloysian mud flats gersen had stood beside many shores on many worlds no two had smelled alike at the end of a nearby pier a string of colored lights festooned the front of a restaurant gersen walked out on the pier looked into the restaurant which seemed cheerful and clean with redcheckered cloths on the tables the name of the restaurant was murdocks bay view grill gersen entered and dined upon the house specialties which were in the main derived from the ocean aloysian cooking tended to blandness murdock however seemed to have no fear of sharp herbs and piquant sauces gersen sat a long time looking out the windows toward the lights of port rums and listening to the mutter of slow waves on the ancient piles below it seemed that as time went bv gersen found himself ever more susceptible to strange moods to which no name could be applied in the early years his emotions focused along a single axis hate grief revengeful lust he had been humorless clenched passionate only in his dedication now there were numerous axes in many directions was the intensity thereby diluted a profitless line of inquiry his strategies so he reflected were at least partially ef fective howard alan treesong had been lured into tantalizing proximity conceivably in pontefract itself possibly at this instant he strolled the cramped old streets or took his ease in one of the formal hotels where now he sat thinking dire thoughts contriving plans fhe demon princes gersen looked around the restaurant somewhere howard treesong might be at his evening repast among the patrons of murdocks bay view grill there was no tall spare man with a phi losophers forehead and a cunning foxy aw treesong was else where gersen went to the telephone called the penwipers hotel henry lucas here has my friend mr strand registered no what about mr sparkhammer no one of that name ei ther then do me a service if you please with discretion do not mention my name try to find where mr strand and mr sparkhammer are staying ill do my best sir gersen returned to his table small chance of locating treesong so easily he must be teased baited and tricked and alice wroke must necessarily be the intermediary it would be a fascinating game mused gersen especially since alice thought him pompous stuffy vain overdressed and silly gersen departed the restaurant and returned to penwipers the desk clerk as expected had been unable to locate either mr strand or mr sparkhammer gersen assured him that the affair was of no consequence and went to his room no one had passed through the door since his departure the telltale he had installed was still in place in the morning the valet outdid himself and dressed gersen m a costume so splendid that even the doorman stared in admiration gersen arrived at the extant offices to find alice wroke already at her desk gersen gave her a civil greeting to which she replied in kind today she wore a kneelength skirt of a dark brown stuff and an ashbeige singlet which suited her coloring to perfection the costume showed her slender figure to advantage her orange hair had been brushed till it shone sitting at his desk gersen pre tended to ignore her presence several times glancing across the room he found her eyes upon him pondering appraising won dering gersen went out into the contest workroom mrs ench brought him a letter a near winner mr lucas perhaps even a winner and how very strange it all is gersen read the letter the book op wxvfs contest manager extant ponterract aloysius sirs can identify the persons in your photograph it was my duty to attend them at the terrible event which cost them their lives this photograph was taken in the rain flower room at wild isle inn they are about to sup on the charnay which unaccountably poisoned them all save only mr sparkhammer the names of those at the table are reading from left to right sharrod yest dianthe de trembuscule beatrice utz robun martiletto sabor vidol stanley sparkhammer john gray the men standing are lan bilfred a gleselman artemus gadouth i know their names from the place cards which i myself prepared two other men were present neither of them ate charnay and so both survived the picture incidentally is customarily made m order to record the sign of the chef who prepared each serving of charnay the signs are the little colored signal posts of each place in this case the wonder persists as several chefs prepared the charnay poi son was evidently transmitted by a tainted utensil i trust that i have satisfied the conditions of your contest and will win the prize cletus parsrval wild isle inn wild isle cyntherea tempestre most interesting said gersen the letter is evidently gen uine the demon princes so it seems to me mrs ench turned gersen a curious glance did you know what this parsival fellow tells us that these men died of poison i am as surprised as you but it wont hurt extants circula tion why would anyone eat this charnay if it is known to be poi son very strange goingson exactly so mrs ench well this mr parsival seems to have the names correctly said mrs ench all except number six sparkhammer is not his proper name hmmf said mrs ench that number six is a willothe wisp in the matter of identity yes he seems a strange case id be inclined to name mr parsival the winner and let be said mrs ench surely no one has given us so long a list im inclined to agree said gersen but still well have to wait out the rest of the contest how is the mail about the same perhaps slacking a trifle very well mrs ench keep up the good work and ask your people to be most attentive in regard to mention of number six i will do so mr lucas unlike alice wroke mrs rnch considered gersen a polite and gracious gentleman without any side to him as she put it to her sister gersen returned with the letter to his office alice asked brightly do you have exciting news gersen ponderously settled himself at his desk alice waited her face frozen in a mask of cheerful expectancy gersen spoke in his most nasal and affected drawl as a matter of fact we have a letter identifying all our faces correctly he claims to have inscribed the place names at the banquet then the names would seem to be correct not necessarily there is one very dubious identification oh which one gersen darted her a stern glance im not sure that its proper for me to comment upon these matters alice not just yet any way alices face fell she gave a small grimace gersen watching surreptitiously thought now she considers how best to arrange her begiiilements the book of dreams alice jumped to her feet went to the commode where she poured two cups of tea she placed one of these before gersen took the other to her own desk where she poised herself half leaning halfsitting have you always lived here in pontefract mr lucas i have traveled of course to many places alice sighed pontefract seems so impersonal even a bit dreary after five years at wild isle gersen proffered no sympathy i cant understand why you came here in the first place alice gave a dainty shrug a dozen reasons wanderlust rest lessness have you ever visited cytherea never im told that its a most hedonistic environment and that the residents live very unconventional lives alice laughed and turned gersen a saucy sideglance in some cases thats true but not all at wild isle youll find every range oflifestyle my mother is almost as conventional as you gersen raised his black eyebrows what you consider me conventional yes to some extent aha gersen gave a scornful grunt as if to imply that alices opinions were callow and superficial tell me more about wild isle is it true that criminals manage the casinos that is a considerable exaggeration said alice my father is not a criminal but no one ever wins naturally not do you ever go into the casinos no its not at all amusing wild isle is a city its more like a tourist resort casinos hotels restaurants yacht harbors beaches and lots of little villas in the hills its no longer wild of course have you ever visited a charnay restaurant alice turned him a look of wary perplexity no what is charnay like well its a purple fruit with rough skin inside tubes full of poison run along the husk the fruit itself is said to be delicious but ive never tried it i dont want to die and its fearfully expen sive the dkmon princes gersen leaned back in his chair weve received a suggestion that our contest photograph depicts a charnay banquet alice picked up a copy of the photograph and examined it yes that might well be true very strange you might have passed some of these people in the street alices response was cool possible but not likely thousands of transients pass through wild isle and theres no indication when the picture was taken it might be ten years old its a recent picture everyone has been identified and were now into authentication so someone has won the contest i made no such statement alice asked ingenuously how did you come by the picture i rescued it from the trash can as a matter of fact but i mustnt gossip about the contest all results are not yet in why dont you take the rest of the day off alice ill be busy away from the office thank you mr lucas i dont quite know what to do with myself im acquainted with no one in town but yourself and youre so remote wtiat nonsense declared gersen you cant really think i so but i do perhaps you dont think it proper to have social contacts with the staff is that company policy im sure theres no such rule do you think im dowdy and plain to the contrary said gersen in all sincerity i consider you most engaging extraordinarily so im sorry that you find ponte fract so dreary perhaps we might have supper together sometime alices lips trembled a smile a grimace in a demure voice she said that would be nice wtiy not tonight wtiy not indeed let me see where are you staying st diarmids inn ill meet you in the lobby at median i feel much better already mr lucas in praise of charnay of all the good things to be had in this bountiful universe there is nothing to exceed a fine ripe charnay except two or three more of the same from gustations by michael wiest if one must die and this seems to be the general fate why perform the act in mean and vulgar style rather die splendidly in a manner all will envy engorged with char nay gillian seal chef musician and bon vivant believe or disbelieve as you will but a safe salubrious and nonpoisonous charnay could easily be developed grown and harvested but every effort in this direction has been thwarted by the charnay growers association nor is there any great public clamor for such a development is it pos sible that the admittedly fine flavor of charnay is enhanced by the presence of awful danger leon wolke journalist writing for cosmopolis who two weeks after publication of his article ate improperly prepared charnay and died st diarmids inn had passed through the hands of various owners each had contributed original ideas to the decor eventually pro ducing an effect of considerable novelty the lobby occupied the the demon princes entire ground floor heavy columns decorated in ancient cretan style supported the ceiling which was patterned in lavender and pink beside each column rhodanthus palms in terracotta pots grew to the ceiling where the bare boles terminated in balls of dark green foliage by vegan standards the decor was garish the move ment of many folk in costumes from every corner of the oileu mene added life and drama to the hectic and vaguely disheveled atmosphere which characterized st diarmids gersen arrived punctiliously on time wearing what the valet had considered appropriate for an informal evening on the town skintight black trousers a shirt vertically striped in black dark gray and light gray with a high black neckband in lieu of a cravat the black jacket responsive to the dictates of high pontefract style was cut away in front cramped at the shoulders and almost bellshaped around the hips gersen had refused a plumed hat and the valet somewhat sulkily had allowed him the use of a soft square black cap with his harsh saturnine face black curls and pallid skin tone he made a striking picture one which however brought him sat isfaction other than a kind of mischievous pleasure in playing dis guises and bemddling poor alice wroke gersen saw her coming along the central aisle looking diffi dently this way and that gersen examined her as if he had never seen her before the wistful mouth short delicate nose cheeks slant ing to a small chin tonight her orange hair hung loosely past her ears almost to the shoulders of her simple smoke gray frock she saw gersen her expression became charged with a syn thetic enthusiasm she nipped up her hand in a gay greeting and crossed the room at a half trot to halt ten feet from gersen she gave him an admiring headtotoe inspection i must say mr lu cas that you turn yourself out most elegantly its penwipers all the way said gersen give the credit to my valet alice heard him without any great comprehension still smiling brightly she said well then where shall we dine here the escutcheon room is pleasant too loud too crowded said gersen i know a place far more exclusive i place myself completely in your hands said alice this way then out into the vegan night they left st diarmids and alice gingerly took gersens arm where are we going the book of dreams s its a pleasant night said gersen we can walk if you like i dont mind they crossed mullawney square to beaudry lane and so into partee old town unreal muttered gersen to himself we walk the streets of pontefract she in her masquerade i in mine alice sensed something of gersens mood mr lucas why are you so somber gersen evaded the question you may call me henry we are not at the office thank you henry she looked uneasily over her shoulder i havent been in this part of town before its not at all like wild isle not at all presently they arrived at the waterfront and murdochs bay view grill alice considered gersen thoughtfully mr lucas so stuffy and meticulous seemed to have unconventional facets to his character they sat in a corner of the restaurant beside a window below them the water heaved in slow swells and sighed through the piles stars and far lights reflected from the dark surface gersen asked can you find your home star i dont know the patterns from here gersen looked around the sky its already set but theres old sol yonder their dinner was served a soup of native artichokes a stew of crustaceans onions and herbs bubbling in brown pots a salad of fresh greens alice nibbled at this and that and in response to ger sens question pleaded lack of appetite she drank several glasses of wine and achieved a degree of vivacity and what of the contest she asked is it still a mystery especially from me mystery no longer but lets not talk shop youre the mys tery tell me about yourself alice frowned out across bottleglass bay theres nothing much to tell life at wild isle isnt all that exciting except for the tourists im still baffled about why you came to pontefract oh circumstances dessert was served fruit tarts and heavy coffee smothered with cream in accordance with aloysian taste gersen who felt that he had lapsed far enough from character ihf dkmon princes attempted a ponderous analysis of pontefract politics of which he knew next to nothing alice sat apathetically looking out the win dow across the dark water her own thoughts obviously not focused on gersens remarks finally gersen asked where now there isnt much enter tainment m pontefract except at the mummery and were too late for the program would you care for a carouse in one of the taverns along the docks no i suppose we should go back to the hotel a topheavy old cab conveyed them back to st diarmids inn in the lobby gersen halted and performed a pontifical bow as if to take his leave alice said quickly oh please dont go so soon looking off across the lobby she spoke m a carefully offhand voice you can come up to my room if you like gersen protested politely but you must be tired still looking away and with a trace of a flush coming over her face alice said no not really in fact im well lonely gersen bowed formally once again in acquiescence in that case ill be happy to come up with you he took her arm they went to the lift and rode up to the fourth floor alice opened the door and walked into the room rigid as a prisoner gersen followed warily he halted m the doorway and surveyed the room alice watched incuriously not even troubling to inquire the reasons for his vigilance reassured gersen came slowly forward he closed the door henry said alice breathlessly may i call you henry ive told you so already i forgot isnt that idiotic let me take your hat and coat gersen tossed the hat into a chair and relinquished his coat thats a relief the pontefract tailors have no concept of the hu man form sit down henry there gersen obediently eased himself down upon the couch alice brought a silver tray from the sideboard what is all this asked gersen candied flower petals hydromel crystals this is liquor of life from sirsse she poured clear green tincture into a pair of small bowls at home lovers drink sirsse together said alice of course weve not lovers you and i but the book of drems but what oh nothing particular gersen tasted the liquor which seemed heady and subtle alice asked do vou like it its unusual certainly and very fragrant alice settled beside him and sipped from her own bowl it makes me feel shudder gersen was surprised to find his arm around her shoulders he had intended to maintain his decorum she relaxed against him and he kissed her rather more than sheer decorum miiht have dictated alice looked at him with pupils dark and dilated gersen asked whats wrong have i offended you oh no she laughed nervously you frighten me just a little youre so different from mr lucas at the office i dont know how to describe it theres definitely only one of me she poured out more of the liquor drink the lovers potion if you want to call it that do you have another lover no whatofyou im quite alone alice put up her face and he kissed her again her dress fell apart at the front revealing her torso and a small round breast she seemed not at all perturbed gersen heaved a deep sigh this cant go any further no alice touched his cheek i cant dispel a cruel suspicion alice stared at him m consternation wtiat do you mean id be very hurt to learn that you were cultivating me only to gain information about the contest absurd of course alice sat tense and pale absurd indeed well then could we be lovers if i told you nothing whatever about the contest this becomes so intellectual couldnt love someone who places no trust in me in other words no but i dont want it to be that way said alice earnestly gersen reflected a moment it seems that to demonstrate my trust i must tell you everything i know i hp dimon princes if you wish very well why not gersen stretched his legs out and put his hands behind his head theres really not much to tell the persons in the picture have been identified all except one whose identity is known to us under a different name from his pocket gersen brought a list from which he read names yest de trem buscule utz bilfred vidol sparkhammer gray gadouth gie selman martiletto all correct except sparkhammer who is know by dozens of other names no one has submitted his real name does that surprise you no why should it gersen tossed the list upon the table and leaned back once because he would seem to be a notorious criminal named howard alan treesong howard alan treesong that cant be true why not alice had no answer the people in the photograph are all dead except number six who is treesong what does that suggest to you alice with her thoughts far away responded with a gloomy shrug i dont understand any of this theres another aspect to the matter said gersen if num ber six is howard treesong and he surely is id like to interview him extant could very profitably use such a piece or a short au tobiography i wish i knew some way to get this message to him i want him to communicate with me alice stared across the room and away into nothingness gersen rose to his feet he picked up his coat and hat alice looked up and spoke in a husky half whisper are you going gersen nodded ive told you everything i know but you havent alice blurted despairingly how did you get the photograph i walked into the cosmopolis library i looked into the trash basket and found this photograph no one could tell me anything about it and so the extant contest was born who put the picture into the trash basket a young and foolish clerk still why did you choose this particular photograph there must have been many others equally suitable someone unknown had written treesong is here on the pic the book of ormms ture i became interested because there are no known likenesses of treesong available i felt that the picture would have considerable news value as it happens that is the case alice sat silently gersen went to the door good night alice looked at him with a tired gaze i wonder how much you know of me not a great deal is there anything you want to tell me trust works both ways alice gave her head a sad shake i havent anything to tell good night then good night alice sat where gersen had left her leaning back on the couch legs stretched out a wintry expression on her face she ran her fingers through her orange hair pushing the curls back from her forehead into a tangle for ten minutes she sat deep in reverie then rousing herself she went to the telephone and made a complicated con nection a voice spoke alice so early youre a pair of fast workers alice responded in a level voice i have your information the persons in the photograph are as follows she read names from the list gersen had left behind what is the source of these names all the different entries theres also at least one entry listing the names all correctly except one and which name is that mr lucas said that sparkhammer seems to use many differ ent names fred framp bentley strange howard alan treesong ive forgotten the rest a silence then in a different voice calm and meditative wtat did mr lucas make of this i think hes anxious that mr sparkhammer or mr treesong should get m touch with him for an interview he wants to publish mr treesongs autobiography the response was prompt and definite he is doomed to dis appointment mr sparkhammer or mr treesong whatever his name has no taste for such a vulgar antic how did extant come into possession of the photograph mr lucas found it in a trash basket in the covrnopolis library a clerk had thrown it away odd most odd are these facts s ihf dfmon princps think so how did the photograph arrive at cosmopohsv i didnt think to ask i suppose it came in whatever way is usual and what led him to select this particular photograph someone had written on it treesong is here that attracted mr lucass attention so he proposed a contest to identify mr treesong and his colleagues that is what he told me did he say why he said he very much wanted to publish mr treesongs au tobiography as i told you he wants mr treesong to get in touch with him small chance of that mr treesong is very busy with urgent affairs mr strand became silent for so long an interval that alice began to fidget then what else did he tell you not very much he knows that the photograph was taken at wild isle and that everyone died of charnay except mr sparkham n mer another long silence then very good alice in the main you have done well i can go back home and you will do as you promised not yet oh dear no not yet you must remain at your post keep your eyes and ears open this henry lucas person what do you make of him alice spoke in a bleak voice i dont know what to make of him hes a contradiction hmmf that tells me nothing but no matter continue as before tomorrow i am going away and for a day or so you will not be able to reach me continue your intimacy with mr lucas i have a feeling that there is something more here beyond what he has told you for how long in due course i will let you know mr strand ive done all i can please alice i have no time for your complaints continue as before and all will be well is this understood i suppose so good night then good night excerpt from an address by nicholas reid fellow of the institute phase at the madera technical col lege the institute is dedicated to human excellence we try to augment beneficial processes and discourage those which are morbid and septic our credo derives from the history of the human race which evolved across millions of years in the natural envi ronment what happens when a saltwater fish is transferred into fresh water it goes into spasms and dies consider then a creature whose every sense capability and instinct have been shaped by the natural environment by interaction with sun wind clouds rain the look of mountains and far horizons the taste of natural food contact with the soil wtiat happens when this creature is transferred to a syn thetic environment he becomes neurotic a victim of hys terical fads willful hallucination sexual perversion he deals with abstractions rather than facts and so becomes mtellectuahzed and incompetent confronted with a real challenge he screams curls into a ball closes his eyes be fouls himself and waits he is a pacifist who fears to defend himself from better understanding of the institute by charles bronstem ihf dimon princes urbanized men and women experience not life but the abstraction of life on ever higher levels of refinement and dislocation from reality they become processors of ideas and have evolved such esoteric occupations as the critic the critic who criticizes criticism and even the critic who crit icizes criticism of criticism it is a very sad misuse of human talent and energy from the institute a pf imef by mary murray our tutelar genius is the titan antaeus urbanity is an unnatural habitude are we elitist as it is often asserted well we surely do not consider ourselves the dregs of society we approve of contrast social disequilibrium extremes of wealth often we are accused of sponsoring chaos however this has never been admitted the urbanites strike back elitist prigs if they like the pleistocene so much why dont they wear skins and live m caves residents of very lofty and very remote ivory towers which they confuse with natural habitat id rather push a pencil in an airconditioned office than push a wheelbarrow in the mud in almost the same terms id rather pick flaws in someones manuscript than pick tomatoes in the hot sun again id rather drive my fissel flasher than a balky mule the rook of dreams gersen stood at a window of his sitting room at penwipers brood ing down across old tara square the time was midnight tara square was dark and still starlight illuminated the roofs of pon teftact casting black shadows down tall gables under crooked eaves and thousands of crotchety chimney pots gersens mood was reflected in his posture he felt morose and drained of energy the great scheme had failed the program had gone with precision howard treesong had reacted as positively as gersen could have hoped in alice wroke he had found a conduit leading to treesong then almost casually defeat for whatever motives pride press of affairs the workings of his uncanny war iness howard treesong had refused to consider the publication of his autobiography or so much as an interview there was no further leverage to be found in the contest in the morning he would put mrs ench in charge of the entire pro ect what next alice wroke remained his single avenue of access to howard treesong but the linkage had become fragile and un certain two questions remained unanswered how did howard tree song control alice wroke why had howard treesong poisoned nine people with charnay the answers were probably to be found at wild isle but so gersen reflected glumly the information would most likely be stale and useless of far more interest what was howard treesongs present ur gent business of this alice wroke evidently knew nothing no other source of information suggested itself gersen looked over the starlit roofs in the pubs of partee old town lights would still be burning he looked toward st diarmids inn and wondered if alice wroke was still awake gersen turned away from the window and stood motionless then he threw off the penwipers shirt donned a dark gray space mans blouse pulled a soft cap down over his forehead and started for the door a chime at the communicator turned him back he stood frowning at the instrument who would be calling him at this hour the screen came alive and presented the long pale face of maxel rackrose mr lucas the demon princes speaking rackrose spoke in a carefully languid voice the information you wanted authentications and so forth has come together ex cept for a few bits and pieces maxel rackrose spoke with such hushed restraint that gersen instantly became alert rackrose said without any great conviction i do hope i havent jerked you from your bed no i was on my way out the door then why dont you step over to the office for a few minutes i think youll be interested in whats turned up til be right there the cosmopolis offices were never closed work proceeded every hour of the day every day of the year a tall glass door whisked aside at gersens approach he entered the foyer where luminous slabs of colored glass blacked out a mercator map of earth gersen rode a lift high into the north tower and so to the offices of maxel rackrose who now used the title superintendent of miscellaneous operations the outer chamber which reflected rackroses pose of fastidious sophistication was an exercise in the most exquisite excesses of the high clapshott style the inner room where rackrose spent most of his time was a jungle of dis order a long table supported stacks of books and periodicals pa pers photographs oddments curios and perplexing trifles of junk there were several stools a communicator a complicated device for the brewing of tea another for the projection of kaleidoscopic patterns on the wall an attenuated statue of a nude womait nine feet tall whose belly opened on the hour to permit a bird to step forth and cry cuckoo rackrose a tall angular young man in expensive if unconven tional garments with a long somewhat equine face lank blond hair and heavylidded blue eyes greeted gersen in a carefully offhand manner sit down if you will he waved a limp white hand to ward one of his precious antique chairs perhaps youd take a cup of tea and a biscuit that would be nice with tea poured and anise cakes set forth rackrose settled into a chair beside a kidneyshaped table and how goes your contest quite well one entry names nine of ten and if no one does the book of dreams better i think well nominate him the winner what of your au thentications rackrose leaned back pressed the tips of his fingers together looked toward the ceiling with pursed lips in accordance with your instructions i processed all available information i started with the index and information from our own files i may say that there was no trouble with authentication the subjects are persons of substance and reputation except for number six none of his purported names correlates with anything other than disreputable activities in short he seems to be a crim inal what of the others aha thats where we make an interesting discovery i found recurring references to the institute and such remarks as said to rank high in the hierarchy and an apparently highranking fel low in fact beatrice utz is identified as artemus gadouth was the triune maxel rackrose paused to allow gersen to reflect upon the implications of his information gersen studied the photograph which he already knew in mi nute detail a startling suspicion formed in gersens mind an idea strange and terrible ten faces could it be the dexad the same idea occurred to me said rackrose gersen reflected a moment rackrose knew nothing of the a directory or identities originally compiled by the ipcc and continually augmented by other agencies the index includes the records of history social welfare registrations military rosters passenger lists of interplanetary vessels birth marriage and death records telephone directories school and university graduation lists criminal identifications the memberships of clubs associations and fellowships names culled from the daily news bv automatic scanners the institute grades its fellows with ranks through number is the triune ranks and are always empty ranks through are limited to a single fellow with the triune these ranks make up the dexad though as often the nine fellows from through are known as the dexad fellows advance from to triune in order of precedence three fellows only occupy rank when a vacancy occurs in the dexad usually by reason of death surviving fellows elect one of die three s to fill the vacancy from the three fellows in rank one is elected to rank similarly fellows advance up the ranks from below there is no limit upon the fellows allowed into each rank to achieve rank is difficult to attain rank is much more difficult a fellow elected to rank has a good chance of becoming triune this is not necessarily true in rank where a fellow who has made enemies among the dexad may never be advanced the demon princes charnay poisonings nor did he realize that number six was howard alan treesong he asked who ranks highest locally rackrose frowned toward the ceiling theres a hermit out on boniface who is supposed to rank high ive heard hes in the dexad if so this picture would not seem to be the dexad because theres no one here from boniface who ranks high in pontefract im not sure let me ask condo he knows such things rack rose spoke into the communicator using a soft voice only a trifle louder than a whisper he made notes on a pad of pale pink paper good enough he turned back to gersen with a page torn from his pad her name is leta goynes she lives at seventeen flaherty crescent out in bray and she might be as high as a sixty or sixty five gersen took the address to his own small office which was far less splendid than that of maxel rackrose at his communicator he placed a call a moment passed then an unemphatic female voice spoke leta goynes here im sorry to disturb you at this late hour mrs goynes my name is kirth gersen and i want to consult you on a matter of great importance now unfortunately yes its institute business of extreme urgency if youll allow me ill come directly out to your house where are you now at the cosmopolis offices take transit to bray junction a cab will bring you out to flaherty crescent as gersen approached the cottage at flaherty crescent the door slid back backlighted in the opening stood a darkhaired woman sturdy solid and obviously in good physical condition she gave gersen a cursory inspection and stood back gersen entered the door closed behind him this way said leta goynes and led him to a neat parlor tea yes please she poured and handed gersen a cup sit anywhere you like thank you gersen seared himself leta goynes remained standing a rather handsome woman in her early maturity her black the book of dreams hair cut close to her head her eyes dark and direct under strong black eyebrows there is no kirth gersen known to cosmopolis for a good reason i call myself henry lucas special writer you are a fellow no longer at phase eleven i discovered that the institute and i often worked at odds with each other leta goynes smiling faintly inclined her head in a terse nod so then gersen handed her the contest photograph have you seen this it appeared in extant i havent seen it before what do you make of it nothing particular you recognize no one no one it might well be the dexad artemus gadouth is this gentle man he is triune as i suppose you are aware leta goynes nodded ive never met him this is sharrod yest dianthe de trembuscule beatrice utz rank one hundred three lan bilfred this gentleman calls himself sparkhammer sabor vidol rank ninetynine john gray gadouth gieselman rank one hundred six robun martiletto gersen paused leta goynes said this is not the entire dexad there are three persons those numbers five six and seven who are prob ably ninetynine last month we lost eimo shookey this banquet precedes so i presume the elevation of a ninetynine the elevation may not have occurred said gersen all ex cept number six were poisoned by charnay leta goyness face became cool and faintly scornful the in stitute is not only strong it is flexible normal adjustments are being made in this case the adjustment will not be so easy the survivor number six poisoned the others his name is howard alan tree song leta goynes stared at the photograph that is terrible infor mation if it is true and i see that it must be true how did he gain rank ninetynine through fraud extortion fear mind bending so i suppose certainly he never rose through the ranks but a more important the demon princes question what members of the dexad are missing from the pic ture and where are these members leta goynes managed a harsh cold laugh under the circum stances that becomes highly important information true and i might be one oftreesongs colleagues or treesong himself gersen handed her jehan addelss business card telephone this man he is a local resident of good reputation ask him what ever vou like about me leta goynes went to the communicator first i will ask some one about jehan addels she made a set of guarded inquiries watching gersen mean while from the corner of her eye then she telephoned jehan ad dels after some delay he responded displeased that his rest had been disturbed gersen spoke to him this lady is leta goynes answer any questions she cares to ask leta goynes questioned addels for fifteen minutes then slowly turned away from the communicator she had gradually resumed that manner typical of the institutes upper ranks a serene and exasperating indifference to events including personal convenience addels gives you a remarkable reputation she thoughtfully sipped her tea then spoke in a pensive voice the institute tends to ignore ordinary social problems even criminals as egregious as howard treesong still leta goynes set her chin i will give you your information three of the dexad are not present in the photograph they are one hundred one one hundred two and one hundred seven the death of one hundred seven was the occasion for the conclave one hundred one lives in isolation on boniface at a place called athmore violet in the wildest part of worlds moil his name is dwyddion and he is our triune although he may not know it since he sees no one and refuses to communicate and what of one hundred two leta goynes smiled a strange crooked smile his name is ben jamin wroke he drowned in the shanaro sea last week his body was washed up on the beach at cele which is near wild isle from everymans guide to the stars vega alpha lyrae the three inner planets padraic mona noaille are

habitable in part due to the numer ous insects which give cuthbert its sobriquet bug hun ters paradise aloysius is next in orbit temperate if damp and most densely populated of the vegan worlds the

the shrewd and provident folk of loysms wresting value from dross used the inhospitable wastes of boniface as a penal settlement and here were discharged the atheists incorngibles and irredeemables of the vegan worlds arriving at port swaven the convicts were processed at a staging compound operated by the order of st jedasias a certain abbot nahut through divine revelation received instruction in a new regimen to which arriving convicts must be subjected the better to prepare them for life on boniface the methods were drastic and unique many of the survivors suffered genetic damage which stabilized and a new human species was thereby more or less accidentally created these were the fops one of the curiosities of the human universe the typical foo was tall with thin arms and legs big

every little foo village exists a square jedasian church time suddenly had become a critical factor inasmuch as dwyd dion hermit and new triune must surely represent one of howard treesongs urgent affairs gersen made all possible haste from leta govness cottage to the spaceport aboard his fantamn flit tenvmg and away into space the automatic pilot swng the boat high over vega and down on the opposite side to where boniface coasted in orbit a primitive world with nothing of value to be plundered looted or kidnapped he book of dre j boniface lacked all entry controls gersen dropped unchallenged down to the harsh blueblackandwhite disk gersen searched the vegan gazetteef but found only a single vague reference to athmore violet the skak range ran diagonally across a section known as worlds moil in the middle of st cro deckers continent along the southern flanks of the skak the river meaughe meandered down meaughe vale where gersen noted the town poldoolie which might well be a source of local information the surface of boniface obscured by clouds and camouflaged by cloud shadows revealed no obvious landmarks gersen oriented himself with the help ot radio beacons calculated the coordinates of the town poldoolie and slanted down into the heavy atmosphere over meaughe vale the sky was clear gersen located pol doolie a huddle of stone structures beside a growth of purple voitch gersen descended in a spiral and landed the flittering in a soggy meadow a quarter mile east of the town the time was local noon gersen stepped from the fhttefwing into a dank cold wind smelling of mud and rancid vegetation out from the town bounded a dozen gangling ragamuffins the larger thrusting the smaller aside the smaller cursing and tripping the larger all wore dirty white smocks which they hiked up as they ran revealing white legs and knobby knees their heads were nar row their facial structures crude and gnarled irorn each narrow scalp rose a bush of stiff white spines the first to arrive halted two feet from gersen and screamed im the guardian im here first the others are smashers pay them naught im keak for me the gautch gautch what is gautcrr asked gersen that is my payment i want either five svu or five picture books the other boys cried out in eager voices give him books for gautch good books with bosers vetch bosers bosers what are bosers the question evoked strangled guffaws keak wiped his mouth and explained bosers with the wide areas and no clothes on yetch theyre the good bosers single orgmism comparable tu a gintil lichen voinh

ferberator crystals and pour stale dog piss into your air intakes so pay up and ill fend them off gersen considered how can you control so many smashers they know better than to flout me cukkms tell what ill do to you faith and i smash so much as a twittle hell shove me head up my own bum hes a scarfer is keak and he knows how to do it gersen nodded well keak i see that you mean business still i think i had better make sure of everyone this way then around the boat ive got fine things in the cargo hatch for lads like you eh asked a small youth what sort of fine things what of boser books asked gersen dozens of them all rotten scurrilous thats the talk cried keak lets have a look this way gersen went around the ship followed by the youths loping and hopping gersen slid open the cargo port and drew down the ladder he pointed to keak first choice goes to you quick now i cant waste time keak hopped up the ladder followed by the others with gersen at the rear theres naught for light in here croaked keak make light show us bosers wide arse big udders gersen touched a button light came to the chamber which was starkly empty hey called keak theres naught here gersen grinned only a clutch of young blackguards im go ing now about my business and im locking you in if you make any mess ill fly you into the mountains and turn you out and you wont be home for supper tonight so mind your conduct gersen backed down the ladder closed and locked the hatch he set off across the dank meadow and presently found a lane which flanked a stagnant drainage ditch choked with magenta slime at the outskirts of town he passed a small cottage raised from the book of drham the bog on posts under the porch crouched an old man sorting rocks from a sack into three piles gersen called out hoy can you direct me to athmore vio let i cant find it on my map the old man merely crouched in the shadow thinking that he had not been heard gersen approached the old man threw a cloth over his rocks and spraddling on long legs like an ungainly spider scrambled back into the muck under his house gersen turned away and continued along the lane passing an other cottage somewhat more substantial with a black energy unit on the roof surmounted by a religious fetish in the gateway of the low wall stood a man wearing a tall conical hat gersen halted and tendered an affable greeting good day sir yes yes replied the foo in a patronizing drawl gersen erked a thumb toward the first cottage why does the old man hide under his house the foo chuckled at gersens naivete he is a miner isnt that clear those are his new ores look under the house notice how his eyes gleam he carries a byloby had you touched his ores he would have blown away your head and ears i only want information where is athmore violet my map doesnt show it naturally not at athmore violet bugardoig mines alexan drites i am not interested in alexandntes i want to find a man who lives nearby can you direct me to athmore violet the fojo erked his thumb toward the town bugardoig is the man to ask im in a hurry i dont want to waste time looking for bugar doig rest easy he will find you as soon as he notices your vessel on his water meadow and he wont waste time what of yourself do you care to earn a hundred svu help me find my friend near athmore violet you say that must be the hermit of voymont he is a solitary man true athmore violet and voymont perilous parts if only because of bugardoigs mines i he demon princf s from inside the cottage came a hoarse voice take the money lippold do as required it is a small thing lippold made no acknowledgment of the advice apparently he had lost interest in gersen and stood staring serenely off across meaughe vale overhead the sky broke apart and vega darted light of resplendent clarity across the landscape objects came alive with color swamp gorse in maroon and ocher the mountains behind poldoolie blueblack and white the voitch purple with an inex plicable bluegreen umbra below the clouds closed like a trap vegalight was gone lippold stood unmoved by the sudden splendor and its equally abrupt disappearance gersen turned away and continued toward the town an irregular huddle of stone huts sties stables and sheds a dozen shops and agencies a tavern a squat jedasian church above clouds from east and west collided they swirled and churned rain began to fall gersen looked over his shoulder lip pold in a blur of rain stood as before gersen ran into town and took shelter under the eaves of a shuttered mechanics shop only the tavern seemed open for busi ness gersen waited a moment the ram continued to fall m gray sheets momentarily illuminated with flashes of lightning gersen saw tall figures loping through the drench toward the tavern paus ing at the door to shake and kick off the wet then enter for a moment the rain paused during the lull gersen ran up the street to the tavern he entered a long room with a counter to one side benches and tables to the other a line of high windows with panes of yellow mica allowed a dreary light into the room at the tables sat groups of foos hunched over cups of mulled liquor the pungence of hot brew mingling with the sour steam of wet clothes and damp flesh brought a twitch to gersens nostrils as he advanced into the room all conversation halted and all heads turned and rows of milk blue eyes scrutinized gersen each man wore a stocking cap pulled down over his spike of hair similar caps hung on poles beside each table gersen nodded politely to the company and went to the counter the barman wiping great hands on the dirty towel tied around his stomach approached what is your want i he book of dreams id like a few words with someone named bugardoig said gersen is the gentleman here at the moment theres no alois bugardoig here and what are you needing from him that you wouldnt be better without and will you not wear a hat wheres your manners sorry i dont own a hat no matter youd look a silly ape with the prut hanging past your cheek like a spent coigel aha who is this into the tavern lumbered a man thick and heavy with slit pale blue eyes almost closed by bulging applered cheeks he went to a pole took off a prut and with a deft twist brought it down over his spike of hair gersen turned to the barman is that bugardoig haha thats cause for laughter or should you be bugar doig a great twinge of rage that is looke hollop and he empties the town swill notice his arms hes a strong man is hollop but never like bugardoig are you drinking do you like our boiled twirps what else do you serve little else its good enough for us are you for fluting and luting with your nose over our good twirps never said gersen be good enough to serve me a portion well said jocko a battern of twirps for this outlander and here since im taking pity on you let me wrangle up a semblance of decency for your head the barman stuffed paper into a soiled and oily prut and pulled it down over gersens brow so that the stuffed part wobbled first to one side then the other not good said the barman but better especially since your business is with alois bugardoig who is a rare stickler for the niceties of life in fact hes sworn never to harm another man on the holy day can you believe it some declare hes only that much worse other days oh worry who is this into the tavern came a foo with a great barrel chest and a face splayed and gnarled like a jungle fungus gersen asked is that bugardoig him never thats shirmis poddle shirmus whats it to be the usual the usual since theres naught better i wonder where is my brat he should have been out back addling the deckers and not a flap of his shirttail well no matter its his bones ill bruise and not my own the demon princes the barman slid across a jar of heavily spiced twirps drink in joy shirmis today so far has been quiet is that surly thing on his way or will i have a moments peace only the high eye sees so far hush do you hear him now shirmis again looked toward the door thats only thunder still he raised his jar and drank youve roused my nerves im away for places more serene the barman watched him depart and gave a sad shake of the head fear is a strange sense and cant be explained ah then is that yet thunder or is it bugardoig shaking his leg a fojo entered the tavern his shoulders tilling the doorway twin buttresses of ropy muscle arched up to support his jaw so that the head seemed more narrow than the neck his mouth was a gash his nose a jut of cartilage gersen looked to the barman and there there you see bugardoig and today he has flame in his eye someone has treated him poorly and it may be hard for all of us is your prut on straight i hope so what does he drink the usual and several more like it serve up a double order gersen turned toward bugardoig who stood looking among the patrons of the tavern with an air of glowering purpose turning toward the bar he took notice of ger sen and gave an exaggerated jerk of displeasure and what is this here with hat askew and face like a gargoyle a friend in pontefract asked me to seek you out he suggested that i put down my ship in your water meadow as you are noto riously generous incidentally i have ordered a double portion of liquor on your behalf bugardoig lifted one mug in his right hand drained it he took the second mug in his left hand poured it down his throat with equal facility and set the empty containers back on the counter and so to business since i make no exceptions pay me now and at once a hundred svu for landing fees demurrage and berth ing for the month first let us discuss a larger matter said gersen have you a few hours to spare at this moment on what kind of business profitable business the book of drkms s explain yourself near athmore violet lives an important man whom we must visit at once eh who is this the crazy hermit on voymont he is not altogether crazy said gersen in fact he has rec ommended you as most qualified to take me to voymont since your properties are nearby bugardoig uttered a great boom of laughter not so nearby that i care to risk my life on voymont so pay me my fee and go to voymont alone if you approach arthmore violet expect my intense displeasure gersen nodded slowly well then come along to my boat i carry no money on my person bugardoig contorted his face into an astonished scowl must i plod the wet marsh because you have been fool enough to forget your money whatever you like said gersen wait here i will go for the money and bring it to you ha roared bugardoig i am not to be tricked so readily come if i must i must to your ship and i will collect a surcharge often svu hold a moment bawled the barman i want a threepiece for the liquor gersen put a coin on the counter and signaled to bugardoig let us hurry before the rain returns bugardoig grumbled under his breath then followed gersen from the tavern they walked back along the lane under a plum colored sky past the cottage where lippold stood as before past the hut of the miner who was nowhere to be seen and out upon bugardoigs water meadow they approached the flittefiving gersen said to bugardoig wait here i will jump aboard and fetch the money dont waste my time with foolishness said bugardoig open up you wont stray beyond the clutch of my fingernails until i heft what is due me the fojos are a suspicious race said gersen he climbed the ladder and opened the port with bugardoig close at his heels this a coin worth threequarters of an svu the demon princes way said gersen at the after bulkhead of the saloon he slid open a door gestured to bugardoig through here bugardoig shoved impatiently past and into the cargo hold gersen slid the door shut and engaged the clamps even as bugar doig realized his error and hurled himself against the door gersen pressed his ear to the panel and heard strident voices grinning he went to the controls took the boat into the air and new away up meaughe vale below the river moved south like a sullen gray snake through terraces splotched with various sorts of vegetation gray goiter bush purple voitch pale green wax plant black smut trees minarets of pink and yellow landcoral thrust a hundred feet into the air poisonous orange smears delineated colonies of wan dering musk ten miles slid behind gersen dropped the boat upon a meadow of broadleaved silvergrass he alighted from the boat and walked to the cargo hatch and slid it open lowered the ladder he called keak keak speak up a surly voice replied what do you want how much mess have you created a short pause then in airy tones cracking up into falsetto i personally nothing of consequence keak listen carefully very carefully indeed i am now about to let the brats go free all but you we will look over the cargo hatch if conditions offend me i will carry you two hundred miles into the mountains there you and you alone will scour that cargo hatch until it glistens and smells sweet as the roses of kew then you will go your way and i will go mine keaks voice came somewhat tremulously conditions are tol erably good notice a bit of mess here and there you had better clean it now while you still command help and while you are still close to home we have no cleaning stuffs there is water in the meadow use your shirts keak uttered a furious spate of barking orders the boys came blinking and winking down the ladder then appeared a pair of massive legs next a great torso and finally the head of alois bu gardoig at the base of the ladder he halted to stare at gersen his cheeks pulsing in and out his mouth a giant scarlet polyp slowly he hunched his shoulders and started for gersen who burnt a line the book of dreams of crackling dazzle almost across bugardoigs toes dont provoke me said gersen im in a hurry bugardoig drew back a pace his face flushed and dismal gersen wved the gun toward keak faster remember how fast you ran out from town half an hour later gersen took the boat aloft leaving a discon solate aroup of shirtless boys staring up after him as he watched they turned and tucking elbows against skinned white chests loped off down the valley bugardoig now sat in the saloon a cord limiting his scope of action knots of muscle played up and down his cheeks his eyes showed as cracks of blue glitter bugardoig clearly was not one to show a tolerant or even fatalistic face to adversity gersen took the ship high under the first fleeting layers of cloud he turned to bugardoig are you acquainted with dwyd dion the hermit certainly i know him he lives over voymont from athmore violet have i not said he was crazy crazy or not weve got to get him away from voymont or hell be killed and this is important quite important so where is voymont from here yonder across the skak and what are the landmarks bugardoig uttered a rasping groan all the inconveniences i owe this evil yetch and his gun what if am struck down by lightning that then will be your fate bugardoig heaved himself erect and looked out the ports go west and a slarshtit north voymont is beyond those three sharp peaks notice that black shadow thats the pritz across from voy mont with airy gulch between notice the devilslight ah theres weird tricks along the pritz gersen took the futtefiving high across ascending ramparts of dreary black rock and over an awesome badlands of crag and cre vasse to the west loomed the pritz lightning flashes up and down its face became ever more noticeable slirsh fojo renii tor a preidolescem girl slarsbdt is a vulgar colliiquiilimi for tri flingimounr or ro anilmusr negligible degree the demon princes s a jumble of confused ridges passed below which bugardoig named in a despondent voice the shaggeth morneys tooth and yonder athmore violet hunckertown trabble with a bore of palladium mount lucasta theres the head of poorlegs river now the vovmont the flitterwing cruised out over an enormous gulch with a silver trickle of water far below below is airy gulch said bugardoig the flitterwmg hovered and settled slowly from churning clouds spasms of lightning clawed the pritz gersen asked in a voice unconsciously taut where is dwyddion lower your vessel into old airy there yonder the ledge where only a madman would live gersen slid the flittering close to the voymont settled through gusts of wind bugardoig pointed a redknuckled finger there dwyddions house i now have done my undertaking take me back to pol doolie well stop only long enough to make sure of dwyddion bah grumbled bugardoig i am tempted to pound your head with my fist gun or no gun be patient said gersen we will not be long in fact the faster the better the flitterwing drifted close to the mountainside dwyddions house was a simple structure a block of welded stone and glass perched precariously on a ledge to the north the ledge had been widened by an artful piling and wedging of large boulders creating first a viaduct a hundred feet long then a small shallow landing area a place open and exposed to view south of the house the ledge became a path leading to a cramped level place in the angle of a crevice here sat a small black flier and beyond half excavated into the stone a structure which gersen assumed to be a workshop this area was concealed and unobtrusive he lowered the futter iving to a landing behind dwyddions black flier bugardoig made a sneering criticism of gersens choice of land ing place are you yetch so foolish why do you not use the convenient area is it too easy and obvious an operation gersen replied in a measured voice a criminal is coming to kill dwyddion i dont want him to know that im here bueardoier erave a rattling snort of derision the book of oreims gersen opened the port and jumped to the ground i cant leave you alone in front of those controls he told bugardoig something strange might happen youd better come along with me bugardoig folded his massive arms i stay here right now said gersen theres no time to waste for crazy yetch business any time is a waste growled bugar doig get along with you then its the cargo hatch for you no gersen held out his hands watch me he jerked his right bleep into his hand as if by magic appeared a projac you know what i can do with this he jerked his left bicep and displayed that complicated weapon known as a dedactor is this familiar to you no it discharges three sorts of glass needles the mildest causes a maddening itch of three weeks duration i will use ten needles on you unless you make a very quick move to the cargo hatch at last you persuade me said bugardoig he groaned belched and with maddening deliberation lowered his bulk to the ground ill go with you and watch your tricks gersen looked around the sky lets make haste he set off along the ledge with bugardoig ambling behind a door at the back of dwyddions house slid ajar in the shadow stood a tall thin man he took a step forward and his features be came clear a dome of a forehead with a high receding mat of dust colored hair black eyes brooding in shadowed eye sockets gaunt cheeks a delicate pointed chin a face implying great intellectual force and a cheerless disposition he inspected his visitors without amiability gersen halted you are dwyddion i am he dwyddions voice was deep do not the terms of this place suggest my earnest desire for solitude death is also solitary you must listen carefully as we have very little time i am kirth gersen this is alois bugardoig a gen tleman of poldoolie who consented to guide me here to what purpose gersen again searched the sky and again saw only dark overcast and low clouds whirling down the wind a gust howled across the mountainside pelting their faces with drops ot halffro en rain dwyddion made an impatient sound thf dfmonprincfs hunched his head between his shoulders and retreated into his house gersen and bugardoig followed with the poorest possible grace dwyddion allowed them to pass they had come directly into the main room of the house ger sen received an impression of austere proportions neutral colors humorless and marginally comfortable furnishings the message of the room was ambiguous here might be the expression of dwyd dions personality his overview of existence or he might simply have subordinated the room to the view from its wide windows the vast gulch blowing with winds and mists the pntz and the inces sant play of purplewhite lightning dwyddion spoke coldly again may i inquire the reason for your intrusion certainly you were notified in regard to a recent conclave of the dexad at wild isle yes i chose not to attend in discussions i find myself consis tently a minority of one and my presence seems unnecessary gersen held out his photograph you know all these men of course and this person here he is silas sparkhammer a ninetynine i consider him intel ligent spontaneous extremely inventive and totally unsuitable for the dexad i agree entirely said gersen his name incidentally is howard alan treesong he poisoned the triune and the entire dexad with charnay there were two exceptions benjamin wroke whom he drowned and you who must now be considered the new triune upon your death treesong becomes triune and he is now on his way here to murder you dwyddion stared blinking from the photograph to gersen all are dead all ha hum i find this simply incredible no doubt it is shocking news but we have no time to waste you must come with us gersen gestured toward the door dwyddion drew back i know nothing i have no facts i cannot act so abruptly who then are you ill tell you everything as soon as were away from here come now the book of dreavis dwyddion gave his head a fretful shake no of course not this is sheer hysteria i cant gersen gestured to bugardoig seize this fellow carry him out with dwyddion safe and out of the way on the flitteiwing an ambush of howard treesong would become feasible with luck the affair could be brought to its finish on this very day bugardoig blinked then advanced upon dwyddion who cried out in a choked voice of outrage stand back he flailed out with his fists as bugardoig stepped forward bugardoig uttered a grunt of annoyance for the foolish position in which he found himself he seized dwyddion slung him aloft and over his shoulder bu gardoig growled at gersen and what now i am bored with this nonsense gersen opened the door carry him to the ship and quickly its a thankless task agreed bugardoig stalked out upon the ledge with gersen close behind three men who had been advancing upon the house stopped short the person on the left was sleek as a seal in a suit of black velvet his face was round and white and distinguished by an ornate artificial nose wrought from gold filigree at the center stood how ard alan treesong wearing green trousers plum red coat flapping black cape and black cheeseslice hat to the right a chiselfaced man with a black skin and black beard stared at bugardoig in won der treesong called out in a quick gay voice hola what goes on here gersen brought forth the projac he aimed at treesong only to find bugardoig in front of him leaning aside he pulled the trigger the bolt struck into treesongs long taut thigh treesong whirled to the ground in a flutter of his black cape gersen dropped to his knee and fired again but treesong had slid over the edge of the viaduct and lay among the boulders where he gave vent to a set of peculiar manyvoiced outcries gersen fired at the blackskinned man and killed him ust as he aimed his own weapon goldnose dropping to the ground fired a bolt which tore open bugardoigs great corded neck bugardoig toppled like a tree and fell upon dwyddion who fretfully pulled himself free and crawled away while bugardoig lay pumping ivid red blood across the stones gersen fired again goldnose erked cursed rolled over the the demon princes edge of the viaduct gersen rose to stand in a wary crouch watching for motion treesong had halted his remarkable multivocal yam mer gersen ran a few steps forward and searched over the declivity hoping to surprise treesong he saw nothing treesong had evi dently taken shelter behind a squat boulder of gneiss gersen ran crouching across the viaduct he saw motion and dropped flat a bolt sizzled through the air a foot above his head gersen fired his projac rock splinters sprayed the head and neck of goldnose who screamed in pain he lost his footing and slipped down the slope gersen watched in fascination as goldnose rolled slid and tumbled slowly gathering momentum to become a top pling limp object bounding rolling falling free to strike the rock walls glance away and disappear into the murk gersen clambered back upon the viaduct in time to see a smalt airboat raise from the landingplat and slant into the sky howard alan treesong had not taken shelter behind the boulder he had crawled back through the rocks and so had made his escape for ten seconds gersen stared after the airboat so near and now so far his intrigues and strategems gone for naught and poor bugardoig a corpse now drained of blood he turned to dwyddion who stood to the side watching gersen with an unreadable ex pression get into the ship said gersen gruffly weve got to leave here in a hurry i see no reason gersen put his anger and frustration under icy control that was howard alan treesong he came to kill you he used a ships boat somewhere not too high hangs his ship in fact its already dropping to pick him up as soon as hes aboard the ship will destroy your house and us as well if we are fools enough to wait dwyddion gave a fatalistic shrug but made no further protest the flittefwmg rose into the sky and flew off to the west down from the clouds eased a dark hull toward voymont theres his ship were not away too soon i understand none of this gloomed dywddion it is an out rage that i who seek only seclusion should be harassed coerced and inconvenienced sad said gersen still if its any satisfaction to you and to bugardoig we have blown treesongs master plan skyhigh and we have also shot him in the leg the book of hrkms what plan is this with you dead he would have become triune hes already tried for the ipcc and failed although the way is still open to him he rules the criminals of all the major worlds there is his power base in ten years he would be emperor of the oikumene humm at pontefract before the day is out ill appoint a new dexad the man is a megalomaniac he is all of that gersen reflected upon howard treesongs outcries in what seemed a multitude of voices he is something very strange indeed three recollections vivid beyond all others in connection with dwyddions house on the voymont persisted with gersen to haunt him all the days of his life first the pntz itself hunched to the attack of a thousand fu rious lightning bolts and airy gulch reverberating to wind and thunder second the corpse of bugardoig face astounded by the un thinkable tragedy which had overtaken him his topknot daubed red with his own blood the third recollection strange and marvelous would be the manyvoiced babble of lamentations and threats produced by how ard treesong as he lay among the rocks by the sibyls of hades such pain no matter no matter that mad dog who knows him not nor i enough elhur padache staunch green the flittefwing once again swung high around vega dwyddion sat stiff and resentful mouth drooping face glum presently he began to turn sidelong glances toward gersen but gersen sat in silence occupied with his own problems at last dwyddion broke the silence in a dignified voice he said i would be interested in learning the reason for your involvement in this business theres no great mystery said gersen i hold something of a grudge against treesong its as simple as that dwyddion managed a sour chuckle something of a grudge eh what occurs when youre seriously offended well no mat ter i suppose i should feel grateful to you probably so i he book of dreavis ah you concur then allow me formally to tender my grat itude i may have been solitary tor too long a time for a fact with the dexad destroyed i have no further cause for isolation the secret now is known only to me dwyddion sat musing and twitching his long white fingers now that he had started talking he found it hard to contain his loquacity you probably wonder why i chose isolation from bit terness and disillusionment there is the answer or if you prefer i learned the secret perhaps i was callow perhaps naive but no one had ever faulted my zeal there was never such a swotsman i was very early selected as an exemplar and cited for my nobility and ease i spent all my time at monstrances and on walking tours ive trudged a thousand landscapes ive exhorted countless granges the places tve seen berenskaya kotop the long hills old home and prairie lands the green star swantees the polders of pedderdulah ive walked them all i was ailed at chlodie on mar skens the factors of pollardich on copus shaved my head i be came resident thwarterman at vasconcelles perhaps you recall the crusade against electric sports m mvra on the south continent ot alphanor what is its name transiskana do you remember the crusade no i led the march and we did great things but not without suf fering oh when i recall the toil the heat the derision and abuse not to mention insects crawlers and banebugs but we thrust on through to cattlesbury and won the day how long ago it seems and suddenly i was rank fifty and sixty i directed the cam paign against pesticides on wirfil i worked as liaison officer with the peas and beaners at new gorcherum i served with the natural jungle league ofarmongol all considered me the definition of an institute activist i was compelling trenchant sublimely assured that my ideals were the best of all possible ideals my rank soared aloft through the eighties and nineties and now no more cam paigns no more programs now i was concerned with policy i had time to rest to think i went before the dexad i watched their deliberations and i omed their banquets and at last i was appointed ninetynine suddenly i was in line for the dexad i met the other institute argut i person who energeucaily strnes q climb the ranks ripidl the demon princes ninetynines my rivals and my peers one was benjamin wroke a person not unlike myself who had arrived at his status much as i had we had much in common yet we never achieved full amica bilitv which after all could not be expected when three men vie for the dexad the other ninetynine called himself sparkhammer he was a man i could not fathom he was impenetrable to the usual processes of analysis i found him by turns charming repellent soothing infuriating he demonstrated both competence and con fidence his decisions were effortless he might have been consid ered a certainty for the dexad except for a certain flamboyance which hurt his chances both benjamin wroke and silas sparkham mer yearned for the dexad sparkhammer almost shamefully so cloyd free rank one hundred four died in the kankashee ungles the dexad voted in benjamin wroke and brought sabor vidol up to ninetynine sparkhammer could barely conceal his fury only two weeks later hassamide was murdered by a thracian footpad i was elevated into the dexad and lan bilfred was raised to ninety nine sparkhammer congratulated me with grace and composure in truth he was far too anxious and everyone knew it as for me the dexad meant nothing i perceived suddenly in the space of ten seconds that this supreme achievement i refer to member ship in the dexad was factitious i had overshot my goals i saw my old self as a child playing games it was a point of view so i now suspected in which the dexad quite concurred i had invested thirtytwo years of toil and sacrifice in a cause which the leadership regarded at best with indulgent approval mind you these were the best intellects of the oikumene they were neither corrupt nor dis honest i gradually understood that in the processes of maturity and wide purview they discerned that the strength and virtue of the institute lay not in its goals nor in the hopeful achievement of these goals but in its operative function as a system into which persons like myself could spend their energies and in so doing leaven an otherwise ponderous society dwyddion paused and stared off along an avenue of memories his mouth trembling in a bitter smile gersen asked you changed so you say in a space often seconds was that not abrupt yes well why should you not know i was approached by rob martiletto the one hundred eight he said dwyddion you are now dexad needless to say you have earned the rank may i the book of drea ms ask if in your appraisal of the dexad you have noticed what i shall call a transcendental serenity yes i have noticed something of the sort i ascribed it to age and a waning of energy that is not altogether the explanation the jump from ninetynine to one hundred one is farther than from say seventy to ninetynine this is because the dexad shares a secret which now i will impart to you in the dexad you advance a long step past the rationale which brought you up to ninetynine the new ideology is contained in the secret he then told me the secret the ten seconds to which i referred passed by i said sir not only can i not endorse your views i will not seaf myself with the dexad in short i now and forever resign from the institute not possible you have sworn to serve for the duration of your days and so you must goodbye i said you will see me never again where are you going where no one will ever come to seek me out martiletto showed neither surprise nor resentment in fact he seemed amused well then do as you must solitude may bring you a new perspective i went away i sought and found solitude and i must say it has been until today the most peaceful time of my life and the secret it is implicit in what i have said the dexad perceived society as separated into three elements in order of consequence they were humanity at large the institute and the dexad humanity and the institute were seen as opposing forces in a state of dynamic equilibrium i he dexad functioned to maintain the tension and to prevent either side from overwhelming the other the dexad therefore has often acted in opposition to the institute creating situations constantly to outrage and stimulate the membership that is the secret now you are triune and you will appoint a new dexad how do you regard this point of view dwyddion uttered a short bleak laugh i have discovered something about myself the secret embarrassed me i saw myself across thirty two ears the earnest swotsman the sweating dupe controlled by institute cant reverent toward triune and dexad contemptuous of the general population then i learned the secret the demon princes to my distress now that i am triune must either impart the secret to the next dexad or suppress it gersen said you are not yet free of treesong today he was thwarted and hurt he will be crazy for revenge revenge cried dwyddion with as much ordinary human emotion as gersen had yet seen him display when he came to kill me absurd it is i who demand revenge for the murder of my fellows for the great indecency perpetrated upon the institute let me offer advice said gersen at pontefract you must make a public disclosure of events the role of silas sparkhammer ninetyninth of the institute will no longer be possible for tree song i intended to make a statement the sooner the better in fact when we reach the pontefract spaceport we can call into cosmopolis feature article in pontefract clarion institute triune describes fantastic murder banquet accused howard alan treesong entire leadership poisoned plot to control institute ascribed to notorious king of criminals demon prince howard alan treesong i personally escaped death by a combination of luck quick thinking and the assistance of my aide declared dwyd dion formerly of institutional rank and now triune a title indicating rank i did not attend the banquet said dwyddion i learned of the event through institute intelligence i was informed that the notorious criminal treesong by some means had preempted to himself rank naturally not in his own identity he called himself sparkhammer and in due course i will discover the decep tion by which he gained rank needless to say his spurious ranking is canceled i have appointed a new dexad from a roster of authentic rankings the work of the institute proceeds i did not attend the murder banquet for a number of reasons the dexad and the triune met at wild isle on the planet cytherea tempestre to elevate one of three s to the dexad and to enjoy a banquet including charnay the demon princes which is a delicacy known only on cytherea i have tasted eharnay and find it delectable but if not prepared properly it is a deadly poison howard alan treesong obtained eharnay extracted the poison injected it into the already prepared certified wholesome fruit which was then served to triune dexad and the candidate s treesong himself abstained from eating or perhaps ate wholesome fruit benjamin wroke rank who like myself chose not to attend the banquet was subsequently drowned by treesong why did he perform such an atrocious act when he still might have been elevated into the dexad because twice already he had been passed over and probably had received information that he was to be rejected again in favor of either vidol or bilfred when a is gainsaid for the third time he must face the bitter fact that he will never attain the dexad and so might as well retire from candidacy treesong chose rather to murder all ranks above him whence by institute law he ascended to the highest rank left open in this case only until i could be disposed of i naturally being of higher rank would precede him to triune gersen rubbed his face with sallow skin tone arranged a hairpiece of effusive black curls over his own short black pelt and donned his exquisite garments to achieve once more the semblance of an indolent wastrel he set off across tara square the day was gray and a gray mist hung on the air the folk of pontefract marched stolidly past their black and brown costumes made a muted richness against the wet stone and old black iron gersen turned into corrib place halted to inspect the extant offices nothing seemed amiss the aged structure black with grime seemed as placid as ever the duration of his absence could be measured in hours the psychological time seemed far longer he crossed the street entered the building and went directly to the contest workroom today so he recalled saw the end of the the book of dreams contest the workload had decreased significantly and only a half dozen sacks of mail lay in the bin mrs ench bustled forward to greet him good morning mr lucas good morning mrs ench any startling developments not yet mr lucas the cytherea entry is still the closest but have you seen the newspapers this morning its absolutely remarkable yes most amazing how will it affect our contest in no way whatever or so i hope we are lucky that our dead line is today otherwise we might have multitudes of opportunistic winners we still might have some well simply have to judge each entry on its own merits quite right mr lucas gersen turned away but mrs ench called him hack oh mr lucas one interesting letter at least i consider it interesting i set it aside for you since it concerns our number six she handed gersen an envelope thank you mrs ench gersen read the letter interesting he read the letter a second time i suppose it has no particular bearing on our contest as the newspapers have established spark hammers true identity my feeling exactly our contest seems remarkably timely is it all a coincidence gersen laughed politely in case anyone asks we are all dumb founded by the new developments no one has asked but many may be wondering thats as may be the publicity cant do extant any harm gersen went on into the front office alice sat quietly at her desk she wore a simple black shirt and jacket upon which the tips of her orange hair rested and then curved upward at the sight of gersen she made an abrupt motion toward the newspaper on her desk then restrained herself good morning mr lucas good morning alice youve seen the news evidently alice feigned no misunderstanding yes she looked down at the journal it is interesting no more than that the demon princes alice only gave a noncommittal shrug gersen said treesong is a terrible man he is one of the demon princes i have heard the name certainly said alice stiffly gersen said theres mention of a benjamin wroke who drowned in the shanaro sea i hope that he is no connection of yours alice looked up with somber eyes then turned away yes he is a close connection thats a great pity you have my sincere sympathy alice made no reply gersen went to his desk he sat down and studied alices profile i still wish very much to meet howard alan treesong alices chin rose an eighth inch she spoke a bitter monosyl lable why he is now more than ever a superb subject for an interview alice lowered her chin to its original position do you think it wise to publicize the exploits of such a man certainly sooner or later he will come to a bad end how do such men function what are their motivations how does he re gard himself he would never allow you to write undignified things about him he could write the copy himself for all i care what with the contest and the murders wed sell a hundred million copies alice abruptly rose to her feet i dont feel well if theres nothing for me to do i think ill rest for an hour or two just as you like said gersen he rose politely to his feet i hope youre better soon thank you with a final swift glance toward gersen skep tical and dubious alice left the office gersen sat back he brought out the letter tendered him by mrs ench and read it for the third time director of extant contest please consider this letter as my entry in your contest i can definitely identify one person in the photograph this entitles me to onetenth of a share in the contest prize which i claim that person marked number was born at home the book of dreams farm near gladbetook in the land of maunish he was named by his mother howard alan after the television wiz ard h a topfinn and arblezanger in remembrance other grandfather with his patronymic he was and is howard alan arblezanger i lardoah and so do i identify him he has not been a close son and indeed left us some years ago i have heard that he is successful and doing well and i hope to see him shortly at the school reunion to which he has been invited in any case i render this identification and i will expect my share of the contest money at once i am adrian hardoah at home farm gladbetook land of maunish moudervelt van kaathes star gersen reflected a moment then called information service moudervelt he found to be the only populated planet of van kaa thes star it was a world somewhat larger than earth with a single continent sprawling twothirds of the way around the equator the world was old and its soil was mellow the mountain ranges of its youth had eroded low leaving wide prairies and meandering rivers moudervelt had first been settled by a variety of small groups re ligious sects clans sporting associations philosophical societies and the like they had quickly exterminated the race of semi intelligent beings in residence parceled out tracts of land estab lished frontiers for their realms and for century after century occupied themselves with their own affairs the land of maunish occupied a section of the goshen prairie in the eastern midlands of the great continent the capital cloutie maintained a popula tion of three thousand eighty miles north in fluter township on the banks of the wiggal river was gladbetook with a population of three thousand maunish had been settled by the partitioners of the pure truth the teachings discouraged space travel and the nearest spaceport lay three hundred miles south at theobald sta tion in the land of leiander gersen turned away from the communicator howard tree song had been born a country boy in one of the most placid back waters of the human universe gersen decided upon reflection that the demon princes the fact had no general significance there were many country boys who never became criminals he turned back to the commu nicator and made connection with room at st diarmids inn alice would be arriving at her own room just about now his timing was exact he heard the door open and alices steps as she crossed the room for a few moments she moved here and there rather listlessly then came to rest she sat five minutes arranging her thoughts then he heard her speaking in a voice resolute and steady alice wroke here a minute passed then howard treesongs voice replied in tones strident and harsh yes alice i hear you what have you accomplished as much as possible i am satisfied only with achievement where is my father according to the newspapers he is dead do not presume to question me make your report can report only what you already know mr lucas told me again that he is anxious to interview you the voice became even more harsh he knows you are in contact with me certainly not he is as callous as you are he wants to publish your biography or your autobiography so that he can sell a hun dred million copies of his journal and he considers me an altruist i doubt that but then i am only reporting his remarks do as you see fit just so alice hesitated then asked the contest is over i have kept to the terms of my bargain is my father truly dead treesongs voice changing once more became flat yet throaty acrid yet thick you now know my name yes and you know who i am i have heard of you perhaps you divined my great scheme you planned to be triune of the institute the stridency returned to treesongs voice that plan has hatefully and viciously been thwarted benjamin wroke who was he wtiat did he matter naturally he is dead and why did i trouble myself the plan is broken by the journalists and their contest the book of dreams so he has gone who wroke how could you think otherwise you assured me otherwise a rasping laugh people believe whatever they want to be lieve i am now done with you go your way you are destructively beautiful you have brought dissent among the colors of my soul red lusts blue feels a melancholy longing while green would cause you pain but noth ing will be done i have taken injury and i suffer there is no time also you have soiled yourself you bedded with the journalist granted at my behest but you should have pleaded and made out cry i showed poor judgment said alice tartly when treesong responded his voice was stern and sullen i am about to depart vega has not been kind nor was it ever i am wounded and sore but in due course i will set things straight and then my pain will be remedied a thousand times over wtiat happened to you alice spoke with ingenuous interest we met ambush a demon in the shape of a man sprang out ofdwyddions house and fired his projac into my leg i should think youd be expecting such things treesong seemed not to hear the remark another brief silence then a new voice clever and electric the extant contest ends tomorrow no today and there is yet no winner thats correct then these are your instructions do not call me again i am free of you save your instructions treesong ignored the interruption continue as before but the conversation had ended at noon vega burnt away the overcast leaving the sky suffused with bright milky haze alice returned to the office looking pale and drawn youre feeling better i hope asked gersen yes thank you she went to her desk and seated herself she had changed into a graygreen frock with a prim white collar which her orange curls barely brushed the colors of some exotic desert the demon princes flower thought gersen she became aware of his attention and gave him a quick glance is there anything i should do not really the contest is essentially over there have been interesting developments dont you think definitely so still its not much better than a standoff treesong failed to take over the institute on the other hand hes still alive and his career goes on your father is dead which is your private tragedy if you had known that sparkhammer was howard alan treesong you could never have hoped otherwise alice turned in her chair to stare at gersen how did you know that benjamin wroke was my father its on your application said gersen he smiled a rather lame smile also not to put too fine a point on it i tapped into your conversations with treesong alice sat like a statue then you knew from the moment you walked into the office even before i knew when i saw you across the street alice flushed suddenly pink and you must have known so i did but still what would you think of me if i had taken advantage of you alice showed a strained meaningless smile what difference does it make what i think i dont want your selfesteem to be damaged especially for the wrong reasons this is an idiotic conversation said alice she rose to her feet and it is idiotic for me to stay here any longer where are you going away am i not discharged of course not i admire your courage wtien i look across the room i like to see you sitting there furthermore the desk communicator chimed gersen touched a button a voice spoke howard alan treesong calling henry lucas henry lucas here do you have a face i do indeed upon the screen appeared an image a face with a high square forehead clear hazel eyes a fine straight nose long chin wde easy mouth an expression of prideml verve and vivacity gersen pulled the black curls of his hairpiece forward and down across his white cheeks half closed his eyes and dropped his jaw the book of dreams in order to project an impression of aristocratic languor alice watched in sardonic amusement as gersen transmitted the image to howard treesong the two men studied each other treesong spoke in a rich flowing voice mr lucas i have been following your contest with interest since as you know i am included in the photograph so i understand naturally it augments popular interest in the event treesong said airily i am not sure whether or not you intend to flatter me for the purposes of this occasion i am a journalist which is to say an automaton without personal feelings if so then you are unusual but no matter since you make no specific bans or debarments i wish to submit my personal so lution to your contest be kind enough to note my identifications or better ask your remarkably beautiful secretary to do so gersen said thoughtfully i doubt if this could be considered regular procedure all our other entries have arrived in written form you make no stipulation to this effect so why should not a verbal identification be valid i can use the prize money as well as the next person quite so our award ceremony takes place shortly if you were adjudged the winner could you be on hand to accept the prize a bit awkward im afraid unless the occasion were celebrated in the far beyond that might be troublesome from our point of view then you must send the money to an address which i will supply now for the identifications quite so quite so alice take notes i wi identify as you have numbers one is sharrod yest two is that acidulous harridan dianthe de trembuscule three the cor pulent beatrice utz four is the oncevoluble lan bilfred whose agile tongue alas is now forever stilled five is the overeager sabor vidol six is that person known on this occasion as sparkhammer but more generally known as howard alan treesong seven is john gray eight is that otiose lummox the triune gadouth nine is gieselman ten martiletto i hope that i am the first correctly to identify these folk im afraid not as soon as dwyddions revelations were made the dkmon princes public dozens of opportunists swarmed into our office with correct identifications pah greed is rampant everywhere another score to be set tled with dwyddion something may still be salvaged i want to publish your bi ography at terms to be arranged you are a unique individual and your memoirs should interest our readers it is something to think about i have often felt the need to express my views the public regards me as a criminal by ordinary definition am a very paragon of the trade i recognize no peer by the very nature of my accomplishments i have created a new category by which i and i alone may be judged i will not now enlarge upon the idea in any case public interest will not be diminished i must consider the matter carefully i dont like to station myself in a designated place at a specific time if you wll reflect upon the conditions of my existence you will perceive that the need for vigilance is one of its very few disadvantages yes so it would seem certain folk do not yield gracefully to my instructions they thereby incur penalties this is sheer simple fact i am meticulous in regard to rewards and penalties i assure you i usually take the rewards and others must make do with the penalties but no matter is not the cosmos a more vital and adventurous place for my pres ence of course i am indispensable all this will fascinate my readers i hope you agree to the interview we shall see at the moment i am pressed for time i have a rendezvous to keep upon a distant planet and must make my ar rangements that is all for now the screen went dim gersen leaned back in his chair tree song seems to have an elastic disposition he changes from minute to minute said alice he terrifies me still i hope to see him at least once again gersen was intrigued by her lackluster voice why so ill try to kill him gersen stretched his arms into the air the narrowshouldered coat constricted him he pulled it off and threw it aside then he took off his hairpiece and threw it after the coatalice watched him sidelong but made no comment the book of dreams he is cautious said gersen i was lucky to get a single shot at him out on the voymont in a soft wondering voice alice asked who are you in pontefract im known as henry lucas a writer for cos mopolis sometimes i use a different name and do different things why gersen rose sauntered across the room to her desk he reached under her arms pulled her up so that her face was close he kissed her forehead her nose her mouth to which she remained passive he eased the pressure of his arms if treesong calls to ask about me you cant tell him if you dont know i will tell him nothing in any case he has no more power over me gersen kissed her again to which she yielded but again made no response she drew back then you want me to remain here very much so she turned and drew away from him i have nothing better to do then youll be here when i get back where are you going im going out to a strange old world to take part in a social occasion where howard treesong is going yes ill tell you all about it when i return alice asked wistfully when will that be i dont know gersen kissed her again and now she re sponded and for a moment relaxed against him gersen kissed the top other head goodbye life introduction to volume ii by baron bodissey unspiek as we traverse the river of human time in our wonder boats we notice recurring patterns in the now of peoples and civilizations the disparate races coalesce only when territory is limited cramped and crowded with corn pressive social pressures strong exact governments are typical of these circumstances they are both necessary and welcome conversely when land is vast and easily available as in the broaching of a new continent or a new world nothing can keep different sorts of people in close contact they migrate to new places and particularize whereupon languages mutate costumes and conventions elaborate aes thetic symbols take on fresh meanings now the public mood turns inward government imposed from another place cannot be tolerated the processes as the race wan ders from its native star are of infinite richness and a source of endless fascination mouderuek then and notv from studies in comparative anthropology by russell cooke had the astute baron chosen to adorn his famous in troduction to volume ii with examples he might well have selected the remote world moudervelt orbiting van kaa thes star as a felicitous paradigm for the illumination of his general principle the book of drkms moudervelt is a world benign and fertile with an ex pansive land area the flora is generally compatible with earth stock the fauna offers no menace except for a few predatory sea creatures moudervelt is an old world the ancient mountain ranges are now forested hills rolling plains extend horizon to horizon under blue skies and flotillas of tall white cu mulus great slow rivers wander the prairies where the soil is deep and the climate fair except for rivers the land lacks natural boundaries but boundaries and borders aplenty have been created to delineate separate dominions each jealous of its identity each cherishing its own roteh and rites each celebrating its distinctive cuisine and scorn ing all others as filth and scum each considering itself the single home of civilization among barbaric incom prehensible and unpleasant neighbors moudervelt knows no true cities most of the lands maintain a spaceport commerce is carried on the rivers which are all interconnected by canals only a few land routes connect the states moudervelt is by no means isolated from the universe it exports a considerable quantity of special foodstuffs for the use of former inhabitants and imports technical goods special tools a few books and periodicals in total bulk no great amount moudervelt by and large is selfsufficient from popular handbook to the planets th edition moudervelt van kaathes star after the usual exposition of physical data and an his torical summary the text devotes a paragraph or two to each of the dominions maunish at the center of goshen prairie occupies an area of about square miles and supports a population of about a million descended from a mission of the pure truth partition the area is bounded bv the dalglish river on the south and east by the land of puck to the west ships trading in offworld fuods roam even whereleniss the settled worlds old earth supplies perhaps a third of all such comestibles the wines of earth are especially prized the demon princes amable and the river bohuloe on the north the lands of ganaster and erquhar to the east the principal town is cloutie notice to offworld arrivals there are no spaceports within the confines of maunish indeed space vessels air craft hoppers or skyriders flying at an elevation over fortynine feet are prohibited entry must be made by surface transportation at an authorized checkpoint border controls are strict as are import regulations bring in no weapons intoxicants erotic materials medicines except those personally required border searches are thorough penalties are severe gersen lowered the flittefwing down upon theobald station farmlands punctuated by white houses spread away from the town in all directions the dalglish river crawled in great loops across the landscape finally to swerve to the north and disappear the spaceport projected no detectable beacon or signal gersen isolated it from adjacent fields only by virtue of three spacecraft already on hand a pair of small cargo carriers and a bedraggled old sissle wandcfway gersen landed the flittefwing made his usual arrangements and jumped to the ground he found himself at the center of a sunny open field sodded with bluegreen turf cool country air blew in his face there was no sound except for a slight hiss from the flitterwings recharging respirators a hundred yards across the field shaded under a pair of sprawling trees he saw a small shed upon which rested a sign central space terminal theobald station land of leiander all incoming traffic report here inside the shed gersen discovered a small fat man dozing at a table the remains of his lunch spread before him he wore what once had been a smart uniform of black tan and red twill but for breeches and boots he had substituted a white kneelength skirt and sandals gersen rapped on the table the official woke abruptly almost before opening his eyes he groped for his cap and pulled it over his the book of dkems balding pate he looked gersen over with a bland expression sir i am an item of incoming traffic the sign directed me here yes yes indeed well there are a few formalities incident to entry he secured a form put questions to gersen noted the responses he completed the form and filed it in a box that is all sir except for the landing fee gersen said first a bit of information i am actually en route to maunish are there any hindrances to travel none whatever the borders are open i can rent a vehicle certainly i will rent you my own car and my son will drive you gersens ears were attuned to almost imperceptible hints and implications he looked sharply at the official at what rent oh nothing unreasonable ten svu per diem no extra charges or supplements none do you take me for a scarper he will drive me to cloutie and elsewhere in maunish at my convenience the official showed an expression of indignant wonder into maunish you must be joking to the maunish border no farther how could i risk my car in that nation of stoneheads where girls strut around with bare elbows and men show their teeth while eat ing they drive like catatonics the air stinks with their pickled ramp to the border no farther perhaps you can secure onward transportation at that point well then what are the public conveyances between the two countries nothing to suit a wealthy offworlder you would be forced to ride the transworld bus with bumpkins returning to maunish that will suit me well enough i have ridden in worse com pany if that is your taste you are in luck the afternoon car passes by in a matter of minutes now as to the landing fee a vessel such as yours is rated at two hundred svu per week payable a month in advance gersen laughed i have important friends in the neighbor he dp mon princes hood they warned me that public officers tend either to larceny or daydreaming he produced five svu this will have to do the official took the money with poor grace it is not regular but i suppose that exceptions are possible for the sake of good public relations yonder comes the transworld along the road came a rickety triplejointed omnibus riding on eight great airwheels gersen flagged it down paid another five svu to the driver and found a seat for hours he rode across a gently rolling land of fields rivers ponds and orchards white farmhouses sprawled under lumines cent foliage of pmk rose red orange and yellow the farmers seemed prosperous life could not be totally bad m the land of leiander even if the girls might not show their elbows a line of dark blue and black foliage wandered across the ho rizon where the dalglish river swung east to delineate the maun ish frontier a hundred yards short of the boundary the bus halted from a station house marched a sergeant and six soldiers in fine uniforms the sergeant boarded the bus put several questions to the op erator who erked his thumb toward gersen the sergeant signaled to gersen this way sir for ust a mo ment bring your luggage gersen took his small traveling bag and followed the sergeant from the bus and into a shed the sergeant took the bag netted it looked at gersen with a smile i see that you are attempting to smuggle a model a proac into maumsh he untaped a pair of grips from the handle to the traveling bag this is not a new trick we are alert for it here i merely confiscate the weapon across on maumsh you would be placed in a cage submerged in the river for three hours or until you were thoroughly drowned they are bar bancally strict in this regard give me the other parts please gersen opened the bag and produced the other components which he had disguised by various methods there you are ser geant i thank you for your warning he erked his right forearm and a throwing blade appeared in his hand you had also better take custody of this he shook his left arm producing an airtube for shooting glass needles and this very wise sir please dont sell them at once if i return this way and i plan to do so i will buy them from you myself the book of drkims that is often the situation sir gersen returned to the bus which at once proceeded across the wide dalglish on an iron bridge and so entered the land ofmaun ish the road slanted off across a marsh of brown mud and purple reeds passed through a grove of giant papaws which emitted a fetid sweetness into the air burst out into the sunlight and now the countryside had altered yonder across the river was leiander here was maumsh nothing was quite the same the bus halted at the maumsh border station in the shade of an enormous linglang tree with blue foliage and a gnarled contorted trunk six feet in diameter as before guards marched out to meet the bus here they wore uniforms of gray and green instead of red black and tan they were a people notably different from the short softfeatured le landers here they were tall spare with lank brown hair and bony faces at a signal from the sergeant the passengers alighted and one by one they entered a long shed where each was examined and searched at three separate stations in gersens case they were brisk impersonal and extremely thorough they ignored his offworld or igin his professed trade ournalism aroused only slightly more interest what do you expect to learn in maunish nothing of consequence i am coming here as a tourist then why not call yourself a tourist it is no great matter one way or the other perhaps not to a tourist nor to a journalist but we are security officers responsible for the decency of maunish to us the roles are very different in the first place the tourist may stay at the hotel bon ton in maumsh while ournalists must spend each night at the police station in that case i am definitely a profound tourist i agree that the differences are significant apparently you carry no contraband apparently not the official showed him a wintry smile you will discover that many of our good maunish customs become persuasively practical upon acquaintance still and i can assure you of this since i have traveled widely i have visited thirtynine distinct and separate do mains maunish is a haven of tolerance compared to such as mal chione or dinkland our statutes are simple and reasonable we hf dpmon princes forbid the advancement of polytheism and the display of white flags we prohibit offensive belching and other breaches of the public peace our schedule of crimes is ordinary enough you need only conduct yourself with discretion to avoid trouble he signed ger sens certificate of admission with a flourish there you are sir the freedom ofmaumsh is yours gersen boarded the bus which suddenly lurched into motion the border station under the sprawling blue linglang was left be hind the landscape was now that of maunish different from that of leiander whether by reason of psychic shift or immanent char acter or altered references gersen who had experienced such shifts many times before had no way of knowing the country seemed bigger the sky more open in a new clarity of atmosphere the ho rizons seemed both far and near in a curious visual paradox along the plain trees grew in private clusters and copses each to its own kind gmsaps orpoons linglangs flamboys the shadows below were a dense darkling black which seemed to glimmer with a strange rich color without a name the farmhouses were both less frequent and older high and narrow for no obvious reason and set far back from the road in ealous seclusion the country became softer the bus rolled through orchards with black trunks and effulgent pink or yellow foliage across brimming rivers through hamlets and at last into cloutie to halt in the central square the sides swung up those passengers with business in cloutie alighted among them gersen he looked around him with interest to the young how ard treesong cloutie would ha e seemed a most important place the center of the civilized universe where he might be brought once a year on some special occasion across the square gersen saw the hotel eon i on an ungainly fourstory structure high and narrow with a heavy overhanging roof and a pair of twostory w ings if howard i reesong were traveling to gladbetook to take part m his school reunion quite possibly like gersen he might choose to lodge at the bon ton the time for caution had arrived and indeed might already have passed him by at a haberdashers shop cersen changed into local garments a shirt ot heav green cloth bagbreeches gathered at the knee gra ool stockings and black broadtoed shoes a widebrimmed lowcrowned black hat tilted somewhat to the back of the head ihe local mannerisms a slow stifflegged gait with arms at the sides and face turned the book of dreams squarely forward were less readily simulated he would still be noticed as an outlander but less readily he crossed the square to the bon ton hotel and entered a dim lobby smelling of years upon years of waxed wood moldenng leather heavy cushions and unnameable local exudations the lobby was deserted the reception desk was dark gersen knocked at a wicket until a small old lady appeared from a back room in a shrill voice she demanded his business gersen replied with dignity i wish to take lodging for a few days so indeed where will you feed wherever i find the best meals those are far away over at the lake where folk forget stric ture and pamper their guts you must ingest what we choose to serve here in our dining room whatever is proper it is very proper the old woman peered at him slantwise what are you doing here are you for selling things she con trived to invest the word with an emphasis at once lubncious and minatory no i am selling nothing oh and after a pause nothing whatever nothing whatever thats a pity she declared in a voice suddenly bright and garrulous i always say that a body should buy and sell as they choose despite the health agency where are you from i cant place you youre not a mandyke nor a booder none of those do you burn fires or pour waters no never very well you may have the smiling sunrise room the womans face became so beatifically innocent that gersen instantly was prompted to ask what are the rates it is our best room reserved for important dignitaries it rents at a corresponding level how much eightythree svu per diem that is far too much let me see your schedule of rates well then five svu gersen was pleased with his room which included the lowest the demon princes of the central verandas a bathroom paneled in white wood an ad jacent sleeping cubicle a small gymnasium the time was now late afternoon gersen descended to the street looked right and left then set off to inspect the town the south end of the square was dominated by a stone statue and be hind a tall austere structure evidently a church or temple a plaque at the base of the statue identified the lordly form as ban dervoum the didram who held aloft a carpenters try square that he might gauge the souls of the dead behind the church grew a hne of heavy black deodars gaps in the foliage revealed a field on which stood a throng of white statues near the church gersen discovered a small stationers shop sell ing a miscellaneicy of small objects on a rack he noticed several copies of cosmopolis of assorted dates and an extant the extant cover displayed a picture of ten men and the caption who are these men name them correctly and win svu gersen entered the shop behind a pair of parallel counters to right and left stood a pair of small girls dressed in longsleeved black flocks their black hair was tied into topknots so tightly drawn that their eyes seemed to bulge into the hair a pair of coral russet fronds had been fixed on the counter gersen found for sale a pamphlet entitled the land of maunish official map and survey this authoritative rendering includes all roads towns riv ers bridges frontier posts together with physiographic de tails price centums gersen took a copy of the map and paid over a coin the girls protested instantly sir the price is two svu gersen indicated the printed notation the price is set at twentyfive centumsn that is for local residents said one girl outlanders must pay a surcharge said the other the book of dreams why is this asked gersen wondering how the girls knew him for an outlander in his new cloutie clothes because the map includes valuable secret information said the girl to the right in an earnest voice extremely valuable to an enemy army said the girl to the left even more grave but surely your enemies already possess maps ofmaunish perhaps not all of our enemies perhaps not with so much secret detail in that case said gersen your map is far more valuable than a mere two svu true but no one would pay such a price said one girl they would prefer to use any old thing said the other girl well it so happens that i am a local resident and not an en emy said gersen i live at the bon ton hotel therefore i am eligible for the lower rate the girls stood silent considering the theoretical basis ofger sens position before they could formulate an argument gersen was gone gersen sat on a bench and studied the map he found glad betook forty miles to the north on the banks of the sweet trelaw ney river gersen continued around the squarealong the way he noticed a sign pantilote garages vehicles of quality sale or hire by hour by day by week apply at our correctly managed workshops you will observe and approve the dutiful exactitude of our pro cesses didram rummel street gersen located didram rummel street and the pantilote ga rages where after considerable formality he succeeded in renting a threewheeled runabout which had been constructed on the premises from miscellaneous bits and pieces thf demon princes evening was already darkening the skies the way to gladbe took seemed too long a ourney gersen arranged to call for the vehicle on the following morning whereupon he would drive across goshen prairie to the early home of howard alan treesong from the teaching of didram bodo sime motto it is not good to inebriate nor to souse using swillage near or far beers or distillations expansion the toper is a fuming bore a loon a mongrel a social mockery often he soils his clothes and commits mal ditties he smells and belches his familiarities trouble all decent folk his songs and tirnlavs offend the ears he often gives breath to scurrilous conjecture the toper suborns good fruit and gives it to decay and the good person who wishes to enjoy the samvacity and good savor of the wholesome fruit is bereft and must raise this outcry why have you despoiled me toper of my fruit and given it to filthy decayrf the toper performs foolish dances he postures like a clown and cleans his ears with broomstraws he is prone to perform pugnacities upon good and earnest folk who chance to halt upon their way to chide him for his fully north of cloutie the countryside became wild and desolate first because ofthejumfer river boglands then b reason of long ledges of black rock which made the land fit only for grazing for the first the dfmon princes time gersen saw indigenous fauna ofmoudervelt twolegged toad like creatures bounding high after flying insects a band of lizard foxes with graygreen pangolin scales and a single optic orb they reared high to watch gersen pass by when he slowed the car they advanced with dancing sidelong steps for purposes gersen could not guess he drove on leaving the troop staring after him with the rockwallows behind the solitude persisted empty steppes spread away to the horizon a land gently rolling without trees lonesome and forlorn in the sunlight finally across the north appeared a dark line the trees along the banks of the great swomey river once across the river the land again became settled gersen drove through half a dozen ham lets as like to each other as eggs a main street a few cross streets an inn several shops a school to the side a hall a temple a varying number of houses and cottages close on midmorning gersen arrived at gladbetook a village much like those others along the road if perhaps a trifle larger a condition signaled by the uankwal tavern on the outskirts of town as well as the more pretentious swechers inn on the central avenue gersen halted the runabout to the side of swechers inn an ancient agglomeration of twenty guest rooms of various sizes on different levels the public chambers were no less irregular with sloping ceilings black woodwork and windows stained violet by a hundred years exposure to van kaathes starlight the stone ex terior could hardly be seen for vines along the front citizens of the town sat at their ease under an arbor at a desk in the entry hall stood a man seven feet tall and thin as a cane with waxen cheelcs and cavernous eye sockets your needs sir lodging if you please i prefer a suite of several rooms the innkeeper inspected gersen with raised eyebrows and sag ging mouth you are alone quite alone and you want several rooms if such a suite is available it seems an immoderate taste if i may say so how many rooms can you occupy at once in how many beds do you plan to sleep how many sanitary requirements are essential for your health the book of dreams no great matter said gersen give me a single room with a bath has my friend jacob bane arrived to swechers no not yet any outlanders at all besides myself no one here by the name of bane nor any other name you are the first to check in today please settle in advance for your accommodation a person who arrives like a waywisp from some far corner of the universe can depart as easily without paying his bill gersen was taken to a dim room with blue walls and a black ceiling which seemed higher than it was wide a stand supported a basin of water with a scrub brush a pad of gray felt covered the bed with a similar pad on the floor glancing into the bathroom gersen discovered a state of disorder the innkeeper anticipated his complaints at the moment this is the best we can offer the inn is heavily booked for an occasion two nights hence to bathe use the pan and the brush for your other needs go to the latrine down the hall the innkeeper departed luck is mith me gersen told himself the dankuall tavern is probably worse gersen wasted no time in the room he descended to the street looked right in the direction he had come then turned left and strolled into gladbetooks modest business district at golcher way he turned left crossed the sweet trelawney river by a mossy stone bridge on the side stood a statue in the likeness ofdidram runel fluter who held aloft in one hand a short curved knife in the other a severed set of male genitalia behind stood the church a sign read partitioners positive of creative truth there is no retreat there is no looking aside there is only the truth and its teaching a cemetery occupied the field opposite which was bordered by heavy deodars everywhere stood statues honoring the dead sim ulacra carved with uncanny skill from glossy white marble or syn thetic stuff the statues stood in groups and companies arranged as if in a colloquy of consolation for the grievous event which had been their common lot the dkmon princfs a quarter mile along the road another bridge crossed the broad slow swanibel river on its way to meet the sweet trelawney be yond gersen saw the gladbetook high school he halted and reflected a moment the time was something short of noon he turned and went back along golcher way into town at a meat market gersen asked directions to the farm owned by adrian hardoah turn left at the corner by swechers he was told make out of town youll be on virle way go four miles to the crossroads turn right on bausger lane the second farm on the left thats the hardoah place with the big green barn what do you want from hardoah dont think for money hes tight as a constipated duddle on a cheese diet gersen made a noncommittal reply and went his way in the runabout he set out along virle way to the north four miles across the prairie he came upon the crossroads and turned right into bausger lane a mile along the road and a hundred yards back from the road he saw a farmstead surrounded by garoms and peppernuts the foliage fluorescing in the light of van kaathes star another mile along the road he noticed a small cottage to the left of the road the hardoah farm it seemed somewhat modest and even ramshackle nor did he notice a green barn on a bench in the sunlight sat an old woman small and thin with a peaked wrinkled face beside her hung a coil of coarse string from which she tatted a patterned cloth working her stiff fingers with painful intensity gersen halted the vehicle and alighted good day madam good day sir would this be the hardoah place no sir by no means youll find the hardoahs yonder a mile along the road fifty yards to the side of the bungalow gersen noticed a dilap idated old structure obviously derelict surrounded by a copse of blueblack ginsap that looks to be an old schoolhouse said gersen it is indeed and where i taught thirty years and sat here an other twenty years watching the place fall apart nowadays they take children over the hill to the new school at leek youve lived here all this time aye indeed ive never had a man i drink water and whey the book of dreams and pot liquor i follow teaching close as close can be and i was judged a good teacher of the young you taught howard hardoah then i did that do you know him not well the old woman looked off through the air seeing scenes across the years ive often wondered what chanced with howard he was an odd little boy and moody ive his picture somewhere but id never find it he was like an elfchild in fact i remember him now at the school pageant where he represented the elf all dressed in green and brown and an elfish little elf he was wry and fidgety and with an eerie face ah yes and wasnt he naughty with little tammy fluter the fairy she cried out and howard was brought up short and no doubt roundly punished by his father they were fundamentals thats the strictest of the partitioning and mostly died out now youre not a fundamentalist im totally ignorant of the sect they espoused a strong creed and quite sensible it all were said that need be said they asserted mans sins could be bred out by careful choice and brother married sister and cousin married cousin so to achieve the best did you notice the statue to runel fluter the didram in town well he was master of the creed and did the work that needed to be done hut little thanks he got es pecially from those he considered unworthy oh those were rare days with teaching ever so strong now theres none left in these parts but the hardoahs and they dont practice the old ideas howard must have been quite a handful sometimes yes or he might be sweet as sweet could be he had overmuch imagination how he loved flowers and how his little mind worked one day he sorted the flowers out by color for the battle of the flowers and such wild antics never did you see with petals flying and the cries of the corpses from hither to yon went howard charging his red troops against the blues with roses dy ing in great gallantry and bluebells triumphant over the vervains ah me what a day then he went up to high school and did poorly or so im told he was small and young and no doubt the big boys bullied him a bit then he went at odds with the sadalflourys and naturally that was a scandal how so mmf hmm i shouldnt be calkin so much but its long ago the demon princes and times have changed though the sadalflourys are still important folk howard took a fancy to one of the girls i think it was suby she naturally jilted him and howard did something very reprehen sible and the sadalflourys were in a passion of rage only howard hastily departed and traveled offworld gersen bent over the womans tatting thats beautiful work its my best i say no more and it earns my victual gersen gave over ten svu you can start such a cloth for me if i dont come back well and good sell elsewhere without a thought but thank you sir not at all ive enjoyed your talk and now i must be on my wav a mile along the road gersen came to a farmstead with a con spicuous green barn to the side he halted the runabout and sur veyed the house a queer tingle of imminence coursing along his skin the house was like many another three stories high built of pink clapboard with blue trim at the windows a high roof broken by gables and dormers in the kitchen garden a tall man in blue trousers and a black shirt worked a cutthroat hoe noticing gersen and the runabout he paused in his work to stare gersen drove into the yard and was approached by the tall man evidently adrian hardoah his hair was yellowbrown streaked with gray cut with no attention to style his face was long bony and weatherbeaten he examined gersen with neither cordiality nor interest sir this is home farm so it is and you are adrian hardoah that is right adrian hardoah spoke in a soft deep voice with careful pace and precise enunciation i am henry lucas i represent extant magazine and i have come here from pontefract on aloysius ah that was the contest magazine hardoahs voice took on a more lively note true among millions of entries you were the first correctly to identify subject number six who is of course your son adrian hardoah instantly became defensive that should make no difference identification is identification the rook of dreams no argument whatever in fact i have come to award the prize thats grand news how much by our rules the first accurate single identification gains three hundred svu i carry that sum with me blessings on us with the help of the didrams and would you know that you just missed howard himself by no more than an hour hes come for his school reunion gersen smiled and shrugged an odd coincidence certainly but its nothing to me one way or the other he just happens to be a man in a photograph hes doing well is howard though he left us no coin and its been many long years since he went out from home but come inside the woman must hear the good news truth to tell i clear forgot the matter and never even thought to ask howard of his great publicity folk must be looking at him everywhere with his picture out like that few folk are so observant sir he followed adrian hardoah up the stairs and into a tidy kitchen a woman almost as tall as adrian looked around her face with a hundred elusive hints of howard treesong fascinated gersen under a wide square fore head her eyes were set a trifle too closely a long straight nose hung over a pale mouth and a nearinvisible chin characteristics which for better or worse gave her an unrelenting and secretive look with no indication of ease or humor still to adrians report of his winnings she responded with a totally ordinary gurgle of pleasure well isnt that fine so how ard has warded us willy nor nilly so it seems well then what ot a taste of tea and a good scone what do you say to that mr lucas id say thank you very much at adrians gesture gersen seated himself at the table he brought forth a packet of notes and began to count them out adrian spoke reverently to think that by the flick of chance no more did i look toward that photograph and only for its being in that outworld jinket extant and who won the grand prixe persons of the group are essentially strangers who chanced to meet at a pleasure resort an attendant at the resort was first to supply the names your son howard also submitted an accurate identification but too late the demon princes reba hardoah smiled a caustic smile isnt that just like how ard he always fell short by just so much a pity hist i do hear ledesmus hell be howards older brother a different sort altogether hell have the farm when we ford the flowing river ledesmus halted in the doorway surprised to see the offworld visitor he was bulkier than his father with apple cheeks and heavy lidded eyes which gave his face a look of sly humor adrian spoke out ledesmus step forward to meet mr henry lucas from a far planet he has brought us an account of money ledesmus pursed his lips to whistle pheeoo what a day first howard down from nowhere and now mr lucas coincidence said gersen still its a pity i missed him as i am ordered to write an article on the folk in the photograph adrian spoke in a voice of dispassionate judgment theres not much to say about howard he never worked a good stint around the farm he dreamed away his schooltime and i daresay hes noth ing very much today for all his travels now then said reba dont be too near with the boy youve always known him to be eerielike gersen asked do you expect him back adrian responded curtly no strange that he should come so far to stop by for just an hour or two reba tried to explain well we expect conduct just a bit in decorous from howard still we grieve to see him stray from teaching if only he would shake the star dust off his heels and come back home to work the fields with ledesmus that would give us joy ledesmus showing his sly grin to gersen said he wont be back he is more indecorous now than ever adrian agreed he wont be back he came out and looked the old place over all hed say was its the same but its not the same he spent as much time out in his old office as he did with his mother his office the old pump shack yonder where hed take himself with his books and papers and colored pens the word ardespant lacks contemporary equivalence it includes the notions of obsti nacy perverse wrongheadedness a eenng attitude toward somber reccitude the book of dreims ledesmus said soberly howard read too much for his men tality a lot of crazy offworld stuff he had a chair and a table and halfway through the night hed be out there burning lights until we called him to bed regular werd was howard where is he staying now adrian said dubiously he mentioned friends he wanted to visit ledesmus gave a jeering laugh friends howard there was nobody but poor nimpy cleadhoe and hes no more now then said reba in mild reproach you dont know everything ledesmus adrian said he came mainly for his school reunion still a person would think hed want to bide at home after all its here he was born and here he was bred and this is the dirt that made up his bones gersen pushed the sheaf of svu certificates over to adrian hardoah there you are sir and our gratitude for participating in the contest i suppose youll want to subscribe to extantv adrian pulled at his chin well give thought to the matter its an offworld jinket and beyond our concerns if i cant fathom the acts of the falsehead ulms in next land to north of us how can i hope to understand the doings at alpheratz or caph no well study our own knowledge which after all is pure truth so the didrams tell us blessed be the teaching murmured reba gersen rose to his feet id like to look about your farm if i may it will serve as background for the article must write on howard certainly ledesmus show the gentleman about gersen and ledesmus went out into the yard ledesmus peered sidelong at gersen so now you must write of howard who wants to read of him theres great interest in the contest ill mention your father and mother and naturally vou indeed now therell be my picture and all a manshaped siipernaniril being who prowls b night and sleeps underground by day according to mannish folklore it hides in the shadows waiting to pounce on children and carry them away the demon princes unfortunately not i dont have a camera with me youre older than howard aye three years did you get along well well enough father allowed no bickers i did the work and howard dreamed away in his office gersen stood irresolute the spoor of howard alan treesong was strong but seemed to lead nowhere id like to look into how ards office right yonder its changed not at all in thirty years we pump irrigation water from the pond for orchard and truck house water we draw up from the well thats another pump ledesmus led the way to a shed ten feet long by eight feet wide he pulled at the door forcing it open against the screech of cor roded hinges two windows admitted light and showed a dusty clutter place hasnt changed much said ledesmus yonder is his table and thats the very chair where he planted his bewalkus these shelves held his books and papers he was neat was howard with everything just so and where are the books and papers hard to say some are back to the house some destroyed howard was fidgety with his things when he took to far ports little enough was left behind howard liked his secrets had he friends what of girls ledesmus made a guttural sound of scornful amusement howard never had the knack for girls he talked too much and acted too little if you get my meaning he liked little young girls and he played dirty on one or two but dont print that ledesmus looked over his shoulder toward the house father never heard these tales hed have skinned howard for wallpaper it didnt mean much howard just wanted to try out the equipment after all thats why its there arent i right teaching is a bit vague on this score but if sarter martus didnt want girls for to play on hed have wrought them with snapteeth like fish traps if you get mv mean ing his great love was a girl called what was it now she drowned in persimmon lake zada memar a pretty thing friends there was nimpy cleadhoe from down the road he and howard roamed the woods together and went out for nuts and he was the rook of dreams somewhat a friend father didnt like it because old man cleadhoe was then town marmelizer whats a marmelizer youve seen the cemetery where dead folk stand theyre all marmels its low work with dead stuff and all still theyre gone now and that was howards friend if friends thevwere ledesmus turned gersen a sheepish smile i ruined that friendship me and my foolishness how so well howard treasured a red writing book and he was most private of it one time nimpy called him out of his office and sent him to see mother over something or another i reached through the window and took the red book and tossed it over the pump well as luck would have it the book slid behind the siding i went back of the barn and waited howard came out and went to lock up his book and couldnt find it and then i never saw such crazy doings he began talking in funny voices and hopping around then he saw poor innocent nimpy and jumped him i ran out and pulled him away before he killed the boy that was howards friend and he wasnt a friend after that in fact he never come back how ard went off to summer teaching and i forgot about the book lets see if its still there ledesmus stepped over the pump pulled aside the wallboard and thrust down his arm hope i dont grab the hot end of a cang i got it he held up a red notebook and tossed it to gersen who took it out into the sunlight and glanced through the contents ledesmus came from the pump room whats in the book gersen handed it over and ledesmus nipped through the pages nothing important what kind of writing is that never saw anything like it before its hard to make out whatever its tomfoolery whats the use of writing what no body can read heres pictures dukes and kings in fancy dress silly rigobands at a carnival father thought howard was copying out the organon i thought he was making up girlstuff howard fooled us all it would seem so said gersen ill take it off your hands for indigenous stinging insect reaching a length of four inches the demon princes a souvenir of gladbetook would you take ten svu for your trou ble well i dont know ledesmus hesitated then took the money i guess its nothing father would want just dont speak of the matter ill say nothing and you dont mention the book to howard should you see him before i do i wonder where hes staying ledesmus shrugged i think he planned to stay here until he had words with father and he left as soon as he arrived he might be at swechers inn since thats the best in town once more in gladbetook gersen went to the arbor in front of swechers inn and found a seat at one of the tables his back to the lowering afternoon sun his black shadow across the scrubbed pinkwood table a tall gangling boy all arms legs and neck came to inquire his needs how sir what are you serving for lunch lunch is out sir just a bit too late i could get you a dish of maunce with a crust of our good bread wtiat is maunce well its a kind of puttogether from herbs and river fish that will do me very well and will you drink whats to be had whatever you choose sir id like a pint of cold beer that we dont serve sir cold or warm in that case show me the card or the list nothing of the sort here sir people know what they like with out reading about it i see what are those folk yonder taking they have our chilled gruel seepings and those folk to the side they take tanglefoot soak what else can be had kidney tonic nibbet soursap toddy belchberry sprig whatisnibbet vitalizing tea ill try nibbet at once sir the boy departed and gersen was left to ponder his situation the rook of drkas s near at hand perhaps within earshot was howard alan treesong gersen could feel the weight of his presence if gersen could lure him a few steps out of town perhaps through mention of the old red notebook and drown him in the sweet trelawney there would be a satisfactory end to the affair unlikely that all would go so well the serving boy brought a platter of fish stew bread and a pot of tea gersen poured the tea tasted to discover flavors to which he could put no names one of the ingredients seared first the tongue then the entire oral cavity the servant boy hiding a grin asked politely sir is nibbet to your taste excellent gersen had devoured white curry in the lascar quarter of zamboanga he had drunk pepper rum in mama pottss swillery at sairle city on copus incidentally im expecting a friend from offworld he doesnt seem to be here at the inn are you reserving rooms for mr slade or any other foreigners that i dont know sir gersen produced a coin find out but discreetly as i want to surprise my friend hes coming for the school reunion the boy scooped up the coin and departed gersen stolidly ate the maunce as he had eaten dozens of other such dishes across the inhabited planets the boy returned nobody like that here sir and were hold ing no rooms where else could he be well theres dankwall tavern down the road but their rooms are poor and theres otts resort out on skooneys lake where rich owls go to roost else theres nothing closer than the inn at blurry corners i see where is the telephone in the office but first pay for maunce and nibbet ive had such tricks played on me before just as you like gersen laid down coins on second thought gersen gave the boy another svu be so good as to call first skooneys lake then the dankwall tavern and inquire as to offworld visitors here for the school reunion mind you dis creetly now dont so much as mention me as you say sir minutes passed gersen essayed another taste of nibbet the boy returned no one known sir the reunion is mostly locals s the demon princes though therell be a few in from foreign places ditty jingols uncle is in from bantry and some others from wimping your friend will likely be along tonight anything else sir not just now the boy departed gersen brought out the red book on the front was a title carefully printed in block letters the book of dreams gersen opened the book and concentrated his attention upon young howard hardoahs handwriting an hour passed two hours gersen looked up turned gauged the height of van kaathes star late afternoon he slowly closed the book and tucked it into his pocket he beckoned to the serving boy what is your name my name is vitching sir vitching this is an svu it is for you presently there will be another in return i want you to perform a service for me vitching blinked all very well sir but how i cant counter wink teaching id blight all my good deeds of the past youll find no conflict with teaching i want you to watch for that offworld person i mentioned to you well one thing with another i see no reason why i cant do this work remember the work must be done in secrecy if one word leaks out ill be seriously angry no need to fear sir gersen transferred the svu to the skinnyfingered hand i am now going out to walk about the town precious little to see sir for folk like you who have been to cloutie well ill still look about mind you not a word to anyone of our business right sir gersen set out along the street and now he felt conspicuous in his citified cloutie clothes he paused at a clothing shop and looked over the merchandise a tray beside the door displayed sharptoed black boots on a rack hung scarves hats and high gaiters in mole skin gray embroidered with green and red he entered the shop and fitted himself out in gladbetook style a highshouldered coat the book of dreams of black furze loosebottomed trousers gathered at the knees with black straps a wide green hat fitting low over his forehead instead of tilted back cloutiestyle looking in the mirror gersen saw a bumpkin sufficiently bland and moony to deceive any offworld eye leaving the shop he turned down golcher way he crossed the sweet trewney passed didram runel fluter the orthome tric ghurch and opposite the cemetery where marmels of the dead stood with their kindred with uneasy sideglances gersen marched past in the uncanny conviction that blank white eyes shifted to watch as he went by a quarter mile beyond he crossed the swan ibel river and once again stood before the school a structure con forming to the most elaborate tenets ofmaunish architecture each side extended a wing capped by a baroque tower a heavy steep faced roof culminated in a belfry of fluted brass surmounted by a tall brass finial in the silvergold light from the setting van kaa thes star each detail each crotchet bracket and ornament was picked out in strong contrast over the gate a sign read th anniversary reunion welcome the return of the famous galloping flatfish class galloping flatfish an old pleasantry a special joke to be ap prehended only by members of the class an effort to think of treesong in this environment walking this road climbing the school steps peering from the tall windows between the north wing and the swanibel extended a paved pavilion a place for students to idle gossip survey the river a dozen men and women worked on the pavilion now hanging fes toons arranging tables and chairs decorating the speakers platform with banderoles tall gilt fans and tassels gersen sauntered into the driveway climbed broad steps of pol ished red porphyry crossed a piazza approached a line ofbronze andglass doors one of which stood ajar gersen entered found himself in a long central hall that ran east and west at the far end van kaathes star poured level light through other glass doors on the walls to either side hung a suc cession of group photographs graduating classes reaching far into the past gersen stood listening silence except for a wisp of music ris the demon princes ing falling halting abruptly a nearby door stood open looking through gersen saw a tall thinfaced man with a bush of white hair and a pair of girls each of whom played the flageolet in time to majestic sweeps of the mans long arms gersen moved away and looked up at the photographs he saw a date fiftytwo years past as he proceeded along the corridor the dates approached the present gersen halted at the photograph dis playing the class of twentyfive years before and studied the young faces gazing forth some proudly posing others grinning sheepishly still others sullen and bored with the entire procedure voices and footsteps from the music room came the instructor and his pupils the instructor stared suspiciously at gersen the girls after an incurious glance departed the instructor spoke m a voice stiff and pedantic sir the school is not open to visitors i am now leaving and must lock the door may i ask you to leave t have been waiting for you sir might we speak together a moment concerning what gersen began to develop an idea which had just entered his head you are professor of music here at the school here i am professor kutte i give lessons from little musical barbarians i create the majesty of an orchestra away from here i am valdemar kutte master musician and director of the grand salon orchestra valdemar kutte raked gersen up and down with eyes sharpened by decades of instructing children in the correct fingering of piano lute harp flageolet and liltaphone and who are you mr offworlder so i see how do you see that asked gersen i thought to look an ordinary gladbetooker not with those clumsy boots and you wear your trousers low here we cultivate style not slackness without intent to offend you seem like someone dressed for a charade gersen laughed ruefully i will try to profit by your instruc tion good day sir we must depart one moment is the grand salon orchestra playing at to morrows festival valdemar kutte responded curtly they have engaged no or chestra whatever owing to financial stringencies the book of dreams circumstances would seem to warrant the presence of your orchestra perhaps so as always there is someone to hold a tight hand on the purse strings usually the most affluent of the persons in authority this is how they become affluent yes perhaps how long have you been musical director here far too long i celebrated my twentyfifth anniversary three years ago i may add that no one took notice of the celebration save myself so then you instructed these folk gersen indicated the pho tograph on the wall many of them some had will but no talent some had tal ent but no will many more lacked both a very few displayed both qualities and these i remember what of this group who were the musicians aha darben sadalfloury had a nice touch on the tantalem i believe that he still plays poor mirtisha van boufer she labored four years on the vanence but always played flat howard hardoah he was most adept but undisciplined alas i believe that he might have gone far howard hardoah which would he be third row down on the end the lad with the brown hair gersen scrutinized the young howard alan treesong who showed a not illfavored face with a square forehead wide and high neat light brown hair an intense bluegray gaze the candid and wholesome effect was flawed by a foxy chin a drooping girlish mouth and a nose somewhat too long and too thin fadra hessel of course plays loitre to this day at the cate chisms i confess my memory brings forward little else sir we must depart and lock the school the two made their exit the door was locked valdemar kutte bowed a pleasure talking to you sir one moment said gersen a pleasant concept has come to mind i have strong sentiments toward this particular class and i as an anonymous benefactor will engage an orchestra to augment the oy of the occasion can you suggest such an orchestra the instructor stood erect eyes snapping fortuitously i can do so i refer you to the valdemar kutte grand salon orchestra the dfan princes which i personally supervise it is the only conceivable choice true there are other local groups scattleboggers bangandbump groups and the like but i control the single musical organization worthy of the name this side ofcloutie and are you available for the evening in question by chance i am quite free then consider yourself engaged as of now what will be your fee well let me think how many pieces will you require generally i present two tarables on the right and left zumbolt soprano pipe gamba cornet vibre fiddles a guitar and flageolet in the classical manner for an engagement of this sort i ordinarily ask two hundred svu but professor kutte looked dubiously at gersens attire i wont quibble said gersen you are hired at two hundred and fifty svu my only stipulation is this i want to become a member of your orchestra for this engagement only eh you are a musician i cant play a note ill tap quietly on a drum and not disturb anyone you would disturb us all the drum is a babys noisemaker what would you suggest this is preposterous why cannot you merely listen from be yond the fence i want to participate close at hand still if you cant no we will find a way can you play so much as a tin whistle gersen could not help but feel humiliation at his incompetence i have never so much as tried bah this is bathos come with me we will see what we can do the only good drummer is a dead drummer valdemar kutte director grand salon orchestra of gladbetook in valdemar kuttes studio gersen was handed a long wooden flute a childs instrument said kutte disdainfully still to sit with the grand salon one must play if only a wooden pipe now fingers here here here so now blow gersen achieved a sour tone once more three hours later gersen had learned one of the five basic scales and kutte was fatigued for now that is enough i will number these stops one four five and eight we shall play simple tunes promenades gallops an occasional ramble you will play onefive onefive onefiveeight onefiveeight in time to the music occa sionally fourfiveeight or onefourfive wen we use a different mode i will furnish you a different instrument i can do no more please pay me my fee in advance plus twentyfour svu for three hours intensive instruction gersen paid over the money now then take this flute when opportunity offers practice play the scale play simple progressions above all learn onefive eight onefive onefive ill do my best you must do better than your best remember it is the grand salon orchestra with whom you play even though play is a pre the dfmon princfs tentious word for your level of achievement and you will of course be making only soft sounds i hope that all will go well it is an eccentric situation but for a musician life is a succession of re markable events we will meet here tomorrow at middle afternoon then you will go to van zeds store to he fitted in proper musi cians uniform as worn by the grand salon orchestra i will in struct him before you arrive then after securing your uniform come here and will supply further instructions as best i can who knows this occasion may make a musician of you gersen looked doubtfully at the flute perhaps so once more at swechers inn gersen dined on lentil paste a stew of pale meat and herbs a salad of river reeds and a half loaf of crusty bread vitching the serving boy reported no success in his investigations but gersen rewarded him suitably darkness fell on gladbetook leaving the inn gersen wan dered up the main avenue to the center of town at each corner of the square a tall post supported a whitegreen globe around which careened dozens of footlong pink insects with eight soft wings to either side like the oars of a galley the shops were dark and empty the haberdasher had ne glected to move his tray of boots inside and his scarves hung as before where anyone so inclined could purloin the entire selection other merchants seemed equally casual the folk of gladbetook were evidently not addicted to larceny in the center of town nightlife was nonexistent gersen re turned along the main street past swechers to the dankwall tav ern where in the common room to the light of a few dim lamps a half dozen farm workers drank soursmelling beer gersen re turned to swechers inn went up to his room where he softly practiced the flute for an hour until his lips failed then he brought out the book of dreams and puzzled over its crabbed script appar ently young howard had evolved a set of heroic tales involving a company of heroes whose persons howard had depicted with lov ing care and in the most intricate detail gersen put the book aside and tried to make himself comfort able upon the unyielding bed in the morning he followed kuttes instructions he practiced the flute and presented himself to kuttes studio on the extension the book of dreams of golcher way a hundred yards south of the square kutte heard him play the scales without enthusiasm now try onefourfive i havent reached that stage yet kutte raised his eyes to the ceiling he heaved a sigh well what must be must be that is the lesson all musicians learn i have spoken to mrs lavenger she is chairman of the reunion i told her that an anonymous benefactor had hired the grand salon or chestra and she was very pleased we must arrive tomorrow after noon at the fourth hour and arrange ourselves we will play before the supper when the guests drink liquor outland fashion and during supper after supper there will be encomiums and congratulations then several dance promenades and no doubt the stylish folk will take punch which is not my habit needless to say as an out worlder you have probably seen inebriation in your time i have so indeed glory to the teaching didrams think of that still you seem a relatively sound man i seldom if ever drink overmuch but is not the stuff pernicious ive heard opinions in both directions kutte seemed not to hear he knit his eyebrows thoughtfully where to your knowledge is the most intolerably drunken den of the oikumene gersen considered not an easy choice to make a hundred thousand saloons from earth out to last call clamor for that dis tinction twasts place on krokinole can hold its head high dirty reds on the pier at daisys landing on canopus iii is another wellknown resort how fortunate are we in gladbetook our decency is the envy of the cosmos however and i say this with regret tomorrow night our reputation may become tarnished the sadalflourys the van bessems the lavengers all surely will taste essences and stings but none will trouble us so i feel assured or at least hopeful once more let us hear those scales now onefiveeight onefour five onefive onefive onefourfive harp on the sacred ram stop it will have to do today i can hear no more practice diligently tonight concentrate on sound production on tone just ness pitch timbre clarity precise attack and sonority wtien you alter tones raise one finger depress the other simultaneously not i hp ufmon princes after a lapse of a second or so practice finger placement when you seek to put a finger on tour let it be four neither two nor six cultivate verve avoid that dreary flatness which now pervades vour articulation is this all clear perfectly good cried valdemar kutte heartily tomorrow will show us hope and improvement on the following afternoon the orchestra assembled at kuttes stu dio kutte distributed scores took gersen aside and listened as he played his parts kutte had arrived at a state of fatalistic calm and made no expostulations it will have to do he said play very softly and all will be well especially if essences flow freely kutte led gersen before the other musicians all pay heed i wish to introduce my friend mr gersen who has become an am ateur of the flute he plays experimentally on this single occasion only we must all try to be polite to him the musicians turned to look at gersen and muttered among themselves gersen submitted to the attention with as much aplomb as he could muster the orchestra set off down golcher way each man carrying his instrument except gersen who carried five flutes tuned in var ious modes all were dressed alike in black suits highshouldered coats and bagbottom breeches gray gaiters pointed black shoes flatcrowned black hats with downdrooping brims the group approached the school and gersen grew ever more uneasy the scheme which originally had seemed so ingenious now as the critical moment approached he saw to be inconvenient cranky and uncertain if howard treesong gave the musicians more than a cursory look he might recogni e henry lucas ofa tant which would create an awkward situation howard treesong would undoubtedly arrive well armed and with an entourage in contrast gersen carried five flutes and a kitchen knife bought the same morning from an ironmonger the orchestra filed into the pavilion placed their instruments upon the platform and waited while valdemar kutte conferred with ossim sadalfloury of the locally important sadalfloury family a portly and jovial man in a fine suit of dark green gabardine valdemar kutte reomed the orchestra a collation will be set the book of dreams behind the pavilion for our convenience it will include braised na vets and conserve there will also be tea and raisin water at the back of the group someone muttered and laughed kutte glared and spoke with meaningful emphasis mr sadalfloury re alizes that we are all valetudenanans and respects our convictions no essences or fermented products will be served to the orchestra as that in any event would detract from its performance so now up on the platform hup hup hah lively and smart everyone the musicians seated themselves on the platform arranged mu sic tuned instruments kutte placed gersen in the back row be tween the zumbold and the gamba both instruments played by large blond men of phlegmatic disposition gersen arranged his flutes in the order kutte had dictated he played a few tentative scales contriving to seem musicianly then he sat back and watched the old classmates as they entered the pavilion many were local residents others had arrived from out lying townships a few resided in far lands and a few had made the journey to gladbetook from offworld they greeted each other with cries of marveling surprise and brassy laughter each astonished to discover how the others had aged hearty salutations were ex changed between folk of equal social standing greetings more care fully measured took place between persons of disparate status howard hardoah as these folk knew him was not yet in evi dence when he arrived what then gersen had not even the ves tige of a plan at the fourth hour of the afternoon the reunion officially began the tables were already filled with groups to the right of the bandstand the gentry had tended to collect to the left sat farm folk and shopkeepers a few tables to the far left were occupied by river folk who lived on barges the men wearing brown corduroy the women coarsewoven pantaloons and longsleeved blouses the gentry so gersen noted sipped liqueurs from exquisite little flag ons of blue and green glass when a flagon was empty it was dropped with a mannered gesture into a basket valdemar kutte carrying a fiddle stepped up on the platform he bowed to right and left then turned to his orchestra shar mellds dance the full version easy but lightsome not too much vigor in the duets are we ready kutte glanced at gersen waved a finger the fourth mode no not that one yes correct he jerked his elbows the orchestra broke into a merry bounce the demon princes about with gersen blowing the tiute as he had been taught though quietly the piece ended gersen gratefully put down the flute it might have gone worse he thought the basic rule seemed to be to stop playing wen everyone else stopped valdemar kutte bespoke another tune and as before signaled gersen in regard to the proper instrument the tune bad bengfer was familiar to everyone present all vigorously sang the choruses and stamped their heels on the floor the song so far as gersen could determine celebrated the esca pades of bengfer a drunken roustabout who fell into the cesspool at the back of buntertown convinced that he had fallen into a vat of nipdoodle beer he drank to satiety and when van kaathes star rose to illuminate the scene astonished passersby discovered bengfers rotund belly protruding above the banks of the cesspool an unsavory song thought gersen but valdemar kutte conducted his orchestra with gusto gersen took advantage of the general con fusion to blow more daringly into his flute receiving only a warning glance or two from kutte a gentleman from a table to the right came up to the bandstand and spoke to valdemar kutte who responded with a peevish if obsequious bow kutte addressed the company by request miss taduca milgher will sing for us oh no cried taduca milgher from her table utter terror she was urged to the platform while valdemar kutte stood smiling sourly taduca milgher sang several ballads a lonesome bird am i my little red barge on the river and pinkrose the space pirates daughter the tables were full the latecomers apparently had all arrived gersen began to wonder if i loward treesong would after all be on hand for the occasion taduca milgher retired to her table supper was announced and the orchestra went to enjoy their collation behind the service screen evening had come to gladbetook a hundred fairy lamps hang ing from a bamboo trellis illuminated the pavilion at their tables the patricians dined at leisure and took their liqueurs folk who the book of dreams interpreted teaching more earnestly sat over pots of tea but missed very little of what went on at the stylish tables unreality thought gersen where was howard treesong near at hand came a sudden message from his subconscious harsh and strong gersen looked across the edge of the pavilion out over the river meadow time seemed to freeze unreality dissipated now was the true the real now near the river three men stood motionless looking toward the pavilion gersen turned looked off toward the road by the fence faces and garments blurred by twi light stood three other men gersen knew by their postures that these were not men of gladbetook all was changed to this moment the reunion had been an occasion of froth and fancy exaggerated quaint absurd beyong the glimmer of the fairy lamps were fancies of another sort brood ing and sinister gersen went to the edge of the pavilion and looked to the south he discerned other shapes inconspicuous under a copse of elms kutte called his orchestra back to the platform now then we will play rhapsody of dreaming maidens mind now grace and delicacy revelry among the reunited schoolmates had reached a mellow state of joviality and good fellowship friends called to old friends across the pavilion recalling escapades feats and jokes social rig ors were loosening badinage included folk along the length of the pavilion never never it was crambert all the while i was cen sured and blamed hoy there sadkin remember the stink flower in miss boabs bouquet what a lark eh most fearful scandal ever that was a year before your time he was known as pussybritches ever after wtiat happened to tussybritches drowned in the quade canal poor chap fell from his barge worse scandal yet was fimfles periscope remember that aye so i do over the transom into the girls dressing room for knees elbows and all between what a thought was that fimfle what a sorry chap where is he tonight not a clue hey there whatever happened to fimfle dont mention the horrid little fellow this from adelie lagnal at the sadalfloury table a sound like the lowest tone of an enormous gong was it real or subliminal gersen felt it but no one else seemed to notice in the entrance stood a tall squareshouldered figure tight trousers of green velour encased his long strong legs over a loose the dfmon princes longsleeved white shirt he wore a black vest with purple and gold fobs his ankleboots were pale brown leather a soft black cap was pulled askew across his wide high forehead he stood in the en trance smiling a twisted smile then with exaggerated self effacement he went to a vacant table nearby and seated himself still smiling his twisted smile from the sadalfloury table came a hoarse choked whisper which penetrated a sudden silence its fimfle himself howard alan treesong or howard hardoah slowly turned his head and looked toward the sadalflourys then he glanced toward the bandstand his gaze passed over gersen and fixed upon val demar kutte and his smile became a trine wider the school chums resumed their conversations back and forth went the badinage but not so easy and not so free as eyes turned curiously toward howard hardoah at last morna van hulgen one of the chairwomen took herself in hand and approaching gave him a hearty and only faintly false welcome which howard hardoah accepted graciously morna van hulgen gestured toward the buffet table proffering supper how ard hardoah smiled shook his head morna looked uncertainly around the room from group to group then turned back to the suave man at the table before her its so nice seeing you after all these years id never have known you except you havent really changed the years have been kind to you very kind indeed i am happy with them i dont remember your particular friends but you mustnt sit here alone theres saul cheebe you remember him hes sit ting with elvinta gierle and her husband from puch of course i remember saul cheebe i remember everyone and everything why not join him or shimus woot theres so much to talk about she indicated the tables which were well to the left end of the room howard hardoah glanced briefly toward the tables in question saul or shimus is it both as i recall were lummoxes dull and dirty i on the other hand was a philosopher well perhaps so still people do change not so consider me for instance i am still a philosopher even more profound than before the book of dreams morna made uneasy movements preparatory to edging away well thats very nice howard so then with these considerations in mind what groups would you recommend that i join the sadalflourys yonder or the van bouyers or for that matter your own morna pursed her lips and blinked really howard im sure that youd be welcome anywhere its just that well at school you know and i thought you thought of me as a poor vagabond of space returning tired and forlorn but full of sentiment to rejoin shimus and saul at our class reunion in some respects morna time is like a mag nifying lens as a boy i never so much as tasted liqueurs or essences i brooded upon these illicit delights and the pretty little flasks be came objects of fascination and wonder be so good as to signal for the steward morna and sit with me together we will taste nectar of phlox and blue tears and nowyouseeme morna drew back a step there is no general steward here howard the drink you see has been privately supplied and now in that case i will accept your invitation howard hardoah jumped to his feet we will join your table and no doubt wim berly can spare a flask or two from his basket with a debonair gesture he urged morna across the pavilion to the table she shared with her spouse wtmberly bloy andjenore sadalfloury peder and ellicent vorvelt the group gave howard hardoah a cool and minimal welcome his response was an easy salute thank you all morna has com mended me to this noble old blue tears and i will gladly take a dram or two gentlemen and ladies my best regards let the fes tivities proceed there is no formal program saidjenore are none of your old friends here just yourselves said howard hardoah no program you say we must see about that after all a reunion should be mem orable thank you wimberly ill try another gill hey there di rector kutte strike up a tune valdemar kutte performed a rigid inclination of the head and shoulders howard hardoah chuckled and leaned back in his chair he has altered not a whit same dry old frump some of us develop thk demon princes in one direction some in another right blov youve developed outward indeed youre quite corpulent bloy sadalfloury became red in the face it is not a matter care to discuss howard ilardoah had already passed on to a different subject so many sadalflourys in fluter township i cant keep the various branches separate as i recall you are of the senior line that is correct and who now is head of the family that would be my father mr nomo sadalfloury he is not present tonight he is not a member of this class and what of suby sadalfloury who was once so beautiful you are evidently referring to my sister mrs suby ver ahe she is present where is she sitting at the table yonder with her husband and others howard hardoah swung about and inspected the darkhaired matron at a table twenty feet away he rose to his feet and went to lean over the group suby do you recognize me you are howard hardoah i believe suby ver ahes voice was cool i am he and who are these others my husband paul my daughters mirl and maud mr and mrs janust of river vista mr and mrs gildv of lake skooney and their daughter halda howard hardoah acknowledged the introductions and returned to suby what an event meeting you again i am happy now that i came your daughters are as lovely as you were at their age subys voice was colder than ever i am surprised that you should wish to bring old events to mind paul ver ahe said astonishing that you should choose to ap pear at all howard hardoah showed a plaintive smile was i not invited is this not my class and my school paul ver ahe said gruffly certain things are best left unsaid quite true howard drew up a chair and seated himself if i may ill try a flask of your ammarv i have not invited you to do so the book of dreams tush paul dont be mean does not your mill grind out ton after ton of valuable murdock flour the mill is still in operation i dispose of the profits as i see fit howard hardoah threw back his head and laughed a pleasure to meet you all he took up mirls hand and kissed her fingers especially you i have an absolutely unappeasable insatiable per haps is not quite the word admiration for beautiful girls and be fore the evening is over we must arrange to meet again paul ver ahe started to rise to his feet but howard hardoah had already turned away from mirl he tilted the flask ofammary to his lips and swallowed the contents at a gulp refreshing in proper style he dropped the empty flask into a basket subys attention had been distracted she touched her husbands arm paul who are those people she pointed to the edge of the pavilion there stood three hardfaced men wearing uniforms of gray and black with black casques each carried a short heavy gun mrs janust cried out softly they are everywhere theyre all around us howard hardoah said in a negligent voice pay them no heed they are part of my entourage perhaps i should make an an nouncement to allay curiosity howard hardoah jumped up on the bandstand school chums old acquaintances others you will notice here and there groups of what appear to be battle troops they are in fact a squad of my companions tonight they wear this rather forbidding costume which tells us that they are in a somber mood wtien they wear yellow youll find them jaunty and gay when they wear white we call them death dolls on this occasion attend their wise counsels and well all enjoy an evening of fun everyone proceed with the party let the rem iniscences flow jenore sadalfloury tells me that no entertainments have been planned i feared as much and saw fit to arrange a little program let me talk briefly of myself perhaps of everyone at tending the dear old school i was most innocent i laugh now to think of my illusions ah that dear dreamy lad twentyfive years gone at school he discovered a mysterious new world of illicit pleasures and tantalizing possibilities but when he tried to explore and extend himself he was rebuffed nothing went right for him he was bullied abused taunted and given an odious nickname thk demon princes fimfle bloy sadalfloury i believe was first to use that expression am i correct in this blov bloy sadalfloury puffed out his cheeks but made no response howard hardoah gave his head a slow marveling shake poor howard the girls treated him little better even now i wince at the slights suby sadalfloury played a particularly heartless game which i will not describe i now invite her charming daughters on a cruise aboard my ship we will visit interesting regions of space and i assure them that in my company they will not be bored it is possible that suby may be distressed and lonesome but she should have considered the possible consequences of her acts twentyfive years ago which resulted in my own departure from giadbetook in sheer point of fact nothing could have been more to my advantage i am now a very rich man i could buy all giadbetook and never notice philosophically i am a far more definite person i subscribe to the doctrine of cosmic equilibrium in simple terms for every tit there must be a tat now for tonights program it is a little pastiche called a noble schoolboys daydream of jus tice how fortunate we are to have on hand many principals to the seminal circumstances cornelius van bouyers chairman of arrangements came hur rying forward howard youre talking extravagant folly you cant be serious in fact youre making fun of us all come down at once theres a good fellow and well all enjov the evening howard raised a finger two companions led cornelius van bouyers from the pavilion and locked him in the girls gymnasium and he was seen no more that night howard hardoah turned to the orchestra gersen twenty feet away hoped that a widebrimmed hat and a bland expression were adequate disguise howard hardoah barely glanced at him director kutte it gives me sreat pleasure to see you tonight do you remember me not vell that is because you flew into a rage with me and snatched away my fiddle you said i played like a drunken squirrel yes remember the occasion you used a clumsy vibrato in the attempt for sentiment you achieved only larmoyance interesting you do not play this style decidedly not each note should be met justly and precisely with an edge to each side the book of ormms s let me remind you of a musicians truism said howard har doah when you stop going up you start going down you have never played drunken squirrel style and it is time that you should make the essay in order to play like a drunken squirrel while you cannot become a squirrel at least you can become drunken here we have the necessary essences drink professor kuttc then play as you never have played before director kutte bowed stiffly and pushed aside the proffered flasks excuse me i do not drink ferments or spirits teaching expressly condemns their use bah tonight we throw a blanket over theology as we might cover a cantankerous parrot let us rejoice drink professor drink here or outside the pavilion with the companions i have no taste for drink but since i am forced kutte threw the contents of a flask down his throat he coughed the flavor is bitter yes that is bitter ammary here try wild sunlight that is somewhat better let me try the blue tears yes tolerable but quite enough howard hardoah laughed and clapped kutte between his nar row shoulders while gersen watched sadly so near and yet so tar the zumbold player next to him muttered the man is insane if he comes within reach ill clap the zumbold over his head you make play with the flute and well have him helpless in a trice by the entrance stood two men the first short and thick as a stump near bald with a square head and flat features the second spare saturnine with short thick black hair hollow cheeks a long pale jaw and chin neither wore a companion uniform see those two men gersen made a discreet indication they are watching and waiting for just some such foolishness i am not a man to accept humiliation growled the zumbold player tonight you had better go carefully or you may not awake to life tomorrow morning director kutte ran his hand through his hair his eyes had become a trifle glassy and he lurched as he turned to his orchestra play us a tune called i loward hardoah drunken squirrel style if you please kutte mumbled to his orchestra gypsy firelight in aeo lian the demon princes howard hardoah listened carefully as the orchestra played keeping time with his finger presently he called out enough now for the program it gives me great pleasure to present to nights entertainment it has been germinating for twentyfive years since i am the impresario and since the themes derive from my own experiences the subjective point of view need come as no surprise let us begin our stage properties are at hand i roll back the curtain of time we are now at school with howard hardoah a dear lad mistreated by bullies and fickle girls i recall one such incident maddo strubbins i see you yonder you seem as over bearing now as then come forward i wish to recall an incident to your mind maddo strubbins glowered and sat back defiantly the com panions approached he lurched to his feet and sauntered toward the bandstand a tall burly man with coarse dark hair and heavy features he stood looking up at howard hardoah with mingled contempt and uncertainty howard hardoah spoke in a harsh brassy voice how good to see you after all these years do you still play on the quadrangles no that is a game for children striking a ball back and forth once we both thought differently i went on the court with my new racquet and ball you came with wax buddle and pushed me off the courts you said cool your arse fimfle you must wait on your betters so you played your game using my ball do you remember when i protested that i had arrived first you said sit quiet fimfle i cant play my best with you caterwauling in my ear when you had finished you hit my ball over the fence and it was lost in the weeds do you remember maddo strubbins made no reply i have long felt the deprivation of that golden day forever lost said howard hardoah it has hung in my memory a frus tration the price of the ball itself was fifty centums my time spent waiting and hunting for the ball is worth another svu to a total of one and a half svu at ten percent interest compounded across twentyfive years it is exactly sixteen svu twentyfive centums and two farthings add ten svu punitive damages for a total let us say of twentysix svu pay me now i dont carry so much money the book of dreams howard hardoah instructed his companions flog him well for twentysix minutes then cut off his ears strubbins said wait a minute here is the money he paid over coins then turned and hunched back toward his table not just yet said howard hardoah you have only paid me for the lost ball sit quietly you said the companions rolled forward a wooden chairframe on which rested a block oi ice they conducted maddo strubbins to the chair cut away his trousers sat him on the ice and strapped him in place sit quietly cool your own arse said howard hardoah you lost my ball and i am tempted to order an excision along your own ropy scrotum except that this is a family entertainment one other matter a companion stepped forward and pressed a contri vance against maddo strubbinss forehead he cried out in pain when the contrivance was removed the letter f in heavy purple block print remained that is an indelible reminder of the odious nickname fimfle said howard hardoah it shall be a memento for anyone i recall using this term it was evolved by bloy sadalfloury let us deal next with this corpulent scalawag bloy sadalfloury was stripped naked and tattooed with fs over his entire body except across his buttocks where flvifle was spelled out in full you are bedizened in style said howard hardoah with crit ical approval wtiile you are bathing at lake skooney and your friends ask why you are spotted like a leopard you will respond it was the fault of my malicious tongue hey companions a clever elaboration stamp his tongue as well so then who and what is next on the program edver vissy forward please remember angela dam a pretty little girl from the lower grades i admired angela with all the fervor of my romantic heart one day as i stood talking to her you came along and pushed me aside you said run along fimfle just pick a directionangela and i will go the other way i have puzzled over this command long and often run along along what the road an imaginary line a long way howard hardoahs voice became nasal and pedantic in this special case we will simplify and imag ine a course around the pavilion you will run a long way along this course and we will learn where emphasis ties four blackguard the demon princfs dogs will chase you and gnaw your legs should you tarry hurrah then edver let us watch a fleet pair of heels as you run along a pity that little angela is not here to enjoy the evening the companions took edver vissy to the course and set him running with four squat hounds lurching and snarling behind him the zumbold player muttered to gersen have you ever seen the like the man is mad to play such spiteful tricks take care said gersen he hears whispers ten minutes old and half a mile away so far his acts are almost benign he is in a good mood i hope never to see him in a rage the program proceeded as one by one howard hardoah ad justed strains and imbalances in the cosmic equilibrium olympe omsted had arranged to meet howard at the blinnick pond picnic grounds howard had trudged ten miles and had waited four hours only to see olympe arrive in company with gard thornbloom you will now be conveyed to a far place howard told olympe you will wait eight hours until morning then walk twenty miles to the wiggal river that you may forever remember this occasion i have arranged a further penalty olympe was stripped nude to the waist one breast was stained bright red the other an equally intense blue and for good measure a purple f was stamped on her belly excellent declared howard hardoah in the future you will find it more difficult to beguile and deceive trusting young boys while howard gave his attention to leopold friss olympe was led from the pavilion and carried off through the night leopold had instructed young howard to kiss his arse six pigs were brought before leopold and he was obliged to kiss each appropri ately hippolita fawer who had slapped howards face on the front steps of the school was spanked by two companions while pro fessor kutte played a threnody in time with her outcries professor kutte now loose in the knees found difficulty in applying bow to strings howard hardoah seized the fiddle in dis gust i have drunk five times as much as you he told kutte you boast of musical competence yet you cannot play while drunk for shame i shall play the tune properly he signaled the companions who set about spanking hippolita who resumed her cries while howard played the fiddle he began to dance as he played lifting the rook of drkms one of his long legs thrusting it high and forward and giving a little kick then prancing forward knees bent meanwhile playing with rapt face and halfclosed eyes the zumbold player said dubiously to gersen truth to tell he plays in fine style a sure touch there notice how justly he accents the womans outcries i am tempted to shout bravo he would be pleased said gersen on the whole it is prob ably best not to call attention to yourself i am sure that you are right the tune came to an end and hippolita returned in dishevel ment to her table howard hardoah was in the mood for music he faced the orchestra all together now with zest rare tones and precise execution pettyville pleasures parnassian mode gersen nudged the zumbold player which flute with the brass flange howard hardoah stamped his foot the tune began after one rendition howard called a halt fair only fair more bite with the cornet you on woodpipe whv do vou not play the traditional solo gersen showed a moony grin fm not that sure of the part sir then you should practice your instrument i give my all sir once again lively now the tune was played with howard hardoah performing his absurd capering dance abruptly he stopped stamped his feet raised his hands on high brandishing fiddle and bow in outrage you on the woodpipe why do you not play as you should why this preposterous pip puppup pippuppup well sir truth be told it is how learned the instrument howard hardoah clutched his head deranged his hat in a frenzy of impatience you exasperate me to distraction with your pippuppup also your foolish leering face companions seize this mooncalf take him down to the river and throw him away mu sicians of his sort the world is better without the companions seized gersen draped him from the plat form howard addressed the audience you are witnessing an im portant event the population is divided into three classes first fastidious persons of discrimination and taste second the vulgar hf demon princes masses exemplihed by yourselves and third a few wretched par venus who mimic the style of their betters as m the case of this woodpipe player his sort must be discouraged now on with the music all who wish may dance two companions frogmarched gersen across the pavilion and down the slope toward the river a third strolled negligently behind nothing could have been more to gersens satisfaction down the steps to the boat dock they marched and out to the far end where the fairy lamps reflected in jerks and jiggles on the dark water the companions seized gersen by the arms and the seat of the pants gersen hung supine and limp its to be one two three and on your way so here we go here we go said gersen he swiveled broke holds struck the man on his left a fearful blow in the neck crushing his larynx he struck the other across the temple with his fist and felt the crush of bone turning at a crouch he flung himself against the knees of the third man who staggered swayed lurched backward clawing at his side arm gersen caught him in a clamp flung him face down planted his knees on the heavy shoulders reached down into the mans mouth jerked up and back and snapped the mans neck panting gersen rose to his feet in less than thirty seconds he had killed three men gersen took up one of the longguns a pistol a pair of daggers then rolled the bodies into the river he started back toward the pavilion the music had halted the companions coordinated by radiocommunicator by one means or another had been notified of trouble at the riverside gersen glimpsed a dozen companions running at a crouch from the pavilion howard alan treesong stood on the bandstand scowling in his direction gersen raised the longgun aimed fired a round ust as howard treesong umped from the bandstand he whirled in midair struck m the shoulder gersen fired again and struck howard treesong in the groin spinning him around again he fell to the floor of the pavilion and out of gersens range of vision gersen hesitated leaning back and forth almost irresistibly urged to rush forward and make sure of howard treesongs death danger was too close if how ard treesong were only w ounded as seemed likelv and gersen were captured it would be a grisly business he could wait no longer dodging into the shade of the larch trees he ran around the pavilion to the driveway where he i he book of drkms crouched among the parked ehicles three companions ran along the front of the pavilion gersen aimed hred once twice three times and three bodies tumbled to the ground gersen gingerly rose to his feet and craned his neck hoping for another shot at treesong danger hung heav death was imminent gersen retreated to the road crossed and took refuge m a copse of some dank local growth a giant shape blotting out the stars descended upon the pavilion searchlights suddenly illuminated the entire area ger sen decided to wait no longer infrared scanners would soon be combing the landscape he ran to the riverside lowered himself into the water and floated away to the north secure from infrared detection he swam across the river and emerged a quarter mile down stream he climbed the bank sodden as a muskrat and stood sur veying the scene to the south failure once more bitter galling failure for the second time he had been offered a shot at his quarry for the second time he had inflicted onl a wound tenders drifted down from the ship and a moment later re turnedthe floodlights were extinguished the ship now a black mass picked out by lines of illuminated ports rose to an altitude of a thousand feet and hovered within the ship treesongs brain would not be inactive the alarm had emanated from the dock where the companions had taken the inept musician who was this musician whom professor kutte had allowed to play in his orchestra obviously the question would be put to kutte who would briskly tell all he knew the musician was an offworlder vho wished to be present at the re union an offworlder he must be captured without fail inquiry quickly would be made at inns towns transport agencies space ports at theobald spaceport the flittering would be noticed boarded the registration in the name ofkirth gersen would duly be recorded and made known to howard i reesong gersen grim aced i ie climbed the bank and trotted north to glocher wa then west beside the cemetery the dead of gladbetook uncannil sen tient m the starlight watched him pass t the main street gersen hesitated a moment thinking of the runabout but professor kutte represented the greater urgency and he continued along glocher wa to kuttes house rhp dp mon princes light glowed from the front windows keeping to the deepest shadows gersen approached the house valdemar kutte in a ma roon dressing gown paced back and forth holding a towel to his forehead so far thought gersen so good the normalcy of the scene made him wonder as to the accuracy of his projections the spaceship might already have departed with the idiot musician re maining as an unsolved if trivial mystery nevertheless gersen decided to wait behind a hedge he found concealment and settled himself minutes passed five ten the street remained quiet gersen stirred fretfully he looked around the sky to find only stars and strange constellations he heaved a sigh adjusted his position his clothes still damp a faint sound from above gersen became instantly alert again imminence down from the sky drifted a small airboat soft as a shadow it dropped to a landing in the street ten yards from gersens hiding place three men stepped to the ground dark shapes m the star shine for a moment they stood in muttered conversation evidently making sure ofkuttes house gersen ran crouching behind the hedge circled kuttes hy drangea hushes and waited behind the gatepost inside the house valdemar kutte in a posture of outrage and indignation complained of the nights events to a small plump woman who listened aghast two men came along the avenue they turned into professor kuttes yard gersen hit one upon the forehead with an iron garden ornament grappled the other and stabbed him to the heart there had been no sound within the house professor kutte continued as before striding back and forth nourishing his hands pausing to emphasize some particularly heinous episode gersen crept back behind the hedge to his former post the third man stood leaning against the skycar gersen stepped quietly into the street behind him striking hard with the dagger he cut the mans spinal cord into the back ot the skycar gersen tumbled the three corpses he took the vehicle aloft floated across gladbetook now dark and shuttered tor the night and settled into the yard behind swechers inn he went quietly to his room changed gratefully into his or dinary clothes tucked the book of df earns into his pocket returning thi book ofdrew to the skvcar he rose into the niht and flew south toward i heo bald over the oalglish river he lowered the skycar ettisoned the three companions then continued south the scattered lights of theobald presenti appeared below red and blue twmklers marked the outlines of the spaceport unnoticed and unchallenged gersen landed the skycar beside his fantarnn flitteiiimg he went aboard and started up the flight systems he considered the skycar if howard treesong found it here near the spot vacated by a fantamic fhtteiivmg he would drawr the natural and obvious conclusion the depot official would supply him the flittetwmgs registration codes the trail would lead directly to kirth gersen care of jehan addels pontefract alovsms gersen overrode the safety latch set the controls and let the skycar fly off into the night he returned into the flittaning sealed the ports and left the land oflelander below t an altitude often miles he hovered and searched the sky neither macroscope nor radar nor xenode detector discovered any trace oftreesons ship which was ust as well since the flittefwmg lacked armament gersen flew into the far north and landed on an expanse ot desolate tundra safe from treesongs detectors should anyone think to deploy them silence and starlight on the waste outside the observation ports gersen consumed a bowl of goulash and sat slumped in his chair profoundly tired hut prevented from sleep by a flux of queer moods nervous excitement slowly waning disappointment for his failure to kill howard treesong contradicted by a grim satisfaction for the damage he had done which would cause treesong inconve nience anger fear uncertainty and pain not a bad evenings work the events themselves they could only be comprehended in terms of howard treesongs personality taking up the book of dreamy gersen began to study the contents he was too tired to persist he went to his couch and soon slept in the morning gersen went out to drink a cup of tea in the slanting sunlight the air carried a smoky reek of fust mud and aeons of slowdecaying vegetation low hills huddled across the southern horizon elsewhere a plain half tundra half bog extended as far as the eye could see graygreen lichen covered the ground punctuated by starved clumps of sedge and small black plantains with scarlet berries the reunion at gladbetook school seemed far distant in both space and time gersen went into the saloon and drew another cup of tea sit ting on the top step of the exit port in the wan light of van kaa thes star he once more set himself to an examination of the book of dreams the tea grew cold gersen read page after page and came at last to where young howard had stopped his writing almost in midsentence gersen put the book down and looked off across the distance once howard hardoah had treasured this book for howard alan treesong it would represent a memento of the sweet sad days of his youth and far more it denned his being it was precious beyond calculation suppose he were now to learn of its existence there were dozens of permutations to the situation howard be lieved that the book had been taken from him by his friend nimpy cleadhoe an allimportant question where now was nimpy cleadhoe gersen sat thinking of young howard hardoah frail tentative sensitive of howard alan treesong strong radiant with confi dence pulsing with vitality picking up the book of dreams gersen thought to feel from the faded red cover a quiver of similar life the book of drkms on first reading the book had seemed a rather formless pastiche there were personal assertions colloquies between seven paladins twelve cantos of narrative verse a late chapter revealed the lan guage naomei known only to the seven paladins and included a syllabary of characters by which naomei might properly be transcribed before young howard had fully developed naomei the book came to its abrupt ending the book apparently had occupied howard for a period of years the initial manifesto occupied a page and a half a statement in which a sympathetic ear might find much that was vivid and compelling whereas a cynical spirit would hear only callow bom bast so much thought gersen might be said for the entire book final judgment could only rest upon how closely achievement matched youthful fantasy in this light the term callow bombast must be discarded feeble understatement thought gersen was a more appropriate phrase the book began i am howard alan treesong i profess no fealty to the hardoah ilk t expect none that my birth occurred through the agency of adrian and reba hardoah is an in cident over which i lacked control i prefer to claim my substance elsewhere from brown soil like that which i now clutch in my hand from

an earnest directness depicted was a naked boy standing in front of a naked young man the boy stalwart and determined with a bright intelligent gaze the young man somewhat insubstantial but effulgent with a nameless quality compounded of daring ardor magical wonder this thought gersen was young howards concept of himself and his vistgetst immir the next page listed a set of aphorisms some legible

must be aware glaide the demon princes she is made from starlight and flower dust she breathes the memory of midnight music i wonder i wonder i wonder today i showed her the sign casually as if it were of no importance she saw it she looked at me but she spoke no word the next few passages bore traces of erasure with passages overwritten in a stronger hand what is power it is the means to realize wants and wishes to me power has become a necessity in itself it is a virtue and balm sweet as a girls kiss and similarly it is there to be taken i am alone enemies and hurlibuts surround me

to think beyond the text passed over a page to resume in ink of heavy purple black the hand seemed more firm the characters more regularly formed the next passage was headed m wi rics the accumulation of power is a selfsustaining process the first accretion is slow but increases according to di rection first the requisite steps these are an equable and careless fare where nothing is revealed during this phase all strictures are methodically discarded discipline in itself is not a corrupt concept only discipline that is imposed direcuon evidently signifies personal control personal manipulation i he book of drlm rather than selfcalculated emancipation then is first from teaching from duty hom setter emotions which loosen the power of decision an evident lapse of time perhaps several months the ensuing hand was tall spiky angular and exuded an almost palpable en ergy a new girl has come to town her name is zada memar zada memar to think of her brings a blur of enthrallment across the brain she moves in a cosmos other own colored by her own colors and urged by her own fascinating ardors how can i om my cosmos to hers how can i share our secrets how can we merge ourselves into a unity of body and soul and ardo i wonder if she knows me as i know her there followed several pages of extravagant speculations upon destiny and circumstances subsequent to a chance meeting between himself and zada memar the next passage consisted of passionate apostrophes addressed to the inner consciousness of zada memar there was no explicit clue as to the progress or outcome of the love affair except in the termination of the passage a wild burst ot emotion directed against the environment in which howard hardoah found himself enemies surround me they stare at me with mad eyes walking or loping past or veering as if blown on the wind they flaunt their insolent challenges i see them through several minds as is useful the time is now call on imnur immir to the tore blank page and a division in the book ofdfiwi for want of better terms the foregoing could be designated part one part the demon princes two was indited in a firm round hand the rasping fervor or pre vious passages seemed under strong control the apparent continuity between the final line of part one and the first line of part two would seem to be misleading upon that place made sacred to myself i bled my blood i made the sign i spoke the word i called on immir and he came i said immir the time is now stand together with me assuredly we are one now we must set about our affairs let us form our com pany so that each is

broken only by sorry death all averred and so was formed the noble troop destined to perform deeds and feats to surpass all those of yore or hence on the next pages the young howard had attempted portraits of the seven with much evidence of painful reworking the sketches terminated part two of the hook there followed several pages of notes and memoranda a few written in the naornei syllabar howard apparently tired of the exertion and continued in ordinary language a list of descriptive titles appeared the book of drems the adventure at tuarech the duel with the sarsen ebratan champions the coming of zada the insolent pride of king weper zada forlorn the castle haround the wooing of zada memar the seven weirds of haltenhorst the adventure at the green star inn the great games at woon windway the dungeons ofmourne paladins triumphant whatever text howard hardoah had planned for the twelve titles was not included in the book except for excerpts and frag ments which occupied the pages following then abruptly two thirds of the way through the book almost in midsentence there was no more writing gersen put the book down he descended to the tundra and paced back and forth beside the flittefwmg all could yet go well there had been failure at voymont and likewise at gladbetook but the book of dreams might permit a third opportunity if he used it correctly to any obvious bait howard treesong twice wounded would react wath hypersensitive suspicion the problem then was to deploy the bait where it would be perceived as something otherwise gersen halted and stood looking gloomily south before plans could be formed he must return once more to gladbetook the proscriptions m regard to maumsh airspace no longer troubled gersen clearly no one made the slightest attempt at enforcement about the hour of noon he dropped the flittefwing down from behind a low cloud and into the woodland at the back of hardoahs home farm mindful of previous frustrations he armed himself with care then sealed his ship and walked to the edge of the open land to his right spread a large pond to his left that strip of land formerly worked by the cleadhoes as gersen approached home farm ledesmus hardoah left the barn with a bucket of feed which he tossed into the fowl run and then returned into the barn gersen went to the door of the farmhouse and knocked the demon princes the door slid back to reveal the gaunt figure of reba hardoah she looked gersen up and down with a blank expression gersen greeted her politely today im here on business im afraid i need just a bit more information naturally im quite will ing to pay for taking your time reba hardoah spoke in a nervous rush of words mr hardoah isnt here at the moment he has gone into the village ledesmus emerging from the barn saw gersen he put down his bucket and ambled across the yard so youre back eh did you hear the news about howard news what news ledesmus guffawed and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand maybe i shouldnt laugh but that crazy howard come to the school meeting with a gang of thugs and made everyone jump through a hoop settled all his old scores did howard terrible terrible keened reba hardoah he insulted the van bouyers and struck bloy sadalfloury and acted a great cruel villain weve been properly shamed by a graceless son now there lady said ledesmus its nothing to pine over truth to tell it gives me to laugh when i think of it that howard now whod have thought hed turn out such a scarper its a disgrace cried reba your father even now is trying to make amends hes much too upright said ledesmus howard is nothing to do with us thats my point of view said gersen still its a pity that he brought you such bad notoriety when i go to teaching house ill never know where to look said reba hardoah just stare them down ledesmus told her specify that if they dont behave youll complain to howard that should shut a mouth or two what an insane idea but give this gentleman his information hes willing to pay for it indeed wtiat is it this time nothing of consequence you mentioned one of howards friends nimpy cleadhoe certainly so then wtiat happened to nimpy wtiere is he now ledesmus frowned and looked across the field to a dismal little the book of drems house under a pair of straggling ginsaps those cleadhoes were always queer folk offworlder stock old cleadhoe was queerest of all in fact he was marmelixer for fluter township i dont remem ber all so clearly but they didnt take kindly to howard fighting on nimpy and accusing him of stealing his book and the lady mrs cleadhoe come over to complain to father who had words with howard and howard went away to make his career and succeeded as we have seen ledesmus dont say so its shame on us for his awful deeds ledesmus only laughed i wish id been to see it all think of maddo strubbins with his hind parts on ice thats rich now gersen asked and what of nimpy the cleadhoes left and thats all we saw of them where did they go they told me naught he looked to his mother what of you they went back whence they came reba hardoah jerked her thumb toward the sky offworld whenthe old cleadhoes died they called for their offworld kin to inherit the land so the new cleadhoes arrived that was before you were born we had little to do with them and we cant be blamed considering the mans calling town eviscerator and marmelizer ledesmus spoke with dis gust reba hardoah hunched her bony shoulders and shuddered it comes to us all teaching or no still whod be marmelizer but someone lowcaste or offworld into the house came adrian hardoah he stopped short at the sight of gersen and stared suspiciously from face to face whats all this something to do with howard again not this time sir said gersen we were discussing your old neighbors the cleadhoes hardoah grunted and flung his hat upon the settee bad stock those folk never did well never bred true a boon that theyre gone i wonder where they went wtw knows offplanet at least reba spoke dont you remember old otho said he was go ing back where he came from yes something of the sort the demon princes where could that be asked gersen hardoah gave him an unfriendly glance the hardoahs are the lineage or didram fluter i am instructor at the college my mother was a bistwider my fathers mother was a dwint of the nineteenth generation otho cleadhoe was public eviscerator who turned a flat ear to teaching am i then to be his crony definitely not adrian hardoah gave a gloomy nod go look at the marmels the first cleadhoe stands proudfast his plaque tells of his birth correct and exact cried ledesmus trust father for wis dom hes never failed yet ledesmus and gersen drove into town in the hardoahs old power wagon along the way ledesmus discussed howards exploits at the school reunion his chortles of amusement indicated neither shame nor remorse for howards outrageous deeds ledesmus halted the wagon beside the church and led the way into the cemetery threading the dead convocations with the ease of long acquaintance the hardoahs and our other ilk are yonder over here stands the dross outworlders and persons of poor rep utation the time was late afternoon in the low light the two moved among the shadowed figures plaques bespoke their names to those who after the passage of years might have forgotten them kassideh hornblath dadendorf lup cleadhoe gersen pointed heres one of them thats one of the old ladies heres luke cleadhoe hell be the first and theres your answer born on bethune preserve out in the crow a far world lost to the goodness of teaching in his youth a notable outrider by diligence he earned to the post of disease monitor to the wild beasts then to first apprentice taxi dermist arriving at gladbetook he diligently worked the farmlands and nurtured a family of several souls all sadly impervious to the truths of teaching so there you have it said ledesmus in tri umph as they walked back through the cemetery toward the church gersen chanced to notice the marmel of a voung girl she stood straight head turned a trifle to the side as if she were listening for a far sound a voice or a bird call she wore a simple gown her head and feet were bare her plaque read zada memar unfortunate the book of dreams child taken from her loving family almost before her first bloom woe and alas for this poor maiden gersen called ledesmuss attention to the marmel do you remember her yes indeed at the school outing she wandered off into the woods and they found her in persimmon lake a pretty thing she was the sun had set low behind the line of deodars the marmels stood in gloom ledesmus said suddenly time to move along heres no place to loiter after dark from the avatars apprentice in scroll from the ninth dimension surrounding the pedestal a low mound agglomerated from the shards of false effigies across a hundred centuries the latest of these in the likeness ofbermssus lay toppled with one mighty leg thrust high marmaduke standing to the side in a robe of brown frowst was moved to a tear of sad recollection now the effigy of holy mungol was brought forward and raised on high to be exalted by the throng the warkeep of gortland climbed to the plinth he raised his arms and called out in a brazen voice victory at last and forever mungol stands on high the holy and the true guard our land for all eternity so it will be let there be oy the host responded with jubilation uttering deep throated shouts and dancing m circles the wind lords struck their shields with mailed fists the bracha skirled their noblest tunes arrayed in glistening mists the pru desses rang bells and made signs the little wefkms re joiced again spoke the warkeep all is complete the par apets are guarded by our mighty vencedors bernissus is less than nothing the remembered smell of a latrine in a diseased lepers nightmare but of the past no more holy mungol stands on high and casts his sublime gaze across eternity let each take up fhe book of drkms his loot and march in glory to his home blue men to the east green men to the west i with my cantarurces fare north the host gave a final glad cry and dispersed each marching his preferred way a single group of seven persons set off to the south across maudly waste toward sesset they were chathres a flatfaced lumpkin with burly shoul ders and a lewd tongue three lygons ordinary shalmar bahuq and amaretto implissimus knight of the blue ker lanth rorback the glutton and marmaduke it was an ill assorted troop and a surly one for none had taken loot faring across the waste they encountered a train of three wagons laden with the plunder of molander abbey the commander was herman the oneeyed vagabond he and his henchmen were given short shrift and the band set about dividing the spoils in the front wagon marmaduke discovered the delight ful sufnt who had caused him such heartache at the grand masque to marmadukes dismay chathres insisted that sufnt be considered a segment of his plunder and his ar guments won the day with sly forethought chathres told marmaduke since you have expressed dissatisfaction with the arrange ments divide the spoils as you will into seven lots and each shall choose that lot which suits him best what is the order of choosing the order is determined by lot marmaduke set about dividing the booty sufnt whis pered into his ear you have been tricked the lots will determine who chooses first but you must choose last as you are arranging the division presumably into parts of equal value marmaduke uttered a cry of consternation sufnt said listen then place me in one lot alone divide all treasure into five lots into the last lot place hermans three iron keys his shoes his drum and other valueless oddments these naturally will fall to you make sure you keep the keys but abandon all else marmaduke did as he was bid by trickery the salacious chathres won first choice and with a grand flourish took i hp df n princes sufnt for his own the others chose lots of gold and gems and marmaduke was left the oddments suddenly it was discovered that the draft beasts had es caped and worse that all the water bags had been slashed with a knife and hung empty furious talk was heard and accusations were exchanged how can we reach sesset wich lies five days hence across the burning waste cried chathres no matter said sufnt i know of a fountain not far to the south we will reach it by sunset grumbling and already thirsty the band took up the loot and staggered to the south at dusk they came to a fertile garden surrounded by a high iron wll which none could scale by reason of poison spikes a single postern afforded entrance which one of marmadukes keys con trolled what luck cried chathres marmadukes foresight has helped us all not so fast said marmaduke i demand a fee for the use of my key from each of you i will take your best jewel i have no jewels cried chathres must i then re main outside to become prey to wild animals what can you offer i have only my sword my garments and my slave girl whom you may not have and no warrior of honor would part with his sword then give me your garments every last stitch and strap so it was done and chathres entered the garden naked as an egg to the amusement of all laugh now chathres told them tonight i shall take pleasure with mv slave girl then who will be laugh mg for supper the band ate fruit from the trees and drank copiously of clear cold water then chathres took sufnt among the trees and set about his lascivious endeavors but the iron walls surrounded a sacred grove and whenever chathres attempted a lewd act a great white bat fle v down to buffet him with its wings until chathres at last desisted the book of drea ms and sufnt was allowed to sleep undisturbed chathres how ever found no comfort m the chill air of the desert night the next day still lacking water bags the group con tinued to the south chathres annoyed by the rays of the sun as well as sharp pebbles and thornbushes at sunset sufnt guided the troop to an abandoned mon astery to which only marmadukes key gave access on this occasion chathres was obliged to yield his sword before marmaduke allowed him through the portal during the night chathres again tried to use sufnt for his pleasure but a ghost came from the ancient stones and sat on his back and chathres was distracted from his intent in the morning the troop set off to the south chathres suffering greatly from sore feet insect stings and heat blis ters still he never released the rope which he had tied around sufnts waist an hour before sunset the band entered a ravine which almost at once narrowed to a defile a flight of stairs led high to a locked door which marmadukes third key opened at a nvist each of the troop passing through the portal gave up a choice gem except chathres who gave over to marmaduke the rope attached to sufnt she is yours along with all my other goods let me pass marmaduke instantly removed the rope sufnt you are free i supplicate your love but not your submission you shall have both she told him and they clasped hands the troop continued along a narrow path from a grotto sprang a rock devil how dare you use my private n way be calm said sufnt we will pay toll for herself and marmaduke she paid over the sword and garments once owned by chathres each of the others gave up a jewel except chathres who cried out i cite my naked body in evidence i have nothing cannot pay in that case said the devil you must step into the grotto the others hurried along the way the better to escape the sound of chathress appalling outcries at last the way came out upon a pleasant land roads the demon princes led off in several directions the comrades took leave of each other and went their separate ways marmaduke and sufrit stood hand in hand considering the various directions one of the roads dropped into a green vale rose again and slanted across the downs toward a steeple marking a dear and familiar village marmaduke stared in wonder that is the road i would travel he told sufrit will you come with me sufrit looked along another road which led to a place she knew well but none there did she love yes marma duke i will come with you hurry then and well be home before sunset and so it was they ran joyously along the road to home while the light faded behind them at tea only pin nacy asked awkward questions but they said theyd been to a fancy dress party and that was all there was to it later events of this particular time tended to blur in gersens memory a consequence of fatigue and the necessity of constantly contriving new plans on the ruins of old howard alan treesong had become a willothewisp dancing elusively ahead ever out of reach once again in space gersen repressed the urge to make for pontefract there to ponder new schemes and perfect his acquain tance with alice wroke instead he brought out the celestial handbook bethune pre serve was the single planet ofcorvus a yellow dwarf in a group of a dozen such stars the system as a whole controlled fourteen planets uncounted planetoids moons and fragments of debris of which bethune preserve alone supported life bethune had been discovered by locater trudi selland her description of its phenomenal flora and fauna caused a public sen sation and prompted the naturalist society to instant negotiations which ultimately led to purchase outright centuries passed during which bethune preserve became in effect a planetsized vivarium from the handbook gersen read at the present time bethune preserve is a curious mixture ten parts nature preserve five parts tourist attraction three parts headquarters for the naturalist society its affiliates the book of drkas and a dozen other organizations such as friends of nature leave be scutinary vitalisis life in god church sierra club biological falange women for natural procreation a few residential tracts had been allocated for the use of these groups as well as scientists students and research fellows in practice almost anyone who finds the conditions of bethune preserve congenial is allowed temporary resi dence which may be extended indefinitely today bethune preserve comprises over six hundred game and nature reserves jealously guarded in their original state ranging from an entire continent to that acre sup porting the single and unique lillaw tree whose provenance is a total mystery the executive trustees today are as zealous as their predecessors sometimes heard are the words arbitrary pedantic vindictive capricious obstinate they rule the world as if it were a private natural history museum which in fact it is in compliance with the local requirements gersen drifted close to one of the ten orbiting quarantine stations he was boarded by four officials in uniforms of blue and green the flitufwing was searched gersen was questioned in regard to contraband life forms and instructed in local regulations a pilot remained aboard to guide the flittering down upon a plat at the special visitors compound near the city tanaquil here gersen was required to post a bond and forbidden to introduce sequester molest capture modify an noy or export living entities of any sort he was then allowed to proceed about his business from the spacefield gersen rode an omnibus into tanaquit through a grove of enormous blacktrunked trees burdened with vermilion flowers and alive with small twittering creatures who jumped swung and glided across high sunlit spaces the omnibus was evidently their ancient foe a troop followed overhead twitter ing and pelting the vehicle with fruit pods the bus continued into tanaquil a town unexpectedly quaint like a town built of childrens blocks in bright primary colors the original scheme had been conceived by the chairwoman of an an cient architectural board who derived inspiration from the illustra the demon princes rions in a childrens book she had laid down the architectural parameters to which concordance must be achieved gersen took lodging at the hotel triceratops a tourist inn notable for a stuffed saurian twenty feet long with six splayed legs and two horns popularly known as triceratops shanar gersen made inquiry of the desk clerk i want to locate an old acquaintance but i dont know where he lives no difficulty whatever apply to the registry there arent all that many of us all told fewer than five million but you wont find anyone there now theyll all be at lunch in the dining room which was decorated to resemble a pri mordial forest gersen was served a stolid meal based upon stan dard cosmopolitan cuisine though the individual dishes all carried picturesque local names he drank beer from a bottle labeled sav age mauler ale which exhibited the picture of a hideous brute glaring at a distant tourist charabanc at the registry gersen was efficiently provided the addresses of two cleadhoes both resident upon the continent rheas in a place known as blue forest gamp within the grand triste prim itive reserve gersen had noticed the halcyon vista tourist service in a building adjacent to the hotel but when he applied at the office it had already closed for the day it seemed that the business com munity of tanaquil operated in a fashion convenient to themselves rather than their customers gersen returned to the hotel and spent the rest of the afternoon on the shaded veranda watching tourists locals and great floating insects wispy creatures of froth film and trailing tendrils depend concordance a concept basic co the nincnoning of bethune society the trustees govern bethune preserve in concordance with the old regulations trustees are selected from notable organizations in which membership is hereditary these onctime naturalist groups now serve principally to denominate ihe aristocracy caste distinctions while mild and nonresirictive are real tourists are outcastes and lack cnirv into local society by a curiousind amusing inversion of values those persons performing physical nmctinns in regard tu the animals and orher nature ohects psirk rangers veterinarians biologists hcrders plant pathologists and the like rank low in status bethune taxonomy while precise lacks verve popular terms carry more impact shanar is one of the bethune continents the book of dreams ing from a gas bladder he drank a succession of gin pahits and wondered how best to approach the business at hand if he apprised the cleadhoes of his plan they might help they might hinder or they could inflict total disaster upon him he sorted through a hundred possibilities then as the sun settled into the forest he threw his hands into the air he could make no def inite plans until he knew more about the cleadhoes in the morning gersen returned to the halcyon vista tourist ser vice where the clerk smilingly informed him that only qualified scientists on specially approved expeditions were allowed the hire of air vehicles no end of troubles otherwise sir explained the clerk think it out for yourself wed have little family picnics in the middle of the gunderson wallows with baby eaten by a three armed swamp ape and daughter raped by the game warden then how can i get where i want to go tourists are recommended to book aboard one of the wild life inspection safaris in a totally safe and airconditioned vehicle that is the easiest and best way to visit the preserves but where do you want to go you must understand that many areas are off limits i want to go to blue forest camp in the grand triste prim itive reserve the agent shook his head that is not an area developed for tourist travel sir suppose you yourself wished to visit blue forest camp how would you go about it im not a tourist still how would you do it id naturally take the commercial flight to maundy river sta tion and the day flight into the forest but gersen put a fiftysvu certificate on the counter im not a tourist im a commercial traveler i sell insect repellent get me the tickets im in a hurry incidentally the agent smiled and shrugged and put the certificate into a drawer it does no good to hurry here in fact it may even be against the law the demon princes blue forest was a heavily wooded savanna rather than an unbroken growth of trees and occupied the basin of the great bulduke river an area of half a million square miles the forest foliage was only predominantly blue in three hues ultramarine bright sky blue and pallid chalk blue additionally certain trees showed foliage of beetlewing green and a few were gray enormous softwinged moths moving through the sunlight created a teasing flicker of crimson and black beasts were numerous the herbivores were protected by bulk armor speed agility stench nailing arms bris tling horns or poison glands carnivores displayed equipment to overcome the defenses various sorts of scavengers skulked through the shadows the junction of the lesser bulduke and the haunted river occurred in a network of sloughs and swamps inhabited by an ex travagant variety of creatures large small fearsome mild with and without yellow wattles with and without gaping purple maws north of the swamp rose a low tableland the site of blue forest camp gersen walked from the airport to town along an unpaved road guarded by a pair of tenfoot fences which held back vegetation and beasts but permitted the free passage of insects heat and hu midity oppressed the air which smelled of twenty unfamiliar odors vegetation soil animal essences the fence struck off to either side at right angles to enclose the town gersen went to the corporation circuit hotel and en tered a lobby dim and cool without comment he was assigned a room by a morose young woman who took his money and jerked her thumb toward the hall room four keys were considered unnecessary gersens room was clean cool sparsely furnished and well screened from the outdoors an old town directory lay on the table gersen turned the pages he saw cleadhoe otho cleadhoe tuty residence employment residence employment perimeter poststation workshop perimeter commissary gersen went out into the little central square the town was quiet few folk were abroad across the street a gaunt structure showed a sign commissary the book of dreams gersen looked through the door he saw an elderly man and a portly blackhaired woman with thick black eyebrows a heavy nose and an uncompromising manner the affairs of a customer occu pied her attention gersen turned away the commissary was not an appropriate place to meet tuty cleadhoe in the center of the square a refreshment stand sold cold drinks and ices gersen obtained a pint of cold fruit punch and seated himself on a bench for an hour he waited while the folk of blue forest camp went about their affairs children trooped past on their way home from school persons entered the commissary and departed the sun dropped into the west from the commissary came tuty cleadhoe she walked briskly away to the south part of town gersen followed along a lane shaded under great spreading trees tuty cleadhoe entered a house close by the peripheral fence gersen waited ten minutes then rang the doorbell the door slid back and tuty cleadhoe looked out sir id like to talk to you for a few minutes indeed tutys dark eyes snapped as she looked gersen up and down to what purpose you formerly were resident at gladbetook in maunish after a short pause yes a long time ago i have just come from there that is of no interest to me i have only bitter memories of gladbetook you must excuse me the neighbors will wonder at my talking to a strange man she started to close the door wait cried gersen you lived near the hardoah family tuty cleadhoe looked through the narrow gap that is true gersen found himself proceeding faster than he had intended do you remember howard hardoah tuty cleadhoe stared at gersen a long ten seconds she re sponded in a thick voice t do indeed may i come in i am here in connection with howard har doah tuty cleadhoe grudgingly stepped aside and made a gesture come in then the interior of the house was dim stuffy and for so warm a climate overfurnished tuty pointed to a chair upholstered in rose the demon princes pinkvelour sit if you will now then what is this of howard hardoah recently i had occasion to visit the hardoah farmstead and the conversation turned to the subject of howard tutv cleadhoe looked incredulous howard lives at home no he left long ago tuty thrust her head forward do you know why trouble of some sort thats mv guess if i could have put my hands on him she extended her hands with fingers clenching i would have torn him into bits gersen leaned back in his chair tuty spoke on iu a voice hiss ing with passion he came to our house he called to our son softly so that we should not hear but we heard he called out our one chick our boy nymphotis who was so meek and good they went to the pond and there howard drowned our little son held him under the water i had a terrible feeling i called nymphotis where are you i went to the pond and there i found my lovely child i pulled out the little bedraggled corpse and carried him home otho went to find howard but he had already gone gersen asked howard never knew that you suspected him there was no suspicion it was certainty but howard never knew tuty made a fierce controlled gesture how could he know he was gone it was our tragedy gersen said i did not know nymphotis was dead im sorry to revive bitter memories you revive nothing we live with them daily look tutys voice cracked with emotion look gersen turned his head in a shadowed corner of the room stood a boy formed of a glossy white substance that is our nvmphotis gersen turned away i will tell you something of howard har doah and what he has become and how justice may be done upon him wait otho must hear you if you think i am bitter he sur passes me fourfold she went to a telephone made a connection and poured a tumble of words into the mesh prom time to time a mans voice uttered a question tuty gestured to gersen now speak we both will hear you the book of dreams howard hardoah is now a great criminal he calls himself howard alan treesong neither tuty nor otho cleadhoe made comment go on i have tracked him across the oikumene he is wary he must be lured and baited with great care i have failed twice but now i have the bait to lure him again here your help would be useful gersen paused otho said go on i dont want to continue unless you feel able to help me there will be danger you need not worry for us said otho tell us what you have in mind you will help tell us what you have in mind i want to bring him here take him out into the jungle and kill him tuty said in an angry voice there is nothing for us to do you will confront him you will kill him it is for nymphotis that he must pay no matter said otho in a heavy voice we will help from the book

the discomfort of his audience as the evening progressed mr hardoahs spirits soared to ever higher levels of fun and audacity he played merry tunes on the fiddle he danced several gavottes a hornpipe and a twitcherv mr hardoahs revelries knew no limits and totally captivated the group he ordained ingenious pranks and charades to celebrate old episodes these were dutifully performed by his nownervous classmates to whom his ul timate intentions were never quite clear he sat mr maddo strubbins on a block of ice he tattooed air bloy sadal floury and he arranged to escort mrs suby ver ahe with her two charming daughters mirl and maud on a long cruise through the outer worlds the festivities were interrupted by a gang of marauders who shot mr hardoah in the buttocks and caused such consternation that the party came to an end mr hardoah departed in pain the wound will surely curtail his dancing for some time to come mr i lardoah expressed outrage that in a presumably wellordered community such crass acts of violence could take place he hopes to return to the next reunion providing that it could be terminated less abruptly inasmuch as he had staged only a few of his ingenious fri volities in the next issue of cosrfiopohs howard alan treesong his memorabilia and boyhood editors note a recent article relating to the notorious howard alan treesong evoked much comment the fol lowing communication so we hope may also be of interest to our readers the book of dreams to the editors of cosmopolis i read your recent article about the school reunion at glad betook with great interest inasmuch as my son nymphotis was a school chum of young howard hardoah it is strange how life works out the two boys were inseparable and nimpy as we called him often spoke of howards talents and skills and his dearest possession was a little book of fancies the book of dreams which howard gave to him our little lad died in a swimming accident shortly before we left maunish and we still have the book of dreams to remind us of the old days on the prairie we find it hard to imagine howard hardoah so shy and careful becoming the person you describe but in our lifetime we have known many surprising events more so i believe than most peo ple since we have traveled from place to place and even now hardly know where we will die we think often of our poor little nimpy if he had lived perhaps now he might also be a person of consequence please do not include my name and address cope with correspondence at this time t as i cannot respectfully tutyc into the cosmopolis office came a spare and saturnine man of indeterminate age wearing a neat black suit cut in the local style pinched at the shoulders and flaring at the hips he moved with the quiet deftness of a cat his eyes were black his face was hollow cheeked and narrow dense black hair grew to a widows peak then coved back over his temples and down past his ears he went to the reception desk looking alertly to both sides as he did so as if from long habit the clerk asked sir how may we oblige you id like a few words with the gentleman who wrote about mr howard treesong a few weeks ago oh that would he henry lucas i believe hes in his office may i ask your name sir schahar the demon princes and the nature of your business mr schahar well miss its somewhat complicated id prefer to explain it once only to mr lucas just as you like sir ill ask if mr lucas can see you now the girl spoke into a mesh and received a response she looked back to schahar will you have a seat sir hell see you in five minutes schahar sat quietly his black eyes nicking here and there around the room a musical tone sounded the receptionist said mr schahar if you please she conducted schahar along a hall and ushered him into a room with pale green walls and a lavender rug behind a kidney shaped table lounged a stylishly pallid man with a languid face framed by glossy dark ringlets his clothes were a confection of superb elegance his manner like his expression was languid and just short of supercilious he spoke in a toneless voice sir i am henry lucas please seat yourself i dont think i know you mr schahar i believe that is correct sir schahar spoke easily in a neutral voice you are a busy man and i will not take too much of your time i am a writer like yourself though certainly neither as competent nor as successful gersen noting schahars strong shoulders long sinewy arms heavy hands with long strong fingers controlled a smile of grim amusement schahar exuded a psychic aura of lethal expertise of stabbings and strangulation of terror and pain schahar had been present at the school reunion standing at the entrance with the short thick man gersen recalled an event of months before when lamar medrano of wild isle had met emmaus schahar at starport new concept she had departed the diomedes hotel with him and had never been seen again tush said gersen am not a writer i am a journalist what is your particular field general affairs facts and personalities i have recently become interested in howard alan treeson and his amazing career un fortunately facts are hard to come by i have found it so said gersen the article on the school reunion you wrote that i believe our local correspondent submitted ten pages of very excited the book of dkems prose which i cobbled together as best i could for information about treesong maunish would seem the place to go i may well take your advice what of this woman and her book of dreamsy gersen gave an uninterested shrug i havent looked into it the letter is around here somewhere i seem to have been desig nated the treesong expert gersen opened a drawer withdrew a sheet of paper glanced at it schahar leaned forward an old exercise book or something similar said gersen probably nothing remarkable schahar held out his hand may i see gersen looked up as if in surprise and seemed to hesitate he frowned down at the letter sorry i think id better not the woman doesnt want to be identified i cant say that i blame her with so many cranks and crackpots running loose gersen replaced the letter in the drawer schahar drew back smiling a faint smile id like to collect any and all information available on this particular subject my main interest is howard treesongs early life his formative period so to speak i am anxious especially to examine such trifles as the book of dreams schahar paused but gersen responded only with a non committal nod schahar went on speaking with a persuasive urgency suppose i undertook to approach this woman in the capacity of a writer submitting to cosniopolis would you then allow me her address your efforts would far exceed your profit thats my opinion why not visit gladbetook on moudervelt and make inquiries of his old acquaintances that would seem more fertile scope for re search again that is excellent advice sir schahar rose to his feet paused a moment and seemed to sway slightly forward languidly gersen also arose i have an appointment else where otherwise id be happy to discuss the matter with you at greater length i wish you success thank you mr lucas schahar left the room gersen waited an instrument to the side of his desk sounded a tone gersen smiled he arranged a telltale to the drawer of his table then turned a key in the antique lock clapping a tripletier aloysian hat on his head he departed the room strolled down the the demon princes corridor past a pair of unoccupied offices behind one of the doors stood schahar so the signaltone had informed gersen gersen walked at a leisurely rate around the block then re turned he went directly to his office standing to the side he slid open the door no explosion no hiss of projectile gersen entered the room the telltale at the drawer had been disarranged the lock showed no evidence of tampering schahar was a skillful operator gersen opened the drawer the letter re mained as he had left it schahar had been satisfied with the name and address gersen went to the telephone and called alice its happened who came a man called schahar im going directly to the spaceport alices voice was neutral take care of yourself of course gersen threw the hat toward a chair changed from his tight shouldered suit into spacemans ordinary and left the cosmopolis office perhaps for the last time a cab took him to the spaceport and out the access avenue to the fantamic flitferwing it had been cleaned washed polished overhauled inspected and provisioned the ports had been scraped clean of space dust the linen had been renewed the tanks were full of water the bins loaded with food the support systems had been recharged the energy cells were replete the fantamic flitteywing was ready for space gersen climbed aboard closed the port stepped into the sa loon his nose detected the faintest of perfumes he looked to right and left nothing extraordinary he took three strides to the stateroom empty he threw open the door to the head out with you wearing mouse gray shorts and a black tunic alice marched forth so there you are said gersen so it would appear said alice i half expected this gersen pointed to the port off the ship with you absolutely not ive decided never to let you out of my sight again you might not come back she stepped close to him and looked up into his face dont you want me aboard the book of driams oh im sure id find you useful still its dangerous i know well i cant waste time arguing now that youre here alice gave a triumphant laugh i knew youd see it my way bethune preserve hung in space full in the light of corvus gersen eased the flitterwmg close up beside one of the orbiting stations no pilot was immediately available he was ordered to stand by alice grumbled about the formalities i dont intend to molest their animals i told them so but i dont think they believe me howard will be even more vexed he cant simply show up in his battle cruiser and throw his weight around perhaps hell arrive as a tourist perhaps he wont dare to come at all i cant see him sending schahar down for his precious book of dreams in any event youll have to stay in tanaquil out of the way if he catches one glimpse of you were in trouble alice put on a submissive face whatever you say still you yourself said i dont look like alice when im dressed as a boy with my hair covered wed better cut off your hair and dye the stubble black thats not necessary id be a funnylooking sight youd laugh at me id be angry and there would go our romance gersen put his arms around her thats a chance we cant take of course not wtiat are you doing stop youve chased me around the ship twice today already rheres nothing else to do you bring it on yourself really arent you afraid ill wear out no oh well the pilot presently arrived and took the vessel down to ta naquil despite gersens request to put down at the blue forest camp airport the book of dkzlus sorry said the pilot thats not regulation it occurred to gersen that even third word the pilot spoke was regulation he pilot went on we cant make it convenient you know everyone would be tracking about picking flowers tcis mg the monkeys ounsts must go about their visits with decorum and respect personally id keep the blighters out altogether then thered be no one to inflict your regulitions on and youd be out of a oh the pilot turned gersen a blueeyed stare he decided gersen had intended a oke and laughed id make out one way or another im not fust a flight attendant you know in fact im a fourthlevel type and reckoned an expert on the pathology of the segmented melantidworm alice asked in that case why are ou here piloting and not out taking care of sick worms there arent that many worms they hide deep in the mud where they are hard to catch then like as not they are quite well i may quality for a second specialty in the meantime i do oui regulation stint with the company here we arc at the terminal leave all weapons and contraband aboard your vessel now it youll alight ill seal the doors gersen and alice each carrying a small travel bag alighted underwent further examination and search and were finally issued clearances at a wicket marked oiiki l d limiid ommi r l l i rnsi i geisen attempted to book passage to blue i orcst gamp aboard the station service flier the clerk refused to listen to him and pushed back his money youll ha e to apply to the designated authorities were very keen here on orderly methods out of curiosity when is the next departure for blue forest camp two departures today sir middle afternoon and shortly after by the left and righthand routes by opensided omnibus gersen md mice rode into town under tall jacarandas and drupes pursued by hysterical tree creatures vt the i lalcyon vista tourist service gersen found i new clerk in attendance a selfimportant young worn in vuth nairow eves and supercilious nostrils she instantly declared gersens request im possible and tried to sell him tickets on ounst schedule route c gersen used persistence and reasoned argument after ten minutes iiif dfmon pri cfs of grim research into travel regulations the woman could find no stipulations expressly supporting her position and grudgingly issued a pair of passage vouchers the spaceport omnibus had gone out of service for the day gersen located the towns only taxi and the two returned to the spaceport arriving only ten minutes prior to the early flight two hours later the flier dropped down upon the ungle com pound north of blue forest camp the door opened into the cabin came a waft reeking of the swamp gersen and alice alighted the flier departed into the south and they stood alone in the ungle clearing the middle of nowhere said gersen his way to the vil lage from the corporation circuit hotel gersen telephoned tuty cleadhoe at the commissary im back again all is going accord ing to plan have you had word yet from let us say anyone else nothing yet iutys voice was harsh we await him with hope and anxiety you have the book ill bring what i have to your house in say half an hour tun made a peevish tskm sound we have regulations here i cant leave my work on an instants whim well if i must i must ill make an excuse gersen told alice mrs cleadhoe has strong views in fact shes obstinate and suspicious he examined her critically youd better wear something drab and inconspicuous alice looked down at herself she wore gray spacemans breeches black ankleboots a dark green shirt what could be more drab and inconspicuous than this well pull that hat down over your hair and try to look like a boy mrs cleadhoe might well be more suspicious than ever im also thinking of howard treesong said gersen if he sees red hair hell think alice it would be better if you stayed here at the hotel weve been through this before stay in the shadows talk in a low gruff voice ill do my best from his carrying case gersen took various bits and pieces and stowed them about his person alice watched without comment ciersen finally said these are weapons all invoking poison take the book of dre l ws this and be very careful with it he gave her a bit of glass tube four inches long if someone you dont like comes close aim the tube toward his face and blow into this end then move as far away as possible alice soberly tucked the rube in the chest pocket of her shirt they left the hotel and walked around to tuty cleadhoes cot tage she had been watching the door opened as they approached tutys heavy face clouded with surprise at the sight of alice who is this and what her name is alice wroke she is my colleague hmmf well its none of my business come in the room had changed from gersens previous visit in a single particular nimpys marmel no longer stood wistfully on the dais tuty gave a grim nod nimpy is gone for the while now then where is the book gersen gave her a red notebook inscribed the book of dreams tuty glanced through the pages she looked up in annoyance theres nothing here naturally not do you think id risk the real book so easily it is a facsimile bait so to speak tuty said grimly it is enough you need do nothing more otho and i have formed our plans nothing is left to chance you should go back to tanaquil and wait when the work is done you will be notified gersen laughed you may have formed plans but so has how ard he is a professional i have no doubt how would you deal with him sooner or later hell show himself here when he does i will kill him tuty stood arms akimbo hands on her sturdy hips indeed indeed how will you do this without weapons i could ask you the same i have a gun a model j proac it will blow the head off a thrombodaxus will you allow me the use of this gun certainly not regulation strictly forbids it nor would otho approve how long before howard comes i dont know i came as fast as possible i suspect that he will do the same there wont be much time between us alice pointed out the window no time at all look the demon princes along the street came schahar and behind him a short thick man with heavy shoulders and a nearneckless head those are two of howards men said gersen do you still think you can cope with them certainly here he comes into the back room with you and not a sound she hustled them into the back parlor and pulled the door shut light through a side window shone on a photograph of young nimpy in a silver frame resting on a nearby library table gersen tried the door which refused to move he cursed under his breath the old fool has locked us in alice looked at the window its small but i could squeeze through the door isnt all that solid we can break through any time we like shh listen from the front room came sounds of conversation you are tuty cleadhoe this was schahars voice what of it who are you no one i know mrs cleadhoe i am traveling secretary go to the hotel i dont want strangers about im not alone i have a great gun ready for intruders be off with you for a noble and important gentleman who wants to speak with you im sure to your profit an important gentleman i know no one like that whats his name and if hes so noble why doesnt he come here himself in stead of sending you like yourself mrs cleadhoe he doesnt care to deal with unpredictable people he is also nervous and timid guns alarm him so please be off with you and your affronts and be quick before i nervously and timidly blast off your leg i am old and alone but i take no abuse from baldheaded tourists excuse me mrs cleadhoe im sorry to offend you please dont flourish your gun so freely one question are you the tuty c who recently wrote to cosmopolis magazine what of it wtiy should i not write as i wish what harm have i done no harm whatever you brought good luck to yourself as you will see if you put away your gun and compose yourself then i will ask my principal to join us the book of driims and then itd he two against one haha no chance of that send in this noble timid gentleman and dont come back the gun ill put it bv unless it wants use im sure youll find no cause for alarm mrs cleadhoe and every reason for satisfaction i cant imagine why or how no response from schahar who evidently had departed gersen put his shoulder against the door which creaked and groaned at once a loud rap sounded on the panel you two stay quiet you are not to interfere with our plans not a sound now someones at the door gersen muttered under his breath alice said shh listen i think its howard they heard the sound of the outer door opening and tutys voice sir and who are you mrs cleadhoe you dont recognize me no why should i what do you want ill refresh your memory you wrote to amagazine about old times in gladbetook and a certain chum of your nymphotis youre not howard hardoah but i see it now how you have grown as a boy you seemed so frail well think of that i must telephone otho a pity he cant be here inside the back room gersen clenching his teeth in frustration put his hand to the door latch alice pulled him back dont be foolish tuty would shoot you without a second thought she knows what shes after so do i its not this shh be reasonable gersen again put his ear to the door a marvel how the years go by seems so long ago and far away but how youve changed so handsome and fine youve be come but come in do and ill pour us a drop of something heres some good old fructance or would you like tea and perhaps a bite of cake thats very good of you mrs cleadhoe ill take a drop of fructance thats more than enough have some of these little cakes i cant imagine how you found me here or why but of course my letter to the magazine of course it brought back old memories things i hadnt thought of in years like the little book you mentioned the demon princfs oh dear yes that funny little red book what a fanciful lad you were so full of dreams and glamours the book of dreams thats how you named your book true i remember distinctly im anxious to see it again and you certainly will ill find it in a moment but you must join me in my meal i was just about to cook up some hotchpotch gladbetookstyle and a dish of lessamy i hope you havent lost your taste for home cooking worse far worse ive taken a stomach ailment and im re stricted as to what i eat but dont let me interfere cook up your own dinner and meanwhile ill glance through my old red book let me think now what have i done with it of course its at the station where otho does his grafting he works such long hours its a pity and disgrace but there are so few qualified nowadays and otho is at it night and day hell be so pleased to see you surely you can spend the week here with me until he comes out of the jungle hed never forgive me if i let you go a week oh mrs cleadhoe i truly cant spare so much time now then i have a nice spare room and im sure you need the rest and then youll be able to see mr cleadhoe ill have him bring your book when he comes well have such good gossips over old times it sounds delightful mrs cleadhoe but i cant spare so much time still id like to see mr cleadhoe where is the outstation its away through the jungle a good hours ride on the railcar tourists naturally arent allowed anywhere near really why not they bother the beasts or give them unwholesome food some of these beasts are under experiment we keep them close under observation and provide their food mr cleadhoe does things just so a pity he cant come in from the station tonight why not call him on the telephone oh no hed never hear of it the connections are wrong in any event how so by afternoon theres a feed train that tends for sick animals it goes out to the station and returns by morning thats routine and wont be changed sometimes i drive it out and stay the night the hook of drms when the regular driver wants time to himself he always reim burses me for my lost time at the commissary a pause then came treesongs voice light and easy why not drive us out tonight it would be a great experience for us of course id reimburse your expenses and who do you mean by us you me umps and schahar wed all like to see the station not possible tourists arent allowed at the station thats a strict regulation one person besides the driver can crouch in the back cab and not be seen but not three couldnt they ride elsewhere among the slops and swill your friends would not like it its against all regulation another pause then would fifty svu cover your expenses at the commissary of course they dont overpay us thats a sad truth still we dont complain our cottage comes without rent and i get a nice discount at the commissary look in tomorrow and if theres any thing you fancy i can get it at a good price if you dont care to go out to the station without your friends why not just stay the week otho would be distressed to miss you actually mrs cleadhoe time presses me hard heres fifty svu well go out this afternoon well theres not much time for arrangements ill have to telephone here and there like a wild woman and perhaps i should have something for joseph to close his mouth hes the regular driver that way were on the safe side can you manage another twenty yes i think so that should suffice now then take your friends back to the hotel then meet me with your overnight kit at the terminal its just a hundred yards along the road in half an hour no later and dont approach until i signal in case superintendent kennifer is strolling about oh and i must call mr cleadhoe to tell him were on our way and to air the extra room if its jungle you want its all there at the station perhaps tonight well see a lucifer or a scorposaur hurry then be off with you in half an hour at the terminal the door closed tuty cleadhoe approached the back parlor you two in there did you hear the demon princes gersen threw his shoulder against the door it burst open tuty cleadhoe stood back holding the blaster in both hands her squat body braced and her face creased in a grin stand back there make a move and ill blow you up i dont care a whit about you live or die so stand back gersen spoke with dignity i thought that we were in this business together so we are you brought howard here im taking him out to mr cleadhoe and we shall see now sit down yonder as i must make my arrangements she jerked the gun alice pulled gersen to a couch and the two seated themselves tuty nodded and went to the telephone she made several calls then turned back to gersen and alice now then as for you mrs cleadhoe listen to me dont take howard treesong for granted he is clever and dangerous tuty swung her heavy arm bah i know him well he was a haunted little milksop who bullied girls and little boys and finally destroyed my nimpy he hasnt changed cleadhoe and i haha were glad to see him now up with you and remember youre nothing to me whatever she herded them into the kitchen and opened a door into the cellar quicktime alice took gersens arm and dragged him through the door down a steep stairs and into a concretewalled space smelling of strange molds old paper and condiments the door shut the bolt jarred home gersen and alice were left in the darkness gersen climbed back up the stairs and listened at the door tuty had not moved gersen could picture her standing foursquare gun at the ready balefully watching the door a half minute passed the joists creaked as tuty moved away gersen groped around the head of the stairs hoping to find a light switch without success he thrust on the door which creaked but withstood the relatively slight force he was able to apply from his unbalanced position gersen groped through the darkness floor joists above oth erwise nothing substantial he descended the ladder alices voice came muffled through the darkness there doesnt seem to be much down here i dont feel any other doors just cases full of old junk what i want is a plank or a length of timber said gersen the book of dreams theres nothing but the cases and some boxes and old rugs gersen explored the cases lets unload these things if i can stack them on the landing so that i can somehow get my back to the door and my feet against the joists ten minutes later gersen clambered up the rickety construc tion dont stand below this is quite precarious ah lying back he put his shoulders to the door kicked up and found a joist with his feet he straightened his legs thrusting with his thigh muscles the door burst open and gersen tumbled backwards into tuty cleadhoes kitchen he picked himself up helped alice up the stairs then paused to sort through tuty cleadhoes cutlery he selected two heavy knives which he tucked into his belt and netted a cleaver alice found a cloth bag put it in this ill carry it they went to the front door looked up and down the street seeing no one they stepped out into the droning afternoon keeping to the shadows the two set off toward the railcar ter minal a cluster of dilapidated structures a hundred yards ahead tuty will be angry if things go wrong alice remarked she is a vehement woman shes a conniving old harridan said gersen slowly now we dont want to be seen a heavy fetor assaulted their noses a smell sour ripe rich and rank looking through the foliage they discovered the origin of the odor by a hopper stood a portly whitehaired man with heavy lidded eyes and a placid expression he controlled the flow of pink gray pulp sliding from the hopper into a vat on a railcar he worked a lever the flow ceased a small locomotive backed close and cou pled to the vat under the locomotives observation cupola sat tuty peering over her shoulder and manipulating the throttle the man at the hopper waved his arm turned away and walked into a workshop tuty pulled back the throttle the locomotive and vatcar moved ahead howard treesong raised himself and settled into the goods compartment behind tuty from behind a bush came two men schahar and umps they ran behind the vatcar swung themselves up to the small rear platform the cars rolled around a curve and out of sight gersen went to the workshop the portly man looked up and gave a peremptory jerk of the thumb sir no public allowed here the demon princrs im not the public said gersen im a friend of mrs clead hoe youve missed her shes just taken feed out to the station along with her nephew were in the same party it seems weve arrived a bit too late is there another locomotive which could make the trip joseph pointed to a rusty old mechanism dented and bent sup ported on blocks and bereft of wheels theres old number sev enteen down for repair one of these days ill put on new drive wheels when time and money come together how far is the outstation its a good seventy miles by the track shorter airwise but theres not a flier in town quite illegal for reasons of ecology and frightening of the beasts seventy miles ten hours at a steady run ho ho chortled joseph youd run maybe a mile before an eye would push up from the mud then a messenger arm sixty feet long ending in grabhooks and away youd go through the air over to the mud and down and then what happens who knows devil a soul has come back to tell alice pointed across the shop whats that thing thats the track inspectors gocart it wont pull freight but shell go licketysplit where the track is level gersen walked around the contraption a platform on four wheels with a pair of cane seats under a hemispherical visor splotched with the juices of smashed insects the controls were starkly simple a pair of handles two toggles and a dial its not beautiful but it rolls along fine said joseph with modest pride i built it myself gersen produced a crisp certificate which he handed to joseph i would like to use the gocart mr cleadhoe will be anxious to see us is it ready to go joseph inspected the certificate its not covered by regulation in fact therell be another twenty for you tomorrow when we return the cleadhoes wouldnt like to miss us and thats more important than regulation you dont work for the corporation nothing is more impor tant than regulation except life and money the book of dreams true well i hereby forbid you to use the cart the black handle is throttle the red handle is brake the toggle controls switches in the track the first fork to the left goes north to the observation post at salmi swamp the second fork goes right and down to the breeding wallows of the red apes the third fork switches off through the feeding meadow and back around to the station so its right left then either way now im going home and im not looking back still remember youve been warned off the premises joseph turned and marched from the shop gersen climbed aboard the gocart he pushed the black lever the can rolled for ward alice quickly jumped up beside him gersen advanced the throttle the cart rolled away from the station and into the jungle from life volume ii by unspiek baron bodissey intelligence demands the most strict of definitions since the word is easily and often abused intelligence rates the quality of gaean mans competence at altering environ ment to suit his convenience or more generally the so lution or problems the corollaries to the idea are several among them in the absence of problems intelligence can not be measured a creature with a large complicated brain is not necessarily intelligent raw abstract intelligence is a meaningless concept secondly intelligence is a quality pe culiar to gaean man certain alien races use different mechanisms and processes optimally to rearrange their en vironment these attributes occasionally resemble human intelligence and on the basis of results achieved the effec tive organs seem to serve analogous purposes these simil itudes almost always are deceptive and of superficial application for the lack of a more precise and universal term the temptation to use the word intelligence incor rectly is wellnigh irresistible but can be countenanced only when the word is set off by quotes viz my own monograph which i include in the appendix to volume eight of this slight and by no means comprehensive series students se riously interested in these matters may well wish to consult the monograph a comparison of mathematical processes as employed by six intelligent alien races the book of drkms the vehicle had been built of odds and ends scraps and make shifts the righthand stringer was a length of tungsten fiber pipe wile the lefthand stringer was hacked from jungle hardwood a slab oi magnesium hexafoam provided support for the seats these originally a sofa with orange and blue cushions the hemispheric windscreen was a reclaimed skylight the wheels were a stock com missary item for the repair of wheelbarrows carts and the like with a flange welded around the inner circumference despite all the vehicle ran smoothly and quietly and blue forest camp was left behind for the first few miles the track led through a floral tunnel of a hundred colors permeated by shafts and sifts of afternoon light drooping fronds dead black on top transmitted ruby red light other fronds showed gradations of blue green yellow stalks of blackandwhite tubing moved back and forth thrusting their round black fronds this way and that for maximum impingement of sun light in open places moths floated on manylayered wisps of gos samer black and crimson and lemon yellow other flying things golden blurs darted past in a hiss of air the jungle became broken the tracks led across clearings and meadows dappled with ponds each with its resident water bull great mottled creatures with horns and shovelsnouts which they used to enlarge their ponds a trestle built of concrete posts and timber laterals took the track across a series of bogs crusted over with pale blue scum or alternately a carpet of angry orange stalks supporting spherical spore pods beyond the bogs the ground rose to become a savanna ro dentlike creatures in carapaces armed with prongs and barbs grazed the turf in bands of twenty or thirty often these were attended by tenfoot baitapes whiteskinned creatures splotched with black fur sinuous black printhenes skulked through the meadows on splaved legs these were voracious cunning and capable of prodigious feats of savagery still they avoided the vilesmelling baitapes the track led up a slope and ran across a plain of coarse black and green grass clumped with thorn tree bands of spindly rumi nants wandered the open areas nervously alert for printhenes or packs of scalawags ravening pounding yelping creatures half liz ard half dog a dozen kinds ot ruminants moved across the savanna the largest an armored monster twenty feet tall supported on a dozen short legs in the hazy northern distance a pair of apelike hie dfmon princes saurians thirty feet tall overlooked the landscape with an eerie sem blance of brooding intelligence a mile to the south a flock of bird like bipeds fifteen feet tall scarletcrested flaunting bright blue tails ran after a bewildered myriapod and hacked it to pieces with beaks and spurs the tracks led directly across the plain diving at halfmile in tervals under animal passthroughs the electric guards were now paralleled by a second electric fence fifty feet to either side of the track the sun hung low in the sky sweeping the landscape with a halcyon unreal illumination and the creatures of the land rather than horrid reality seemed more the subjects of an imaginary if macabre bestiary the tracks stretched clear and empty the feed train had passed from view gersen pulled the throttle open the cart lurched for ward at great velocity jumping bounding and shivering to irreg ularities in the track gersen reluctantly reduced speed i dont want to take this thing into a ditch its too heavy to carry out and its too far to walk mile after mile and still no sign of the feed train to right and left spread the savanna four doubleheaded browsers watched from sensors at the ridge of their humps a mile ahead the track plunged into a dark forest at the edge of the shade sunlight glinted for an instant on the housing of the locomotive were gaining said gersen and what do we do when we catch up asked alice we wont catch up gersen estimated the distance ahead were only a few minutes behind still id like to be a bit closer howard wont be able to explain schahar and umps there might be trouble right away unless hes a very smooth talker at the edge of the forest the tracks wound back and forth to avoid outcrops of rock gersen reduced speed accelerating when the tracks stretched empty ahead a post beside the track supported a white triangle almost at once the track switched one fork leading to the north the other continuing directly east the direction the feed train had taken by the evidence of the open points a mile along the track another fork led to the south as before the feed train had proceeded east gersen became even more vig the hook of drems ilant the feed train could not be far ahead as before he increased speed along straightaway cautiously slowing and peering around curves another white triangle appeared beside the track the third fork said alice station to the right feed lot to the left gersen braked the cart to a halt the feed train has gone left see the switch points wed better follow for half a mile the tracks led north through a forest gaps in the foliage revealed yet another savanna stretching awav to the east the tracks curved east and slanted down upon the savanna alice pointed theres the feed train gersen braked the cart to a halt the feed train passed over an unloading device in an area unprotected by the electric fence tutv stopped the locomotive uncoupled the vatcar and proceeded a valve in the bottom of the feed car opened discharging the pulp into a trough on the back of the car schahar and umps rose to their feet to stare in dismay after the departing locomotive then they turned to examine the creatures which from all directions converged on the feeding trough a twentyfoot haltape with head half bear half insect lurched forward at a shambling trot schahar and umps jumped down and ran toward a tree the ape caught umps and lifted him by the leg into the air umps kicked out in a frenzy and drove his heel into the creatures proboscis it threw umps to the ground jumped up and down on his torso pounded the body with its fists then it turned away and looked toward schahar now perched in the lower branches of the tree where he attracted the attention of a spiderlike reptile which inhabited the upper branches it dropped a long gray arm which it swung toward schahar who yelled in alarm drew a knife and hacked when the spiderreptile descended by swift ac robatic swings schahar jumped to the ground dodged to escape the baitape which then pulled at the spiderreptiles tentacle the spiderreptile jumped from the tree wrapped itself around the bait apes head flourished high its sting and thrust it home the bait ape keened in pain tore at the tentacles with monstrous arms the tentacles clutched tighter the sting struck again the ape banged the spiderreptile into the tree trunk again and again reducing it to pulp and finally tore it loose the ape staggered away save a convulsive bound and fell into a heap a band of scavengers at the ufmon princes tracted by the outcries loped forward noticing schahar they cir cled him yelling jumping biting and schahar presently was pulled down to disappear under a seethe of animals gersen spoke in a rueful voice do you think tuty knew that those two were riding behind her i dont care to guess the train with tuty and howard treesong had disappeared into the jungle at the far side of the meadow the feed car now blocked the track weve got to go back to the fork said gersen he pulled on levers and toggles where is reverse gear he searched in vain the throttle controlled forward motion the brake brought the car to a stop gersen jumped to the ground and tried to lift one end of the cart without success it carried ballast to hold it to the tracks he tried to push the can but the slope defeated him this is absurd said gersen there must be a way to go backward if i had a length of timber i could pry the car off the tracks but im afraid to go into the forest its getting dark said alice the sun is going down gersen went to the edge of the track bed and looked into the forest high low right and left i dont see anything here i go wait said alice what is this little gadget here gersen returned to the cart at the center of the platform a handle turned a worm gear alice you are an intelligent girl that is a jack which lifts the cart high enough so that we can swivel it around end for end alice said modestly i thought that perhaps i might be helpful or even indispensable five minutes later they returned the way they had come to the third switch and now they turned east and drove at full speed through the twilight a mile two miles five miles the forest abruptly became a soggy moor ahead the sunset glimmered on a wide loop of river the track led across a bridge of metal bars evidently electrified to inhibit the creatures of the bog inside the compound the track led past a commissary store a dispensary and a row of six small cottages a few yards farther stood the laboratory which overlooked the swamp and beyond gorgon river the book of driiams the track branched into a siding gersen coasted up behind the locomotive and stopped for a moment the two sat listening silence at blue forest camp howard treesong said in a voice of jovial camaraderie the passenger compartment nonsense ill ride up forward with you a pity but it cant be done said tuty suppose superinten dent kennifer should happen by you sit in the back and crouch till were in the jungle then relax and enjoy the ride watch for marshmallow moths and water flowers treesong climbed into the compartment behind the drivers cupola and made himself inconspicuous the train moved away from the terminal if from the corner of her wideset eyes tuty had noticed schahar and umps as they clambered aboard the swill car she gave no sign through jungle across savanna in and out of the dark forest rolled the feed train at the third switch tuty swung north and out upon the feed meadow which was rarely used except when biologists intended experiments but tonight tuty had decided to feed the animals almost without halting the train she detached the feed car howard treesong jumped to his feet in the back com partment and stared out the rear window tuty cleadhoe never so much as looked over her shoulder howard treesong shoulders sagging and ashen of face sank once more into his seat the train trundled into the station rolled across the compound and halted beside the laboratory tuty climbed to the ground grunting and wheezing howard treesong alighted from the passenger compartment and stood looking around the compound tuty called out in a brassy voice so then howard how did you find our lovely countryside its not at all like dear old gladbetook still its quite pictur esque true well then lets find if mr cleadhoe is expecting us with a nice supper i do hope hes put out his pets hes a wonder with animals is mr cleadhoe come along howard the night bugs will be after us in another minute tuty led the way to the laboratory she slid back the door the demon princes otho were here make sure ditsy is out howard wont care to be annoyed by any of your charmers otho are you about a gruff voice said tush woman of course im about come in so this is young howard hardoah isnt he changed youd never recognize him thats a fact otho cleadhoe stepped forward on long thin legs standing six inches taller than howard treesong cleadhoes great head was bald on top harsh and craggy with an untidy ton sure of gray hair a stained gray beard and eyes in deep lavender sockets he fixed howard treesong with a long stare of impersonal appraisal howard ignored the inspection and looked around the room and this is your laboratory im told that youre now an important scientist ha not altogether im still a practitioner of my old trade but now both my subjects and my methods are different come along ill show you some of my work while mrs cleadhoe puts out our soup tuty called out in a voice of brassy jocularity ten minutes then and no more youve all evening to show off your trophies ten minutes my dear come howard through here and watch your head these arches werent built for tall men let me take your hat ill wear it if i may said treesong i am very sensitive to drafts a pity well then along this route we take tanaquil dig nitaries who come to learn how we spend the public money i might add that they never leave dissatisfied this is the chamber of as tinches howard treesong inspected the room with his eyes heavy lidded otho cleadhoe if he noticed treesongs unenthusiastic manner paid no heed these are all varieties of astinche the be thune andromorphs a local evolutionary development the genus is especially rich on shanar and in this particular neighborhood they vary in size up to the thirtyfoot giant you see there he indicated an alcove i processed the creature almost singlehanded with trifling help from my staff i worked in an atmosphere of ar gon under germicidal conditions i skinned the beast marmelized the soft tissues reinforced the skeletal frame and refitted the pelt remarkable said treesong a fine piece of work they are amazing creatures agile for their size we often see the book of drkms them capering across the distance these others over here are its cousins or so we believe do you know there are still mysteries regarding these creatures how they breed how they develop how they order their body chemistry all mysteries but i wont bore you with technical details as you see they come in every size every color intelligence who knows some are clever some a blur of motion a cry of annoyance from howard treesong as down from one of the alcoves jumped a creature eight feet tall with thin arms and legs to snatch treesongs hat and bound from the room otho cleadhoe laughed a croak of indulgent amusement clever yes mischievous yes intelligent who knows that is ditsy who is full of tricks im afraid your hat is gone ill have to replace it howard treesong ran to the door and peered through whats got into the beast it put my hat in the fire its a pity for certain i cant apologize enough ditsy outside what can you mean acting in such a way hes destroyed your fine hat if your head becomes cold please say so tuty can provide a hood or a shawl no great matter ditsy must be punished and i will see to it the creature is attracted to bright colors and makes a mischief with guests perhaps i should have warned you no matter i have a dozen hats none other so splendid ill warrant well its a pity through here now we leave the chamber of astinches for the hall of swampwalkers howard treesong showed only a cursory interest in the twenty purple and black creatures with their odd cloaks of woven vegeta tion a very representative collection said otho cleadhoe they are found only along the gorgon river now to the den of horrors as i call my workshop it never fails to impress cleadhoe led the now bored and languid howard treesong into a room illuminated by a high glass cupola a central platform supported a massive redandblack creature with six legs and a fe rocious head an awesome beast said treesong quite so and an awesome project the largest of my expe rience yonder is my office a dismal sort of place but the cor the demon princes poration wont spare me anything better your little book is there and well pick it up presently why not now suggested treesong since its close at hand as you like its on my desk if you care to fetch it now then i wonder do you think that here and there the hide tends to sag across the haunches howard treesong had gone to the side chamber on the desk lay a small red volume inscribed the book of dreams treesong stepped forward the door closed behind him out in the workshop otho cleadhoe turned a valve waited fifteen seconds then turned it off tuty cleadhoe looked into the workshop the soup is ready do you care to eat ill be busy said cleadhoe i dont care to eat navarth sat drinking wine with an aged acquaintance who bemoaned the brevity of existence i have left to me at the most ten years of life that is sheer pessimism declared navarth think optimistically rather of the ten hundred billion years of death that await you from chronicles of navarth by carol lewis navarth despised latterday poetry save only those verses composed by himself these are faded times wis dom and innocence once were allied and noble songs were sung i recall a couplet by no means sublime quaint rather succinct yet reverberating a thousand meanings a farting horse will never dre a farting mans the man to hire where is the like today from chronicles of navarth by carol lewis gersen and alice went quickly through the dark to the laboratory the night was warm clear and dark illuminated by thousands of lambent stars from the swamp and the jungle came sounds a far strident howl and uncomfortably near a grunting bellow of rage light shone from a window gersen and alice watched tuty cleadhoe moving around in the kitchen she sliced bread sausage and ramp she stirred the contents of a kettle and set out imple ments at a table the dkmon princrs gersen muttered for two who wont be taking supper she seems quite placid whispered alice perhaps we can just knock on the door and ask if were in time for supper thats as good a plan as any gersen tried the door latch then knocked in the kitchen tuty stiffened then darted to a side board tucked a weapon into her pocket she went to a communi cator spoke heard a few guttural words then turned marched to the front door and threw it open her hand close to her gun hello mrs cleadhoe said gersen are we too late for the party tutv cleadhoe stared grimly from one to the other why did you not stay where i left you are you impervious to reason can you not understand when your presence is unwanted all this to the side mrs cleadhoe you failed to honor our agreement tuty cleadhoe showed a small quick smile perhaps i did what then youd have done the same to me had you fixed on it she looked over her shoulder come in then wrangle with mr cleadhoe if you like she led them into the kitchen otho cleadhoe stood at the sink carefully washing his hands he swung around and surveyed gersen and alice from the depths of his lavender eye sockets visitors eh tonight im busy or id show you around thats not why were here where is howard treesong cleadhoe jerked his thumb back yonder hes safe and now ill want my supper wi you eat sit down said tuty with automatic if graceless hospitality theres enough for all eat said cleadhoe in a cavernous bass voice we will talk of howard hardoah did you know he killed our nymphotis gersen and alice seated themselves at the table hes killed many people said gersen what would you have done with him killed him in return yes cleadhoe nodded ponderously well you shall have your chance i took him into a still room and turned gas on him hell be awake in about six hours so you havent killed him oh no cleadhoes smile broke a pink gap through the beard the book of drkms life is awareness and howard hardoah should become more broadly aware perhaps in time he will repent his crimes possibly so said gersen still you have not kept good faith with us cleadhoe glanced at him uncomprehendingly then resumed his chewing perhaps in our emotion we acted less than politely but postpone your annoyance you shall take part in the ultimate judg ment tuty cried out and dont forget we guarded you from harm howard brought two of his murderers with him ha but they will murder no more otho cleadhoe smiled approvingly as if tuty had been de scribing the recipe for her soup he said howard is crafty imag ine this he carried a weapon in his hat i instructed ditsy to snatch away the hat and destroy it as mrs cleadhoe says we have done our share in the work neither gersen nor alice had any comment to offer in about six hours howard will recover his faculties said cleadhoe in the meantime you may rest or sleep or examine the collections or you may sit comfortably drink tea or brandy and tell us of the harms you have suffered from howard hardoah gersen looked at alice wtiat of you i cant sleep mr and mrs cleadhoe might like to hear of the school reunion at gladbetook aye that we would indeed at midnight otho cleadhoe left the kitchen twenty minutes later he returned howard is returning to consciousness if you like you can come the group filed through the laboratory and along a corridor cleadhoe halted beside a door listen he speaks through a mesh came the sounds of a colloquy first came howard treesongs voice clear and strong but puz zled and fretful an impasse like a wall i can neither advance nor retire nor yet sidle away the sunrise is here we are lost in the jungle take care let none stray aside paladins who hears my voice the responses came quickly the voices almost seemed to over lap as if several spoke together the dkmon fringes mewness stands by your side this a calm clear voice pre cise and without passion spangleway here among the apes rhune fader the blue and hohenger and black jeha rais all are here a thin cool voice spoke eia panice is here and immir i am here till the end immir you are steadfast like all the rest now to set a wise strategy jeha rais you are grave the deep voice of jeha rais the black paladin sounded i am grave and more than grave after these mighty years did you not recognize him immir he called himself cleadhoe of dandelion farm jeha rais he is the dree a few seconds of silence immir then we are in desperate condition rhune fader we have known desperate times before remember the course at ilkhad it was enough to daunt the iron giant yet we won through spangleway i recall the ambush in massilia old town a dreadful hour immir brothers let us fix our thoughts on this moment only jeha rais the dree is a brute of malevolence to shift his force we need counterforce can we offer wealth immir i will open our treasury he can own sybaris for all of me mewness it will not tempt the dree loris hohenger offer a doxen maidens each more beautiful than the last let them wear gowns of sheer diaphane and regard the book of dreams him with gazes neither gay nor grave as if they asked who is this marvel wtio is this demigod immir good hohenger the concept moves you i suspect that you would throw your brother paladins into lake chill to take part in such a parade mewness not the dree spangleway wealth beauty what is left rhune fader if only we had valkariss cup and eternal youth immir complications complexities i sense a devilish plot rhune fader silence all someone stands outside the door cleadhoe spoke in a whisper he is halfawake he talks as if he were dreaming he slid back the door enter half the room was bare and dim the other half had been planted and worked to simulate a jungle glade light slanted down through a hundred sorts of foliage on gnarled tendrils hung flow ers bugcatchers and spore pods a stream passed through rocks forming a small pool which drained through dark red reeds into an unseen outlet beside the pool in an armchair sat howard alan treesong nude except for a short skirt around his hips his hands rested on the arms of the chair his legs which were stark and glossy white rested on the turf his head had been shaved bald across the pool on a bank of turf reclined the marmel of nymphotis in the bushes moved a half dozen small astinches with faces formed of mottled redandblue cartilage crests like small black hats and glossy black pelts the presence of howard treesong interested them they watched and listened with respectful attention the colloquy had ended howards eyes glinted under half closed lids his breathing seemed normal cleadhoe spoke to gersen and alice this originally was a display cage for the little astinches they are called puppet man darins and are strange little creatures dont go too close there is a mesh of invisible pinrays which will sting you it seemed a fine place to maintain howard the demon princes you have marmelized his legs quite so he is immobile and he must gaze at nymphotis whom he murdered this is our judgment upon him whatever additional punishment you or alice wroke wish to apply i shall not object it is your right gersen asked how long will he live like this cleadhoe shook his head that is hard to predict his natural functions continue but he is immovably anchored his hair inci dentally concealed a mesh of circuitry there are no implants or internal weapons i have made sure of this treesongs eyes were open he looked down at his legs moved his hands felt the cool material which now composed the sheathing of his upper thighs cleadhoe spoke howard alan treesong we from among all your numberless victims are now working retribution upon you tuty cried out in a rich contralto there he is our son nym photis and there sit you howard hardoah his murderer reflect upon your evil deed howard treesong spoke in an even voice i have been well and truly trapped and who are these other two alice wroke what brings you here among these zealots i am one of them do you not remember what you asked of me to save the life of my father when you already had taken his life my dear alice when one deals in high policy one sometimes overlooks nice details your fathers death and your services were both elements in a larger design and you sir your semblance is disturbingly familiar it should be you have met me several times both at voymont and at gladbetook i had the pleasure of shooting you unfortunately not to serious effect you also know me as henry lucas of extant i am responsible for enticing you here through your book of dreams but let me take your memory even farther back do you recall the raid on mount pleasant i remember the episode yes it was a remarkable exercise i saw you for the first time on that occasion and i have de voted my life to arranging this confrontation indeed you are a fanatic you have the faculty for creating fanatics the book of dreias howard treesong made an easy gesture so now i am at your mercy how will you deal with me gersen laughed sourly what more could i do to you well there is always torture or you might take pleasure in killing me i have destroyed you as a man that is enough howard alan treesongs head drooped my life has run its course i intended to rule the human universe i would have been first emperor of the gaean worlds i almost did so now i am tired i cannot move and i will not live long leave me now i prefer to be alone gersen turned and taking alices arm left the room the cleadhoes followed the door closed almost at once the colloquy began immir now all is known the dree has done a terrible deed oh my paladins what now what say you jeha rais rais the time has come immir how so green mewness why do you turn away metuness there are long roads yet to be traveled and many an inn where i would take refuge immir why do you all look this way and that are we not all brothers and paladins jeha rais make for us a great strat egy to move these marmel legs spangleway immir i bid you farewell rais farewell immir the time has come immir loris hohenger are you deserting me too hohnenger i must be away to far places and new battles im mir and sweet blue fader what of youand you fia pan ice the demon princes panice i will do my brotherly best for you paladins turn back a single deed remains to be done farewell noble immir and now in the corridor the four heard a thud a splash cleadhoe ran to the door threw it aside the great chair had toppled howard alan treesong lay in a grotesque heap face down in the pool cleadhoe turned his nostrils flaring his eyes aglitter he made a wild gesticulation the chair was solidly fixed he could not have toppled it alone gersen turned away whatever has happened it is enough for me he took alices arm lets go somewhere else in the fhtterwing and traveling space alice picked up the book of dreams then at once put it down again what will you do with it i dont know give it to cosmopolis i suppose wliy not just put it out into space i cant do that alice put her hands on his shoulder and now what of you what of me how youre so quiet and subdued you worry me are you well quite well deflated perhaps i have been deserted by my enemies treesong is dead the affair is over i am done
