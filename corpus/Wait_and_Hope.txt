tremlett xxxvia surprising discovery xxxviithe dead alive xxxviiiconclusion chapter i ben and his aunt five oclock sounded from the church clock and straightway the streets of milltown were filled with men women and children issuing from the great brick factories huddled together at one end of the town among these two boys waked in company james watson and ben bradford they were very nearly of an age james having just passed his fifteenth birthday and ben having nearly attained it both boys looked sober why will appear from their conversation its rather hard to get out of a job just now said james why couldnt the superintendent discharge somebody else i suppose its all right said ben we were taken on last and we havent as much claim to remain as those that have been in the mill longer i dont believe there was any need of discharging anybody complained james you know business is very dull said ben who was more considerate and i hear they have been losing money oh well they can stand it said james so can you said ben your father is pretty well off and you wont suffer oh i shall have enough to eat and so on but i shant have any spending money and i cant get a new suit as i expected to this fall i wish that was all i had to fear said ben but you know how it is with me i dont see how aunt jane is going to get along without my earnings oh youll get along somehow said james carelessly for he did not care enough about other peoples prospects to discuss them yes i guess so said ben more cheerfully theres no use in worrying wait and hope thats my motto you have to wait a thundering long time sometimes said james well good night come round and see me tomorrow youll have plenty of time i dont know about that i must look up something to do i shant i am going to wait till the superintendent takes me on again theres one comfort i can lie abed as long as i want to i wont be tied to the factory bell the house which james entered was a goodsized twostory house with an ample yard and a garden behind it his father kept a drygoods store in milltown and was generally considered welltodo james entered the mill not because he was obliged to but because he wanted to have a supply of money in his pocket his father allowed him to retain all of his wages requiring him only to purchase his own clothes as he was paid five dollars a week james was able to clothe himself with half his income and reserve the rest for spendingmoney he was very fond of amusements and there was no circus concert or other entertainment in milltown which he did not patronize ben kept on his way till he reached the small house where his aunt lived and which had been his own home ever since his parents died when he was but five years of age two years before mr reuben bradford his uncle died and since then the family had been supported chiefly by bens wages in the mill his aunt got some sewing to do but her earnings were comparatively small there was one thing ben dreaded and that was to tell his aunt about his loss of employment he knew how she would take it she was apt to be despondent and this news would undoubtedly depress her as for ben he was of a sanguine cheerful temperament and always ready to look at the bright side if there was any bright side at all his little cousin tony seven years old ran out to meet him what makes you late ben he asked i am not so very late tony answered ben taking the little fellows hand yes you are its halfpast five oclock and suppers been ready quarter of an hour i see how it is tony you are hungry and that has made you tired of waiting no i am not but i wanted you to come home its always pleasanter when you are at home i am glad you like my company good evening aunt jane good evening ben sit right down at the table wait till ive washed my hands aunt i came home by mr watsons and that made me a little longer have you heard any news ben asked this thinking it possible that his aunt had already heard of the discharge of some of the factory hands but her answer satisfied him that she had not butters a cent higher a pound said mrs bradford i declare things seem to be going up all the time thirstyfive cents a pound it really seems sinful to ask such a price i wish that wasnt the worst of it thought ben im afraid even at twentyfive cents it will be hard for us to pay for butter if i dont get something to do soon i guess i wont tell aunt jane till after supper ben decided after a good cup of tea perhaps it wont make her feel so lowspirited so he ate his supper chatting merrily with his little cousin all the time just as if he had nothing on his mind even his aunt smiled from time to time at his nonsense catching the contagion of his cheerfulness i wish youd split a little wood for me ben said mrs bradford as our hero rose from the supper table ive had some ironing to do this afternoon and that always takes off the fuel faster all right aunt jane said ben i guess ill wait till ive finished the wood before telling her thought ben it wont be any worse than now tony went into the woodshed to keep him company and his aunt prepared to clear away the supper dishes she had scarcely commenced upon this when a knock was heard at the door the visitor proved to be old mrs perkins a greataunt of james watson who was an inveterate gossip her great delight was to carry news from one house to another how do you do mrs bradford she began i was just passin by and thought id come in a minute i am very glad to see you mrs perkins wont you have a cup of tea no thank you the fact is ive just took tea at my nephew watsons there i heard the news and i couldnt help comin right round and sympathizin with you sympathizing with me what for asked mrs bradford amazed on general principles she felt that she stood in need of sympathy but her visitors tone seemed to hint at something in particular it aint possible you havent heard the news ejaculated mrs perkins feeling that she was indeed in luck to have it in her power to communicate such important intelligence to one who had not heard of it i hope it isnt anything about ben said mrs bradford alarmed yes i may say it is something about benjamin answered mrs perkins nodding in a tantalizing manner he hasnt got into any scrape has he he hasnt done anything wrong has he asked aunt jane startled no poor child sighed the old lady thats the wust ont it aint what he has done its because he wont have anything to do for mercys sakes tell me what you mean mrs perkins hasnt benjamin told you that hes lost his place at the factory is this true mrs perkins asked mrs bradford turning pale yes business is dull and fifty men and boys have been turned off james watson and your benjamin are among them ben never told me anything about it faltered mrs bradford heaven only knows what we shall do oh i guess youll get along someway said mrs perkins complacently she was not herself affected having sufficient property to live upon well i must be going said the old lady anxious to reach the next neighbor and report how poor mrs bradford took it dont you be too much worried the lord will provide i am afraid we shall all starve thought mrs bradford mournfully she opened the shed door and said ben is it true that youve lost your place at the mill yes aunt answered ben who told you old mrs perkins why didnt you tell me before theres no hurry about bad news aunt i am afraid well all have to go to the poorhouse said aunt jane sighing perhaps we may but well see what else we can do first wait and hope aunt thats my motto mrs bradford shook her heard mournfully i dont mind it so much for myself she said but i cant help thinking of you and tony tony and i are coming out all right theres lots of ways of making money aunt just do as i do wait and hope chapter ii three situations before going further it may be as well to explain exactly how the bradfords were situated to begin with they had no rent to pay the small house in which they lived belonged to an old bachelor uncle of mrs bradford living in montreal and all they were required to do was to pay the taxes which amounted to very little not more than twelve dollars a year ben had earned at the factory five dollars a week and his aunt averaged two to some readers it may seem remarkable that three persons could live and clothe themselves on seven dollars a week but mrs bradford was a good manager and had not found the problem a difficult one now however the question promised to become more difficult if ben found nothing to do the family would be reduced to two dollars a week and to live comfortably on that small sum might well appal the most skilful financier ben woke up early and immediately began to consider the situation his motto was wait and hope but he knew very well that he must work while he was waiting and hoping otherwise he would differ very little from the hopeful micawber who was always waiting for something to turn up aunt jane he said after a frugal breakfast over which mrs bradford presided with an uncommonly long face how much money have you got on hand i want to know just how we stand mrs bradford opened her pocketbook with a sigh and produced two onedollar bills and thirtyseven cents in change theres only that between us and starvation she said mournfully well thats something said ben cheerfully isnt it tony its a lot of money said the inexperienced tony i never had so much in all my life there somebody thinks you are rich aunt jane laughed ben what should the poor child know of household expenses said mrs bradford to be sure only we may get some money before that is used up they owe me at the factory for half a week two dollars and a half i shall get it saturday night we wont starve for a week you see where are you going ben asked tony wont you stay and play with me i cant tony i must go out and see if i can find something to do milltown was something more than a village in fact it had been incorporated two years before as a city having the requisite number of inhabitants the main street was quite citylike being lined with stores i wonder if i cant get a change in a store thought ben so he made his way to the principal street and entered the first store he came to a large drygoods store entering he addressed himself to a small thin man with an aquiline nose who seemed to have a keen scent for money what can i do for you young man he asked taking ben for a customer can you give me a place in your store asked ben the small mans expression changed instantly what do you know of the drygoods trade he inquired nothing at present but i could learn answered our hero then ill make you an offer ben brightened up if you come into the store for nothing the first year ill give you two dollars a week the second do you take me for a man of property asked ben disgusted the small man replied with a shrill creaking laugh sounding like the grating of a rusty hinge isnt that fair he asked you didnt expect to come in as partner first thing did you no but i cant work for nothing then lemme see ill give you fifty cents a week for the first year and you can take it out in goods no thank you answered ben i couldnt afford it as he went out of the store he heard another grating laugh and the remark thats the way to bluff em off i offered him a place and he wouldnt take it ben was at first indignant but then his sense of humor got the better of his anger and he said to himself well ive been offered a position anyway and thats something perhaps i shall have better luck at the next place the next place happened to be a druggists the druggist a tall man with scanty black locks was compounding some pills behind the counter ben was not bashful and he advanced at once and announced his business dont you want a boy he asked the druggist smiled ive got three at home he answered i really dont think i should like to adopt another im not in the market for adoption said ben smiling i want to get into some store to learn the business have you any particular fancy for the druggists business asked the apothecary no sir i cant say that i have i never took much but enough to know that i dont like it then i am afraid you wouldnt do for experiment clerk whats that oh it his duty to try all the medicines to make sure there are no wrong ingredients in them poison for instance i am afraid i shouldnt like that said ben you dont know till youve tried heres a pill now suppose you take that and tell me how you like it the druggist extended to ben a nauseouslooking pill nearly as large as a bullet he had made it extra large for bens special case no i thank you said ben with a contortion of the face i know i wouldnt do for experiment clerk dont you need any other clerk couldnt i learn to mix medicines well you see there would be danger at first to the customers i mean you might poison somebody and then i would be liable for damages if you will get somebody to sign a bond forfeiting ten thousand dollars in any such case i might consider your application i dont think i could find any such person said ben then i am afraid i cant employ you you are quite sure you dont want to be experiment clerk and swallow your medicines i guess not good morning good morning if you want any pills you will know where to come i would rather go where they make em smaller said ben ben and the druggist both laughed and the former left the shop thats the second situation i have been offered today soliloquized our hero they were not very desirable either one of them to be sure but it shows theres an opening for me somewhere the next was a cigar store i might as well go in thought ben a little humpbacked man was behind the counter want to hire a boy asked ben are you the boy yes what can you do i am willing to do anything the hunchback grinned then perhaps i can give you a situation will you work for three dollars a week ben reflected that will do with strict economy he thought till the factory takes me on again ill come for a few weeks at that rate he said but perhaps you wont like your duties said the hunchback grinning in a curious manner what would be my duties i should paint you red and have you stand outside the door as an indian was the answer ben didnt relish the joke youd better take that position yourself he retorted nobodyd know the difference get out roared the cigar dealer angrily ben left at once thats the third situation ive been offered he said id give em all three for a decent one chapter iii at lovells grounds on the way home ben met james watson how are you james he said what have you been doing this morning james gaped the fact is he said i have only just got up and had my breakfast i dont see how you can lie abed so late oh i can do it just as easy i guess i was born sleepy you look so retorted bed with a laugh what have you been doing inquired james lazily ive been about in search of a place you have said james with sudden interest did you find any yes i found three what exclaimed james in surprise i was offered three places which did you take i didnt take any i didnt like them you are too particular ben just tell me where they are ill accept one all right said ben ill give you all the information you require the first is a drygoods store id like to be in a drygoods store whats the pay fifty cents a week for the first year faugh ejaculated james disgusted whats the second place experiment clerk at the druggists good pay i dont know what are the duties to taste all the medicines to make sure theres no poison in them the druggist offered me a pill to begin with about as large as my head i wouldnt take it for a hundred dollars a week whats the third in a cigar store the pay is three dollars a week thats better than nothing where is it i guess ill take it i dont think youll like the duties said ben laughing i wouldnt mind selling cigars that isnt what youre wanted for you are to be painted red and stand outside as an indian thats the worst yet i dont wonder you didnt take any of those chances what are you going to do this afternoon try and find some more places leave that till tomorrow you know theres going to be a big picnic at lovells grounds with all sorts of athletic sports there are prizes for wrestling jumping and so on i would like it well enough but i cant afford to go therell be nothing to pay father subscribed for two tickets so ive got a spare one come will you go yes i will and thank you then come round to the house as soon as youve got through dinner all right ill come i suppose you havent found a place said mrs bradford when ben entered not yet i dont know whats going to become of us if you dont said aunt jane mournfully dont get discouraged so quick aunt ive only been looking round one forenoon besides ive been offered a place and declined it declined it what could you have been thinking of ben then told his aunt of the place at the druggists he thought he would not mention the others if youd taken it we might have got our medicine cheaper said aunt jane who did not comprehend a joke and understood the offer literally i should have got mine for nothing said ben laughing and more than i wanted too what pay would you get i didnt ask the first pill the druggist offered me was too much for me so i respectfully declined the position pills are excellent for the constitution said mrs bradford in a rather reproachful tone i never could get you to take them benjamin some day youll lose your life perhaps because you are so set against them i cant say i hanker after them aunt said ben good humoredly however you see i might have had a place so you mustnt get discouraged so quick will you stay at home this afternoon ben asked little tony i cant tony i have an engagement with james watson aunt jane if i am late to supper dont be frightened ben found james ready and waiting they set out at once lovells grounds were situated a mile and a half away they comprised several acres sloping down to a pond which was provided with pleasure boats the grounds were frequently hired by parties from neighboring towns having been fitted up especially for the enjoyment of a crowd today they were engaged by a young peoples association and the program included among other things some athletic sports the grounds were pretty well filled when the two boys arrived in fact the performance had already commenced youre just in time for the fun boys said george herman a mutual acquaintance coming up to meet them why whats up george there is to be a fat mans race of two hundred yards for a prize of five dollars who are going to enter tom hayden the landlord of the milltown house and jim morrison the tailor one weighs two hundred and fifty the other two hundred and fortythree good laughed ben that will be fun where do they start from there dont you see that chalkmark and there come the men there was a level track laid out extending two hundred yards which was used for such occasions and this was one of the attractive features of lovells grounds the two men advanced to the startingline each accoutered for the race they had divested themselves of their coats and stood in shirtsleeves breathing hard already in anticipation of the race their bulky forms appeared to great advantage and excited considerable amusement tom hayden who was rather the heavier of the two had encircled his waist with a leather strap which confined it almost as closely as a young ladys waist this was by advice of frank jones a young fellow noted as a runner i dont think i can stand it frank said hayden gasping for breath oh yes you can mr hayden youll see how it will help you i can hardly breathe youve got it too tight frank jones loosened it a little and then turned to morrison wont you have a girdle too mr morrison he asked not much i dont want to be suffocated before i start have you made your will hayden not yet i will make it after i have won the prize are you ready gentlemen asked frank jones who officiated as starter as ready as i ever expect to be answered hayden trying to draw a long breath and failing then start at the word three one two three amid shouts of applause the two fat men started it cannot be said they started like arrows from the bow but they certainly exerted themselves uncommonly their faces grew red with the efforts they made and their colossal legs hurried over the ground as fast as could reasonably be expected i could beat them easily said james watson of course you could just wait till youve got as much to carry look theres morrison down it was true somehow one of morrisons legs entangled with the other and he tumbled and rolled over and over go in and win hayden shouted fifty voices to his gasping competitor about seventyfive yards remained to be traversed it look as if hayden could win the race with opposition but he was quite out of breath he pressed both hands on his stomach stopped and deliberately sat down on the track dont give it up yelled the crowd keep on and the prize is yours i cant gasped hayden and i wouldnt for five times the prize i dont want it so the prize was not awarded but the crowd had their fun and the two fat competitors sat down together to rest under a tree they did not recover from their efforts for at least an hour is there to be a boys race asked ben yes the boys race is next in order youd better enter i will said ben whats the prize five dollars bens eyes sparkled if i could only win it he thought it would be equal to a weeks pay at the factory chapter iv the boys race ben felt that his chances of winning the prize were very good among his schoolmates he was distinguished for his superiority in all athletic sports he could jump farther and run faster than any of the boys of his age and this was a ground of hope on the other hand he could not tell how many contestants there might be he had measured himself against the boys of his acquaintance but there were hundreds of other boys in the city and among them it was quite possible that there might be one who surpassed him however ben was always hopeful and determined to do his best to win one of the committee now came forward and announced the boys race the distance was to be the same the prize five dollars and there was a limitation of age no boy over seventeen years of age was permitted to enter are you going to compete james asked ben i guess not i dont stand any chance against you i dont know about that i might stumble or give out i should like the five dollars well enough then enter your name well i will i may as well try so ben and james were the first to enter their names are you coming in george asked ben of george herman no i lamed myself in jumping yesterday and am not in condition my brother frank is going to enter of course he wont stand any chance for he is too young the next to put down his name was radford kelso you cant run radford youre too fat said george cormack youre as fat as i am retorted radford i stand as much chance as you next came arthur clark and frank jones both tall and long of limb and looking as if they might be dangerous rivals both were strangers to ben i am afraid one of those fellows will outrun me said ben aside to james they are taller but perhaps they cant hold out as well but the course is only two hundred yards said ben that is against me just then the announcement was made on behalf of the committee that the distance would be increased to three hundred yards and that there would be a second race of a hundred and fifty yards for boys under fourteen the prize being two dollars and a half frank said george herman to his brother you had better wait and enter the second race i think i will and here is charlie he can go in too edward kemp harry jones and george huntingdon next entered their names for the first race the list was about to be declared complete when an active wellmade youth advanced and expressed a wish to compete he had just reached the grounds and learned that a race was to be run he gave his name as john miles from boston who is he george do you know him asked ben i believe he is visiting some friends in milltown he looks as if he might run he is well made for running the question is has he had any training thats going to decide the matter take your places boys at the order the contestants whose names have already been given took their places in line john miles glanced carelessly and rather contemptuously at his rivals ill show them how to run he said you are very kind said frank jones who stood next to him we never saw anybody run you know i have practiced running in a gymnasium said miles pompously running is the same all the world over perhaps it is but i run on scientific principles frank jones laughed you are very condescending to run with us then oh i go in for all the fun i can get i suppose you expect to win the prize of course i do who is there to prevent you dont pretend to run do you well ive always supposed i could run a little though i have never run in a gymnasium but there are better runners here than i that boy pointing to ben is said to be a good runner he said john miles contemptuously why im a head taller than he hes a mere baby well we shall see time was called and the signal to start was given the boys started almost simultaneously arthur clark was fastening a girdle about his waist and that delayed him a little for a few rods all the boys kept pretty well together then three gradually drew away from the rest these three were john miles frank jones and ben bradford arthur clark was just behind but his loss at the start put him at a disadvantage when the race was half over john miles led while fifteen feet behind ben bradford and frank jones were doing their best to overtake him john miles wore upon his face the complacent smile of assured victory at two hundred yards frank and ben had partially closed the gap between themselves and john miles intent though he was on his own progress ben had leisure to observe that miles was beginning to lose ground it seemed clear that he was inferior to ben in sustained power there is hope for me yet thought ben i am not in the least tired toward the end i will put on a spurt and see if i cant snatch the victory from him go in and win exclaimed frank jones youre got more wind than i dont let a stranger carry off the prize not if i can help it said ben he was now but four feet behind john and there were fifty yards to be run for the first time john miles became apprehensive he turned his head sufficiently to see that the boy whom he had considered beneath his notice was almost at his heels i cant let a baby like that beat me he said to himself and he tried to increase the distance by a spurt he gained a temporary advantage but lost more in the end for the attempt exhausted his strength and compelled him to slacken his speed farther on twenty yards from the goal the two rivals were neck and neck now for my spurt said ben to himself he gathered himself up and darted forward with all the strength that was in him he gained six feet upon his rival which the latter tried in vain to make up the excitement was intense popular sympathy was with ben he was known to be a milltown boy while john miles was a stranger put on steam milltown shouted the crowd hurrah for boston called out two personal friends of john miles ben crossed the line seven feet in advance of john amid shouts of applause frank jones came in an easy third and arthur clark ranked fourth i congratulate you said frank to ben who stood flushed and pleased at the goal youve won the prize fairly john miles stood by mortified and sullen better luck next time said frank jones you see we know a little about running i should have won easily enough if i hadnt had a sudden attack of cramp said john grumbling you didnt run as if you had the cramp you say so because you dont know how fast i can run i didnt run at all this morning thats unlucky i wanted to see some real running i should like to run the race over again said john of course you cant for the prize has been won i dont care about the prize ive got money enough i havent said ben i care more for the money than the victory look here said john ill put up five dollars myself if youll run with me again you will exclaimed ben his eyes sparkling yes i will and you wont ask me to put up anything no then ill run if the committee will let me a ready permission was obtained from the committee but it was stipulated that the younger boys should have their race first to this both contestants readily agreed since it would give them a chance to recover from the fatigue of the race they had just engaged in chapter v ben wins again i am very glad you won said frank jones in a low voice thank you so am i answered ben smiling of course i should have preferred to win myself continued frank candidly but as i saw that it lay between you and john miles i sided with you do you know miles no but i spoke with him just as the race began i saw that he felt sure of winning he boasted that he had practiced running at a gymnasium in boston then i wonder he didnt beat me he would on a short race but your wind is better i am glad to win for the sake of the money said ben i have lost my place at the factory and my aunt depends on my earnings then i am glad for you said frank i didnt need the money myself if i had won i would have given it to you knowing your circumstances you are very kind said ben gratefully you may win another five dollars i hope you will it will be rather hard on john miles to lose two races and his money too you neednt consider that if i judge him rightly he has selfconceit enough to carry him through a dozen defeats he will have some excuse ready you may be sure he says he lost the first race by a sudden cramp he has not more cramp than i there are little boys in line said ben i recognize frank and charlie herman do you know the others i know nearly all next to charlie herman are aleck gale johnny clarke little vanderhoef brooks gulager and charlie boyd the end boy is charlie snedeker who will win one of the hermans probably the prediction proved correct charles herman can in first leading his brother by a few feet you ought to divide the prize with me charlie said frank i didnt like to beat my older brother or i would have run ahead of you you didnt seem to hold back much said charlie however i will be generous and give you a dollar it will be all in the family proclamation was now made that a supplementary race would be run for a prize of five dollars offered by john miles the contestants being john miles and ben bradford the distance by request of miles was diminished to two hundred yards john was shrewd enough to see that the shorter distance was more favorable to himself defeat had not diminished his good opinion of himself not increased his respect for ben you gained the race by an accident he said to ben as they stood side by side waiting for the signal perhaps i did replied ben goodhumoredly all i can say is that it was a lucky accident for me of course it was you dont think you can run as fast as i can i cant tell yet i will do my best you will have to i have practiced running in a boston gymnasium then you have the advantage of me of course i have besides i am taller than you for all that i mean to win your five dollars if i can my money is safe enough i dont concern myself about that he has a tolerably comfortable opinion of himself thought ben i begin to want to beat him for something else than the money the signal was given and the boys started as in the first race john miles soon took the lead he was nearly three inches taller than ben naturally his legs were longer and this was an advantage again he put forth all his strength at once ben on the other hand reserved his strength for the close of the contest when the race was half over john miles was probably twenty feet in advance boston will win this time said arthur clark see how much miles leads i am not so sure of that said george herman i know ben bradford he is very strong and can hold out well miles is using himself up do you see how he is panting this was true in spite of all his training john miles had never been able to overcome a shortness of breath which was constitutional with him it was telling upon him now foot by foot ben gained upon him it was the first race over again toward the finish he overtook him and a final spurt won the race with john miles full ten feet behind have i won fairly asked our her turning to john that confounded cramp caught me again said john sullenly if it hadnt been for that you couldnt have beaten me that was unlucky for you i could beat you by twentyfive yards if i felt all right boasting is easy thought ben but he did not say it he felt in too good humor over his second victory we may have a chance to run again some time when you are in better condition he said cheerfully maybe so answered john dubiously he felt that he had had enough of running against ben bens acquaintances gathered about him and congratulated him over his double victory boys whom he did not know sought an introduction and he found himself quite a lion john miles returned to the two boys who had accompanied him and began to apologize for his want of success i was awfully unlucky he said i suppose that fellow thinks because he has beaten me twice when i had the cramp that he is a better runner than i am just see those fellows crowding around him i suppose he will strut like a turkeycock but this was doing injustice to ben he certainly had reason to feel pleased with his success for it not only brought him a sum equal to two weeks wages at the factory but he received the congratulations of the boys so modestly that he won the good opinion of many who had hitherto been strangers to him by george ben youve done well said james watson i just wish i were in your place i owe my good luck to you james how is that you invited me to come here i shouldnt have come but for you i am glad of it ben from what you tell me the moneyll come in handy indeed it will james it would come in handy to me too but you need it more ben was summoned before the committee of the picnic and asked whether he preferred to take his prizes in money or in the form of a gold medal in money he said promptly the medal would always remind you of your victory they wouldnt receive it at a grocery store said ben then you are a family man said a member of the committee smiling yes said ben ive got an aunt and cousin to provide for the money was accordingly placed in his hands two fivedollar greenbacks were a rich reward for his afternoons exertions he thought i wish i could earn as much money every day he thought we would have no trouble then about getting along about halfpast four oclock ben and james left the picnic grounds and started on their way home they had occasion to pass the cigar store where ben had been offered employment the proprietor was standing at the door have you made up your mind to accept my offer he asked recognizing ben you dont offer enough said ben isnt three dollars a week enough for a boy like you since i last saw you ive earned ten dollars answered ben you have exclaimed the cigar dealer in surprise i believe you are deceiving me you dont expect me to believe a story like that there is the proof said ben displaying the greenbacks are you sure you havent stolen the money asked the dwarf suspiciously i am as sure as that you are no gentleman retorted ben nettled by his tone the cigar dealer began to jump up and down with rage and shook his fist violently at the two boys who retired laughing chapter vi mr dobsons visit it was a little after five oclock when ben entered his humble home he was in excellent spirits as may be imagined his aunts face however presented a decided contrast to his own well benjamin she said with a sigh i suppose you havent found anything to do no aunt jane i have been to a picnic i dont see how you can have the spirits to go to a picnic when we are on the verge of starvation said mrs bradford reproachfully not so bad as that aunt jane we wont starve this week anyway perhaps not but i look forward to the future so do i aunt jane ben replied but there is this difference between us you look forward with discouragement while i look forward hopefully you know my motto is wait and hope youll have plenty of waiting to do his aunt retorted but there isnt much to hope for why isnt there i shouldnt think youd need to be told you havent earned a cent today and how do you know i havent demanded ben smiling how could you you were going about this morning after a place and this afternoon you have been at a picnic for all that aunt i have earned something more than if i had been at the factory mrs bradford stared at ben in astonishment how much did you earn ben asked tony havent i done well enough to earn a dollar tony mrs bradfords face assumed a more cheerful look for a dollar in that little household would go far i dont see how you found time to earn so much benjamin she said now just suppose aunt that i earned two dollars said ben with a merry twinkle in his eyes this was too much for his aunt to believe if supposing would make it so i should be very glad to suppose but it wont but its true aunt i cant believe it benjamin unless youve found the money somewhere and then you will have to return it no i earned it aunt jane and its mine fairly i am glad to hear it benjamin is there any chance to earn any more the same way i am afraid not aunt jane however ive done even better than i told you ive earned ten dollars this afternoon benjamin bradford said his aunt sharply do you expect me to believe such a foolish story as that ben laughed he was not surprised at his aunts incredulity he wouldnt have believed that morning that there was any chance of his making so much money i dont know as i blame you aunt jane but if you wont believe me perhaps youll believe your own eyes answered ben as he drew forth the two fivedollar bills from his pocket and showed them to mrs bradford are they good she asked suspiciously as good as gold aunt jane well not exactly as good as gold but as good as greenbacks anyway i cant understand it at all said mrs bradford in helpless bewilderment then ill tell you all about it said ben and he did so i shall have a high opinion of my legs from this time he concluded for they have earned ten dollars in quicker time than my hands can earn twentyfive cents even his aunt in spite of her despondent mood could not help being cheerful over such good fortune as that you see aunt jane that even if i dont earn anything for the next two weeks we shall be as well off as if i had been working at the factory all the time so dont worry any more till that time has passed you certainly have been very fortunate benjamin mrs bradford was forced to admit a copious rain is very apt to be followed by a protracted drought and i am sorry to say that this was the case with bens luck day after day he went about milltown seeking for employment and night after night he returned home disappointed and emptyhanded if it had depended only on himself his courage would still have kept up but his aunts dismal forebodings affected his spirits he did not find it quite so easy to wait and hope as he anticipated three weeks passed and ben was painfully sensible that there was but a dollar in the house they had just risen from the dinner table on the day when their fortunes were at so low an ebb when a knock was heard at the door a man of about thirtyfive mr jotham dobson was admitted mr dobson was a man with a brisk businesslike air wont you come in mr dobson asked ben who had answered the knock is your aunt at home inquired mr dobson bruskly yes sir then ill step in a minute as i want to see her on business what business can he possibly have thought ben i wish his business lay with me and that he wanted to employ me good morning mrs bradford said dobson rapidly no thank you i really havent the time to sit down i have a little business with you thats all perhaps he wants to get me to do some sewing thought mrs bradford but she was doomed to be disagreeably disappointed perhaps you are not aware of it said mr dobson but i am the city collector of taxes ive got your tax bill made out let me see here it is will it be convenient for you to pay it today how much is it faltered mrs bradford eleven dollars and eighty cents precisely answered the collector mrs bradford looked so doleful that ben felt called upon to reply we cant pay it this morning mr dobson he said really you had better make the effort said dobson you are aware that the tax is now due and that one per cent a month will be added for default thats twelve per cent a year pretty heavy what shall we do benjamin asked his aunt in a crushed tone wait and hope aunt jane my friends said mr dobson persuasively i really think youd better make the effort to pay now and so avoid the heavy interest perhaps said ben youll tell us how to pay without money you might borrow it all right i am willing mr dobson will you be kind enough to lend us twelve dollars to meet this bill mr dobsons face changed it always did when any one proposed to borrow money of him for he was what people called a close man i really couldnt do it he answered moneys very scarce with me particularly scarce its all i can do to pay my own taxes ben smiled to himself for he knew how the application would be answered then of course we cant pay at present he said weve tried to borrow and cant i didnt expect youd try to borrow of me the tax collector said dobson even if i had the money it would be very unprofessional of me to lend you the money it would be very unprofessional of us to pay you without money returned ben i suppose i must call again said the collector disappointed he was disappointed less for the city than for his own account for he received a percentage on taxes collected i suppose you must benjamin this is awful said mrs bradford piteously after mr dobson had retired what is going to become of us the city will sell the house for taxes theyll wait a year first at any rate aunt jane so we wont fret about it yet there are other things more pressing if we dont get some money within a day or two we must starve benjamin something may turn up this afternoon aunt jane wait and hope ben put on his hat and went out in spite of his cheerful answer he felt rather sober himself chapter vii ben gets employment when ben got out into the street he set himself to consider where he could apply for employment as far as he knew he had inquired at every store in milltown if a boy was wanted only to be answered in the negative sometimes kindly other times roughly at the factory too he had ascertained that there was no immediate prospect of his being taken on again its a hard case thought ben when a fellow wants to work and needs the money and can find no opening anywhere it was a hard case but ben was by no means the only one so situated it may be said of him at all events that he deserved to succeed for he left no stone unturned to procure employment perhaps he thought i can get a small job to do somewhere it would be better to earn a trifle than to be idle as this thought passed through bens mind he glanced into deacon sawyers yard the deacon was a near neighbor of his mother and was reputed rich though he lived in an oldfashioned house furnished in the plain manner of forty years back it was said that probably not fifty dollars worth of furniture had come into the house since the deacons marriage twoandforty years previous perhaps his tastes were plain but the uncharitable said that he was too fond of his money to part with it a couple of loads of wood were just being deposited in the deacons yard they were brought by a tenant of his who paid a part of his rent in that way when ben saw the wood a bright thought came to him perhaps i can get a chance to saw and split that wood he said to himself the deacon doesnt keep a man and he is too old to do it himself as ben did not mean to let any chance slip he instantly entered the yard by the gate and walking up to the front door rang the bell the bell had only been in place for a year the deacon had been contented with the old fashioned knocker and had reluctantly consented to the innovation of a bell and he still spoke of it as a newfangled nonsense nancy sawyer an oldmaid daughter of the deacon answered the bell good morning maam said ben politely good morning ben the deacons daughter responded hows your aunt today pretty well thank you will you come in i called on business said ben dont you want that wood sawed and split yes i suppose it ought to be said nancy do you want to do it yes said our hero im out of work and ready to do anything i can find to do are you used to sawing and splitting wood inquired nancy cautiously we had a boy once who broke our saw because he didnt understand how to use it you neednt be afraid of my meeting with such an accident said ben confidently i saw and split all our wood at home and have ever since i was twelve years old come in and speak to father said nancy i guess hell be willing to hire you she led the way into a very plain sitting room covered with a rag carpet where the deacon sat in a rocking chair reading an agricultural paper the only one he subscribed to his daughter whose literary tastes were less limited had tried to get him to subscribe for a magazine but he declined partly on account of the expense and partly because of the pictures of fashionably dressed ladies and he feared his daughter would become extravagant in dress deacon sawyer looked up as ben entered the room its ben bradford father said nancy for her fathers vision was impaired he aint come to borrow anything has he nancy asked the old man no he wants you to employ him to saw and split your wood dont you know im a sawyer myself said the deacon chuckling over a familiar joke ben laughed feeling that it was his policy to encourage what feeble glimmering of wit the deacon might indulge in thats your joke father said nancy youll have to get the wood sawed and split and you might as well employ ben i thought you was in the factory benjamin said the old man so i was but they cut down the number of hands some weeks ago and i had to leave among others how do you make a livin then inquired the deacon bluntly weve got along somehow said ben but if i dont get work soon i dont know what we shall do nancy said the deacon seems to me i can saw the wood myself it will save money no you cant father said nancy decidedly you are too old for that kind of work and you can afford to have it done you are a sensible woman even if you are homely thought ben though for obvious reasons he did not say it i dunno about that nancy said her father well i do said nancy peremptorily the fact is that she had a will of her own and ruled the deacon in many things but it must be admitted judiciously and with an eye to his welfare how much will you charge benjamin the deacon asked for sawing and splitting the whole lot how much is there of it asked ben two cords i dont know how much i ought to charge deacon sawyer i am willing to go ahead and do it and leave you to pay me what you think right thats right said the deacon in a tone of satisfaction you may go ahead and do it and ill do the right thing by you all right said ben cheerfully ill go right to work i am obliged to say that in this agreement ben was unbusinesslike there are some men with whom it will answer to make such contracts but it is generally wiser to have a definite understanding for the lack of this disputes often arise and mean men will take advantage when so fair an opportunity is afforded them after ben left the room nancy who was sensible and practical and by no means niggardly as her father said to him you ought to have named your terms ben then you would know just what you are earning i was afraid i might ask too much and lose the job now you may get too little even if i do i would rather be at work than be doing nothing thats the right way to feel said nancy approvingly i like to see a boy at your age industrious as to the terms i will try to make my father do you justice thank you maam can you tell me where you keep the saw and ax you will find them in the woodshed in the l part thank you how long do you expect the job will take you i should think two or three days but i have never undertaken such a large job of any kind before very well i didnt speak of it because there is any hurry about it you may not be in a hurry but i am thought ben for i want the money ben tackled the woodpile vigorously it was not a kind of work he was partial to but he was sensible enough to know that he must accept what work came in his way without regard to his own preferences he had been at work about an hour when he heard his name called from the street looking up he recognized james watson is that you ben asked james in some astonishment it is supposed to be dont i look natural asked ben smiling what are you doing dont you see i am sawing wood you dont mean you go around from house to house sawing wood why not i should think you would be too proud to do it i am not too proud to do any honest work that will put money in my pocket isnt it as respectable as working in the factory certainly not i am willing to work in the factory but i wouldnt go round sawing wood you can afford to be proud james but i cant we are almost out of money and i must do something i dont believe the deacon will give you much of anything he hasnt the reputation of being very generous i must take my chance at that i am sorry for it i wanted you to go fishing with me this afternoon i should like to go james but business before pleasure they say ben has not pride thought james as he went away disappointed but he was mistaken ben was proud in his way but he was not too proud to do honest work chapter viii deacon sawyers liberality about four oclock on the afternoon of the third day ben completed his job not only had he sawed and split the wood but carried it into the woodshed and piled it up neatly all ready for use he surveyed his work not without complacency the deacon cant find fault with that job he said to himself he ought to pay me a good price the shed opened out of the kitchen ben rubbed his feet carefully on the mat knowing that housekeepers had a prejudice against mud or dust and ascending a couple of steps entered the kitchen miss nancy was there superintending her help well miss nancy said ben ive finished the wood have you piled it up in the woodshed asked the lady yes wont you come and look at it nancy sawyer stepped into the shed and surveyed the wood approvingly youve done well she said and now i suppose you want your money it would be convenient admitted ben youll have to see father about that said nancy can i see him now asked ben a little anxiously for he knew that his aunts stock of money had dwindled to ten cents yes you may go right into the sittingroom this room was connected by a door with the kitchen wait a minute said nancy and she looked at ben in rather an embarrassed way ben paused with his hand on the latch waiting to hear what miss nancy had to say my father is very careful with his money she said he may not realize how much work there has been in sawing and splitting the wood he may not pay you what it is worth ben looked serious for he knew that he needed all he had earned what shall i do if he doesnt he asked i dont want you to dispute about it take what he gives you and then come to me i will make up what is lacking in one way or another thank you miss nancy you are very kind said ben i dont know about that said nancy i dont pretend to be very benevolent but i want to be just and in my opinion that is a good deal better now you may go in ben lifted the latch and entered the sittingroom he found that the deacon was not alone a gentleman of perhaps thirtyfive was with him i hope i am not intruding said ben politely but i have finished with the wood though deacon sawyer was a very close man he was always prompt in his payments so much must be said to his credit he never thought therefore of putting ben off i suppose you want to be paid benjamin he said yes sir i should like it if convenient to you lemme see benjamin how long has it taken you two days and a half sir not quite its only four oclock now have you just go through yes sir we didnt make no bargain did we no sir i left it to you quite right so you did now benjamin continued the deacon i want to do the fair thing by you two days and a half at twentyfive cents a day will make sixtytwo cents or we will say sixtythree will that do poor ben he had calculated on three times that sum at least that would only be a dollar and a half a week he said looking very much disappointed i used to work for that when i was young said the deacon at the factory i was paid five dollars a week said ben nobody of your age can earn as much as that said the deacon sharply no wonder manufacturin dont pay when such wages are paid what do you say mr manning continued the deacon appealing to the gentlemen with him mr mannings face wore an amused smile he lived in the city and his ideas on the subject of money and compensation were much less contracted than the deacons since you appeal to me he answered i venture to suggest that prices have gone up a good deal since you were a boy deacon sawyer and twentyfive cents wont go as far now as it did then you are right said the deacon it costs a sight for groceries nowadays well benjamin ill pay you a little more than i meant to heres a dollar and thats good pay for two days and a half ben took the money but for the life of him he couldnt thank the deacon very heartily he had been paid at the rate of forty cents a day which would amount to two dollars and forty cents a week for work considerably harder than he had done at the factory good afternoon he said briefly and reentered the kitchen nancy sawyer scanned his face closely as he closed the door of the sittingroom she was not surprised at his expression of disappointment well she inquired what did father pay you he wanted to pay me sixtythree cents answered ben with a touch of indignation in his tone twentyfive cents a day of course that was much too little what did he pay you a dollar how much were you expecting to get asked nancy in a businesslike tone i was hoping to get seventyfive cents a day that would be less than i got at the factory i think your work was worth that much myself said the spinster ben felt encouraged my father is getting old he forgets that money wont buy as much as it did in his younger days he means to be just then i dont think he succeeds very well thought ben i understand such things better proceeded miss nancy and i try to make up for fathers mistakes as far as i can now tell me what are you meaning to do with the money you received for this job i shall give it all to aunt jane answered ben you are a good boy said nancy approvingly and she will buy groceries with it i suppose yes miss nancy it is about all she has to depend upon just so now ben i will tell you what i will do father keeps me pretty close myself as far as money goes but we have plenty in the house of groceries and such things as your aunt will need to have now will it do just as well if i give you the balance that you have earned in that form it will do just as well miss nancy and i am very much obliged to you for your kindness i am not kind only just said nancy i dont think it honest to pay too little for work nor father either for that matter only he doesnt always set the right value on it maggie you may bring me the large covered basket in the back room upstairs maggie brought the basket at once and miss nancy went with it into the storeroom or buttery she tied up various parcels of sugar tea and flour and added two loaves of bread and a couple of pies quite filling the basket there she said i guess youll find a dollar and a halfs worth of articles here give my love to your aunt and tell her from me that they are not a gift but that you have fairly earned them thank you miss nancy said ben overjoyed at his good luck you may say you are not kind but i am sure you are miss nance was really pleased by this recognition of her attempt to do justice if its kindness she said you are very welcome do you find it hard to get along benjamin pretty hard since i have lost my place at the factory miss nancy tell your aunt said miss nancy significantly that if she ever want to borrow any flour or groceries to come to me thank you said ben gratefully and he felt sure that nance had a kind heart in spite of her prim and formal demeanor with a glad heart he carried home the basket and its contents brought great relief to mrs bradford who as she told ben was most out of everything chapter ix mr mannings proposal after supper ben sauntered slowly up the street it was a relief to him after his confinement during the day and there was always a chance to find something to do this was desirable for now that deacon sawyers woodpile was disposed of ben had no work engaged ben sauntered along as i have said until he found himself in front of the milltown hotel it was the only hotel in the town and though not large was able to accommodate all who had occasion to visit the town and were not otherwise provided i wonder if mr brockton this was the landlords name hasnt got something for me to do thought ben as this thought occurred to him he entered by the open door and stepped into the office mr brockton was not in but in an armchair at a window ben recognized mr manning the same gentleman whom he had seen two hours before at deacon sawyers the recognition was mutual mr manning removed his cigar from his lips and said with a smile your name is benjamin isnt it yes sir have you come to spend some of the money you received from my friend the deacon no sir it is all the money i have in the world and i must take good care of it wages dont seem to be very high in milltown remarked mr manning pleasantly and he smiled again not for sawing and splitting wood sir they pay very well in the factory were you ever employed in the factory yes sir how did you happen to lose your place inquired mr manning searchingly it was the dull times sir they discharged quite a number and as i was one of the latest on of course i was among the first to go you dont complain of that do you no sir but at the same time it was unlucky for me still it wasnt as bad as if you were a man with a family to support i have a family to support sir you have repeated mr manning a little surprised you are rather young to have a family he added with a smile ben laughed i am not married yet if thats what you mean he said but i have an aunt and cousin to take care of and you find it hard work eh yes sir tell me about it here sit down next to me and tell me how you are situated mr manning had a sympathetic tone which invited confidence so ben followed his directions and confided to him all his perplexities we got along well enough he concluded as long as i kept my place at the factory five dollars a week went a good way with us besides my aunt made about two dollars a week sewing is she making that now no sir even that kind of business is getting dull last week she made a dollar and a quarter that isnt much no sir but every little helps you are right there we must not despise small earnings such as you made in the deacons employ i got paid better than you think sir said ben miss nancy made it up to me did she i am glad to hear it she is a good woman she understands better than her father the proper price of work yes sir are you any relative to deacon sawyer no said mr manning but i have had a little business transaction with the deacon hes pretty close in money matters so people say here sir but i must do him justice and add that you can rely implicitly upon his word well ben what are your plans only to find work of any kind sir how happened you to come to the hotel here i thought mr brockton might possibly have something for me to do sawing wood perhaps yes sir or anything else that is honest you are a good industrious boy said mr manning approvingly you deserve to succeed this approval encouraged ben thank you sir he said perhaps i may some time have it in my power to help you i hope you may sir at any rate i thank you for mentioning it mr manning paused a moment he appeared to be in thought as he remained silent ben concluded that the interview was at an end he rose from his seat and was about to bid mr manning good evening when the latter said are you particularly engaged for the next hour ben no sir ben answered rather surprised then suppose we take a walk i am alone here and would like your company thank you sir said our hero feeling flattered at the value set upon his society by a gentleman from new york for he had ascertained that mr manning was a member of a business firm in the great city they left the hotel mr manning lighting a fresh cigar i wont offer you a cigar ben he said for i dont think it well for boys of your age to smoke i never smoked in my life said ben but i presume you know some boys that do oh yes plenty of them it is a bad thing for them impoverishing the blood and often checking the growth i am glad you have not contracted the habit suppose we walk by your house all right sir you wont find it very large or elegant but is it comfortable oh yes sir what kind of woman is your aunt you may think it an odd question but i have my reasons for asking she is an excellent woman said ben she has only one fault what is that she gets discouraged too easily as now for instance yes sir she predicts that we shall all be in the poorhouse inside a month what do you think about it my motto is wait and hope a very good one but i can give you a better what is that sir work and hope oh i mean that too there isnt much use in waiting if you dont work too i see we agree pretty well on that point that is our house said ben pointing out the cottage where his aunt lived it was small but everything about it was neat and attractive how many are there in your family asked mr manning again my aunt and my little cousin tony how old is he seven years old you wonder perhaps why i ask so many questions said mr manning i will tell you by the death of an intimate friend i have become guardian to a little girl about five years old she is at present in the city but i think she will be better off in the country now do you think your aunt would take charge of such a child for a fair price of course it might pay her better than sewing i think she would said ben but would you be satisfied with our humble way of living i dont wish the child to live on rich food good bread and butter and plenty of milk are better in my opinion than rich meats she could have as much of those as she wanted and your little cousin would be company for her yes sir he would like it very much he feels lonely when i am away then as to the terms i think i should be willing to pay seven dollars a week seven dollars a week for a little girls board exclaimed ben astonished well not exactly for the board alone there will be considerable care i could get her boarded for half that but her father left considerable property and i prefer to pay a generous price do you think she will consent to take the child yes sir and think herself very lucky too wont you come in and speak to her about it no you may speak to her about it and i will call in the morning and settle the details of the arrangement and now good night good night sir what splendid luck thought ben aunt jane will hardly believe it didnt i tell her to wait and hope and he entered the house chapter x bens journey ben looked so cheerful and smiling that tony asked have you got work ben not yet tony mrs bradford shook her head rather despondently we might as well go to the poorhouse first as last she said i dont think we had better go at all aunt jane said ben you cant find anything to do not yet but i expect to some time and what are we going to do till then i mean to fall back upon you aunt jane i think you will be able to keep us from starving i dont know what you mean benjamin i am sure i am willing to work but last week i only earned a dollar and a quarter and i dont feel sure of even doing that i have got a plan for you aunt jane what is it you might take a boarder who would come to board with me perhaps i can find you a boarder besides any one that could pay a fair price would expect better living than we could afford i dont think you will find that trouble with the boarder i have engaged for you what do you mean benjamin asked mrs bradford in surprise what would you say to boarding and taking care of a little girl of five do you know of any such little girl yes what would her friends be willing to pay seven dollars a week this was about twice as much as mrs bradford expected and she looked incredulous i dont believe any one would pay such a price she said upon this ben gave his aunt full particulars and her usually sober face brightened up at the prospect of thus maintaining their home i can hardly believe it she said this mr manning must be very liberal the money doesnt come from him he says the little girl has property and can afford to pay well he is coming round tomorrow morning to learn whether you will take her wont you take her mother pleaded tony i shall be very glad of the chance said mrs bradford it will make us very comfortable still aunt jane if you would really prefer going to the poorhouse said ben his eyes twinkling i will go round and see if you can get in never mind benjamin said his aunt cheerfully i prefer to keep out of that place as long as i can would you like to have a little girl to play with tony asked ben itll be bully said tony where did you learn that word tony inquired his mother shocked it isnt swearing is it mother no but it is not refined im too young to be refined mother but where did you learn it tony ben smiled tony dont want to expose me aunt jane he said i suppose he learned it of me it isnt a bad word i never used it said mrs bradford primly no i should think not said ben laughing i cant image you calling anything bully it isnt a ladys word you know aunt boys cant always use gotomeetin words they want to be free and easy sometimes here the discussion was dropped and the evening was passed cheerfully the next morning mr manning called admitted into the little cottage he glanced quickly about him and was pleased to find that though the furniture was plain there was evidences of neatness mrs bradford too in spite of her tendency to low spirits impressed him favorable as likely to be kind and judicious but perhaps what influenced him as much as anything was the presence of tony for he held that a child companion would be very desirable for his young ward he repeated the offer of seven dollars a week i am afraid it will hardly be worth that mr manning though it will be very welcome to us said mrs bradford i prefer to pay liberally since the property left to my young charge is ample besides she will be more or less care i shall have to trouble you to provide the little girl with suitable attire charging of course all outlays to me i shall be very glad to do so mr manning when do you wish the child to come as soon as possible will you bring her yourself there will be some difficulty about that answered mr manning hesitatingly i cant leave my business where is she may i ask in new york cant i go for her asked ben eagerly why benjamin expostulated his aunt you have never traveled i wouldnt trust you by yourself much less with the care of a child mr manning smiled but ben was annoyed why aunt jane you must think me a baby he said i guess i can take care of myself i wouldnt dare to go to new york myself alone said his aunt oh thats different said ben youre a woman and of course you couldnt take care of yourself and you are a man i suppose said mr manning amused i shall be some time and aunt jane never will returned ben i think mrs bradford said mr manning that your nephew is right in that seriously i am inclined to favor the plan do you really think benjamin can be trusted mr manning i really do he has never been away from home i think he has plenty of selfreliance and will quickly learn what little is needed about traveling i am willing to trust him thank you sir said ben much gratified feeling a high respect for mr mannings judgment can you get him ready to go with me by the twelveoclock train asked mr manning twelve oclock ejaculated mrs bradford startled why its nine now well aunt cant i change my clothes in three hours asked ben impatiently but to go on such a journey it seems so sudden i dont think there will be any trouble in getting ready said mr manning to whom the journey to new york seemed like a mere trifle though it was nearly six hundred miles away of course he continued i shall pay his expenses and and here he hesitated a little from motives of delicacy allow me to pay two weeks board in advance you may have occasion to use the money thank you sir said mrs bradford gratefully it did indeed relieve her from anxious embarrassment for her purse was very low and if ben were gone any length of time she would have been in a dilemma i think we have settled all that is needful said mr manning rising to go if anything else occurs to me i will either tell ben or write to you good morning mrs bradford good morning sir turning to ben mr manning said ben let me see you at the hotel as early as halfpast eleven ill be on hand sir said ben ill get there earlier if you say so just as you like when you come call for me yes sir it doesnt seem as if you were going away ben said tony i cant hardly realize it myself tony its a great responsibility benjamin said his aunt beginning to look serious suppose the cars run off the track i guess they wont aunt jane i was reading of an accident out west only yesterday i am not going out west aunt jane i guess ill reach new york right side up with care what an expression benjamin ben laughed only boys talk aunty it means all right dont you go on the steamboat too benjamin i guess so the boiler may explode if everybody thought that nobody would travel aunt jane it doesnt happen once in a thousand times at last ben got ready he was very much excited but his excitement was of a pleasurable kind one his way to the hotel he met james watson where ware you going all dressed up ben going to new york answered ben proudly youre only foolin no im not im going to new york by the twelveoclock train what for asked james astonished to escort a lady home answered ben she wants an ablebodied escort thats used to traveling james was very much surprised and also a little incredulous but he was finally convinced that benn was in earnest i wish i were in your shoes he said enviously theres nothing id like better than going to new york youre a lucky boy ben quite agreed with him chapter xi in new york of the journey to new york i do not purpose to speak ben enjoyed it extremely for it gave him his first view of the great world as he whirled by town after town and city after city and reflected how small after all was the distance on the map between milltown and new york he got a new idea of the size of the world what are you thinking about ben asked mr manning observing that our hero looked thoughtful i was thinking how large the world is sir didnt you ever think of that before no sir i have always lived in milltown i dont think i was ever ten miles from home before then your ideas were necessarily contracted one advantage of travel is that it broadens our views not only as regards distance but also of men and things ben assented though he did not fully understand his companions statement from time to time ben asked questions of mr manning but after a while that gentlemen met a friend on the cars and ben was left pretty much to himself they did not reach new york till midnight i will take you to my boardinghouse tonight ben said his companion tomorrow we will talk over our plans a hansom conveyed them to a house in an uptown street where mr manning boarded of course ben could not at that hour see much of the great city which he was visiting for the first time besides he was quite fatigued and felt more like closing his eyes in sleep than using them mr mannings rooms were very comfortable and even luxurious ben slept soundly till his companion waked him up come ben its eight oclock and the breakfast bell is ringing havent you had sleep enough the sun was shining bright in at the window and the noise of carriages could be heard in the street beneath ben looked about him in momentary bewilderment dont you know where you are asked mr manning smiling yes i am in new york said ben his face brightening up ill be dressed in less than no time he exclaimed leaping out of bed and setting to work energetically if you keep your promise i certainly cant complain said mr manning shall we be late to breakfast asked ben with some anxiety there will be others later so you feel hungry do you uncommonly hungry said ben i guess its travelling that gives me an appetite what a nice place you live in mr manning its very handy having water come out of pipes how do they do it ill explain to you some time when we are not in such a hurry all right sir ben was soon dressed and went down to breakfast with his new patron there was quite a difference between the appearance of the table at this fashionable boarding house and their plain breakfast table at home but ben was one who easily adapted himself to new circumstances and did not display any greenness now ben said mr manning as they rose from the table i suppose you are not in a very great hurry to go home no sir you would like to see a little of the city yes sir very much i think day after tomorrow will be early enough to go back you write a line to your aunt so that she need not feel anxious thank you sir where is the little girl she is temporarily staying at the house of a married sister of mine my sister is rather an invalid or she might keep her permanently i shall not have time to go round and introduce you today for my business will occupy me closely where shall i go sir asked ben wherever you like you can wander round the city and see whatever pleases you only be back a little before six oclock for that is our dinner hour dinner at six repeated ben astonished for he had always been accustomed to dine at twelve when do you take supper we dont sup at all that is not regularly in the middle of the day we take lunch you can go into some restaurant and buy lunch yes sir oh by the by have you got any money asked mr manning a little answered ben how much ben produced thirtyseven cents in change that is rather short allowance said mr manning here take this he handed him a twodollar bill i dont need so much mr manning said ben but two dollars were not so much in the eyes of his patron as in his i dare say you can find a use for it he said smiling thank you sir well good morning or perhaps it will be as well for you to accompany me as far as broadway there i shall take a car and you can saunter along as you please a brief walk brought them to broadway and then they separated ben wandered down broadway amused at the sight until he same to twentythird street where he stopped ben look at it with admiration he had never seen such structures nor dreamed of their existence new yorks a splendid city he said to himself as he was looking about him some one addressed him what are you looking at johnny my name isnt johnny answered ben turning toward the boy who had accosted him the boy puffed out his cheeks and whistled when did you come from the country he asked why are you so anxious to know inquired ben who saw that the other was making game of him and was not overwell pleased why you see barnum has offered twentyfive cents for a country greenhorn and i guess youll do said the boy with his tongue in his cheek ben was irritated at first but he concluded to take it as a joke i am not for sale at that price he said adding good humoredly i am green i suppose this is my first visit to the city can you tell me the name of that building thats the imperial hotel have you got a cigarette to spare no said ben i dont smoke then you aint civilized said the boy ive smoked for five years you have exclaimed ben amazed why you dont look any older than i am im sixteen and im not quite fifteen ben noticed that the boy had none of the youthful bloom which mantled his own cheeks he was already paying the penalty of his early use of tobacco youre a big boy of your age said the city boy ben thought that the other was small for his age but he did not say so look here johnny said the new york boy my name is ben whats the odds well ben if youll give me a quarter ill go round and show you some of the sights what do you say ben hesitated it seemed to him a little extravagant at the same time his curiosity was aroused and he finally agreed to the proposal when he returned to his home in the country he felt that he should like to be able to tell his companions something of the city he had visited give me five cents in advance said the newly engaged guide what for asked ben cautiously i want to get some cigarettes ben complied with his request the boy darted into a small cigar store and soon emerged with a cigarette in his mouth at which he puffed with evident pleasure wont you try one he asked i guess not said ben come along then you ask any questions about what you see and ill answer whats that field its a common isnt it asked ben pointing to a park after they walked down broadway for a few blocks oh thats madison park but weve got a good deal bigger park than that uptown central park thats the name of it is it far off about two miles do you want to go there no id rather see the streets and the nice buildings i can see plenty of fields at home are you going to stay long in the city asked tom for this ben learned was the name of his companion only a day or two i want to see as much as i can while i am here they walked down broadway tom pointing out the prominent buildings and answering the numerous questions asked by ben on the whole he proved to be a very good investment in the way of a guide being wellinformed on the subjects about which ben inquired when they reached the astor house tom said i guess youve got a quarters worth out of me if you want me any longer you must give me another quarter i cant afford it said ben i guess i can get round by myself now so tom left him with scant ceremony and ben sat down on a bench in city hall park to rest chapter xii an adventure presently a young man rather showily dressed sat down beside ben he glanced sharply at our hero but did not immediately address him finally he said fine day my young friend yes sir very fine returned ben politely i suppose you live in the city no sir i am here only on a visit said ben rather flattered by the supposition i dont look so green after all he thought so am i said the other i live in philadelphia i am from the country said ben indeed you have lived in the city some time have you not no sir i am surprised to hear it you have the appearance of a city boy ben was not inaccessible to flattery it was not surprising that he regarded the young man from philadelphia with favor have you dined inquired the stranger not yet said ben i dont know where to find a restaurant say no more about it my young friend i shall be glad to have you dine with me i know a good place quite near by you are very kind said ben considering that i am a stranger i have a young cousin who resembles you very closely i suppose that is why i cannot regard you as a stranger by the way what is your name ben bradford singular coincidence my cousin is named benjamin my name is john smithson well ben if you will allow me the familiarity suppose we go to dinner thank you mr smithson ben followed his new acquaintance to a moderatelypriced restaurant in fulton street it was the first time he had ever been to an eatinghouse and looked with interest at the numerous tables smithson and he took seats at a small table opposite each other and the former began to inspect the bill of fare i hope you have a good appetite my young friend he said so that you may do justice to my hospitality city people seem to be very kind thought ben no one in milltown would pay me such attention finally he made his selection and so did smithson at the end of halfanhour the dinner was concluded smithson looked at the checks sixty cents and seventyfive cents he said that makes a dollar and thirtyfive cents yes sir i have go to step out a minute said smithson oblige me by paying at the desk out of this bill as he spoke he handed ben a fivedollar bill but said ben there will be nearly four dollars left meet me an hour hence at the place where we were seated and hand me the balance of the money but said ben i might miss you havent you better pay yourself as you go out i am in a great hurry to meet an engagement said smithson suppose i shouldnt meet you suppose i should keep the money no fear you look honest well meet me in an hour and he hurried out of the restaurant saying with a nod to the cashier the boy will pay here was another compliment ben thought a perfect stranger had trusted him with three dollars and sixtyfive cents which he might readily make off with i am glad i look honest thought ben i seem to be treated very well two minutes later he went up to the cashiers desk and laying down the two checks extended the fivedollar bill the cashier was about to make change when his attention seemed to be drawn to the bill he held it up and scrutinized it very closely considerably to bens surprise young man said he suspiciously where did you get this bill from the man that came in with me answered ben are you aware that this is a bad bill asked the cashier sharply a bad bill exclaimed ben in genuine surprise no i had no idea of it who is this man who gave it to you do you know him he said his name was smithson from philadelphia i never saw him before this morning what were you to do with the change i gave you back did he tell you to keep it no sir i was to meet him in the park in an hour and give it to him he has been making a catspaw of you i dont understand said ben knowing the bill to be bad he did not venture to offer it himself as it would make him liable to arrest arrest exclaimed ben in dismay yes one who knowingly offers a counterfeit bill is liable to arrest and imprisonment i hope you dont think i knew anything about it said ben alarmed no you look too honest to be a confederate of a scoundrel he ought to be ashamed of himself to impose upon me said ben indignantly what shall i do have you any other money ben produced a twodollar bill i will take pay out of this for your share of the dinner and with your help i propose to arrest your companion the cashier briefly explained his plan a policeman was summoned and ben was instructed to meet smithson at the time appointed and tender him the change he did so smithson looked up eagerly as ben approached have you got the change he asked yes said ben give it to me ben drew fro his vestpocket three dollars and sixtyfive cents with which he had been provided and tendered them to the young man who eagerly took them much obliged said smithson looking elated at the supposed success of his plan just then a quietlooking man a detective in citizens clothes stepped up and laid his hand on the swindlers arm mr smithson i want you what for inquired smithson turning pale for passing a counterfeit bill i have passed no counterfeit faltered smithson you employed this boy to do it for you theres some mistake said smithson stammering you cant prove anything with this boys help we can dont trouble yourself to invent excuses you have been suspected for some time the boy lies said smithson fiercely if he does it will be found out come along with me much against his will smithson walked arminarm with the detective ben was notified to be in attendance at court the next morning at ten oclock to testify against his new friend i am more of a greenhorn than i thought ben said to himself who would have thought such a polite young man was a counterfeiter about four oclock ben went uptown to mr mannings boardinghouse and remained there till the merchant arrived chapter xiii a curious old lady the next morning mr manning introduced ben to his temporary ward a bright attractive little girl who seemed to take an instant fancy to our hero is he my brother she inquired of mr manning he is going to be your brother if you like was the smiling reply i am glad of it said the little girl putting her hand confidingly in bens ben was not much used to girls never having had a sister but it occurred to him that he should find it very pleasant to have emma in the house are you willing to leave the city and go home with your new brother asked mr manning yes said emma promptly when are we going this afternoon you will sail on a big boat and then ride on the cars shall you like that ever so much said emma clapping her hands you will take care of me wont you appealing to ben oh yes ill take care of you said ben manfully i think you had better go to boston on the fall river line said mr manning that will give you nearly all night on the boat and you can have a comfortable nights rest indeed i think you may as well remain on board till the halfpastsix train starts that will get you into boston about nine oclock in time for a late breakfast what time can you go to milltown there is a train at halfpast ten that will answer very well now if you will come downtown with me i will engage passage for you ben accompanied mr manning to the office of the steamers and passage tickets were obtained and paid for at four oclock ben and his young charge were seated in the showy cabin of the immense sound steamer which plies between new york and fall river as the two were chatting an old lady evidently from the country looked attentively at them she was old and wrinkled and from time to time took a pinch of snuff from a large snuffbox which she took from the pocket of her dress what is your name little gal she inquired at last emma answered the child come and kiss me said the old lady emma surveyed the old lady critically and answered bluntly i dont want to come and kiss me and ill give you the first cent i find on the currant bushes said the old lady coaxingly i dont want to answered emma again why dont you want to asked the old lady with a wintery smile cause youre old and ugly and put snuff up your nose answered emma who had not yet learned that the truth is not to be spoken at all times the old lady gasped with wrath and amazement well i never did she exclaimed yes you did said emma understanding her to say that she never took snuff i saw you do it a minute ago you are a bad wicked little gal said the old lady in high displeasure youre spoiled child no i aint said emma angry in turn dont you let her call me names she added speaking to ben ben found it difficult not to laugh at the old ladys discomfiture but he felt called upon to apologize for his young charge i hope youll excuse her maam he said shes only a little girl how old is she asked the old lady abruptly five years old then shed orter know better than to sass her elders said the old lady snappishly shes badly brung up is she your sister no maam is she any kin to you no im her guardian the old lady adjusted her spectacles and surveyed ben from head to foot in a scrutinizing manner sho said she why youre a child yourself im fifteen returned ben with dignity you dont mean to say you have the care of the little gal at present i have aint nobody else travelin with you no maam where are you goin to milltown wheres that in massachusetts is she goin to board with your folks yes maam id like to have charge of her for a month id make a different gal of her i wouldnt go with you said emma if you was bad id whip you so you couldnt stand said the old lady her eyes snapping ive got a granddarter about as big as you but she wouldnt dare to sass me the way you have im glad you aint my grandmother said emma i dont want a dirty grandmother like you you mustnt talk so emma said ben thinking it time to interfere talkin wont do no good she ought to be whipped said the old lady shaking her head and scowling at emma dont you want to go on deck and see the steamer start asked ben as the only means of putting a stop to the irrepressible conflict between the old lady and his charge oh yes let us go up so they went on deck where emma was not a little interested at the varied sights that met her eye did you ever see such an ugly old woman ben asked emma when they had reached the top of the stairs hush emma you must be more particular about what you say you shouldnt have said anything about her taking snuff but she does take it insisted the little girl i saw her put it up her nose that is nothing to us she has a right to take it if she wants to but she wanted me to kiss her you wouldnt want to kiss her ben would you no i dont think i should answered ben with an involuntary grimace you were right in refusing that soon after the boat started they went down to the supperroom and got some supper mr manning having supplied ben with sufficient funds to travel in a liberal manner just opposite them at the table sat the old lady who shook her head frowningly at the freespoken young lady ben was amused in watching her i say you sir she said addressing the waiter bring me some tea and toast and be quick about it for i aint had anything to eat since breakfast and feel kinder gone at the stomach please write your order maam on this paper said the waiter whats the use of writin it cant you remember yes but the bill has to be footed up at the desk well i cant write it for i aint got my specs about me madam i shall be happy to write for you said ben politely im obleeged to you i wish you would she said what shall i put down how much is a cup of tea ten cents its awful high it dont cost em moren three cents shall i put it down yes i must have it how much do they charge for toast dry toast ten cents thats awful high too why you can git ten slices off a fivecent loaf and they only bring you two or three it costs a sight to travel cream toast twenty cents said ben mischievously what is the world comin to exclaimed the old lady twenty cents for cream toast like as not its skimmilk well i guess you may put down dry toast shall i put down anything else asked ben how much do they charge for beefsteak inquired the old lady fifty cents its wicked shame she exclaimed indignantly theyre a set of robbers and ive a good mind to tell em so you sir to the waiter who came up at that moment what do you mean by askin such shameful prices for your vittles i havent anything to do with the prices maam i need some meat said the old lady sternly but i wont buy any i wont encourage you in your shameful swindlin ill bear up as well as i can till i get home though like as not i shall be faint the waiter took the written order and brought the old ladys tea and toast ben ordered some steak and finding that more was brought than he needed offered a piece to the old lady shant i rob you asked the old lady looking at the meat covetously not at all maam ive taken all i want then i dont keer if i do take a piece i feel kinder faint and meat goes to the right spot but i wasnt going to pay any of their shameful prices the old lady ate the meat with evident relish and an expression satisfaction which arose partly from the reflection that she was gratifying her appetite without expense she even regarded emma with a softened expression saying i forgive you little gal for what you said to me you dont know no better you must try to behave like the boy thats with you hes a real polite boy so he is said emma i like him ever so much luckily she added nothing to kindle the old ladys resentment and they rose from the table on good terms chapter xiv prof crane the phrenologist after supper ben and his young charge took their seats in the main salon the passengers were grouped about the tables many of them reading the new york evening papers among them ben observed a tall man wearing a full beard and attired in a suit of rather rusty black who presently sat down beside him from his appearance ben fancied that he might be a clergyman or a missionary my young friend said the stranger at length are you traveling to boston yes sir ahem do you live in boston no sir i live in milltown a manufacturing town did you ever have your head examined ben stared at the questioner in surprise what should i have my head examined for he asked i see you dont understand me said the gentlemen of clerical appearance i am a phrenologist oh yes i understand said ben i lecture on phrenology and examine heads describing the character and prominent traits of my subjects on phrenological principles for instance i can readily tell by the help of my science your leading tendencies and in what career you would be most likely to meet with success i would like to know that myself said ben becoming interested my terms for an ordinary examination are twentyfive cents for a written description i charge a dollar if i had plenty of money said ben i wouldnt mind getting a written description a dollar spent that way may save you hundreds of dollars nay perhaps thousands said the phrenologist insinuatingly ben shook his head i havent any money to spare he said i have some money but it was given to me to pay traveling expenses surely you can spare twentyfive cents said the phrenologist you can remember what i say and write it down yourself afterward so i can said ben i guess i can afford a quarter but where can we go stay here said prof crane for this was his selfchosen designation it will probably bring me other customers i dont know said ben looking about him doubtfully i dont think i should like to have all these people hear about me you need not be afraid you have a very good heard besides it is no more public than at my lectures all right then move your chair forward a little there that is right prof crane arose and assumed the attitude of a speaker ladies and gentlemen he commenced after clearing his throat the gentlemen in the saloon looked up from their newspapers in some surprise at this unexpected interruption ladies and gentlemen i am prof crane the phrenologist i trust you will pardon the interruption if i publically examine the head of this young man and describe his character as indicated by his phrenological development go on said a stout gentlemen opposite it will help to pass the time thank you sir i trust that what i may say will not only help to pass the time but lead you to reflect seriously upon the great importance of this science and its claims upon your attention all eyes were turned upon ben who bore the ordeal very well this lad has an excellent head all the organs are well balanced none being in great excess his temperament is nervoussanguine hope predominates with him he will not be easily discouraged but when he has an object in view he will pursue it perseveringly to the end he is not quarrelsome but will not allow himself to be trodden upon he has plenty of courage he is not bashful but respectful to his elders and superiors he is conscientious and more likely to do right than wrong of course he might yield to temptation but it would have to be a powerful one he has a fondness for pets and will be kind to younger children he will find no pleasure in illtreating or tyrannizing over them he has not much invention and would make a poor machinist but is likely to succeed in general business he will probably be steady and reliable and faithful to the interests of his employer this was the substance of prof cranes description of our hero ben listened with satisfaction feeling that it was a very good character indeed he was sorry that some business man could not hear it as it might lead him to offer him employment when the examination was over ben tendered the professor twentyfive cents in payment now said the professor looking around him is there any other lady or gentleman whose head i can examine for the small sum of twentyfive cents my usual terms are fifty cents but as i am traveling and this is out of office hours i dont mind reducing the price for this occasion among those present was a rustic couple who appeared to be on a wedding trip the bridegroom was dressed in a full suit of blue cloth the coat being decorated with brass buttons while the bride was resplendent in a dress brilliant in color and with large figures sally said the young husband i want you to have your head examined it only costs a quarter oh jonathan how can i before all them folks said sally bashfully suppose he should say something bad about me if he does ill bust his head said jonathan he cant say nothin but whats good about you sally all right jonathan just as you say my wife will have her head examined said jonathan with a proud glance at his radiant bride please sit here madam said the professor now i will trouble you to remove your bonnet dont tumble up my hair said sally solicitously that will not be necessary said prof crane this lady has a very harmonious head whats that inquired sally in a low voice of jonathan who stood at her side something good i reckon whispered her husband she has those sweet domestic virtues which fit the possessor to adorn the family circle and lend a luster to the home how nice he talks murmured sally in a tone of gratification yes sally hes smart said jonathan and can read you like a book this lady has a great taste for music she would be like to excel as a musician am i right sir i guess you are said jonathan youd ought to hear her sing in the choir to hum shes got a powerful voice sally has she can almost raise the rafters of the old meetinhouse you see ladies and gentlemen that the husband of the lady confirms what i say of her phrenology never errs a phrenologist is never mistaken in character nature has stamped her impress upon each one of us and declares unmistakably what we are go ahead professor said jonathan impatiently the lady has a taste for strong and decided colors what is showy attracts her admiration thats so commented jonathan she has a good deal of firmness and likes to have her own way as most of use do added the professor still she would yield to strong persuasion it will be unnecessary to go farther in the examination which proved quite satisfactory to the young couple and a source of amusement to the rest of the passengers jonathan next submitted himself to the professors skill and was highly delighted in being told that he was fitted to shine in public life and might hereafter become a member of congress i guess the folks at home will think more of me when they hear that he remarked to sally the professor has given us good characters so he has do you think its all true jonathan of course it is its a wonderful science sally i didnt know i had so many bumps nor i i cant feel em myself thats because youre not used to it it takes the professor to do it other subjects were forthcoming and the professor cleared three dollars during the evening he understood human nature well enough to flatter all without absolutely contradicting the science of which he claimed to be the exponent chapter xv an old convert to phrenology about eleven oclock the steamer stopped a dense fog had sprung up which made it perilous to proceed ben who was a novice in traveling got up to see what was the matter he was on his way back to the stateroom when he encountered a strange figure the old lady was wandering about in dishabille looking thoroughly alarmed recognizing ben she clutched his arm what has happened she asked in a hollow voice is the ship sinkin no maam answered ben we have only stopped on account of the fog something may run into us exclaimed the old lady oh dear i wish i had never left home youd better go back to bed said ben soothingly theres no danger no i wont said the old woman resolutely im not going to be drowned in my bed ill stay here till mornin and she plumped down into an armchair where she looked like an image of despair hadnt you better put on something more suggested ben you may get cold ill put on my shawl and bunnit said the old lady i cant sleep a wink we shall be shipwrecked i know we shall whether the old lady kept her word or not ben did not know when he entered the saloon the next morning she was already up and dressed looking haggard from want of sleep ben ascertained that the boat had started again about five oclock and would probably reach fall river five or six hours late this would make it necessary to take breakfast on board he imparted the news to the old lady its a shame she said indignantly they did it a purpose to make us spend more money i expected to eat breakfast at my sons house in boston we shall not probably reach boston till noon i hear then suppose ill have to buy somethin to stay my stomach its a shame it costs a sight to travel so it does acquiesced ben theyd oughter give us our breakfast im afraid they wont see it in that light the old lady went down to breakfast and grudgingly paid out twenty cents more for tea and toast she was in hopes ben would get some meat and offer her a portion but he too felt the necessity of being economical and ordered something less expensive prof crane attempted to renew his phrenological examinations but could only obtain two subjects shant i examine your head he asked insinuatingly of the old lady no you shant she answered tartly i dont want you pawing over me dont you want me to describe your character no i dont like as not youd slander me oh no maam i should only indicate by an examination of your bumps your various tendencies and proclivities i dont believe ive got any bumps oh yes you have we all have them i shall only ask you twentyfive cents for an examination i wont give it said the old lady resolutely clutching her purse as if she feared a violent effort to dispossess her of it i cant afford it it is a very small sum to pay for the knowledge of yourself i guess i know myself better than you do said the old lady nodding her head vigorously then yielding to an impulse of curiosity say mister is it a pretty good business examinin heads it ought to be answered the professor if the world were thoroughly alive to the importance of the noble science of phrenology i dont see what use it is let me tell you then maam you have doubtless employed servants that proved unworthy of your confidence the old lady assented now if you had employed a phrenologist to examine a servants head before engaging her he would have told you at once whether she was likely to prove honest and faithful or the reverse you dont say exclaimed the old lady beginning to be impressed well that would be something i declare now theres mirandy jones used to work for me im almost certain she stole one of my best caps to wear herself asked ben demurely no she wanted it for her grandmother im almost sure i saw it on the old womans head at the sewin circle one afternoon then again there was susan thompson she was the laziest sleepiest gal i ever see why one day i went into the kitchen and what do you think there she stood in the middle of the floor leanin her head over her broom fast asleep in both these cases phrenology would have enabled you to understand their deficiencies and saved you from hiring them here a gentlemen whispered to prof crane offer to examine the old womans head for nothing i will see you are paid the professor was not slow in taking the hint madam said he as my time just now isnt particularly valuable i dont mind examining your head for nothing will you said the old lady well youre very polite and oblegin you may if you want to prof crane understood that a joke was intended and shaped his remarks accordingly this lady he commenced is distinguished for her amiable disposition here there was a smile visible on several faces which luckily the old lady didnt see at the same time she is always ready to stand up for her rights and will not submit to be imposed upon youre right there mister interjected the old lady as my soninlaw will testify he tried to put upon me but i soon let him know that i knew what was right and meant to have it my subject has a good taste for music and would have been a superior performer if her talent had been cultivated but her practical views would hardly have permitted her to spend much time in what is merely ornamental she is a good housekeeper and i may venture to remark that she understands cooking thoroughly the old lady so potent is flattery really began to look amiable i wish old miss smith could hear you she interrupted shes a vain conceited critter and purtends she can cook better than i can if i couldnt make better pies that she had the last time the sewin circle met at her house id give up cookin thats all you see gentlemen and ladies said the professor looking about him gravely how correct are the inductions of science all that i have said thus far has been confirmed by my subject who surely ought to know whether i am correct or not this lady he proceeded is fitted to shine in society her social sphere may have been limited by circumstances but had her lot been cast in the shining circles of fashion her natural grace and refinement would have enabled her to embellish any position to which she might have been called the contrast between the old ladys appearance and the words of prof crane was so ludicrous that ben and several others with difficulty kept their countenances but the old lady listened with great complacency i wish my granddarter would hear you she said shes a pert little thing that thinks she knows more than her grandmother ive often told my darter she ought to be more strict with her but it dont do no good its the way with the young madam they cannot appreciate the sterling qualities of their elders when the examination was concluded the old lady expressed her faith in phrenology i never did believe int before she admitted but the man described me just as if he knowd me all my life railly its wonderful prof crane got his money and with it the favor of the old lady to whom he had given such a firstclass character her only regret was that her friends at home could not have heard him about one oclock in the afternoon the long journey was at an end and ben and his young charge descended from the train in the south terminal in boston chapter xvi bens loss it has already been mentioned that there was a train to milltown at halfpast ten in the morning of course ben was too late for this he ascertained however that there was another train at five oclock and this he resolved to take where are we going ben asked emma as they stepped out of the station dont you feel hungry emma yes then we will go and have some dinner first of all this proposal was satisfactory to the little girl who took bens hand and walked up toward washington street with him on school street they found an eatinghouse which did not appear too high in price and ben led emma in they seated themselves at a table and ordered dinner just opposite sat a pleasantlooking man of middle age he was fond of children and his attention was drawn to little emma is that your sister he inquired of ben no sir answered ben no relation no sir she is from new york she is going to board with my aunt does your aunt live in boston no sir in milltown has the young lady come into the city on a shopping excursion inquired the new acquaintance smiling no sir she is just on her way from new york i went to fetch her you are a young guardian rather sir but there was no one else to go for her how old are you fifteen are you attending school no sir i should be glad to do so but my aunt is not in good circumstances and i have to work i have been employed in the mills but they discharged some of their hands lately and i was among them how would you like to come to boston to work very much i may some time have a vacancy for you i am a wholesale stationer on state street give me your address and if i have any opening i will write to you thank you sir said ben i should like very much to work here ben took the strangers card from which he learned that his name was otis johnson and that he dealt in stationery blank books diaries and a similar line of goods this may lead to something thought ben i should enjoy living in boston there is a good deal more going on here than in milltown it was about quarter of two when ben and emma rose from the table what are we going to do now asked emma ben considered the train doesnt start till five he said we wont go to the station yet for we should get tired of waiting we will walk about and look into the shop windows unless you are tired i am not tired i should like it said emma presently they came to the old state house bens attentions was attracted by a charleston car he knew that bunker hill monument was in charleston and it struck him that it would be a good opportunity to go and see it does this car go to bunker hill monument he inquired yes said the conductor it goes within two minutes walk of it how long does it take to go there twenty minutes ben reflected that the train did not start till five oclock and that there would be plenty of time for the excursion he did not know when he would have another chance and resolved to avail himself of this he helped emma to board the car and got on himself i like to ride in electric cars ben said emma so do i emma do you know what we are going to see what is it a great stone monument five times as high as a house what is a monument ben explained to her does anybody live in it asked the little girl no i dont think it would be a very pleasant place to live in what did they build it for then ben explained that a great battle had been fought on the hill where the monument stood do they fight any battles there now ben asked emma in some apprehension why are you afraid of getting killed yes there is no danger it is over a hundred years since there was any fighting there just then the car stopped and a new passenger got on and sat down just opposite ben and his young charge ben did not take special notice of her and was surprised to hear a familiar voice i declare if it aint the little gal looking up he recognized the old lady his fellow passenger how do you do maam he said putty well where be you goin over to bunker hill im goin to charleston myself my son is away with his wife and im goin over to stay with my niece till he comes back how do you do little gal pretty well said emma you dont know me do you it was an unfortunate question yes i do youre the lady that takes snuff said emma some of the passengers tittered and the old lady turned red in the face well i never did she exclaimed in mortification youre a badbehaved little gal she didnt mean to offend you maam said ben shes very young shes old enough to behave children didnt use to sass their elders like they do now if one of my children was to behave so id shut em up in a dark closet for twentyfour hours with only dry bread to eat the old lady shook her head vigorously and glared at emma over the top of her spectacles it was just as well perhaps that emma was absorbed in looking out of the window and did not listen to what the old lady was saying being a highspirited and freespoken young woman she would have been likely to reply and that would have made matters worse the ride was not a long one for but a narrow bridge separates boston proper from the historic town of charleston you get out here said the conductor go up that street to the monument ben could see the great stone pillar standing up against the sky in plain sight and he ascended the hilly street toward it that is the monument emma he said it looks like a big chimney said emma only chimneys are made of brick it would take a big house to need such a chimney as that said ben they reached the top of the hill and stood beside the monument which looked immensely tall now that they were close to it this is where warren fell said ben repeating to himself a piece of information which he had heard did he fall inquired emma oh no he was killed in the battle here are you going to ascend the monument asked a gentleman who had come up the hill another way i didnt know you could said ben there is a spiral staircase inside most visitors ascend it there is a splendid view from the top i should think there would be will you go i think of going and would like your company no i guess not said ben it would be too much for emma she is only a little girl and could not stand the fatigue i wouldnt dare to go up so high ben said emma timidly here a welldressed lady who had heard the discussion said if you would like to go up young man i will take care of the little girl till you come down will you stay with me my dear she smiled pleasantly and emmas confidence was won yes ben i will stay with her she said only dont be gone too long ben hesitated he wanted to go up and was not sure when he would have another opportunity he could see no reason to doubt that emma would be entirely safe under the care of the stranger i dont like to give you so much trouble said ben it will be no trouble said the lady politely i am fond of children it was twentyfive minutes before ben descended he looked for emma and his heart gave a great bound of dismay neither emma nor the lady was to be seen chapter xvii the strange captor this was what had happened when ben was fairly on his way up the monument the lady addressed emma my dear she said are you fond of candy ever so much said emma suppose we go to a candy store and get some but i dont want to leave ben said the little girl oh we will be back before he returns said the lady will you come if you are certain sure you will be back in time oh yes my dear the ladys manner was so kind that emma felt entire confidence in her promise yes i will go they walked down the hill in a different direction from that which they had come up this brought them to a street on which were some shops the lady entered one leading emma by the hand give us one halfpound of assorted candy she said the girl behind the counter weighed out the candy and handed it to her they left the shop now are we going back to ben asked emma i have sent word to him to come to my house and take supper my dear child come with me and you will see him soon how should emma know that this was not true she was a little girl with no experience of the world accustomed to put confidence in those she met and the lady was very kind in her manner is your home far off she asked no it is quite near this proved to be true the lady turned up a street lined with neat dwellings and rang the bell a servant answered the bell is it you mum she said yes jane jan looked inquiringly at the little girl and was on the point of asking who she was but she knew her mistress was peculiar and said nothing this little girl will stay to tea said the lady put on an extra plate yes maam and isnt ben coming too asked emma noting the omission yes jan you may put on two extra plates emma followed her new acquaintance upstairs and was led into a neat bedchamber the lady entered it bade emma enter locked the door and then sinking on the floor before the astonished child exclaimed with evident emotion have i found you at last my dear dear child emma was startled at the ladys tone and for the fist time felt alarmed i aint your child she said what makes you call me so are you not my dear little mary said the lady no my name isnt mary my name is emma did they change your name my dear child was it not enough to take you away from me without changing your name i dont know what you mean said emma ore and more alarmed i want to go back to ben would you leave your mother my child you are not my mother let me go emma ran to the door but it was locked and the key was in the ladys pocket i cannot let you go my dear child you have been away from me too long already i have been very lonely without you her tone was still kind it had never varied but emma was thoroughly frightened let me go she began to cry i want to go to ben the lady looked at her in mingled grief and wonder can a child turn from her own mother to a stranger she said musingly she forgets that she is my little mary she no longer loves me my name is emma said the little girl why did you take me away from ben help was at hand though it came from a stranger a knock was heard at the door and the lady rose and opened it the newcomer was a little younger than the lady already mentioned but bore such a resemblance to her as to indicate that she was her sister she looked at surprise at emma where did you get this child clara she asked it is my little mary dont you see that it is you are mistaken clara your little mary is in heaven she has come back again this is she dont you see that it is she asked the lady called clara earnestly my poor sister said the younger lady compassionately you are mistaken this is not your little mary where did you find her to whom does she belong emma had listened to this conversation with interest feeling that it concerned her she answered the question herself i belong to ben she said where is ben asked the younger lady he is at the big stone chimney he was going up to the top he left me with her you mean the monument dont you my dear child yes maam is this true clara yes the elder sister admitted the younger lady looked perplexed you did wrong clara to take the little girl from her brother he will feel very anxious about her she said she would buy me some candy said emma could i see my child and not claim her said clara i am not your child what makes her say i am her child my dear said the younger lady gently my poor sister lost her little girl not long since she has not been well since when she saw you today she thought you were her little mary i want to go back to ben what will ben say certainly you must go back to your brother come my child we will try to find him emma went downstairs with her new friend clara did not attempt to hinder her but seated herself with an air of dependency in an armchair and buried her face in her hands i am afraid ben has gone away said emma it is very perplexing said the young lady to herself we will go out and try to find your brother if we cannot you can tell me where your home is and i will take you there i dont know exactly where it is said emma i have never been there i came from new york i am going to board with bens aunt and you dont know where she lives you dont know the name of the town emma shook her head my poor sister has done great mischief said the young lady gravely i must do my best to remedy it they went out into the street together meanwhile ben in great trouble of mind remained in the neighborhood of the monument for ten minutes or more perhaps the lady has taken emma on a little walk he thought perhaps she thought i wouldnt be down so soon ben felt that it was very inconsiderate but he would not at first believe that there was anything really wrong but when ten minutes has passed he became alarmed and began to blame himself aunt was right he thought i wasnt fit to be trusted with the care of a little girl what shall i say to mr manning what shall i do he looked about him in despairing bewilderment streets radiated from the monument in several different directions which should he take if he took any there was not more than one chance in four that it would prove the right one he was still standing there when the gentleman who had gone up with him descended where is the little girl he asked ben explained his trouble dont be alarmed my boy said the gentleman in a tone of sympathy i will help you sooner or later we shall hear of the child what shall i do asked ben it is possible the child may be brought back i will remain here to receive her if she comes and you may go and search for her come back in about halfanhour ben started on his quest and with feverish haste he explored street after street but in vain with sad heart he retraced his steps to the monument what was his joy to find emma returned and in charge of the gentleman he had left behind and another lady an explanation was given to which ben paid little attention such was his joy at the recovery of his young charge what time is it sir he inquired of his companion five minutes to five then we are too late for the train exclaimed ben in dismay chapter xviii the envelope what train asked the gentleman the fiveoclock train to milltown is that the last train yes sir you will have to wait till tomorrow will it make much difference ben blushed i shall have to stay at a hotel he said uncomfortably and i dont think i have money enough i did not expect to have that expense i can relieve you on that score said the gentleman i live in charleston not far away you shall stay at my house tonight and go home by the morning train there is a morning train isnt there yes sir at halfpast ten you will accept my invitation yes sir and thank you said ben gratefully i dont know what i should have done if you had not invited me i am glad to have the opportunity of doing you a kindness i want to send you away with a good impression of charleston it was a handsome house to which ben was led by his new friend his wife received the two children with unaffected kindness and soon made them feel at home during the evening mr somerby for this was his name drew out of ben the particulars of his history and present position ben seemed so frank and manly that he was quite pleased with him mr somerby was not in business unless he may be called a capitalist he was the possessor of a large fortune and the care of his property required a considerable share of his time when ben was ready to go the next morning mr somerby put an envelope into his hand dont open this till you get home he said no sir now goodby and good luck to you thank you sir meanwhile mrs bradford at home was feeling anxious old mrs perkins had dropped in to make a call and her conversation wasnt reassuring hasnt ben got back she asked not yet theres a great risk in sendin a boy so fur said the old lady do you think so asked mrs bradford uneasily to be sure i do hes too young thats what i thought but ben was very sure he could get along boys is allus confident said mrs perkins whose knowledge of grammar was not very profound but i never knew one that you could rely on benjamin is a good boy yes hes a good boy as boys go but dont you trust him too fur when did you expect him back i expected him last night and he didnt come just as i thought mrs perkins nodded her head vigorously and looked unutterably wise maybe the cars is gone off the track said the old lady oh dont say such things mrs perkins said mrs bradford uneasily i didnt say they had but were havin a dreffle number of accidents nowadays ben is all right said tony thinking he ought to defend his cousin he said when he went away hed come home right side up with care little boys should be seen and not heard said mrs perkins always be prepared for the worst thats my motto and my motto is wait and hope said a familiar voice outside the door its ben exclaimed tony joyfully the door was thrown open and there stood ben with little emmas hand in his aunt jane he said heres little emma come to live with you my dear i am very glad to see you said mrs bradford emma looked in her gentle face and liked her at once will you be my aunt too she asked yes my dear tony come here and be introduced said ben tony was bashful at first but it was not very long before he and emma were merrily playing together so youre railly back benjamin said old mrs perkins rather disappointed yes maam hows james loafin round as usual said his affectionate relative boys are so shiftless they may be admitted ben goodnaturedly but they get hungry sometimes aunt jane is there anything to eat in the house i will set the table at once said his aunt the little girl must be hungry too youre undertakin a great responsibility mrs bradford said mrs perkins the little girl will be a great care to you i dont look upon it in that light said mrs bradford i am glad to have her here humph you will talk different a month from now but i must be goin after dinner ben bethought himself of the envelope which mr somerby had given him he opened it when a banknote dropped to the floor picking it up he saw to his amazement that it was a fiftydollar bill with sparkling eyes he read the letter or rather these few lines which were penciled on a halfsheet of note paper i have been interested in your story and beg your acceptance of the enclosed as a slight help and encouragement should you ever need advice or assistance i shall be glad to have you call upon me frederic somerby what do you think of that aunt jane said ben in a tone of exultation hasnt my motto worked pretty well after all isnt it better to wait and hope than to give up and get discouraged yes ben i begin to think you are right we are better off than when i was at work in the factory yes ben we can get along very comfortably i have been thinking aunt that while business continues dull i will go to school this money i will put in a savingsbank and we shall have it to fall back upon if we need it this plan met with mrs bradfords approval and was carried out by ben when he returned from the savingsbank with his book in his hand he felt like a capitalist in fact he was so cheerful that his aunt caught the infection and looked brighter than she had for years it is pleasant to have money in the bank she said to old mrs perkins like as not the bank will break said the old lady i see an account last week of a savinsbank that failed i wouldnt trust any of em mrs perkins said ben with mock gravity i heard last week of a man who died in his bed id never go to bed if i were you it aint well to joke said the old lady always be prepared for the worst that isnt my motto said ben as long as i live i mean to wait and hope chapter xix the prize for scholarship the annual examination of the grammar schools in milltown came about the middle of june just before summer vacation it the first ward school two prizes had been offered by the principal to the scholars who stood highest on the ranklists speculation was rife as to the probable result but the choice was finally narrowed down to two boys one of these was ben bradford now sixteen years of age the other was samuel archer son of the superintendent of the milton mills there is an old saying like father like son mr archer was purseproud and consequential and felt that he was entitled to deference on the score of his wealth and prominence sam said he two days before the examination what are your chances of obtaining the prize i think i ought to have it father answered sam that is you think you will be entitled to it yes sir then you will get it as a matter of course i dont know that dont you think the prize will be adjudged fairly the principal thinks a great deal of ben bradford is he your chief competitor he is the only boy i am afraid of who is he he is a poor boy used to work in the mills he is the nephew of the widow bradford yes he lives in a small house about the size of a bandbox i expect they are as poor as poverty ben wears coarse clothes i dont believe he has a new suit a year and you have too many i believe your bill for clothes exceeds mine oh father you want your son to dress well people know you are a rich man and they expect it humph it may be carried too far said mr archer who had just paid a large tailors bill for sam and you say the principal favors him yes everybody can see it it is rather strange he should favor a penniless boy said mr archer himself a worshiper of wealth the man dont know on which side his bread is buttered so i think he ought to consider that you are a man of consequence here i rather think i have some influence in milltown said mr archer with vulgar complacency i fancy i could oust mr taylor from his position if i caught him indulging in favoritism but you may be mistaken sam mr archer looked thoughtful finally he said i think it will be well to pay some attention to mr taylor it may turn the scale when you go to school tomorrow i will send by you an invitation to mr taylor to dine with us well give him a good dinner and get him goodnatured so when sam went to school in the morning he bore a note from his father containing a dinner invitation say to your father that i will accept his invitation with pleasure said the principal it was the first time he had received such a mark of attention from mr archer and being a shrewd man he understood at once what it signified hes coming father announced sam on his return home did he seem gratified by the invitation i couldnt tell exactly he said he would accept with pleasure no doubt he feels the attention said mr archer pompously he knows i am a man of prominence and influence and the invitation will give him social status mr archer would have been offended if he had been told that the principal was more highly respected in town than himself in spite of his wealth and fine house when the principal sat down to mr archers dinner table he partook of a dinner richer and more varied than his modest salary enabled him to indulge in at home nevertheless he had more than once been as well entertained by others and rather annoyed mr archer by not appearing to appreciate the superiority of the dinner confound the man he takes it as coolly as if he were accustomed to dine as sumptuously every day thought archer i hope you are enjoying dinner mr taylor he said very much thank you i rather plume myself on my cook i venture to say that i pay five dollars a month more than any other person in milltown but i must have a good dinner i am very particular on that score have you a good cook mr taylor asked mrs archer condescendingly why the fact is that we keep but one servant i suppose your salary will not permit you to keep more than one servant you are right madam really mr taylor i think your salary ought to be increased said mr archer graciously the laborer is worthy of his hire eh i must see if i cant induce the town to vote you an increased compensation thank you said the principal quietly a larger salary would of course be acceptable but i doubt whether the town will feel like voting it rest easy said mr archer pompously i think i can bring it about oh by the by continued the rich man samuel tells me that you have offered two scholarship prizes yes sir to the two scholars who pass the best examination how does my boy stand in the matter he is one of the most prominent competitors i am very glad to hear it very glad sam you must do your best tomorrow it would gratify me very much if you should succeed i am ambitious for my son mr taylor and i dont mind admitting it your ambition is a very natural one said the principal sams scholarship is excellent and his record is very satisfactory thank you mr taylor your assurance is deeply gratifying to mrs archer and myself it will be the happiest day of our lives if sam succeeds in the approaching competition he has a very fair chance of success sir i think ive fixed things said mr archer complacently after the principal had taken his leave the prize is as good as yours sam chapter xx before the battle bens term at school had already extended to eight months our hero was thorough in whatever he did and having an excellent natural capacity easily took high rank as a scholar do you expect to win the prize ben asked his friend james watson i hope to win it said ben so does sam archer i suppose it lies between us two unless you step in and carry it off added ben smiling for he knew that james who was low in rank was not at all sensitive on the subject make yourself easy ben i wont interfere with you you are my friend you know and for your sake i will answer a few questions wrong you always were considerate james you have relieved my mind of a load of anxiety dont mention it ben i shant feel the sacrifice you are a good fellow at any rate james and that is more than i can say for sam archer he thinks an awful lot of himself he cant forget that his father is superintendent of the mill by the way ben what are you intending to do in vacation i shall try to get employment in the mill again i have been idle nearly a year now your aunt has been getting along very well yes thanks to the seven dollars a week received for emmas board but i dont like to feel that she is supporting the family i think it is high time for me to be at work ben ive been thinking of something out with it james sam archer will be very much disappointed if you take the prize over him he doesnt love me overmuch now i am afraid he will prejudice his father against you so as to induce him to refuse you employment in the mill do you think he would be as mean as that do i think so i know it sam archer is mean enough for anything he has just as good a chance as i have he told one of the boys you were mr taylors pet he will say the prize was give to you on account of favoritism will anybody believe it no one except sams special friends i think mr taylor does like you that reminds me where do you think mr taylor is tonight i dont know i am sure he is dining at mr archers thats something new isnt it mr archer is trying to curry favor with the principal for sam then he doesnt know him very well mr taylor will decide justly at any rate do you want very much to go back to the mill ben yes then the best thing you can do is to let sam beat you that will make him goodnatured and you will probably get a place i shant resign the prize i shall do my best to obtain it if that loses me employment in the mill i will go in search of employment elsewhere i like your pluck ben i am willing to wait and i expect to win in the end well good luck to you ben my supper is ready and i must go home the more ben thought it over the more he felt that james was probably correct in his prediction as to the effect of his success i am determined to beat sam he said to himself the next morning he entered the schoolroom cool and confident while sam though rather nervous seemed almost equally confident mr taylor wont go back on me he reflected after dining at our house especially after father has promised to get him a higher salary the examination lasted all the session it was partly oral and partly written boys said the principal i shall devote the evening to the examination of your papers tomorrow morning my decision will be made known i wish it were over thought sam i think hell give me the prize but i should like to be sure of it chapter xxi ben wins at school every boy was in his seat the next morning at the opening of school though the choice lay between two only there was a general interest felt in the result of the competition ben was the favorite though sam had a few followers generally sycophantic boys who had a respect for wealth or had favors to ask of him boys said the principal i sat up till twelve oclock last evening examining your papers i have not only ascertained who are entitled to the two prizes but i have made a list of the ten highest scholars with their percentages i am glad to say that many of you have done well and i regret that i have not more prizes to bestow i will now announce the names of the prize boys first prize benjamin bradford second prize sam archer the boys applauded noisily bradfords percentage continued the principal is ninetynine and eighttenths archers ninetyseven and ninetenths both are very high and i heartily congratulate both young gentlemen upon their brilliant success bradford you may come up to the desk mr taylor placed in his hands a neat edition of longfellows poems thank you sir said ben the boys again applauded archer you may come up said the principal sam rose slowly and with a discontented look shuffled up to the desk an edition of tennysons poems was handed to him he received them without a word of thanks and hurried back to his seat there was no applause in his case this was the last day of school and the session lasted but an hour and a half at halfpast ten the boys poured out of the schoolhouse with noisy demonstrations of joy i congratulate you old fellow said james watson to ben youve done splendidly thank you james so do i and i exclaimed one and another ben received all these congratulations modestly go and congratulate sam boys he said a good scholar but a mean boy said james however here goes i congratulate you on your prize sam he said offering his hand sam did not appear to see the hand a second prize isnt worth having he said discontentedly of course it was all i had a chance for bradford is the teachers favorite do you mean to say ben dont deserve the first prize he was sure to get it anyhow thats mean in you to speak so sam its what i think at any rate well sam said his father as he entered his presence how is it just as i expected father old taylor gave the first prize to his favorite ben bradford after all the attention i have paid that man it is positively outrageous to defraud you of your rights you wont have his salary increased now will you father ill do what i can to have the man discharged theres a favor i want to ask of you father what is it my son i hear that ben bradford is going to seek employment in the mill now that school is over i hope youll refuse to take him on i will his prize will cost him dear would you have given him employment if i had beaten him for the prize yes business has revived and we have decided to take on some extra hands giving preference to those who have formerly been in our employ then i will be revenged at any rate said sam chapter xxii sams revenge now that vacation had fairly commenced ben thought he had better make application for employment at the mills it was generally understood that business had improved and that new hands were to be taken on on the morning succeeding the award of prizes ben presented himself at the office of the superintendent after awhile the great man arrived he nodded patronizingly to the applicants for employment he saw ben in the number and his small soul was rejoiced for he meant to humiliate him he summoned one and another to a conference engaging such as were old hands ben began to look hopeful he too had experience at last mr archer beckoned to him to approach what do you wish he demanded i should like employment at the mills said ben have you been in my employ before yes sir mr archer opened a thick folio volume which lay upon the desk and appeared to be looking for something which he found at last i cant employ you he said coldly why not sir because your record is not good bens eyes flashed with proper indignation i dont understand sir he said in a dignified tone it strikes me that my language is plain what complaints were made of me i should like to know in what respect i failed to do my duty probably you know as well as i can tell you said the superintendent at any rate i have no time to waste in examining into the matter i prefer to take a boy who has nothing against him next ben left the office smarting not so much at the failure to obtain employment as at the unfounded charges trumped up against him just outside the office he met sam archer good morning bradford said sam eyeing our hero curiously are you going to work in the mill no said ben shortly perhaps old taylor will give you employment no doubt he would if he had occasion to employ any one mr taylor is a gentleman do you mean to say father isnt a gentleman you can draw your own conclusions ben was not quite an angel though he was a manly boy and he felt pugnacious ive a great mind to knock you down said sam you may have the mind but you havent got the strength to do it said ben i wont dirty my hands with touching you thats prudent at any rate retorted ben youd better go home and read your prize thats good advice though it comes from a bad source returned ben it isnt needed however for i have been reading it i can quote two lines be not like dumb driven cattle be like heroes in the strife what do you mean by that i mean that you will find it hard to drive me perhaps so but ive done one thing boasted sam whats that i told father not to take you if you applied and thats why you are going away with a flea in your ear i am not surprised to hear this he answered indeed i am very glad to hear it you are glad to hear it repeated sam puzzled yes i dont understand why you should be i suppose not i am glad you know just why i was refused well i hope you are satisfied i am entirely so i wonder what the fellow means thought sam chapter xxiii the decoy letter sam knew that ben was anxious to obtain a situation it occurred to him that it would be a splendid joke to write to ben in the name of some boston firm offering him a situation ben would go up to the city of course only to find that he had been sold of course it would not do for sam to write the letter himself since his writing was well known to ben again the letter must be posted in boston however where there is a will there is a way sam was acquainted with a boy who lived in boston frank ferguson and to him he wrote enclosing the draft of a letter which he requested frank to copy and mail to ben it is only a practical joke sam explained in his letter in return for one ben has played on me but for this explanation frank who was an honorable boy would not have lent himself to this scheme as it was it struck him only as a piece of fun and he followed sams instructions a few days later ben in going to the postoffice received a letter directed to himself it read thus benjamin bradford we are in want of a boy in our store you can have the place if you wish it will be necessary for you to report for duty next monday yours in haste jones porter ben had heard of jones porter they were wellknown booksellers and publishers a position with them was certainly desirable but how could they have heard of me thought ben he was not vain enough to suppose that his name was well known in boston yet here was an important firm that had offered him employment again the manner in which the letter ended struck him as rather singular it didnt occur to ben to doubt its genuineness as he was walking back he met james watson whats the news ben asked james i am offered a place in boston answered ben you dont say so what sort of place is it it is a place in a bookstore there is the letter james read it how did they happen to write to you i dont know i am sure cant you think of any way in which they could have heard of you there is only one way i can think of there was a gentleman in charleston who was quite kind to me when i was there last year he promised to be of service to me if i ever needed it he may have mentioned my name to jones porter very likely said james you are in luck i wish i knew what wages they are willing to pay said ben if its only five dollars a week it wont more than pay my board and i dont like to call upon aunt jane to pay for my clothes you will take the place wont you at any rate oh yes perhaps i can get a chance to earn something by extra work and so pay for my clothes well i wish you good luck ben if you hear of a place for me let me know i will james i should like your company ben went home and showed the letter to his aunt you see aunt i am provided for said ben old mrs perkins was present and hazarded a cheerful observation i wouldnt trust a boy of mine in the city mrs bradford she said its the ruination of em most always like or not ben will get dissipated and take to drinkin and have the delirious triangles mrs bradford was easily alarmed do you think youd better go ben she asked doubtfully youre so young i cant afford to wait till im an old man aunt jane he said and i dont mean to have the delirous triangles if i can help it you wouldnt keep me at home till im eighty like mrs perkins im only sixtytwo exclaimed the old lady indignantly what do you mean by calling me eighty i didnt know you were sensitive about your age i aint snarled the old lady i own up to sixtytwo but you neednt call me twenty years older mrs perkins was really seventytwo and looked her age but she fondly hoped to deceive the public do you really think you had better go to boston ben said his aunt after the departure of the visitor yes aunt jane theres no chance for me in milltown as you know very well mr archers prejudiced against me and wont take me into the mill i shall miss you very much ben ill write you once every week how much will you get i dont know if its too little i will live as closely as i can i shall be learning the business you know and of course i shall get my salary raised when i deserve it ben had a strong positive nature and he convinced his aunt that he ought to accept the offer of jones porter mrs bradford set about putting his clothes in order sam archer awaited with interest the result of his joke seeing ben the next day he stopped him where are you bound ben he asked i am going to buy some underclothes he said have you got a place yes i expect so sam wanted to laugh but concealed his emotions where is it he asked it isnt in you fathers mill retorted ben no i suppose not is it in town it is in boston said ben in a tone of satisfaction sam laughed involuntarily what are you laughing at inquired ben angrily excuse me said sam i was thinking how green you would be at first in a city place i will call and see you when i go to the city i dont like to be impolite but as you prevented my getting a place here i dont look upon you as a friend and i only care to receive calls from my friends how proud we are just because we have got a place in boston said sam mockingly and he laughed again i thought he would be disappointed to hear of my success thought ben he is rather a queer boy isnt it jolly said sam to himself wont he be mad when he finds it all a sell chapter xxiv ben arrives in boston ben set out for boston on monday morning in very good spirits his aunt shed a few tears at parting she was apt to take depressing views of the future and said i hope youll prosper ben in a tone which implied that she did not think there was more than one chance in ten of his success but ben understood his aunt and did not allow her presentiments to weigh with him his motto was still wait and hope ben found himself seated beside a young man of pleasant appearance who was attracted by our heros frank and manly look i suppose you are going to boston he said yes answered ben readily have you got a place there i am going to have said ben cheerfully do you mind telling where oh no said ben i am going to the store of jones porter indeed there are very prominent business men i suppose they are said ben do you know them personally i dont know them at all i think some friend of mine must have mentioned me to them its rather singular that i shouldnt know anything about your engagement said the young man why should you inquired ben in natural surprise the fact is i am mr porters nephew and am a salesman in the establishment said the young man he drew from his pocket a business card bearing the name henry w porter with jones and porter ben was rather disturbed and he thought can there be anything wrong he said aloud i dont see how there can be any mistake i received a letter from jones porter last week offering me the place ben took the letter from his pocket and handed it to the young man the latter ran his eye over it hastily he examined the signature and the address and said quietly i dont think this letter came from our store ben felt as if the earth had opened before him i dont understand it he said his face very red if the letter isnt genuine who could have written it it seems written in a schoolboy hand said young porter isnt it possible that some one may be playing a practical joke on you it wouldnt be much of a joke to me said ben i should call it a mean trick myself said porter but cant you think of any one who may have written it ill bet its sam archer and who is sam archer he is the meanest boy in milltown said ben doesnt he like you isnt he one of your friends no he does all he can to injure me but here ben examined the letter a second time this isnt his handwriting that proves nothing he probably sent it to some confederate in boston to copy and mail to you dont you think there is any chance of its being genuine asked ben the chance is very slight but it is well of course to make sure i have been away to pass sunday and shall go to the store at once on my arrival you can go with me i will introduce you to my uncle if it is a trick said ben uncomfortably i shall be in an awkward fix whether it is a trick or not you can count on my friendship said young porter kindly thank you said ben gratefully about an hour later ben and his new friend entered the large and handsome bookstore of jones porter young porter as he walked through the store received the greetings of his fellow clerks have you adopted a boy asked one facetiously yes said porter smiling where is my uncle he is in the back office all right come along ben henry porter kept on his way till he reached the back part of the store where a goodsized office was partitioned off mr porter was writing at a desk good morning uncle said bens companion good morning henry have a good time excellent uncle let me introduce to your favorite notice master benjamin bradford of milltown mr porter did not consider it beneath his dignity to be polite even to a boy i am glad to see you my young friend he said rising and offering his hand to ben are you on a visit to the city poor ben his heart sank within him evidently mr porter would not ask such a question of a boy whom he had engaged to work for him the young man saw his embarrassment and answered for him thats rather an odd question to ask you new clerk uncle he said my new clerk henry i dont understand you ben show your letter that is a forgery said the uncle rather indignantly poor ben manly as he was he felt ready to cry i am sorry he said faltering have you any idea who wrote it asked mr porter yes answered ben its sam archer in fun no in spite he is always glad to injure me what can be his motive ben explained his relations with sam do you need the position asked mr porter yes sir i am poor and can ill afford the money i have spent in coming to boston sam knows this and it is mean for him a rich boy to fool me so mr porter was a kindhearted man more than once he had kept on a clerk whom he did not need go into the store a minute my boy he said while i speak with my nephew of course ben obeyed what do you think of this boy henry i think very favorably of him he seems honest and straightforward and i think he is smart i like his looks myself i wish we had a vacancy we shall have very soon to whom do you refer frank robinson is going to leave at the beginning of next month his father thinks it will be better for him to go to school a year or two longer so you would recommend hiring this boy yes sir i have so good an opinion of him that i am quite willing to guarantee him if you will take him on immediately i will myself pay his wages till the end of the month when robinson leaves bravo henry that shows a kind heart i wont accept that but will give you leave to help him outside as much as you please chapter xxv sam gives himself away ben was looking with interest at a row of new books when he was summoned into the private office my young friend said mr porter senior we are not responsible for the letter that brought you here no sir said ben i am sorry to have troubled you ill go home this afternoon he looked sober enough poor ben for it would not be pleasant facing his aunt and friends in milltown and explaining matters even the licking which he determined to give sam archer if he should prove the author of the decoy letter would be a poor satisfaction you may as well stay said mr porter my nephew thinks we can find a place for you in the store will you really take me asked ben we will try you my nephew thinks you will suit us thank you sir said ben warmly your friend who wrote the letter will be rather disappointed eh said young porter smiling yes said ben who could smile now i should like to see him when he learns that his malicious letter has procured me a situation what do we pay you robinson six dollars a week then benjamin shall have the same he has no knowledge of the business to be sure i will have soon said ben confidently thats right my lad make yourself useful to us and you wont have cause to regret it he was set to work dusting books and young porter went to his own desk he was chief bookkeeper when the store closes he said come to me i shall take you to my room tonight in the evening at his friends room ben wrote the following letter to his friend james watson boston july dear james though i have been only a few hours in boston i have a good deal to tell you you remember my showing you the letter from jones porter which induced me to come to the city well it was a hoax it didnt come from the firm at all somebody wanted to play a trick on me and wrote it i have no doubt sam archer was at the bottom of it you know what a mean fellow he is and that he would like nothing better than to injure me but i am glad to say that he has not succeeded by great good luck i got acquainted with mr porters nephew on board the train i showed him the letter which he pronounced probably a forgery but he took me to the store he is head bookkeeper and introduced me to his uncle it seems that there will be a vacancy at the beginning of next month and as i was on the ground they engaged me so sams mean trick has been the means of obtaining me a position he will be provoked enough when he hears it now i will tell you what i want you to do dont say a word about the letter being a hoax merely tell the boys that i have got the place i expected if sam wrote the letter he will certainly betray himself keep mum and lead him on then let me know what you find out i will write again soon your affectionate friend ben bradford its a mean trick and just like sam ejaculated james when he read bens letter ill follow bens instructions sam will be coming round making inquiries pretty soon ill manage him james was right in his supposition sam eagerly awaited the upshot of his trick he concluded that ben would come back monday night depressed and humiliated and he was on the street near bens house when the afternoon train got in ready to feast his eyes on his rivals unhappiness but he waited in vain the next morning about ten oclock he met james watson on the street james had received the letter from ben the evening previous how are you james said sam im all right said james rather coolly have you heard from ben bradford i heard last night what does he say asked sam eagerly he hadnt been in his situation long enough to tell how he should like it answered james is he in a situation demanded sam in surprise what do you think he went to boston for where is he working asked sam incredulously he is with jones porter of course didnt you know they sent for him ha ha laughed sam i am on the track thought james i dont know what you mean said he quietly jones porter sent for ben and he is in their employ ill bet you a dollar ben bradford will be back here within a week said sam in a ton of great confidence i dont believe jones porter ever wrote him a letter i saw the letter suppose you did it might have been a hoax then whoever wrote it did ben a good turn for he has got a place at jones porters i dont believe it said sam uneasily ben writes me that he is there will you let me see the letter no i wont that convinces me that its all a humbug you think the letter a hoax yes i do what reason have you for thinking so i decline to state who do you think wrote it how should i know as you know so much i dont mind telling you that you are right the letter was a hoax sam laughed heartily i thought so he said and i know who wrote it sam didnt laugh now who he asked uncomfortably you did it what do you mean blustered sam exactly what i say otherwise you would have had no reason to suspect the genuineness of it does ben bradford charge me with it just wait till i see him that will be some time unless you go to boston jones porter happened to have a vacancy and ben stepped into it your letter got him a place i dont believe it said sam faintly its true and its lucky for you if ben had been obliged to come home he would have given you the worst licking you ever had chapter xxvi ben finds a boardingplace henry porter had a fine suite of rooms in the back bay district of boston ben spent the night with him youve got a nice home said our hero yes said the bookkeeper my rooms alone cost me fifteen dollars a week without board ejaculated ben yes said the young man smiling why that is almost eight hundred dollars a year quite correct i see you think me extravagant i was wondering how you could afford it your surprise is natural if i only depended on my salary i certainly should not hire such expensive apartments but a good aunt left me twenty thousand dollars two years since and this being well invested yields me about fourteen hundred dollars a year i wonder you dont go into business i have thought of it but doubt whether i should manage a business of my own judiciously if not i should run the risk of losing all my money i like keeping books for my uncle and he pays me a good salary with this and the income from my property i can live as well as i wish without incurring any risk at all i dont know but that is best said ben now let me speak of your own plans ben your income is six dollars a week yes sir you must regulate your expenses accordingly i want to do so mr porter how much board shall i have to pay asked ben anxiously i cannot tell without inquiring there is a boardinghouse on warren avenue kept by a worthy lady of my acquaintance how much do you fell able to pay i should like to have enough over to buy my clothes we will see if we can manage it get your hat and we will go to the boardinghouse now it was a threestory brick house such as is common in boston it was unusually neat for a boardinghouse of medium grade mrs draper being an excellent housekeeper with a horror of dirt how do you do mr porter was the landladys greeting mr porter had once boarded with her very well thank you mrs draper how is business pretty full eh yes sir ive only got one small room vacant may we see it it wont suit you mr porter it may suit my young friend here a relative of yours inquired mrs draper no but he is a young friend in whom i feel an interest i shall be very glad if the room suits him then mrs draper led the way upstairs to the vacant room it was small but neatly carpeted and provided all that was needful in a chamber how much do you like it ben asked the bookkeeper very much said ben in a tone of satisfaction mr porter walked to the other end of the room and discussed terms with mrs draper in a low tone what is your price for this room with board i have generally got six dollars a week i want you to let my young friend have it for four i really couldnt do it mr porter you have no idea how much i have to pay at the market for meat and vegetables then my landlord wont reduce my rent you dont understand me mrs draper said the bookkeeper you are to charge him only four dollars but i propose to make up the difference that is of course satisfactory one thing more my young friend is not to know about this arrangement he is to suppose that four dollars a week is payment in full there is only one objection to that mr porter if my other boarders suppose that is all he pays they will make a fuss and want their rate of board reduced then he shall be cautioned to keep the price he pays secret ben ben walked over to where they were standing mrs draper agrees to take you at the very low price of four dollars a week for room and board ben looked delighted then i shall have money enough from my wages to pay all my expenses without calling on aunt jane yes if you are economical as this price is extremely low you are not to mention to any of the other boarders how much you pay i will be sure to remember it said ben as they were leaving the house mr porter said dont suppose ben that i am anxious to get rid of you i had half a mind to keep you with me a week or two but one thing deterred me you are a poor boy and have your own way to make in the world you cant for years afford to live as i am doing if i accustomed you to living expensively it would be harder for you to accommodate yourself to your means i understand you mr porter and thank you i consider you a true friend said ben earnestly i see you are a sensible boy ben you are right in looking upon me as a friend i hope you will come and call upon me often thank you sir i shall consider it a privilege to do so and i hope you will give me any advice that you think will benefit me i will ben and i will begin now we have a large public library in boston of which we are very proud i advise you to draw books from it i shall be glad to said ben eagerly come round and i will show it to you together they entered the handsome building on copley square ben who had never seen a large library or indeed any library containing over a thousand books was amazed at what he saw i didnt suppose there was any library in the world so large he said here is the newspaper and magazine room you can come in here any evening it will be much better than to spend your time where many boys and young men do in billiard and drinking saloons i shall enjoy living in boston very much i think you will while a large city has more temptations than a small town it also has more opportunities for improvement i hope ben you will start right and prepare the way for a useful manhood thank you mr porter i mean to try the next day ben took formal possession of his room in the boardinghouse on warren avenue he found a pleasant class of boarders there and a good table though not luxurious it was better than he had been used to at home and he felt himself fortunately placed chapter xxvii sam attempts strategy the more sam archer thought of the effect of his letter upon bens fortunes the more he felt provoked i wish i hadnt sent him to jones porter thought he i hope he wont suit them when a fortnight had passed sam managed to meet james watson have you heard from ben bradford lately yes said james what does he write that he likes his place very much the bookkeeper is very kind to him and assists him with advice then he likes being in a bookstore sam was not overjoyed at the news how kind you are to take such an interest in ben i dont take an interest in him returned sam then what makes you ask after him so particularly i expected hed be discharged by this time what made you think so he didnt give satisfaction at the mill he was discharged so was i but not for the same reasons said sam it was because times were dull i rather think bens work was satisfactory enough but you influenced your father against him how much pay does he get inquired sam more than he received at the mill i wonder whether all this is true considered sam james watson is bens friend and he may represent things better than they are an excellent plan suggested itself to sam he would ask his fathers permission to go to boston and pass a day or two with his friend frank ferguson this would allow him to drop into jones porters store and judge for himself how ben was situated sam had no trouble about obtaining permission on reaching the city he decided to call at the store before going to his friends residence ben was dusting books when a glance toward the door revealed the entrance of sam the latter had cherished a faint hope that james had deceived him and that ben was really not employed how shall i receive him ben asked himself he decided to treat him coolly but not to quarrel good morning bradford said sam good morning archer was the return greeting sam didnt quite like this familiarity how do you like working here very much answered ben much better than in the mill he added significantly i shouldnt think theyd have taken a green country boy suggested sam pleasantly perhaps they wouldnt if a friend hadnt written for me said ben with a meaning glance at sam how much pay do you get i would rather not say because it is so small said sam with a sneer on the contrary i look upon it as liberal i am doing better than if i had remained at milltown this was bad news for sam i am really obliged to the person who wrote the letter which secured me the position ben added it isnt much of a business to dust books i sell books sometimes said ben smiling can i show you something this morning no i dont want anything where do you live i board on warren avenue in a cheap boardinghouse there are some very nice people who board there sam came to a sudden decision would it be possible to induce ben to give up his place and enter the mill again he could be discharged after awhile and cast adrift it was rather foolish to suppose that ben would snap at such a bait but he decided to try it i think you would be better off in the mill he said you could board at home and help your aunt you would soon be promoted too i thought you didnt want me to enter the mill exclaimed ben amazed your father told me that my record was not good and ben looked indignant father was feeling out of sorts said sam smoothly he will take you on if youll come back what does the fellow mean thought ben it didnt take him long to guess if he should return to the mill he would be once more in sams power you really think your father would employ me yes he would if i asked him to i would thank you sam archer if i thought your offer was a friendly one what makes you think that it isnt the feeling which i have reason to think you entertain for me and your conduct in the past you are too suspicious ben if i find i am i will apologize to you it would be foolish for me to give up so good a position in order to accept a poor one which is not all permanent well bradford i must bid you good morning just write to me if you decide to accept if i decide to accept i will hes getting very impudent said sam to himself if i could only get him into the mill i could fix him wed let him stay two or three weeks and then ship him but he wont do it stay i think of a way what the way was may be conjectured from a letter which ben received three days later from his aunt jane my dear nephew i am feeling almost heartbroken it is reported by one who saw you lately that you are looking very dissipated i was afraid the temptations of the city were too much for you you are too young to go away from home i wont blame you too much for i feel that you are weak rather than wicked but i shall not feel comfortable till you are at home again dont hesitate to give up your place i am assured that they will take you on again at the mill and it will be much better for you to be at home with us till you are older and better able to resist temptation your anxious aunt jane bradford ben read this letter in amazed indignation sam is at the bottom of this he concluded it is he that has reported that i look dissipated he wants to deprive me of my place and get me into the mill where i shall be in his power i cant forgive him for frightening my poor aunt if i were at home i should certainly punish him as he deserves ben took the letter to his friend the bookkeeper what do you think of that he asked this letter was written at an enemys instigation you are right mr porter then ben told his friend of sams call will you do me a favor mr porter he asked certainly i will ben then will you write to my aunt and assure her that my habits are good and that her informant has willfully lied it will relieve her anxiety with pleasure the next day mrs bradford received a letter very enthusiastic in its tone which completely exonerated our hero from the charges brought against him your nephew it concluded bids fair to become one of our best clerks he is polite faithful and continually trying to improve you need have no apprehension about him it would be very foolish for him to resign his situation chapter xxviii sam praises ben the same mail that carried the bookkeepers letter to mrs bradford also carried a letter from ben to sam archer it ran thus sam archer you might be in better business than telling lies about me to my aunt if you think i look dissipated your eyes deceive you and i advise you to wear glasses the next time you come to boston if you choose to come to the store it is none of my business but you need not take the trouble in order to see me i quite understand your anxiety to get me back into the mill there was a time when i should have been glad of a place there but now i have a place that suits me better and dont care to change benjamin bradford when sam received this letter he looked and felt provoked somehow or other ben was always getting the better of him he wanted to injure him but there seemed no way suddenly it occurred to sam that he might prejudice jones porter against our hero he sat down at once and wrote them an anonymous letter of which this is a copy messrs jones porter i hear that you have taken into your employment a boy named benjamin bradford from this town you probably are not aware that he has a very bad reputation here he was employed in the mill for a time but was discharged because he was idle and lazy he keeps bad company and none of the respectable boys here cared to associate with him i dont like to see an honorable firm imposed upon and that is why i warn you of the character of your new clerk though i have no personal interest in the matter a friend the next day ben was summoned to the countingroom ben said mr porter have you any enemy in milltown yes sir we have just received a letter warning us against you as unworthy of our confidence mr porter smiled or ben might have felt uncomfortable may i see the letter he asked the letter was placed in his hands it is sam archers handwriting he said looking up i hope sir you wont let it prejudice you against me i would not allow myself to be influenced by an anonymous letter it is a stab in the dark i want to show you how inconsistent sam is said ben he was here a few days ago and urged me to give up my place here and take one in the mill that is rather strange if he is your enemy no sir he dont like it because i have a good place here if i should go into the mill i should probably be discharged in a week or two and cast adrift are any boys as malicious as that not many sir i hope but sam is an exception i sympathize with you in your persecution ben but i can assure you that no anonymous letters will change my opinion of you if this enemy sends another letter i shall feel tempted to increase your wages then i hope hell write again said ben laughing if we continue satisfied with you we shall probably advance you on the first of january thank you sir said ben warmly may i answer this letter sir you may say that we have shown it to you and that we despise such malicious attempts to injure the next day sam received a letter from ben which concluded if you write another similar letter to my employers you will be doing me quite a service it will probably cause them to raise my salary as i owe my place to you you now have it in your power to increase the obligation how bad you must feel sam at your inability to do me harm i cant say i exactly sympathize with you but i certainly pity you for harboring such malice in your heart i dont know how to express my gratitude for all of your kindness if ever you want a situation in boston let me know there is a peanut woman on the common who wants a smart active salesman ben bradford sam was stung by the cool indifference and contempt which appeared in this letter ben did not take the trouble to be angry he evidently despised his enmity and defied him sam felt that he hated ben worse whats that letter you are scowling over sam asked james watson its a letter from a miserable puppy hissed sam is it do you correspond with miserable puppies i cant help their writing to me if you want to know who it is its your friend ben bradford how long have you corresponded asked james i wouldnt lower myself by writing to him said sam wrathfully ill show you what i think of his letter as he spoke he tore the letter to pieces youre a strange boy sam said james why am i havent you been working hard to get ben back to milltown i wish hed come back and yet you cant bear the sight of him i hate him worse than any fellow i know come now sam just listen to a little advice if you had always treated ben right you would like him as well as i do why should you cherish malice against him he has good qualities and so have you if youd only give em a chance to show themselves thats all gammon said sam impatiently what about your having good qualities about my ever liking ben bradford before id make a friend of him i would go without friends you may think differently some time on the first of january ben wrote to his aunt my dear aunt congratulate me on my good luck mr porter this morning called me into the countingroom and informed me that henceforth my wages would be eight dollars a week two dollars more that i have been receiving i owe this partly to my good luck i am a favorite of the bookkeeper who is mr porters nephew otherwise if i had been advanced at all it would have been only one dollar a week dont you think it would have been rather foolish if i had come back and gone into the mill as you wished me to after all i think ben did right to stay said aunt jane when she read the letter i wish hed come home said tony then he could play with me chapter xxix the cunard steamer early one morning a gentleman came into jones porters bookstore and selected some books which he paid for there were eighteen in all where shall we send them sir can you send them to the cunard steamer at east boston i sail for europe today certainly sir when does the steamer start at twelve oclock dont fail to have them there on time as i shall be greatly disappointed to miss them when the gentleman had left the store ben was summoned ben do you know the cunard wharf in east boston asked the bookkeeper i can easily find it here is a package of books to be carried there all right sir said ben they are for mr james parker if you dont find him leave them with the steward so ben took the package and made his way toward the east boston ferry on board the boat he look around him thinking it possible that he might recognize some one of his fellow passengers considerably to his surprise he noticed mr archer superintendent of the factory at milltown whom he had not seen since the latter declined to take him on again at the mill i wonder what brings mr archer here his surprise however was only momentary there was nothing strange in the superintendents having business at east boston ben noticed however that mr archer wore a travelingsuit and carried a knapsack ben would have liked to inquire if squire archer had seen his aunt lately if they had been on friendly terms but he was very doubtful how his advance would be received and remained where he was the boat touched the pier and the passengers disembarked ben was two or three rods behind the squire our hero inquired the way to the steamer and had no difficulty about obtaining the necessary information to his additional surprise squire archer crossed the gangway only a little in advance of ben what can be the squires business here thought ben in surprise ben halted on deck and looked around for some officer to whom he could entrust the package at this moment squire archer turned and saw ben for the first time he started and changed color as ben could see for an instant he looked irresolute then he approached ben and said roughly what brings you here i am here on business answered ben on business what business i have a package of books for one of the passengers oh i see said the mill superintendent seeming to be relieved you are working in a bookstore yes sir what firm is it jones porter oh yes i know i have often been in their store how do you like your place squire archers tone was quite genial and friendly though there was an uneasy expression on his face very well sir if you ever get out of a place come to me i thought you said my record was not good so i did said the superintendent but i was mistaken i was thinking of another boy at the time i am glad to hear it sir he answered i felt disturbed about it at the time of course i believe you and sam had a little difference yes sir but i dont think i was to blame i dont care to inquire into that you and sam will laugh over it when you become a little older squire archer had never seemed so kind and pleasant ben began to think he had misjudged him i would like to be friends with sam he said i shall be ready to meet him halfway i will tell him so tonight said the superintendent by the way i suppose you are rather surprised to see me here you didnt think i was going to europe no sir i didnt think that i suppose you couldnt be spared at the mill quite true my boy i cant be spared for so long i wish i could i have long wanted to make a european tour but i am tied down at home by business however that doesnt explain why i am here dont tell me sir unless you like it is none of my business to be sure in fact there is a little secret about it but i dont mind telling you ben felt more and more surprised was this the proud squire archer who carried his head so high if there is a secret about it perhaps you had better not tell me said ben oh i am quite willing to tell you but you must not say anything about it till after the steamer has sailed the fact is a man who owes the mill a large sum of money it is suspected has taken passage on board this steamer with the intention of going to europe and evading the payment of his debt i cant tell you his name as that might interfere with my plans i am here to intercept him and prevent his departure i hope you will succeed squire archer said ben thank you ben you see therefore that it is essential for me to keep my presence here secret till the steamer sails i will go downstairs now and watch ben delivered his parcel left the steamer and did not mention that he had met any one whom he knew he felt bound to respect squire archers secret in the afternoon he was walking up washington street with the bookkeeper when the latter bought the evening transcript he glanced at the first page and then turned to ben do you know archer living in milltown certainly he is the superintendent of the mill there well here is a paragraph about him it seems he has left the town with fifty thousand dollars belonging to the corporation his flight has made a great sensation the police are on his track and it is thought that he will be arrested and brought back i saw squire archer this morning on the cunard steamer he told me not to mention having seen him till after the steamer had started is it possible exclaimed young porter yes he said he was looking out for a man who owed money to the mill whom he suspected of taking secret passage for europe chapter xxx sam is improved by adversity mr archers flight made a great commotion in milltown no one entertained a suspicion of his integrity he had been appropriating the funds of the corporation to his own use being treasurer as well as superintendent when exposure was inevitable he fled to sam and his mother it was a great blow not only on account of the disgrace but also because it involved poverty and a narrow style of living to persons of their pretensions this was heavy to bear they were not altogether penniless mrs archer had property of her own to the amount of four thousand dollars which was unimpaired but even at a liberal rate of interest this would not support them sam remained in the house dispirited and resentful against the father who had brought this upon him till he got tired of confinement and walked out he hoped to meet no one whom he knew but at the corner of the street he fell in with james watson he is one of ben bradfords friends he will rejoice at what has happened thought sam but james stopped him and said in a friendly tone are you out for a walk sam let us walk together i didnt know as youd care to walk with me you dont think i rejoice over your misfortune i didnt know but you might you are a friend of ben bradford he will be very sorry he wont think of any little difference there has been between you i dont believe that said sam shaking his head you will as soon as you see him you mustnt lose courage sam i know its bad for you but i dont know whats going to become of us said sam despondently we shall be poor that isnt the worst thing that can happen to you father has treated us very badly he has done wrong but he is your father remember sam i am your friend and if i can do anything for you i will thank you james he said you are a good fellow much better than i thought i supposed you would be glad i was down in the world same was to be still more surprised the next day he received the following letter from ben bradford dear sam i am very sorry to hear of your misfortune of course no one can blame you or your mother i believe i was the last acquaintance to see your father before he left boston i had occasion to go on board the cunard steamer which sailed on wednesday on the dock i met your father and had a little conversation with him he did not tell me that he was going to europe but he was in a travelingdress and no doubt he was what has happened will no doubt make some difference in your plans if you wish to get a situation in boston i may be able to help you to one at the beginning of next month there will be an opening for a boy in an establishment on milk street the wages will not exceed five dollars a week but it would be difficult for a beginner to do better if you wish i will try to get this place for you at any rate i hope you will regard me as a friend who wishes you well the little quarrel there has been between us is not worth remembering your sincere friend benjamin bradford to say that sam was surprised to receive this cordial letter from a boy whom he had so persistently tried to injure will hardly express his feelings he was overwhelmed with astonishment mingled with shame ben is a great deal better than i am he was forced to admit i dont deserve such a kindness from him he showed bens letter to his mother i think i had better ask ben to get me the place we must not be too proud we have no right to be proud now we shall have scarcely enough to support us in the humblest manner my wages will help i shall get five dollars a week that will be two hundred and sixty dollars a year even mrs archer was surprised at the change in sam do you think you will be willing to work of course i shall that is if i can work in boston i dont want to stay here nor i said mrs archer suppose we both go to boston then i am afraid our income wont be sufficient for two or three years you can spend some of your principal mother by that time i shall be getting higher wages and it may not be necessary i didnt expect that you would take it so sam ben received the following answer to his letter dear ben i thank you for your kind letter i feel very much ashamed of the way i have treated you in the past i didnt know what a good fellow you were i am afraid i shouldnt have behaved as well in your place as to your offer i accept it thankfully i shall be very glad to get the place you speak of mother and i intend to move to boston as it is no longer agreeable to stay here do you know of any boardinghouse where the prices are reasonable for we cannot afford to pay high rates if you do please find out on what terms we can be accommodated and let me know ben was pleased sam has improved he thought by the first of the month sam and his mother were established in a boardinghouse on warren avenue and sam had entered upon his duties in milk street chapter xxxi clouds in the sky ben felt that he and his aunt were fortunately situated from the time when his salary was raised he had laid aside two dollars a week which he deposited in the savingsbank on school street his aunt having no rent to pay easily got along on her income from work and from the liberal board paid for little emma i am getting on thought ben complacently regarding his bank book at the end of three months i am worth twentysix dollars already little emma his aunts boarder was a child of pleasant disposition and had given little trouble to mrs bradford her health too had been excellent until all at once she became pale and thin mrs bradford felt it her duty to report this to mr manning the childs guardian by his direction a skillful physician was consulted who gave it as his opinion that the best thing for the child would be a sea voyage this was communicated to mr manning fortunately he responded my sister starts in a fortnight for europe she will be absent six months i have prevailed upon her to take charge of emma mrs bradford was glad that the little girl would have a chance to recover her former health and bloom but she felt her loss doubly on account of her society and on account of the loss of income which her absence would involve it was not until after emma had actually gone that she felt the full force of the last consideration so the poor woman wrote a doleful letter to ben in which she predicted that tony and herself must soon go to the poorhouse when this letter reached ben his duty was set plainly before him from his regular income he could spare two dollars a week and taking two dollars weekly from his reserve fund he would be enabled to allow his aunt four dollars a week which added to her own earnings would maintain her and tony in comfort my dear aunt he wrote dont talk of going to the poorhouse just yet you forget that you have a rich nephew in boston who is unwilling that any of his relations should live at public expense unless they get into public office i dont suppose there is any chance of your getting elected member of congress as it is i shall send you every week four dollars which i hope will provide you with your usual comfort i can keep up this allowance for twenty weeks and that will carry you nearly to the time when emma will return to you then all will be right again ben began to save a dollar more he wanted to prepare for the time when his little fund would be exhausted if by that time he had twelve dollars more he would be able to continue to his aunt her regular allowance till the six months were at an end the thought that he had arranged matters so satisfactory made ben quite cheerful he realized the advantage of the habit of saving he was encouraged also by some help which he received from the bookkeeper ben said he do you spend all your salary yes mr porter i am obliged to i should think you could save something out of eight dollars a week as only four goes for board so i could but i have to help my aunt i thought she was provided for said mr porter doesnt she get seven dollars a week for boarding a little girl she did but the little girl is now in europe i suppose you cannot send much to your aunt i send her four dollars a week four dollars a week exclaimed the young man in surprise why that allows you nothing after paying your board the ben told his friend about his savings doesnt it seem hard to have your earnings used up in this way asked the bookkeeper no answered ben cheerfully you are an excellent boy ben you have done just the right thing i am glad you are so unselfish i am afraid i am selfish as the majority of boys but i am not mean enough to let my aunt and little cousin suffer i believe you consider me a friend of yours ben i consider you one of the best friends i have mr porter said ben warmly then you must allow me a friends privilege as he said this he drew from his pocketbook a twentydollar bill and put it into bens hands thank you very much mr porter but ought i to accept so much certainly remember that my means are considerable and that i have no one dependent upon me ben felt that his companion derived pleasure from his gift and he did not see why he should make any further objections he added the twenty dollars to his savingsbook fund and said to himself there will be no trouble now in tiding over the six months but it is said misfortunes never come singly the very next day his aunt received a lawyers letter which plunged her into the deepest despondency chapter xxxii the blow falls this is the material portion of mrs bradfords letter to ben dear benjamin the blow has fallen at last i felt that our prosperity was not lasting though i never could make you believe it i have always expected the worst and it has come benjamin we are ruined i shall end my days in the poorhouse after all if you want an explanation read the letter which i enclose the letter enclosed was from solomon brief attorney of montreal informing mrs bradford that as executor of the estate of the late matthew baldwin of montreal he begged to remind her that for five years she had failed to pay the rent on a tenement owned by the deceased and which he now found it to be his duty to demand at sixty dollars per year without interest this would now amount to three hundred dollars which he hoped mrs bradford would see the propriety of paying at once mrs bradford continued i dont know whether they will put me in jail or not but you know that i cannot pay this money and couldnt if i had five years to do it in what will become of us all i dont know man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward your sorrowful aunt jane bradford ps i am sure your uncle matthew never intended that i should pay the rent he once wrote me a letter to that effect but i cant find it even ben hopeful as he was looked sober after reading this letter he went to his friend the bookkeeper have you ever seen your uncle ben he inquired no sir what was his reputation he was considered wealthy it is a pity you could not visit montreal and make some inquiries said the bookkeeper thoughtfully of course i cant do that then first of all write to this lawyer and inquire the particulars of mr baldwins death and next how his property is left then make him acquainted with the terms on which your aunt has occupied her house this advice seemed reasonable and ben adopted it as ben left the store at six oclock one evening he brushed by an old man with a bent figure and apparently feeble he stumbled and would have fallen had not ben sprung forward and held him up thank you my boy he said in a tremulous voice you seem feeble said ben compassionately yes i am not strong if you wish it i will accompany you to your house you might fall again what is your name benjamin bradford where do you board asked the old man abruptly at no warren avenue i want to find a comfortable boardinghouse do you think i could get in there yes sir i know mrs draper has a vacant room is she reasonable in her charges if she were not i could not afford to board there ive a great mind to go there said the old man i wonder if he has money enough to pay his board regularly thought ben just then a grandson of mrs drapers charlie hunting a boy rather younger than ben came up how are you ben he said all right charlie do you know if your grandmother has let the bedroom on the second floor yes i know she hasnt would you like to go and see it sir asked ben yes said the old man is it far about half a mile but we can take the cars no i can walk if you will walk slow enough for me i am not so young as i was certainly sir charlie if you are going home just tell your grandmother that this gentleman is coming to look at her room you neednt wait for me all right ben you are very kind to an old man what did you say your name was ben bradford have you parents living no sir only an aunt and cousin are they well off not very sir they got along very comfortably till lately but now something has happened which makes me feel anxious but i wont trouble you with it sir tell me about it i would like to hear it for five years my aunt has occupied a small house rent free it belonged to her uncle she has just got a letter saying that her uncle is dead and demanding payment of rent for the last five years what are you going to do about it i have written to the lawyer telling him on what terms my aunt occupied her house that is rent free on condition that she paid the taxes regularly what was the uncles name i am a little acquainted in montreal perhaps i may have heard it his name was matthew baldwin i have heard of him he was a miserly old man i dont know about that said ben it seems to me you ought to look after the matter why dont you go to montreal i cant spare the time or money answered ben besides we should certainly have heard of it if any property had been coming to us i have written to the lawyer and expect to hear something soon when they reached the boardinghouse on warren avenue the old man appeared pleased with the vacant room he haggled a little about the terms but finally agreed to take it at the price set by mrs draper he gave his name as marcus benton and too immediate possession chapter xxxiii ben receives a commission in due time a letter came from montreal it was brief and not overcourteous from it ben learned that mr baldwin had been dead for three weeks and that all his property was left to a young man who claimed to be a distant relative the name of the heir was john tremlett the letter concluded i can find nothing in the papers of the deceased confirming your statement that your aunt was allowed to occupy her house rent free if you hold any proof of your assertions you may forward it otherwise mr tremlett will insist upon his claim this letter reached ben on a friday it naturally caused him anxiety he obtained permission to go to milltown saturday afternoon and spend sunday he desired himself to institute a search for the letter of which his aunt had spoken his aunt received him in tearful despondency oh what shall we do benjamin said the widow first we must search for that letter of uncle matthews i know im to blame benjamin i have brought ruin upon you and my poor innocent tony you havent ruined me so you need not trouble yourself about that even if the letter cannot be found i guess we shall live through it they hunted high and low but the letter was not to be found ben was a good deal disappointed but did not venture to say so not wishing to increase his aunts despondency on monday morning he went back to boston and told the bookkeeper it seems quite desirable that you should go to montreal ben said young porter of course that is out of the question mr porter no i think it can be managed ben looked as he felt not a little surprised it is some time explained the bookkeeper since we sent an agent to montreal we have been thinking of sending some one up there stopping at the principal towns on the way you are rather young but if i recommend you i presume my uncle will let you go of course mr porter senior had to be consulted though not a little doubtful about the expediency of sending so young a representative of the house he finally gave his consent which was communicated to ben ben was summoned to the countingroom and received his instructions with a sum of money for expenses at three oclock in the afternoon he was dismissed though he was not to start till the next morning old mr bentons door was open when ben returned what brings you home so soon he inquired i am going to montreal said ben come in and tell me about it the old man clad in a ragged dressinggown was sitting in a rockingchair by the fire the day was not cold but his blood was thin and he felt the need of some artificial heat he was smoking a common clay pipe isnt this sudden your going to montreal asked mr benton yes sir i think young mr porter has made business there in order to give a chance to go what do you mean to do i shall attend first to the business of the firm and then call on this lawyer mr brief it is well thought of and benjamin try to get a chance to see the new heir mr tremlett and find out what use he is making of his property yes sir i will have you money enough to pay your expenses benjamin asked the old man rather hesitatingly oh yes sir the firm provides for that to be sure of course they ought to do it said mr benton appearing to feel relieved how long do you expect to be gone benjamin i dont know sir i am to stop in burlington and one or two other places i may be gone ten days i shall feel lonely without you benjamin i am glad you value my society so much i am a lonely man benjamin i have never had many friends and i have outlived nearly all of those you ought to have married mr benton then you would have children and grandchildren to comfort you in your old age i wish i had benjamin but it is too late now it is never too late to mend mr benton said ben men older than you have married then they were fools said mr benton bluntly suppose you should be sick sir i would hire a nurse i am not rich but i have enough to provide for the few years i have remaining i must ask you to excuse me now sir said ben i must buy a few things which i shall need ben wrote briefly to his aunt to let her know that he was about to start for montreal mrs bradford was not a little discomposed its tempting providence to send a child like benjamin to a foreign country she remarked to mrs perkins who had dropped in for a neighborly chat do you know how far it is mrs perkins about a thousand miles answered her visitor whose ideas about geography were rather misty suppose ben should lose his way like as not he will observed mrs perkins i shant sleep a wink till ben gets back they ought to have sent somebody with him ben can get along said tony who had implicit confidence in his big cousin he wont get lost what does a child like you know about it said mrs perkins rebukingly you shouldnt put in your oar when your mother and me are talking chapter xxxiv solomon brief on his arrival in montreal ben ascertained where mr briefs office was but deferred going to see him he felt very properly that he ought to attend to the business of his employers first and then when he could do so without detriment to their interests look after his own he was very anxious to succeed he knew very well that jones porter had serious doubts about the expediency of sending so young a representative to montreal in calling upon different booksellers he exerted himself to the utmost though but sixteen his address was pleasing his manner selfpossessed and he was courteous and gentlemanly so that he won favorable regards of those with whom he had business relations the result was that he received quite a number of orders which he at once sent forward by mail thus three days were spent on the morning of the fourth he called at the office of solomon brief what do you want boy asked a clerk i want to see mr brief his time is too valuable to be taken up by boys if i had a clerk like you i would soon get rid of him you would hey blustered the young man advancing threateningly ben didnt budge and the clerk stopped short did you say you came on business he inquired that i will tell mr brief said ben firmly you are from the states arent you yes that accounts for your impudence i should know you were not from the states why because you are so uncivil look here young fellow youd better clear out if you dont want to get kicked out who is to do the kicking i am i wouldnt advise you to try it why not it wouldnt be prudent ho ho laughed the clerk sarcastically once more said ben i request you to announce me to mr brief he is executor of mr baldwins estate i believe yes why didnt you tell me that was your business i couldnt see that it mattered to you at this moment the inner door opened and a tall man with reddish hair and muttonchop whiskers of the same hue made his appearance whats this frederic who is this boy i wish to see you on business connected with mr baldwins estate sir said ben but this young man appears to have an objection to the interview why dont you bring him in i didnt suppose he had any business with you who constituted you a judge of that sir hereafter leave me to decide boy come in mr brief threw himself into an office chair well who are you he asked my name is benjamin bradford well you wrote a letter to my aunt mrs jane bradford of milltown massachusetts not long since exactly do you represent her i do very well did you bring the three hundred dollars which she owes to the estate of my client no sir what then i came to repeat what i have written you that my aunt was authorized to occupy the house rentfree it was hardly worth while to come so far to say that said mr brief with a sneer i am here in montreal on other business and have taken the opportunity to see you about my own indeed then you are a business man i represent the firm of jones porter publishers humph cant they get any one but a boy to represent them that sir is their business he answered emphatically i have not chosen to inquire whether my uncle could not have found a better lawyer to act as executor you are impudent young man exclaimed solomon brief his face being as red for the moment as his hair we have neither of us been overcivil said ben suppose we come back to business come now youre a cool one perhaps i am i have always understood that coolness is desirable in business may i inquire of what disease my uncle died it would serve you right if i declined to answer your questions after your impudence to me however i will overlook it this time your uncle committed suicide good gracious ejaculated ben who was quite unprepared for this announcement how did he do it he drowned himself what could possibly have driven him to it of that we are ignorant he left a letter at his lodgings directing me to open and carry out the provisions of his will which he had deposited with me may i ask what were the provisions of his will you seem to be curious i have a right to be my aunt and myself are among his nearest relations if not the nearest we had a right to suppose that we might be remembered in his will you were not you can understand that we wish at all events to know the contents of the will we should have been apprised of his death sooner as a lawyer mr brief understood that ben was in the right and he produced a copy of the will the will was brief the entire estate of the deceased was left to john tremlett with this provision that for the first year only the income should be paid to him afterward he was to come into full possession it seems regular said ben of course it is regular i helped him make the will who is mr tremlett i never heard of him a second or third cousin he was a sort of adopted son of mr baldwin just here the inner door opened by the clerk who announced mr tremlett sir chapter xxxv john tremlett john tremlett was a darkcomplexioned young man rather above the middle height he was by no means handsome but plain faces are often attractive and this young mans was not his eyes were bloodshot and even bens inexperienced glance could detect the marks of dissipation he was expensively dressed and looked like one who made a business of spending money how are you brief he said carelessly throwing himself into a chair in better condition than you are i judge from your looks mr tremlett responded the lawyer i hope so i feel awfully seedy said tremlett your own fault you shouldnt keep such late hours oh bother that brief i must have a good time you dont look as if you were enjoying your mode of life oh i shall be all right when i get over my headache is this a client of yours glancing at ben hes a relation of yours according to his own account said mr brief is he inquired tremlett languidly cant say i ever saw him before mr baldwin was my greatuncle said ben that is he was an uncle of my aunt mrs jane bradford indeed were you expecting a share of the property asked tremlett suspiciously i thought mr baldwin might remember his niece he hasnt though so i find by the will sorry for you but of course mr baldwin had a right to dispose of his property as he saw fit i dont deny his right then you are not intending to dispute the will said tremlett relieved i never dreamed of doing it i came about a house which my aunt has been occupying rentfree what is it brief do i know about it its a small house in milltown massachusetts which belongs to your uncles estate i found that mrs bradford has paid no rent for it during the last five years and accordingly sent her an invitation to pay up arrears has she done it no sir said ben mr baldwin permitted her to occupy the house rentfree that is your assertion said the lawyer it is true returned ben quickly show it to me in writing and that will end all dispute i hope yet to do it but thus far we have been unable to find uncle matthews letter thats all fair said tremlett if the letter cant be found the money must be paid my aunt is utterly unable to pay it she is poor that is no excuse in law my young friend said mr brief she must borrow the money then where asked ben that is not our lookout as you are in business perhaps you will advance the necessary sum if i were able and were satisfied of the justice of the claim i would do so answered ben but i dont believe that uncle matthew intended that my aunt should be distressed by such a demand why should he have let the rent run on for five years if he expected her to pay it cant say im sure how much is due asked tremlett three hundred dollars said brief look here young fellow said tremett perhaps you and i can settle it if you will pay me two hundred dollars cash down i will give you a receipt for the whole mr tremlett said mr brief stiffly you appear to forget that i am settling this estate you have no authority to make such an offer wasnt the property left to me i should like to know demanded tremlett blustering yes then why am i not authorized to make the offer tell me that according to mr baldwins will you can only receive the income for the first twelve months thats deuced hard on a fellow said tremlett on the other hand i think it is a prudent precaution the old man was a tightfisted old curmudgeon he only wanted to annoy me the lawyer shrugged his shoulders and ben broke out indignantly i wouldnt speak in that way of a man who had left me all his fortune mind your own business boy retorted john tremlett sharply do you think i am going to stand your impudence i think it is just as well you have waited till after uncle matthews death before speaking of him in that way dont let up on the boy make him pay every cent of the debt brief exclaimed john tremlett angrily of course we shall follow up the matter mr tremlett have him arrested if he doesnt pay brief ben smiled you seem to forget mr tremlett that i am not your debtor the claim is against my aunt is that so brief the boy is right i am sorry for it i should like to hold him responsible no doubt mr tremlett said ben but we cant always have our wishes granted leave the matter in my hands said the lawyer i will do what is best by the way brief said john tremlett i mustnt forget my errand i want some money some money i gave you two hundred dollars last week well its gone and i want some more mr tremlett said the lawyer gravely are you aware how much money you have spent during the last four weeks no i have kept no account well i have you have drawn eight hundred dollars it costs something to see life perhaps so but i cannot permit you to exceed your income during the first year at least thus far you have spent twice as much as you were entitled to draw ben listened attentively he had no idea of the extent of his uncles property if it yielded four hundred dollars a month as he inferred it must amount to nearly if not quite a hundred thousand dollars and this young man was not content with that our hero could not help wondering at his unreasonableness i dont see how i can economize muttered tremlett what was your income before mr baldwins death mr tremlett inquired mr brief i starved on eight hundred dollars a year then it seems to me you aught to live comfortably now on five thousand my circumstances are changed at this rate youll run through the property in ten years oh ill pull up after awhile said the heir carelessly so just give me a couple of hundreds old fellow i will hand you a hundred said mr brief reluctantly hereafter you must keep within your allowance youre getting to be as miserly as the old man said tremlett whats your name boy my name is benjamin bradford i suppose we are cousins or something of that sort come out and take a drink no thank you i never drink you dont what a prig you must be goodbye brief the heir left the office and mr brief turned to ben what do you think of your uncles heir he inquired i think he is going to ruin rapidly answered ben you are right the grub has become a butterfly and the sober clerk has developed into a gay spendthrift he was your uncles clerk and distant relative it would make the old man turn in his coffin if he knew how quickly his money is likely to melt away cant you check him asked ben for twelve months i can after that i am powerless i wish he were more like you thank you said ben surprised at the compliment my bark is worse that my bite said the lawyer about this claim against your aunt i will do what i can for you but try to find the letter you refer to the sum is a small one it is large to us just so but my client would squander it in a week let me hear from you after you have returned and instituted a further search thank you sir i will write ben left the office judging mr brief more favorably than at first with john tremlett he was disgusted chapter xxxvi a surprising discovery i suppose i have done all i can said ben to himself there will be no object in remaining in montreal any longer he immediately purchased a ticket and took the next train homeward he arrived in boston at midday he went at once to the store and was cordially welcomed by the bookkeeper i am glad to see you ben said the young man my uncle is well pleased with the orders you have sent home then he is satisfied with me i leave him to tell you that you can go at once into the countingroom ben reported himself as directed welcome back ben said the old gentleman have you just arrived i reached the station twenty minuets ago sir and came directly to the store i like that how do you like drumming it requires patience sir but i like it i hope you are satisfied with me you have exceeded my anticipations to be candid with you i doubted the expedience of sending so young a representative i know that sir and it made me work harder i should have no hesitation in sending you again in fact i shall probably send you next month to new york and philadelphia i should like that very much sir said ben his eyes sparkling i shall try to satisfy you i think you will said his employer kindly i never doubted your fidelity now i feel assured of your capacity and tact have you any orders not yet reported two or three small ones sir give them to me this done mr porter dismissed ben for the day you need not report for work till tomorrow morning ben was glad to go to his boardinghouse on arriving there he received another cordial greeting this time from mr benton the old gentleman seemed really delighted to see him and eager to learn what he had accomplished ben began to speak of the orders he had received but mr benton interrupted him i dont mean that he said i want to hear about your own affairs did you see mr brief the lawyer yes sir how did you like him not at all at first but better before we parted how was that asked mr benton showing some curiosity at first he insisted strongly on the claim the estate has against my aunt but after awhile he said he should not press the matter at present and recommended us to look for uncle matthews letter you have searched for it have you not asked mr benton yes sir but so far without success still i havent given up all hope of finding it my motto is wait and hope i think it will all come out right said the old man did you see john tremlett yes sir tell me about him said the old man eagerly ho does he look he looks like a fast young man answered ben i did not like him at all do you think he is spending money fast i know he is how much money do you think he has drawn in a month two hundred dollars suggested mr benton he had drawn eight hundred and spent it all for he came into the office to ask for more the young scoundrel exclaimed marcus benton with an excitement which ben could not understand why he is making ducks and drakes of my old friends fortune did you know uncle matthew asked ben quickly yes answered the old man i told you so didnt i no sir you never told me that do you know john tremlett yes i have seen him he was a sober steady young man apparently who ingratiated himself with mr baldwin whom he deceived as to his real character what relation was he to uncle matthew very distant but he seemed near having been in his employ for several years he collected rents and attended to other necessary matters if he was ever sober and steady he has changed a good deal did mr brief give him the money he asked for not all he wanted he gave him one hundred dollars and reminded him that he was only at liberty to pay over to him the income of the estate that is for the first twelve months quite right murmured mr benton he lectured him upon his extravagance and fast life and warned him that he must check himself he did right what i dislike most about this john tremlett was the way in which he spoke of uncle matthew said ben how did he speak of him demanded marcus benton quickly as a tightfisted old curmudgeon he did the young viper exclaimed the old man indignantly spoke so of the man who left him his fortune yes sir i couldnt help telling him i thought it not very becoming to speak in that way of his benefactor and he told me to mind my own business i wouldnt have believed john tremlett would act so said mr benton slowly i trusted him so and always treated him kindly you trusted him repeated ben astonished my boy said mr benton the time has come for me to throw off the mask i am not marcus benton as you suppose i am matthew baldwin but i thought mr baldwin was dead committed suicide exclaimed ben in wild amazement the world thinks so but the world is mistaken i will tell you the whole story i found myself getting old in all probability i had but a few years to live by industry and economy i had accumulated a fortune which i must leave behind me i was anxious that it should not be squandered i selected john tremlett as my heir so far as i knew he was devoted to my interests and he seemed steady in his habits but it occurred to me to try him accordingly i sent a letter to my lawyer solomon brief who had my will in his possession announcing my intention to commit suicide and directing him to open the will and carry out the provisions then i left montreal secretly staying a short time in northern vermont later i came on to boston and managed to throw myself in your way not knowing me you treated me with kindness and consideration i became interested in you and regretted that i had made no provision for you and your aunt through you i have learned how unwisely i disposed of my fortune thank heaven it is not too late to remedy that this seems like a romance mr benton i mean uncle matthew yes call me uncle i like to feel that i have somebody to live for come out to milltown with me uncle matthew aunt jane will be delighted to see you said ben i have work to do first said the old man firmly i must go to montreal and you must go with me i am not sure that jones porter will allow me then throw up your situation you shall lose nothing by it when do you wish to start tonight said mr baldwin resolutely then i must go to the store at once and give notice of my absence ben lost no time in going to the store he explained matters fully and obtained a weeks leave of absence then he bought tickets for his uncle and himself and they set out on their long journey chapter xxxvii the dead alive mr brief was considerably surprised when ben entered his office i thought you had gone back to boston he said i have been back to boston mr brief and returned to montreal on business didnt you finish up your business here i thought so sir but i was mistaken i am afraid you are not a very good manager it looks to me like waste of time what can i do for you a gentleman came with me who thinks he would like to have you attend to a little business for him certainly responded the lawyer bruskly i shall be happy to wait on him where is he staying at the windsor and you recommended me i am much obliged to you what is the gentlemans name marcus benton cant say i ever heard of him is he from boston he comes from boston answered ben evasively in the hope of securing a profitable client mr brief lost no time in seeking the hotel remain here a moment said ben as they entered the office and i will let mr benton know you are here certainly said the lawyer complacently in five minutes ben reappeared follow me if you please mr brief he said by the way mr benton says he knows you mr benton knows me it is strange i cant recall him said mr brief trying to recollect i think you will remember when you see him possibly but i have no recollection on any gentleman of that name ben and his uncle to give him a name not strictly warranted by facts occupied two rooms adjoining ben ushered the lawyer into his own room saying mr brief you must prepare for a surprise when however the socalled marcus benton entered the room mr brief sprang to his feet in great amazement can i believe my eyes he ejaculated i think you can mr brief said the old gentleman quietly you are matthew baldwin precisely and you are not dead do i look as if i were asked mr baldwin smiling what does it all mean asked mr brief bewildered it means that i wished to try john tremlett i wished to ascertain whether he were worthy to inherit my fortune what is your opinion my opinion said the lawyer is that he would run through the property in five years i am disgusted with him how does he spend his money inquired mr baldwin in every kind of extravagance and every form of dissipation at the rate he is going on it is a question in my mind whether he or the property would last longer i got that idea from my young friend here who by the way knew of me only as marcus benton when he came first to see you of course you will resume possession of the property mr baldwin such is my intention i can give it back into your hands entire with the exception of nine hundred dollars drawn by tremlett and your funeral expenses my funeral expense exclaimed mr baldwin in surprise yes a body was found in the st lawrence which was supposed to be yours it was buried with proper ceremony the old man smiled but there was a certain sadness in the smile it is perhaps only anticipating things a little he said the expenses shall be allowed of course you wish mr tremlett to be informed without delay yes he is to come to my office in an hour can you let me witness the interview yes sir you can conceal yourself in the inner room and i will see him in the outer office with the door ajar an hour later john tremlett swaggered into mr briefs office brief said he i must have some money have you used up the hundred dollars i gave you four days since every cent i am afraid you squandered it that is my business brief you remember the warning i gave you at that time come brief you cant expect to keep me in leadingstrings i am seeing life and of course i must pay for it a pretty round sum too oh well i am making up for lost time old baldwin kept me so close that i had to live like a hermit for years he starved me on eight hundred dollars a year the stingy old file apparently you want to live at the rate of ten thousand dollars a year now mr tremlett well i can afford it for a year or two you seem to forget that your income for the first year is not quite five thousand then my creditors must wait i am going to have my fling it would make mr baldwin turn in his coffin if he were to know how you are wasting his substance very likely it would said tremlett laughing heartily but theres one comfort he cant come back to trouble us dont be too sure of that john tremlett said a voice which struck terror to tremletts heart and mathew baldwin walked out of the inner office the young mans face turned as pale as ashes and his knees knocked together in his fright is it you mr baldwin he ejaculated yes it is i your benefactor the stingy old file as you so gratefully call me answered the old man sternly then you are not dead not at present how long i may live i cannot say but long enough i hope to do an act of justice i am very sorry stammered tremlett forgive me sir i may forgive you because nothing has happened that cannot be remedied but i shall never again trust you wont you take me back into your service sir entreated john tremlett desperately never said mr baldwin emphatically what will become of me ejaculated the miserable young man shedding maudlin tears i am penniless i will not wholly cast you off i will authorize mr brief to pay you eight hundred dollars during the next year in monthly installments i hope you will turn over a new leaf i will sir i will indeed said tremlett but mr baldwin knowing his past hypocrisy did not put much faith in his penitence i hope so for your own sake he said briefly you can go now sir at the end of a month you can come back and mr brief will pay you your monthly allowance how can i live till then asked tremlett cant he pay it sooner i have but a dollar left sell some of your jewelry that diamond ring for instance it will maintain you till the money is payable john tremlett left the office crestfallen and cursing his foolish prodigality which had lost him a fine fortune what are your plans mr baldwin asked the lawyer shall you remain in montreal no mr brief there is nothing to keep me here now i shall make my home in the states this boy i have tested and found to be true gold he will not deceive me as john tremlett has with him and his aunt i propose to make my home for the little time i have left a very fine boy said mr brief regarding ben in quite a different light now that he was indirectly acknowledged to be a rich mans heir i shall leave you to manage my property here mr brief for the present at least you will transmit the income to me as it accrues you shall not repent your confidence sir said the lawyer how soon do you leave the city tomorrow will that suit you ben oh yes uncle matthew he is a lucky boy thought mr brief as the two went out his future is provided for chapter xxxviii conclusion ben said mr baldwin let us talk over your plans do you wish to remain at the store or would you like to get a better education i would get a better education if i could afford it sir you can afford it on an income of a thousand dollars a year a thousand dollars a year exclaimed ben that is the income i shall allow you out of this you will be expected to pay all of your expenses how can i thank you sir would you object to my giving aunt jane a part of the money yes i shall object bens countenance fell but uncle matthew he said i dont like to live in luxury while aunt jane is straitened your feelings do you credit my boy but i mean to take care of your aunt jane myself she is my niece and you i am not sure whether you are related to me at all but i want you to call me uncle matthew all the same i shall like to sir no uncle could be kinder that is well said the old gentleman you know ben i have no one else to care for now do you think your aunt jane will be willing to move to boston i am sure she will like it then i shall hire or buy a comfortable house install her as mistress require you to live with me while you are attending school and tyrannize over you all there was a bright smile on the old mans face he was looking forward to the new life with anticipations of a happiness and comfort which had long been strangers to him how happy we shall all be uncle matthew even aunt jane will forget to look on the dark side i hope so ben i think we can be happy together there is one thing i forgot to tell you he said later i shall expect you to pay your board out of your income you know if you fail to make regular payments we shall have to bundle you out i will remember said ben smiling by arrangement ben went up to milltown alone to tell his aunt the news he entered the little house with a sober face i see you bring bad news benjamin said mrs bradford mournfully you will have to leave the house aunt jane and go to the poorhouse i knew it would turn out that way and mrs bradford put her handkerchief to her eyes whats the matter asked tony
