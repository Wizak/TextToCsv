bursting from their brows jamie and mr wilkes carried camillia like a lady pope sailing high in her sedanchair cot eyes clenched shut praying careful screamed mrs wilkes ah shes dead no there put her down easy and at last the bed was tilted against the house front so that the river of humanity surging by could see camillia a large pale bartolemy doll put out like a prize in the sun fetch a quill

crowd clamored drawn by the others aching to advise their favorite swig recommend some country site where it rained less and shone more sun than in all england or your south of france old men and women especial doctors as all the aged are clashed by each other in bristles of canes in phalanxes of crutches and hobble sticks back cried mrs wilkes alarmed theyll crush my daughter like a spring

grinning son there it will buy me a fine black funeral coach said the pale girl hush did you imagine family so many people two hundred would pay to give us their opinion yes said mrs wilkes wives husbands children are deaf to each other so people gladly pay to have someone listen poor things each today thought he and he alone knew quinsy dropsy glanders could tell the slaver from the hives so

father said jamie of two hundred remedies which one is true i care not whispered carillia sighing it grows dark my stomach is queasy from listening to the names may i be taken upstairs yes dear jamie lift please said a voice halfbent the men looked up there stood a dustman of no particular size or shape his face masked with soot from which shone waterblue eyes and a white slot of an ivory smile dust sifted from his sleeves and his pants as he moved as he talked quietly nodding i couldnt get through the mob earlier he said holding his dirty cap in his hands now going home here i am must i pay no dustman you need not said camillia gently hold on protested mr wilkes but camillia gave him a soft look and he grew silent thank you maam the dustmans smile flashed like warm sunlight in the growing dusk i have but one advice he gazed at camillia she gazed at him be this saint boscos eve sir ma am who knows not me sir said mr wilkes i think it is saint boscos eve sir also it is the night of the full moon so said the dustman humbly unable to take his eyes from the lovely haunted girl you must leave your daughter out in the light of that rising moon out under the moon said mrs wilkes doesnt that make the lunatic asked jamie beg pardon sir the dustman bowed but the full moon soothes all sick animal be they human or plain field beast there is a serenity of color a quietude of touch a sweet sculpturing of mind and body in full moonlight it may rain said the mother uneasily i swear said the dustman quickly my sister suffered this same swooning paleness we set her like a potted lily out one spring night with the moon she lives today in sussex the soul of reconstituted health reconstituted moonlight and will cost us not one penny of the four hundred we collected this day mother jamie camillia no said mrs wilkes i wont have it mother said camillia she looked earnestly at the dustman from his grimed face the dustman gazed back his smile like a little scimitar in the dark mother said camillia i feel it the moon will cure me it will it will the mother sighed this is not my day nor night let me kiss you for the last time then there and the mother went upstairs now the dustman backed off bowing courteously to all all night now remember beneath the moon not the slightest disturbance until dawn sleep well young lady dream and dream the best good night soot was lost in soot the man was gone mr wilkes and jamie kissed camillias brow father jamie she said dont worry and she was left alone to stare off where at a great distance she thought she saw a smile hung by itself in the dark blink off and on then go round a corner vanishing she waited for the rising of the moon night in london the voices growing drowsier in the inns the slamming of doors drunken farewells clocks chiming camillia saw a cat like a woman stroll by in her furs saw a woman like a cat stroll by both wise both egyptian both smelling of spice every quarter hour or so a voice drifted down from above you all right child yes father camillia mother jamie im fine and at last good night good night the last lights out london asleep the moon rose and the higher the moon the larger grew camillias eyes as she watched the alleys the courts the streets until at last at midnight the moon moved over her to show her like a marble figure atop an ancient tomb a motion in darkness camillia pricked her ears a faint melody sprang out on the air a man stood in the shadows of the court camillia gasped the man stepped forth into moonlight carrying a lute which he strummed softly he was a man welldressed whose face was handsome and now anyway solemn a troubadour said camillia aloud the man his finger on his lips moved slowly forward and soon stood by her cot what are you doing out so late asked the girl unafraid but not knowing why a friend sent me to make you well he touched the lute strings they hummed sweetly he was indeed handsome there in the silver light that cannot be she said for it was told me the moon is my cure and so it will be maiden what songs do you sing songs of spring nights aches and ailments without name shall i name your fever maiden if you know it yes first the symptoms raging temperatures sudden cold heart fast then slow storms of temper then sweet calms drunkenness from having sipped only well water dizziness from being touched only thus he touched her wrist saw her melt toward delicious oblivion drew back depressions elations he went on dreams stop she cried enthralled you know me to the letter now name my ailment i will he pressed his lips to the palm of her hand so she quaked suddenly the name of the ailment is camillia wilkes how strange she shivered her eyes glinting lilac fires am i then my own affliction how sick i make myself even now feel my heart i feel it so my limbs they burn with summer heat yes they scorch my fingers but now the night wind see how i shudder cold i die i swear it i die i will not let you he said quietly are you a doctor then no just your plain your ordinary physician like another who guessed your trouble this day the girl who would have named it but ran off in the crowd yes i saw in her eyes she knew what had seized me but now my teeth chatter and no extra blanket give room please there let me see two arms two legs head and body im all here what sir to warm you from the night of course how like a hearth oh sir sir do i know you your name swiftly above her his head shadowed hers from it his merry clearwater eyes glowed as did his white ivory slot of a smile why bosco of course he said is there not a saint by that name given an hour you will call me so yes his head bent closer thus sooted in shadow she cried with joyous recognition to welcome her dustman back the world spins i pass away the cure sweet doctor or all is lost the cure he said and the cure is this somewhere cats sang a shoe shot from a window tipped them off a fence then all was silence and the moon shh dawn tiptoeing downstairs mr and mrs wilkes peered into their courtyard frozen stone dead from the terrible night i know it no wife look alive roses in her cheeks no more peaches persimmons she glows all rosymilky sweet camillia alive and well made whole again they bent by the slumbering girl she smiles she dreams whats that she says the sovereign sighed the girl remedy what what the girl smiled again a white smile in her sleep a medicine she murmured for melancholy she opened her eyes oh mother father daughter child come upstairs no she took their hands tenderly mother father yes no one will see the sun but rises please dance with me they did not want to dance but celebrating they knew not what they did
