waiting for nick by nora roberts chapter one she was a woman with a mission her move from west virginia to new york had a series of purposes outlined carefully in her mind she would find the perfect place to live become a success in her chosen field and get her man preferably but not necessarily in that order frederica kimball was she liked to think a flexible woman as she walked down the sidewalk on the east side in the earlyspring twilight she thought of home the house in shepherdstown west virginia with her parents and siblings was to freddies mind the perfect place to live rambling noisy full of music and voices she doubted that she could have left it if she hadnt known she would always be welcomed back with open arms it was true that she had been to new york many times and had ties there as well but she already missed the familiarвђher own room tucked into the second story of the old stone house the love and companionship of her siblings her fathers music her mothers laugh but she wasnt a child any longer she was twentyfour and long past the age to begin to make her own in any case she reminded herself she was very much at home in manhattan after all shed spent the first few years of her life there and much of her life in the years after had included visitsвђbut all with family she acknowledged well this time she thought straightening her shoulders she was on her own and she had a job to do the first order of business would be to convince a certain nicholas lebeck that he needed a partner the success and reputation hed accumulated as a composer over the past few years would only increase with her beside him as his lyricist already just by closing her eyes and projecting she could envision the lebeckkimball name in lights on the great white way she had only to let her imagination bloom to have the music they would write flow like a river through her head now all she had to do she thought with a wry smile was convince nick to see and hear the same thing she could if necessary use family loyalty to persuade him they were in a roundabout way semicousins kissing cousins she thought now while her eyes lighted with a smile that was her final and most vital mission before she was done nick would fall as desperately in love with her as she was had always been with him shed waited ten years for him and that to freddies mind was quite long enough its past time nick she decided tugging on the hem of her royal blue blazer to face your fate still nerves warred with confidence as she stood outside the door of lower the boom the popular neighborhood bar belonged to zack muldoon nicks brother stepbrother technically but freddies family had always been more into affection than terminology the fact that zack had married freddies stepmothers sister made the stanislaskimuldoonkimballlebeck families one convoluted clan freddies longtime dream had been to forge another loop in that family chain linking her and nick she took a deep breath tugged on her blazer again ran her hands over the reddishgold mop of curls she could never quite tame and wished once hopelessly that she had just a dash of the stanislaskis exotic good looks then she reached for the door shed make do with what she had and make damned sure it was enough the air in lower the boom carried the yeasty scent of beer overlaid with the rich spicy scent of marinara freddie decided that rio zacks longtime cook must have a pasta special going on the juke dion was warning his fellow man about the fickle heart of runaround sue everything was there everything in place the cozy paneled walls the seafaring motif of brass bells and nautical gear the long scarred bar and the gleaming glassware but no nick still she smiled as she walked to the bar and slid onto a padded stool buy me a drink sailor distracted zack glanced up from drawing a draft his easy smile widened instantly into a grin freddieвђhey i didnt think you were coming in until the end of the week i like surprises i like this kind expertly zack slid the mug of beer down the bar so that it braked between the waiting hands of his patron then he leaned over caught freddies face in both of his big hands and gave her a loud smacking kiss pretty as ever you too and he was she thought in the ten years since shed met him hed only improved like good whiskey with age the dark hair was still thick and curling and the deep blue eyes were magnetic and his face she thought with a sigh tanned tough with laugh lines only enhancing its character and charm more than once in her life freddie had wondered how it was that she was surrounded by physically stunning people hows rachel her honor is terrific freddies lips curved at the use of the title and the affection behind it zacks wifeвђher auntвђwas now a criminal court judge were all so proud of her did you see the trick gavel mama sent her the one that makes this crashingglass sound when you bop something with it seen it his grin was quick and crooked she bops me with it regularly its something having a judge in the family his eyes twinkled and she looks fabulous in those black robes i bet how about the kids the terrible trio theyre great want a soda amused freddie tilted her head what are you going to card me zack im twentyfour remember rubbing his chin he studied her the small build and chinadoll skin would probably always be deceiving if he hadnt known her age as well as the age of his own children he would have asked for id i just cant take it in little freddie all grown up since i amвђ she crossed her legs and settled in вђwhy dont you pour me a white wine coming up long experience had him reaching behind him for the proper glass without looking howre your folks the kids everybodys good and everyone sends their love she took the glass zack handed her and lifted it in a toast to family zack tapped a squat bottle of mineral water against her glass so what are your plans honey oh ive got a few of them she smiled into her wine before she sipped and wondered what he would think if she mentioned that the biggest plan of her life was to woo his younger brother the first is to find an apartment you know you can stay with us as long as you want i know or with grandma and papa or mikhail and sydney or alex and bess she smiled again it was a comfort to know she was surrounded by people who loved her butвђ i really want a place of my own she propped her elbow on the bar its time i think for a little adventure when he started to speak she grinned and shook her head at him youre not going to lecture are you uncle zack not you the boy who went to sea she had him there he thought hed been a great deal younger than twentyfour when he shipped out for the first time okay no lecture but im keeping my eye on you im counting on it freddie sat back and rocked a little on the stool then askedвђcasually she hopedвђso whats nick up to i thought i might run into him here hes around in the kitchen i think shoveling in some of rios pasta special she sniffed the air for effect smells great i think ill just wander on back and say hi go ahead and tell nick were waiting for him to play for his supper ill do that she carried her wine with her and firmly resisted the urge to fuss with her hair or tug on her jacket again her attitude toward her looks was one of resignation cute was the best shed ever been able to do with her combination of small build and slight stature long ago shed given up on the fantasy that she would blossom into anything that could be termed lush or glamorous added to a petite figure was madly curling hair that was caught somewhere between gold and red a dusting of freckles over a pert nose wide gray eyes and dimples in her teenage years shed pined for sleek and sophisticated or wild and wanton curvy and cunning freddie liked to think that with maturity shed accepted herself as she was but there were still moments when she mourned being a lifesize kewpie doll in a family of renaissance sculptures then again she reminded herself if she wanted nick to take her seriously as a woman she had to take herself seriously first with that in mind she pushed open the kitchen door and her heart jolted straight into her throat there was nothing she could do about it it had been the same every time she saw him from the first time shed seen him to the last everything shed ever wanted everything shed ever dreamed of was sitting at the kitchen table hunkered over a plate of fettuccine marinara nicholas lebeck the bad boy her aunt rachel had defended with passion and conviction in the courts the troubled youth who had been guided away from the violence of street gangs and back alleys by love and care and the discipline of family he was a man now but he still carried some of the rebellion and wildness of his youth in his eyes she thought her pulse humming those wonderful stormy green eyes he still wore his hair long pulled back into a stubby ponytail of dark bronzed blond he had a poets mouth a boxers chin and the hands of an artist shed spent many nights fantasizing about those longfingered widepalmed hands once she got beyond the face with its fascinating hint of cheekbones and its slightly crooked noseвђbroken years ago by her own sharp line drive which hed tried unsuccessfully to fieldвђshe could with pleasure move on he was built like a runner long rangy and wore old gray jeans white at the knees his shirtsleeves were rolled up to the elbow and missing a button as he ate he carried on a running commentary with the huge black cook while rio shook the grease out of a basket of french fries i didnt say there was too much garlic i said i like a lot of garlic nick forked in another bite as if to back up his statement getting pretty damned temperamental in your old age pal nick added his voice slightly muffled by the generous amount of pasta hed just swallowed rios mild goodnatured oath carried the music of the islands dont tell me about old skinny boyвђi can still beat hell out of you im shaking grinning nick broke off a hunk of garlic bread just as freddie let the door swing shut behind her his eyes lighted with pleasure as he dropped the bread again and pushed back from the table hey rio look whos here hows it going fred he crossed over to give her a casual brotherly hug then his brows drew together as the body that pressed firmly against his reminded him uncomfortably that little fred was a woman ahвђ he backed off still smiling but his hands dipped cautiously into his pockets i thought you were coming in later in the week i changed my mind her confidence lifted a full notch at his reaction hi rio freddie set her wineglass aside so that she could properly return the bear hug she was enveloped in little doll sit down and eat i think i will i thought about your cooking rio all the way up on the train she sat smiled and held out a hand to nick come sit down your foods getting cold yeah he took her hand gave it a quick squeeze then let it go as he settled beside her so how is everybody brandon still kicking butt on the baseball diamond batting leading the high school league in home runs and rbis she let out a long sigh as rio set a large plate in front of her katies last ballet recital was really lovely mama cried of course but then she tears up when brand hits a fourbagger you know her toy store was just featured in the washington post and dads just finishing a new composition she twirled pasta onto her fork so how are things with you theyre fine working on anything ive got another broadway thing coming up he shrugged it was still hard for him to let people know when something mattered you should have won the tony for last stop being nominated was cool she shook her head it wasnt enough for himвђor for her it was a fabulous score nick is a fabulous score she corrected since the musical was still playing to full houses were all so proud of you well its a living dont make his head bigger than it is rio warned from his stove hey i caught you humming this once nick noted with a grin rio moved his massive shoulders in dismissal so maybe one or two of the tunes werent bad eat are you working with anyone yet freddie asked on the new score no its just in the preliminary stages ive hardly gotten started myself that was exactly what shed wanted to hear i read somewhere that michael lorrey was committed to another project youll need a new lyricist yeah nick frowned as he scooped up more pasta its too bad i liked working with him there are too many people out there who dont hear the music just their own words that would be a problem freddie agreed clearing a path for herself you need someone with a solid music background who hears words in the melody exactly he picked up his beer and started to drink what you need nick is me freddie said firmly nick swallowed hastily set his beer down and looked at freddie as though she had suddenly stopped speaking english huh ive been studying music all my life it was a struggle but she kept the eagerness out of her voice and spoke matteroffactly one of my first memories is of sitting on my fathers lap with his hands over mine on the piano keys but to his disappointment composing isnt my first love words are i could write your words nick better than anyone else her eyes gray and calm and smiling met his because i not only understand your music i understand you so what do you think he shifted in his chair blew out a breath i dont know what to think fred this is kind of out of left field i dont know why you know ive written lyrics for some of dads compositions and a few others besides she broke off a piece of bread chewed it thoughtfully it seems to me to be a very logical comfortable solution all around im looking for work youre looking for a lyricist yeah but it made him nervous the idea of working with her to be honest hed have had to admit that in the past few years shed begun to make him nervous so youll think about it she smiled again knowing as the member of a large family the strategic value of an apparent retreat and if you start to like the idea you can run it by the producers i could do that nick said slowly sure i could do that great ill be coming around here off and on or you can reach me at the waldorf the waldorf why are you staying at a hotel just temporarily until i find an apartment you dont know of anything in the area do you i like this neighborhood no iвђi didnt realize you were making this permanent his brows knit again i mean a really permanent move well i am and no before you start im not going to stay with the family im going to find out what its like to live alone youre still upstairs right in zacks old place thats right so if you hear about anything in the neighborhood youll let me know it surprised him that even for a moment he would worry about what her moving to new york would change in his life of course it wouldnt change anything at all i picture you more park avenue i lived on park avenue once she said finishing up the last of her fettuccine im looking for something else and she thought wouldnt it be handy if she found a place close to his she pushed her hair out of her face and tipped back in her chair rio that was sensational if i find a place close by ill be in here for dinner every night maybe well kick nick out and you can move upstairs he winked at her id rather look at you than his ugly face well in the meantimeвђ she rose and kissed rios scarred cheek вђzack wants you to come out when youre done nick and play ill be out in a minute ill tell him maybe ill hang around for a little while and listen bye rio bye doll rio whistled a tune as he moved back to his stove little freddies all grown up pretty as a picture yeah shes okay nick resented the fact that whatever spicy scent shed been wearing was tugging on his senses like a baited hook still wideeyed though she doesnt have a clue what shes going to face in this town in this business so youll look out for her rio thwacked a wooden spoon against his huge palm or i look out for you big talk nick snagged his bottle of beer and sauntered out one of freddies favorite things about new york was that she could walk two blocks in any given direction and see something new a dress in a boutique a face in the crowd a hustler looking for marks she was she knew naive in some waysвђin the ways a woman might be when she had been raised with love and care in a small town she could never claim to have nicks street smarts but she felt she had a good solid dose of common sense she used it to plan her first full day in the city nibbling on her breakfast croissant she studied the view of the city from her hotel window there was a great deal she wanted to accomplish a visit to her uncle mikhail at his art gallery would down two birds she could catch up with him and see if his wife sydney might know of any available apartments through her real estate connections and it wouldnt hurt to drop a bug in his earвђand the ears of other family membersвђthat she was hoping to work with nick on his latest score not really fair fred she told herself and poured a second cup of coffee but love didnt always take fair into account and she would never have applied even this type of benign pressure if she wasnt confident in her own talents as far as her skill with music and lyrics was concerned freddie was more than sure of herself it was only when it came to her ability to attract nick that she faltered but surely once they were working so closely together he would stop seeing her as his little cousin from west virginia shed never be able to compete headon with the sultry striking women he drew to him so freddie thought nodding to herself shed be sneaky and wind her way into his heart through their shared love of music it was all for his own good after all she was the best thing in the world for him all she had to do was make him realize it since there was no time like the present she pushed away from the table and hurried into the bedroom to dress an hour later freddie climbed out of a cab in front of a soho gallery it was a fiftyfifty shot as to whether shed find her uncle in he was just as likely to be at his and sydneys connecticut home sculpting or playing with their children it was every bit as likely he might be helping his father with some carpentry job anywhere in the city with a shrug freddie pulled open the beveledglass door if she missed mikhail here shed scoot over to sydneys office or try the courthouse for rachel failing that she could look up bess at the television studio or alexi at his precinct she could she thought with a smile all but trip over family any direction she took the first thing she noticed inside the small sunny gallery was mikhails work though the piece was new to her she recognized his touch and the subject immediately hed carved his wife in polished mahogany madonnalike sydney held a baby in her arms their youngest freddie knew laurel at sydneys feet three children of various ages and sizes sat walking closer freddie recognized her cousins griff moira and adam unable to resist she trailed a finger over the babys cheek one day she thought she would hold her own child just that way hers and nicks i dont wait for faxes mikhail shouted as he entered the gallery from a back room you wait for faxes i have work but mik came a plaintive voice from inside the room washington saidвђ do i care what washington says i dont think so tell them they can have three pieces no more butвђ no more he repeated and closed the door behind him he muttered to himself in ukrainian as he crossed the gallery words freddie noted with a lifted brow that she wasnt supposed to understand very artistic language uncle mik he broke off in the middle of a very creative oath freddie with a hoot of laughter he hoisted her off the ground as if she weighed no more than a favored rag doll still just a peanut he said kissing her on the way down hows my pretty girl excited to be here and to see you he was like his swearing wild and exotic with the golden eyes and raven hair of the stanislaskis freddie had often thought that if she could paint she would paint each member of her ukrainian family in bold strokes and colors i was just admiring your work she told him its incredibly beautiful its easy to create something beautiful when you have something beautiful to work with he glanced toward the sculpture with love in his eyes for the wood freddie reflected but more much more for the family hed carved in it so youve come to the big city to make your splash i have indeed with a flutter of lashes freddie hooked an arm through his and began to stroll stopping here and there to admire a piece of art im hoping to work with nick on the score hes beginning oh mikhail quirked a brow a man with so many women in his life understood their ways well and appreciated them to write the words for his music exactly wed make a good team dont you think yes but its not what i think is it he smiled when her lips moved into a pout our nick he can be stubborn yes and very hard of head i can knock him in that head if you like her lips curved again before she laughed i hope it wont come to that but ill keep the offer in reserve her eyes changed sharpened and he could see clearly that she wasnt so much the child any longer im good uncle mik musics in my blood the way arts in yours and when you see what you wantвђ i find a way to have it easily accepting her own arrogance she shrugged her shoulders that too was in the blood i want to work with nick i want to help him and im going to and from me you wantвђ family support for a chance to prove myself if it becomes necessary though i have an idea i can convince him without it she tossed her hair back in a gesture mikhail thought very like his sisters what i do want and need is some advice about an apartment i was hoping aunt sydney might have some ideas about a place near lower the boom maybe she does but theres plenty of room with us the children you know how they would love to have you with them and sydneyвђ he caught her expression and sighed i promised your mama i would try natasha she worries she doesnt need to she and dad did a pretty good job of raising the selfreliant type just a small place uncle mik she continued quickly if youd just ask aunt sydney to give me a call at the waldorf maybe she and i can have lunch one day soon if shes got time she always has time for you we all do i know and i intend to make a nuisance of myself i want a place soon before she added with a gleam in her eyes grandma starts conspiring to have me move in with them in brooklyn ive got to go she gave him a quick parting kiss i have another couple of stops to make she darted for the door paused oh and when you talk to mama tell her you tried with a wave she was out on the street and hailing another cab now that her next seed was planted freddie had the cab take her to lower the boom and wait as she went to the rear entrance to ring the security bell moments later nicks very sleepy and irritated voice barked through the intercom still in bed she said cheerfully youre getting too old for the wild life nicholas freddie what the hell time is it ten but whos counting just buzz me in will you ive got something i want you to have ill just leave it on the table downstairs he swore and she heard the sound of something crashing to the floor ill come down no dont bother she didnt think her system could handle facing him when he was halfawake and warm from bed i dont have time to visit anyway just buzz me in and call me later after youve gone over what im leaving for you what is it he demanded as the buzzer sounded instead of answering freddie hurried inside dropped her music portfolio on rios table and raced out again sorry to wake you nick she called into the intercom if youre free tonight well have dinner see you wait a damnвђ but she was already dashing toward the front of the building and her waiting cab she sat back let out a long breath and closed her eyes if he didnt want herвђher talents she correctedвђafter he went through what shed left for him she was back to ground zero think positive she ordered herself straightening she folded her arms take me to saks she told the driver when a woman had a potential date with the man she intended to marry the very least she deserved was a new dress chapter two by the time nick found and dragged on a pair of jeans and stumbled downstairs freddie was long gone he had nothing to curse but the air as he rapped his bare toe against the thick leg of the kitchen table hopping he scowled at the slim leather portfolio shed left behind what the hell was the kid up to he wondered waking him up at dawn leaving mystery packages in the kitchen still grumbling he snatched up the portfolio and headed back up to his apartment he needed coffee to get into his own kitchen he expertly stepped over and maneuvered around discarded newspapers clothing abandoned sheets of music he tossed freddies portfolio on the cluttered counter and coaxed his brain to remember the basic functions of his coffeemaker he wasnt a morning person once the pot was making a hopeful hiss he opened the refrigerator and eyed the contents blearily breakfast was not on the menu at lower the boom and was the only meal he couldnt con out of rio so his choices were limited the minute he sniffed the remains of a carton of milk and gagged he knew cold cereal was out he opted for a candy bar instead fortified with two sources of caffeine he sat down lighted a cigarette then unzipped the portfolio he was set to resent whatever it was that freddie had considered important enough to wake him up for even smalltown rich kids should know that bars didnt close until late and since hed taken over the late shift from his brother nick rarely found his bed before three with a huge yawn he dumped the contents of the portfolio out neatly printed sheet music spilled onto the table figures he thought the kid had the idea stuck in her head that they were going to work together and he knew freddie well enough to understand that when she had something lodged in her brain it took a major crowbar to pry it loose sure she had talent he mused he would hardly expect the daughter of spencer kimball to be tonedeaf but he didnt much care for partnerships in the first place true hed worked well enough with lorrey on last stop but lorrey wasnt a relative and he didnt smell like candycoated sin block that thought lebeck he warned himself and dragged back his disordered hair before he picked up the first sheet that came to hand the least he could do for his little cousin was give her work a look and when he did his brows drew together the music was his own something hed half finished fiddled with on one of the family visits to west virginia he could remember now sitting at the piano in the music room of the big stone house freddie on the bench beside him last summer he wondered the summer before not so long ago he couldnt recall that shed been grown up and that hed had a little trouble whenever she leaned into him or shot him one of those looks with those incredibly big gray eyes nick shook his head rubbed his face and concentrated on the music again shed polished it up he noted and frowned a bit over the idea of someone fooling with his work and shed added lyrics romantic lovestory words that suited the mood of the music it was ever you shed titled it as the tune began to play in his head he gathered up all the sheets and left his halffinished breakfast for the piano in the living room ten minutes later he was on the phone to the waldorf and leaving the first of several messages for miss frederica kimball it was late afternoon before freddie returned to her suite flushed with pleasure and laden with purchases in her opinion shed spent the most satisfying of days shopping lunching with rachel and bess then shopping some more after dumping her bags in the parlor she headed for the phone at this time of day she thought she could catch some if not all of her family at home the blinking message light caught her eye but before she could lift the receiver the phone rang hello damn it fred where have you been all day her lips curved at the sound of nicks voice hi there up and around are you real cute fred ive been trying to get hold of you all day i was about to call alex and have him put out an apb hed pictured her mugged assaulted kidnapped she balanced on one foot toeing off her shoes well if you had hed have told you i spent part of the day having lunch with his wife is there a problem problem no no why would there be a problem even through the phone sarcasm dripped you wake me up at the crack of dawnвђ after ten she corrected and then you run off for hours he continued ignoring her i seem to recall you yelling something about wanting me to call you yes she braced herself grateful he couldnt see her or the hope in her eyes did you have a chance to look at the music i left for you he opened his mouth settled back again and played it cool i gave it a look hed spent hours reading it poring over it playing it its not badвђespecially the parts that are mine even though he couldnt see her her chin shot up its a lot better than not badвђespecially the parts that i polished the gleam in her eyes was pure pride now how about the lyrics they ranged from the poetic to the wickedly wry and had impressed him more than he wanted to admit to either of them youve got a nice touch fred oh be still my heart theyre good okay he released a long breath i dont know what you want me to do about it butвђ why dont we talk about that are you free tonight he contemplated the date he had lined up thought of the music and dismissed everything else theres nothing i cant get out of her brow lifted work she wondered or a woman fine ill buy you dinner come by the hotel about seventhirty look why dont we justвђ we both have to eat dont we wear a suit and well make it an event seventhirty with her bottom lip caught in her teeth she hung up before he could argue jittery she lowered herself to perch on the arm of the chair it was working she assured herself just as shed planned there was no reason to be nervous right she thought rolling her eyes no reason at all she was about to begin the courtship and seduction of the man shed loved nearly her entire life and if it went wrong shed have a broken heart suffer total humiliation and have all her hopes and dreams shattered no reason to panic to give herself a boost she picked up the phone again and called west virginia the familiar voice that answered smoothed out all the rough edges and made her smile mama at seventhirty nick was pacing the lobby of the waldorf he was not happy to be there he hated wearing a suit he hated fancy restaurants and the pretentious service they fostered if freddie had given him half a chance he would have insisted she come by the bar where they could talk in peace it was true that since hed found success on broadway he was occasionally called upon to socialize even attend functions that required formal wear but he didnt have to like it he still just wanted what hed always wantedвђto be able to write and play his music without hassles nick outstared one of the uniformed bellmen who obviously thought he was a suspicious character damn right i am nick thought with some humor zack and rachel and the rest of the stanislaskis might have saved him from prison and the prospect of a lifetime on the shady side of the law but there was still a core of the rebellious lonely boy inside him his stepbrother zack had bought him his first piano over a decade before and nick could still remember the total shock and wonder hed felt that someone anyone had cared enough to understand and respond to his unspoken dreams no hed never forgotten and to his mind hed never fully paid back the debt he owed the brother who had stuck by him through the very worst of times and hed changed sure he no longer looked for trouble it was vital to him to do nothing to shame the family who had accepted him and welcomed him into their midst but he was still nick lebeck former petty thief con artist and hustler the kid whod first met former public defender rachel stanislaski on the wrong side of prison bars wearing a suit only put a thin layer between then and now he tugged on his tie detesting it he didnt think back very often there was no need something about freddie was making him switch back and forth between past and present the first time he saw her shed been about thirteen a little china doll cute sweet harmless and he loved her of course he did in a purely familial way the fact that shed grown into a woman didnt change that he was still six years older her more experienced cousin but the woman who stepped out of the elevator didnt look like anyones cousin what the hell had she done to herself nick jammed his hands in his pockets and scowled at her as she crossed the lobby in a short snug little dress the color of justripened apricots shed clipped up her hair and it showed entirely too much of slender neck and smooth shoulders glittery colored gems swung from her ears and one tearshaped sapphire nestled comfortably between the curve of her breasts the kind of female trick nick knew that drew a mans eyes to that tempting point and made his fingers itch not that his did he assured himself and kept them safely in his pockets her dimples flashed as she spotted him and he concentrated on them rather than on her legs as she walked to him hi i hope you havent been waiting long she rose on her toes to kiss him at the left corner of his mouth you look wonderful i dont see why we had to get all dressed up to eat so i could wear the outfit i bought today she turned a saucy circle laughing like it he was lucky his tongue wasnt hanging out its fine what there is of it youre going to get cold to her credit she didnt snarl at the brotherly opinion of her appearance i dont think so the cars waiting just outside she took his hand linking fingers with him as they walked out of the lobby toward the sleek black limo at the curb you got a limo to go to dinner i felt like indulging myself with the ease of long practice she flashed a smile at the driver before sliding smoothly into the car youre my first date in new york it was said casually as if she expected to have many more dates with many more men nick only grunted as he climbed in after her ill never understand rich people youre not exactly on poverty row these days nick she reminded him a broadway hit going into its second year a tony nomination another musical to be scored he moved his shoulders still uncomfortable with the idea of true monetary success i dont hang around in limos so enjoy she settled back feeling a great deal like cinderella on her way to the ball the big difference was she was going there with her prince charming big sunday dinner at grandmas coming up she said yeah i got the word on it i cant wait to see them and all the kids i dropped by uncle miks gallery this morning have you seen the piece he did on aunt sydney and the children yeah nicks eyes softened he almost forgot he was wearing a suit and riding in a limo its beautiful the babys terrific shes got this way of climbing up your leg and into your lap bess is having another one you know so she told me at lunch theres no stopping those ukrainians papas going to have to start buying those gumdrops he likes to pass out by the gross you dont worry about teeth nick said in yuris thick accent all my grandbabies have teeth like iron freddie laughed shifting so that her knee brushed his they have a wedding anniversary coming up next month right we were kicking around ideas for a party at lunch we thought about hiring a hall or a hotel ballroom but we all thought it would be more fun and more true to them if we kept it simpler would you and zack hold it in the bar sure thats no problem hell of a lot more fun there than at some ritzy ballroom and he wouldnt have to wear a damned suit rio can handle the food you and i can handle the music he shot her a cautious look yeah we could do that and we thought we could do a group present did you know grandmas always wanted to go to paris nadia paris he smiled at the thought no how do you know it was something she said to mama not too long ago she didnt say too muchвђyou know she wouldnt just how shed always wondered if it was as romantic as all the songs claimed oh and a couple of other things so we were thinking if we could give them a trip fly them over there for a couple of weeks get them a suite at the ritz or something its a great idea yuri and nadia do paris he was still grinning over it when the limo glided to the curb where have you always wanted to go hmm nick climbed out automatically offering a hand to assist her oh i dont know the best place ive ever been is new orleans incredible music you can stand on any street corner and be blown away by it the caribbeans not bad either remember when zack and rachel and i sailed down there god that was before any of the kids came along you sent me a postcard from saint martin she murmured she still had it it was the first time id been anywhere zack decided that as a crew member my best contribution was as ballast so i ended up doing mostly kitchen duty i bitched all the way and loved every minute of it they stepped inside out of the slight spring chill and into the warmth and muted light of the restaurant kimball freddie told the maitre d and found herself well satisfied when they were led to a quiet corner booth very close to perfect she thought with candles flickering in silver holders on the white linen tablecloth the scent of good food the gleam of fine crystal nick might not realize he was being courted but she thought she was doing an excellent job of it should we have some wine she asked sure he took the leatherbound list his years of working a bar had taught him something about choosing the right vintage he skimmed the list and shook his head over the ridiculous price markups well it was freds party the sancerre he told the hovering sommelier it was a profession nick had always thought that made a guy look as though he had an ashtray hanging around his neck yes sir excellent choice i figure it should be since its marked up about three hundred percent while freddie struggled with a laugh and the sommelier struggled with his dignity nick passed the list back and lighted a cigarette so any luck on finding an apartment i didnt do a lot about it today but i think sydney will come up with something finding one in new york isnt a snap kid and you can get conned there are plenty of people out there just waiting for a chance to gobble up fresh meat you ought to think about moving in with one of the family for the time being she arched a brow want a roommate he gaped at her blinked then blew out smoke that wasnt what i meant actually being roomies would be handy once we start working togetherвђ hold it youre getting ahead of yourself am i with a slight smile she sat back as the sommelier presented the wine label for nicks inspection fine he said with an impatient wave of his hand but there was no getting rid of the man until the ritual of the wine was completed nick handed the cork to freddie cork smelled like cork and hed be damned if hed sniff it to speed the business up he took a quick sip of the sample that was poured into his glass great lets have it with strained dignity the sommelier poured freddies wine then topped off nicks before nestling the bottle into the waiting silver bucket now listenвђ nick began it was an excellent choice freddie mused as she savored the first sip dry and nicely light you know i trust your taste in certain areas nicholas without reservation this is one of them she said lifting her glass and musics another you may be reluctant to admit that your little freddies as good as you are but your musical integrity wont let you do otherwise nobodys saying youre as good as i am kid but youre not bad giving in just a little he tapped his glass against hers for a moment he lost his train of thought something about the way the candlelight played in those smoky eyes and the look in them as if she had a secret she wasnt quite ready to share with him anyhow he cleared his throat brought himself back i liked your stuff oh mr lebeck she lowered her lashes fluttered them i dont know what to say youve always got plenty to say the one numberвђit was ever you it may fit in with the score i thought it would she smiled at his narrowed eyes as the daughter of spencer kimball i do have certain connections ive read the book nick its wonderful the story manages to be beautifully oldfashioned and contemporary at the same time it has a terrific central love story wit comedy and with maddy ohurley in the leadвђ how do you know that she smiled again and couldnt prevent it from leaning toward smug connections my fathers done quite a bit of work for her husband reed valentines an old friend of the family connections nick muttered why do you need me you could go straight to valentine hes backing the play i could unconcerned with the tone of annoyance freddie pursed her lips and studied her wine but thats not the way i want to do it she lifted her gaze met his held it i want you to want me nick if you dont it wouldnt work between us she waited a beat could he see that she wasnt simply talking about music but about her life as well their life ill do everything i can to convince you that you do want me then if you can look at me and tell me you dont ill live with it something was stirring deep in his gut something skittish and dangerous and unwanted he had an urge a shockingly strong one to reach out and run his fingers down that smooth ivoryandrose cheek instead he took a careful breath and crushed out his cigarette okay fred convince me the hideous tightness around her heart loosened i will she said but lets order dinner first she chose her meal almost at random her mind was too busy formulating what she should say and how she should say it to worry about something as insignificant as food she sipped her wine watching nick as he completed his part of the order when he finished and looked back over at her she was smiling what i was just thinking reaching over she laid a hand over his about the first time i saw you you walked into that wonderful chaos at grandmas and looked as if youd been hit by a brick he smiled back at her on easy ground again id never seen anything like it i never believed people lived that wayвђall that yelling and laughing kids running around food everywhere and katie marched right up to you and demanded you pick her up your little sisters always had her eye on me so have i he started to laugh then discovered it wasnt all that funny come on really one look at you and my inthemiddleofpubertyhell heart started beating against my ribs your hair was a little longer than it is now a little lighter you were wearing an earring with a half laugh he rubbed his earlobe havent done that in a while i thought you were beautiful exotic just like the rest of them initial embarrassment at her description turned to puzzlement the rest of who the family god those wonderful ukrainian gypsy looks my fathers aristocratic handsomeness sydneys impeccable glamor zack the tough weatherbeaten hunk hed like that one nick thought with a grin then you somewhere between rock star and james dean she sighed exaggerating the sound i was a goner every girls entitled to a memorable first crush and you were certainly mine well he wasnt sure how to react i guess im flattered you should be i gave up bobby macaroy and harrison ford for you harrison ford pretty impressive he relaxed as their appetizers were served but who the hells bobby macaroy only the cutest boy in my eighthgrade class of course he was unaware that i planned for us to get married and have five kids she lifted her shoulder let it fall his loss you bet anyway that day i just sort of looked at you and worked on working up the courage to actually speak little freckled fred she mused among all those exotic birds you were like porcelain he murmured a little blond doll with enormous eyes i remember saying something about how you didnt look like your little brother and sister and you explained that natasha was technically your stepmother i felt sorry for you he looked up again losing himself for a moment in those depthless eyes because i felt sorry for meвђthe outofstep stepbrother and you sat there so serious and told me step was just a word it hit me he told her it really hit for the first time and it made a difference her eyes had gone moist and soft i never knew that you seemed so easy with zack i tried to hate him for a long time never quite pulled it off though i worked pretty hard at making life miserable for both of us and then i was hung up on rachel hung up butвђ diplomatically freddie trailed off and took an avid interest in her food he was easy with the memory now had been for years yeah i was barely nineteen and because i figured she was a class act with a great figure and incredible legs i didnt see how she could resist me youre blushing fred hey every boys entitled to one memorable crush he grinned at her i was pretty ticked when i figured out rachel and zack had a thing going made an idiot out of myself then i got over it because they had something special and because it finally occurred to me that i loved her but i wasnt in love with her thats how crushes end right she eyed him levelly sometimes and in a roundabout way what weve been talking about right here proves my point about why we should work together he waited while their appetizers were cleared and the second course was served interested he picked up the wineglass that had just been topped off again how to add emphasis to her pitch freddie leaned forward and her perfume drifted over him so that his mouth watered were connected nick on a lot of levels we have a history and some similarities in that history that go back to before we met youre losing me she gave an impatient shake of her head we dont have to get into that i know you nicholas better than you may think i know what your music means to you salvation his eyes clouded and he lost interest in his meal thats pretty strong its absolutely accurate she corrected success is a byproduct its the music that matters youd write it for nothing youd play it for nothing its what kept you from sinking without a trace every bit as much as the family did you need it and you need me to write the words for it because i hear the words nick when i hear your music i hear what you want it to say because i understand you and because i love you he studied her trying to separate emotion and practicality but she was right hed never been able to separate the two with his music the emotion came first and shed tapped into that with the words shed already written and with the words shed just spoken you make a strong case for yourself fred for us well make a hell of a team nick so much stronger and better than either of us could be separately the music hed played that morning wound through his head her lyrics humming with it it was ever you in my heart in my mind no one before and no one after for only one face have i always pined you are the tears and the laughter a lonely song he thought and an achingly hopeful one she was right he decidedвђit was exactly what hed intended lets play it like this freddie well take some time see how it goes if we can come up with two other solid songs for the libretto well take it to the producers under the table she tapped her nervous fingers on her knee and if they approve the material if they approve the material youve got yourself a partner he lifted his glass deal oh yes she tapped her glass against his sounding a celebratory note its a deal it was far more than the wine that had her feeling giddy when nick walked her up to her hotel room after dinner laughing she whirled pressing her back against the door and beaming at him were going to be fabulous together i know it he tucked stray curls behind her ear barely noticing that his fingertip skimmed the lobe lingered well see how it flies tomorrow my place my piano bring food all right ill be there first thing in the morning you come before noon ill have to kill you wheres your key kid right here she waved it under his nose before sliding it into the slot want to come in ive got to finish off the late shift and close the bar soвђ his words and his thoughts trailed off as she turned back and slipped her arms around him the quick flash of heat stunned him get some sleep he began and lowered his head to give her a chaste peck on the cheek she wasnt that giddyвђor perhaps she was just giddy enough she shifted tilting her face so that their lips met only for two heartbeats two long unsteady heartbeats she savored it the taste of him the firm smooth texture of his mouth and the quick instinctive tightening of his hands on her shoulders then she drew away a bright determined smile on her lips that gave no clue as to her own rocky pulse good night nicholas he didnt move not a single muscle even after she shut the door in his face it was the sound of his own breath whooshing out that broke the spell he turned walked slowly toward the elevators his cousin he reminded himself she was his cousin not some sexy little number he could enjoy temporarily he lifted a hand to push the button for the lobby noticed it wasnt quite steady and cursed under his breath cousins he thought again who had a family history and a potential working relationship no way he was going to forget that no way in hell chapter three hi rio freddie balanced bag purse and briefcase as she entered through the kitchen of lower the boom hey little doll busy with lunch preparations rio had both hands occupied himself whats doing nick and i are working together today she told him as she headed for the stairs be lucky if you dont have to pull him out of bed by his hair she only chuckled and kept going he said noon its noon on the dot she added to herself maneuvering up the narrow curved staircase she gave the door at the top a sharp rap waited tapped her foot shifted her bags okay nicholas she thought up and at em after fighting the door open she gave a warning shout in the silence that followed she heard the faint sound of water running in the shower she decided and satisfied carried her bundles into the kitchen shed taken him seriously when he told her to bring food out of the bag she took deli cartons of potato salad pasta salad pickles and waxedpaperwrapped sandwiches after setting them out she went on a search for cold drinks it didnt take long for her to realize they had a choice between beer and flat seltzer and that nicks kitchen was crying out for a large dose of industrialstrength cleaner when he came in a few minutes later the sleeves of her sweater were pushed up and she was up to her elbows in steaming soapy water whats going on this place is a disgrace she said without turning around you should be ashamed of yourself living like this i wrapped the medical experiments that were in the fridge in that plastic bag id take them out and bury them if i were you he grunted and headed for the coffeepot whens the last time you took a mop to this floor i think it was september he yawned and trying to adjust his eyes to morning measured out coffee did you bring food on the table with a frown he studied the salads the sandwiches wheres breakfast its lunchtime she said between her teeth times relative fred experimentally he bit into a pickle with a clatter freddie set the last of the dishes shed found crusted in the sink aside to drain the least you could do is go in and pick up some of the mess in the living room i dont know how you expect to work in this place the tart taste of the pickle improved his spirits so he took another bite i pick it up the third sunday of every month whether it needs it or not she turned fisted her hands on her hips well pick it up now im not working in this pit clothes everywhere trash dust an inch thick leaning back on the table he grinned at her her hair was pulled back in an attempt to tame it that failed beautifully her eyes were stormy her mouth was set she looked he thought like an insulted fairy god youre cute fred now those stormy eyes narrowed you know i hate that yeah his grin only widened with dignity she ripped off a paper towel from a roll on the counter to dry her hands what are you staring at you im waiting for you to pout youre even cuter when you pout she would not she promised herself be amused youre really pushing it nick it stopped you from ordering me around the way you do with brandon i do not order my brother around nick scooted around her to get one of the coffee mugs shed just washed sure you do face it kid youre bossy i certainly am not bossy spoiled and cute as a little button to prove her own control she took one long deep breath im going to hit you in a minute thats a good one nick acknowledged as he poured coffee sticking your chin up its almost as good as a pout for lack of something better she tossed the balled paper towel so that it bounced off his head i came here to work not to be insulted if this is the best you can do ill just go he was chuckling as she started to storm by him for the first time since shed come to new york he felt their relationship was back on the level where it belonged bigbrotherly cousin to pipsqueak he was chuckling still as he grabbed her arm and whirled her around ah come on fred dont go away mad im not mad she said even as her elbow jabbed into his stomach his breath whooshed out on a laugh you can do better than that youve got to put your body behind it if you want results challenged she attempted to and the quick tussle threw them both off balance he was laughing as they fought for balance as she ended up with her back against the refrigerator his hands at her hips hers gripping his forearms then he stopped laughing when he realized he was pressed against her and she was so soft and small her eyes fired up at him and they were so wide and deep her mouth pouting now drew his gaze down and it was so deliciously full she felt the change slowly a melting of her body a thrumming in her blood this was what she had been waiting for yearning forвђthe mantowoman embrace the awareness that was like light bursting in the head following instinct she slid her hands up his arms to his shoulders he would have kissed her he realized as he jerked back and it would have had nothing to do with family affection in another instant he would have kissed her the way a hungry man kisses a willing womanвђand broken more than a decade of trust nick she said it quietly with the plea just a whisper in the word hed scared her he thought berating himself and lifted his hands palms out sorry i shouldnt have teased you like that more comfortable with distance he backed up until he could reach the mug hed set on the table its all right she managed a smile as the warmth that had shuddered into her system drained out again im used to it but i still want you to pick up that mess his lips curved in response it was going to be all right after all my place my mess my piano youll have to get used to it she debated a moment then nodded fine and when i get my place and my piano well work there maybe he got a fork and began to eat potato salad out of the carton why dont you get some coffee and well talk about what im after with the score what were after she corrected she plucked a mug out of the drain partner they sat in the kitchen for an hour discussing dissecting and debating the theme and heart of the score for first last and always the musical was to span ten years taking the leads from a youthful infatuation into a hasty marriage and hastier divorce and ultimately to a mature fulfilled relationship happy ever after freddie called it the perpetual rocky road was nicks opinion they both agreed that the two viewpoints would add zest to the work and punch to the music she loves him freddie said as they settled at the piano the first time she sees him shes in love with love nick set up the tape recorder they both are theyre young and stupid thats one of the things that makes the characters appealing funny and real hmmm listen he took his place on the piano bench beside her hip to hip with her it opens with the crowd scene lots of movement lights speed everybodys in a hurry he flipped through his staff sheets and with what freddie decided was some sort of inner radar unerringly chose the one he wanted so i want to hit the audience with the confusion and rush he adjusted the synthesizer keyboard on the stand beside him and that energy of youth in the opening number when they run into each other literally right here he started to play a jarring opening note that would wake the senses freddie closed her eyes and let the music flood over her quick full sometimes clashing notes oh yes she could see what he wanted impatience selfabsorption hurry up get out of my way in part of her mind she could see the stage packed with dancers convoluted choreography the noise from traffic horns blaring needs more brass here nick muttered hed all but forgotten freddies presence as he stopped to make notes and fiddle with the synthesizer dont stop now i just want to punch up the brass she only shook her head at him and placed her own hands on the piano keys with her eyes narrowed on the notes hed scribbled on the staff paper she began voice melding with music dont stop now ive got places to go people to see dont know how im supposed to put up with anybody but me her voice was pure funny hed almost forgotten that low smooth easily confident surprisingly sexy youre quick he murmured im good she continued to play while words and movement ran through her head it should be a chorus number lots of voices point and counterpoint with an overlying duet between the principals hes going one way she the other the words should overlap and blend overlap and blend yeah he picked up the fill on the synthesizer playing with her thats the idea she slanted him a look a smug smile i know it took them more than three hours and two pots of coffee to hammer out the basics of the opening not wanting to jar her system with any more of the caffeine nick seemed to thrive on freddie insisted he go down to the bar and find her some club soda alone she made a few minute changes to both words and music on the staff sheet even as she began to try them out the phone interrupted her humming the emerging song in her head she rose to answer hello why hi is nick around the slow sultry southern female voice had freddie lifting a brow hell be back in just a second he had to run down to the bar oh well ill just hang on then if its all right with you im lorelie i bet you are freddie thought grimly hello lorelie im fred not nicks little cousin fred thats me she said between her teeth little cousin fred well im just thrilled to talk to you honey warmed honeyed molasses all but seeped through the phone line nick told me he was visiting with you last night i didnt mind postponing our date seeing as it was family damn it shed known it was a woman thats very understanding of you lorelie oh now a young girl like you alone in new york needs the men in her family to look out for her ive been here myself five years and im still not used to all the people and everybody just moves so fast some arent as fast as others freddie muttered where are you from lorelie she asked politely she hoped atlanta honey born and bred but up here with these yankees is where the modeling and television work is youre a model didnt it just figure thats right but ive been doing a lot more television commercials these days it just wipes you out if you know what i mean im sure it does thats how i met nick i just dropped into the bar one afternoon after the longest shoot i asked him to fix me a long cool something and he said i looked like a long cool something to him lorelies laugh was a silver tinkle that set freddies teeth on edge isnt nick the sweetest thing freddie glanced up as the sweetest thing came back in with an armload of soda bottles oh he certainly is were always saying that about him well i think its just fine that nick would tend to his little cousin on her first trip alone to the big city youre a southern girl too arent you honey well south of the masondixon line at least lorelie were practically sisters heres our sweet nick now face dangerously bland freddie held out the receiver your magnolia blossoms on the phone he set the bottles down in the most convenient place on the floor then took the phone lorelie with one wary eye on freddie he listened yeah she is no its west virginia yeah close enough ah listenвђ he turned his back lowering his voice as freddie began to noodle softly at the piano im working right now no no tonights fine come by the bar about seven he cleared his throat wondering why he felt so uncomfortable im looking forward to that too oh really he glanced cautiously over his shoulder at freddie that soundsвђ interesting see you tonight after he hung up he bent down to retrieve one of the bottles as he unscrewed the top and took it to freddie he wondered why it should feel like a pathetic peace offering its cold thanks and so he noted was her voice icecold she took the bottle tipped it back for a long sip should i apologize for taking you away from lorelie last night no were notвђshes justвђno its so flattering that you told her all about your little lost cousin from west virginia freddie set the bottle down and let her fingers flow over the keys better there than curled around nicks throat i cant believe she bought such a pathetic clichг i just told her the truth he stood scowling and feeling very putupon that i needed to be looked after i didnt say that exactly look whats the big deal you wanted to have dinner and i rearranged my plans next time just tell me you have a date nick i wont have any trouble making plans of my own incensed she pushed away from the piano and began stuffing her papers into her briefcase and i am not your little cousin and i dont need to be looked after or tended to anybody but a total jerk could see that im a grown woman well able to take care of herself i never said you werentвђ you say it every time you look at me she kicked a pile of clothes away as she stormed across the room for her purse it so happens that there are a few men around who would be more than happy to have dinner with me without considering it a duty hold on i will not hold on she whirled back curls flying around her face youd better take a good look nicholas lebeck i am not little freddie anymore and i wont be treated like some family pet who needs a pat on the head baffled he dragged his hands through his hair what the hells gotten into you nothing she shouted it frustrated beyond control nothing you idiot go cuddle up with your southern comfort when she slammed the door nick leaned down to open a club soda for himself he could only shake his head to think he mused shed been such a sweettempered kid freddie worked off a great deal of her anger with a long walk when she felt she was calm enough to speak without spewing broken glass she stopped at a phone booth and checked in with sydney the conversation did quite a bit to lift her spirits afterward armed with an address she rushed off to view a vacant onebedroom apartment three blocks from nicks it was perfect while freddie wandered from room to room she envisioned the furnishings shed place here the rugs shed place there her own home she thought with room enough for a piano under the window space enough for a pullout sofa so that her brother or sister could come and stay for visits and best of all close enough that she could keep an eye on nick how do you like that nicholas she wondered as she grinned at her view of manhattan im going to be looking out for you i love you so much you stupid jerk sighing she turned away from the window and walked into the kitchen it was small and needed some paint to perk it up but she would see to that shed enjoy choosing the right cookware the pots and pans and kitchen implements she loved to cook and even as a child had loved the big kitchen in her home in west virginia the wonderfully crowded kitchen at her grandmothers in brooklyn shed cook for nick here she thought running a finger over the smooth butcherblock countertop if he played his cards right no she smiled at herself and at her own impatience it was she who had to play the cards and play them right shed been too hard on him even if he had been a jerk shed spent more than half her life in love with him but he spent that same amount of time thinking of her as a little cousinвђif not by blood then by circumstance it was going to take more than one romantic dinner and one afternoon as colleagues to change that and change it she would hands on hips she began another tour of the apartment just as she would build a life here one that reflected her own taste and grew from the solid loving background shed been blessed with and before she was done the world she created would be filled with music and color and love and by god with nick it was nearly seven when nick came down to the bar zack lifted a brow as he mixed a stinger hot date lorelie oh yeah now zack wiggled his brows tall willowy brunette with rose petals in her voice thats the one nick moved behind the bar to help fill orders were just going to catch some dinner then well come back here so i can relieve you i can cover for you no its no problem she likes hanging out here after i close up well figure out something else to do i bet you will table six needs two drafts and a bourbon and branch got it hey did you hear about freddies apartment nicks hand paused on the lever what apartment found one just a couple blocks from here shes already signed the papers zack filled an empty bowl with beer nuts you just missed her she came in to celebrate did anybody look over the place for her mik she didnt say kids got a good head on her shoulders yeah i guess she should have gotten rachel to look over the lease though chuckling zack laid a hand on nicks shoulder as he was finishing preparing the order hey the little birds have to leave the nest sometime with a shrug nick placed the drinks on the end of the bar for the waitress so she went on back to the hotel nope went out with ben ben nicks fingers froze on the cloth hed picked up to wipe the bar what do you mean she went out with ben now nick twisted the cloth into a semblance of a noose his eyes went bright and hard as a dagger you introduced fred to stipley sure with a nod to a waitress zack began to fill another order he asked me who the pretty blonde was so i introduced them they hit it off too hit it off nick repeated and you just let her walk out of here with a stranger come on nick bens no stranger weve known him for years yeah nick said grimly imagining slipping the cloth noose around zacks neck he hangs around bars surprised and amused zack glanced over so do we thats not the point and you know it nick rattled bottles and resisted the urge to pour a stiff shot of whiskey for himself you cant just hook her up with some guy and let her waltz off with him i didnt hook them up i introduced them they talked for a while and decided to catch a movie yeah right movie my ass he thought what man in his right mind would want to waste time at the movies with a woman with big liquid gray eyes and a mouth like heaven oh god he thought his stomach clenching as he imagined fred at ben slipleys mercy ben just wanted a little company at this weeks boxoffice hit damn it zack are you crazy okay ill give it to you straight i sold her to him for five hundred and season tickets to the yankees he should have her to the opium den by this time nick managed to get his vivid imagination under control but didnt have the same luck with his temper thats real funny bro lets see how funny you are if he hits on her after setting the drinks aside zack turned to study his brother fury he noted which hed seen plenty of times before on nicks face since it seemed so incredibly out of place under the circumstances he kept his tone mild and if he does shell handle it or hit back hes not a maniac a lot you know about it nick muttered baffled zack shook his head nick you like ben youve gone to yankees games with him he lent you his car when you wanted to drive to long island last month sure i like him incensed nick grabbed a beer mug from the shelf and began to polish it why shouldnt i like him but that has nothing to do with fred picking up some strange guy in a bar and going off with him to god knows where zack leaned back tapping a finger against the bar you know little brother someone who didnt know you might think youre jealous jealous terrifying thought thats bull just bull he slapped the mug down and chose another at random if he didnt keep busy he was afraid he might streak out of the bar and start searching every movie theater in manhattan but a strange idea was beginning to take root in zacks mind he eyed nick more cautiously now toying with the thought of his brother falling for little freddie kimball then why dont you tell me whats not bull whats going on with you and freddie nick nothings going on in defense nick concentrated on the glass he was polishing and attacked im just trying to look out for her thats all which is more than i can say for you i guess i could have locked her up zack mused or gone along with them as chaperon next time i see shes having a conversation with a friend of mine ill call the vice squad shut up zack cool off nick your georgia peach just walked in great making an effort nick ordered himself to shift freddie and her idiotic behavior to the back of his mind he had his own life didnt he and as freddie had recently grown so fond of pointing out she was a grown woman nick glanced over working up a smile as lorelie sauntered toward the bar there she was he thought gorgeous sexy and if their last date was any indication more than ready to let nature take its course she slid fluidly onto a bar stool flipped back her shiny stream of dark hair and beamed sparkling blue eyes at him hello nick ive been looking forward to tonight all day it was hard to keep the smile in place when it hit himвђand it hit him hardвђthat he wasnt the least bit interested in southern hospitality chapter four nick smelled coffee and bacon the minute he stepped out of the shower it should have put him in a better mood but when a man hadnt slept well worrying over a woman it took more than the possibility of a hot meal to turn the tide she had a lot of explaining to do he decided as he stalked into his bedroom to dress out half the night with some guy shed picked up at a bar shed been raised better than that he had firsthand knowledge it was one of the things he counted on he thought as he met his own annoyed eyes in the mirror over the dresser freddies family the care and attention they devoted to each other every time he visited them hed seen it felt it admired it and he was just a little envious of it hed missed that kind of care and attention growing up his mother had been tired and he supposed shed been entitled to be with the burden of raising a kid on her own when she hooked up with zacks old man things had changed some it had been good for a while certainly better than it had been theyd had a decent place to live he mused hed never gone hungry again or felt the terror of seeing despair in his mothers eyes with hindsight he even believed that his mother and muldoon had loved each otherвђmaybe not passionately maybe not romantically but theyd cared enough to try to make a life together the old man had tried nick supposed as he tugged on jeans but hed been set in his ways a tough old goat who never chose to see more than one side of thingsвђhis own side still thered been zack hed been patient nick remembered carelessly kind letting a kid trail along after him maybe it was the memory of that the way zack had taught him to play ball or just let him dog his heels that had given nick an affection and ease with children for he knew all too well what it was like to be a kid and at the mercy of adult whims zack had made him feel as if he belonged as if there were someone who would be there when you needed them to be there but it hadnt lasted as soon as zack was old enough to cut out he had joining the navy and shipping off and leaving nick acknowledged now a young stepbrother miserably alone when nicks mother died things had deteriorated fast nicks defense against the loss and the loneliness had been defiance rebellion and a replacement of family with the edgy loyalty of a gang so hed been a cobra he reflected cruising the streets and looking for trouble finding it until the old man died and zack came back to try to pull a bitter hardshelled kid out of the pit nick hadnt made it easy on him the memories of those days had a rueful smile tugging at his lips if he could have found a way to make it harder back then he would have but zack had stuck rachel had stuck the whole chaotic bunch of stanislaskis had stuck they had changed his life maybe saved it it wasnt something nick ever intended to forget maybe it was his turn to do some paying back he considered freddie might have the solid base hed missed in his formative years but she was flying free now it seemed to him she needed someone to rein her in and since no one else was interested in overseeing freddies behavior it fell to him he pulled his stilldamp hair back and tugged a shirt over his head maybe she was just too naive to know better he paused considering the thought after all shed spent most of her life snuggled up with her family in a little town where having clothes stolen off the line still made the papers but if she was determined to live in new york she had to learn the ropes fast and he was just the man to teach her feeling righteous nick strolled into the kitchen to begin the first lesson freddie was standing at the stove sautгing onions mushrooms and peppers in preparation for the omelet shed decided to cook as an opening apology after a bit of reflection shed decided shed been entirely too hard on nick the day before it had been jealousy she was forced to admit plain and simple jealousy was a small greedy emotion she acknowledged to herself and had no place in her relationship with nick he was free to see other womenвђ for the time being temper tantrums werent going to advance her cause and win his heart she reminded herself she had to be open understanding supportive even if it killed her catching the movement out of the corner of her eye she turned to the doorway with a big bright smile good morning i thought you might want to start the day with a traditional breakfast for a change coffees ready why dont you sit down and ill pour you some he eyed her the way a man might a favored pet who tended to bite whats the deal fred just breakfast still smiling she poured coffee then set the platter of toast and bacon on the table shed already set i figured i owed you after the way i acted yesterday shed given him his opening yeah about that i wanted toвђ i was completely out of line she continued pouring alreadybeaten eggs into the sizzling pan i dont know what got into me nerves i guess i suppose i didnt realize how big a change i was making in my life coming here well yeah somewhat soothed nick sat and picked up a strip of bacon i can see that but youve got to be careful fred the consequences dont take nerves into account consequences puzzled she gave the fluffy eggs an expert flip ohвђ i guess you could have booted me out but thats a little excessive for one spat spat now it was his turn to be puzzled as she slid the omelet out of the pan you had a fight with ben ben she transferred the omelet to nicks plate then stood holding the spatula oh ben no why would i why would you think so you just saidвђwhat the hell are you talking about about yesterday giving you a hard time after lorelie called she tilted her head what are you talking about im talking about you letting some strange guy pick you up in a bar thats what im talking about nick studied her as he forked in the first bite of his omelet god the kid could cook are you crazy or just stupid excuse me all her good intentions began a slow slide into oblivion are you talking about my going to the movies with a friend of zacks movies hell nick fueled up on breakfast as he prepared to lecture you didnt get home until after one her hands were on her hips now and her fingers were tight around the handle of the spatula how would you know when i got home i happened to be in the neighborhood he said loftily saw you get out of a cab at the hotel onefifteen the memory of standing on the street corner watching her flit into the hotel in the middle of the night soured his mood again though it didnt diminish his appetite are you going to try to tell me you caught a double feature he reached for the jam for his toast just as freddie brought the spatula down smartly on the top of his head hey spying on me youve got a lot of nerve nicholas lebeck i wasnt spying on you i was looking out for you since you dont have the sense to look out for yourself with wellconditioned reflexes he ducked the second swipe pushed back from the table his body moved on automatic tensed for a fight put that damn thing down i will not and to think i felt guilty because id yelled at you you should have felt guilty and you sure as hell should have known better than to go off with some guy you know nothing about uncle zack introduced us she began fury making her voice low and icy im not going to justify my social life to you thats what she thinks nick countered silently no way in hell was he going to allow her to go dancing off with any bar bum who happened along and he needed to make that clear youre going to have to justify it to somebody and im the only one here where the hell did you go you want to know where i went fine we left the bar and raced over to his place where we spent the next several hours engaged in wild violent sexвђseveral acts of which are still i believe illegal in some states his eyes went hard enough to glitter it wasnt just her words it wasnt just her attitude it was worse because he could imagineвђwith no trouble at allвђa scenario just like the one shed described only it wasnt ben she was breaking the law with it was nick lebeck thats not funny fred much too wound up to note or care about the dangerous edge to his voice she snarled at him its none of your business where i went or how i spent my evening any more than its mine how you spent yours with scarlett ohara lorelie he corrected between his teeth it didnt do his disposition any good to remember that he hadnt spent the evening with lorelie or anyone else and it is my business im responsible forвђ nothing freddie snapped back jabbing the spatula into his chest for nothing get it im above the age of consent and if i want to pick up six guys at a bar you have nothing to say about it youre not my father and its about time you stopped trying to act like it im not your father nick agreed a slow vicious buzz was sounding in his ears warning him that his temper was about to careen out of control your father might not be able to tell you what happens to careless women he sure as hell wouldnt be able to show you what happens when a woman like you takes chances with the wrong man and you can damn right i can in a move too quick and unexpected for her to evade he snatched the spatula out of her hand and threw it aside even as it crashed against the wall her eyes were going wide stop it what are you going to do to make me nicks movements were smooth predatory as he stalked her backing her into a corner you going to call for help you think anybodys going to pay attention to you hed never looked at her like that before no one had with all that lust and fury simmering fear lapped through her until her pulse was scrambling like a rabbits dont be ridiculous she said trying for dignity and failing miserably as he slapped his palms on either side of the wall caging her i said stop it nick what if he doesnt listen to you he stepped closer until his body was pressed hard against hers until she could feel the wiry strength in it just on the edge of control maybe he wants a sampleвђmore than a sample all that pretty skin his eyes stayed on hers as he ran his hands up her arms down again hes going to take what he wants now his hands were at her hips kneading how are you going to stop him what are you going to do about it she didnt think didnt question riding on fear jumbled with excitement freddie threw her arms around his neck for an instant the gleam in his eyes changed darkened and then her mouth was on his all her pentup needs and fantasies poured into the kiss she clung to him wrapped herself around him and reveled in the wild flash of heat he was holding her as shed always wanted to be held by him hard possessively hard his mouth was frantic as it took from hers a scrape of teeth that made her head spin a plunge of tongue that staggered her soul desire she could taste it on him the full ripe and readytoexplode desire of a man for a woman they might have been strangers so new was this burst of passion and need they might have been lovers for a lifetime so seamlessly choreographed were the fast frenetic movements of hands of mouths and bodies he lost his head lost himself her mouth was a banquet of flavorsвђthe tart the sweet the spicyвђand he was ravenous there was so much thereвђthe scent and taste and texture of her so much more than the expected so much richer than dreams all of it opened for him invited him to feast he didnt think of who they were or who they had been there was no thought at all only a desperate leap of emotion that consumed him even as he avidly consumed her more the need for more slashed through him like a whip he pressed her hips into the edge of the counter then lifted her up onto it so that his hands were free to touch and take he heard her raspy indrawn breath when his fingers streaked under her sweater and closed over her then his own moanвђpart pain part pleasureвђwhen he found her firm and soft her nipples hard with desire against his thumbs her heart pounding out an erotic rhythm against his palms she began to tremble one quick shudder that grew and quickened until she was vibrating like a plucked string shame washed over him a cold gray mist over redhot lust staggered by what hed done by what hed wanted to do he dropped his hands and slowly stepped back her breath sounded more like sobbing and her eyes he noted furious with himself were glazed as he watched she gripped the edge of the counter for balance and her knuckles went white im sorry fred are you all right when she said nothing nothing at all he used his temper to combat the shame if youre not youve nobody to blame but yourself thats the kind of treatment youre opening yourself up to he shot at her if it had been anybody but me things would have been worse im sorry i scared you but i wanted to teach you a lesson you did though her heart was still thudding freddie was recovering slowly nothing she ever imagined had come close to being as wonderful as exhilarating as the reality of nick now he was going to spoil it with apologies and lectures i wonderвђ hoping she could trust her legs she slid slowly from the counter to the floor вђwho taught whom i kissed you nicholas i kissed you and knocked you on your butt you wanted me his blood was still humming he couldnt quite silence the tune lets not confuse things fred oh i agree lets not you werent kissing your little cousin just now nick you were kissing me now it was she who stepped forward and he back in a reversal of the dance and i was kissing you his throat had gone unbearably dry who was this woman he wondered who was this devilish sprite with eyes full of awareness and knowledge who was turning him inside out with a look maybe things got out of hand for a minute no they didnt the smile was entirely too smug and female it was a look he recognized and on another woman he might even have appreciated it isnt right fred why because he found himself fumbling over reasons he knew only too well i dont have to spell it out for you he picked up his neglected coffee and drank it down stonecold i think youre having a hard time spelling it out for yourself empowered freddie tilted her head again i wonder nick what you would do if i were to kiss you right now take her he was certain without thought or conscience on the floor cut it out fred we both need to cool off you may be right her lips curved again sweetly id say you need some time to get used to the idea that youre attracted to me i never said that he set down his cup again it isnt always easy to accept changes in people we think we know but ive got plenty of time she was standing perfectly still but he could feel her circling him fred he let out a long breath im trying to be reasonable here and im not sure its going to work he frowned down at her im not sure any of this is going to work maybe some things have changed and whatever those changes are we dont seem to get along as smoothly as we once did if working together means risking our friendshipвђ youre nervous about working with me no button she could have chosen could have been more effective whatever he had made of himself through the years there was still a remnant of the rebellious young man whose pride was a point of honor of course im not afraid of working with you or anyone if thats true then we dont have a problem of course if youre thinking you might not be able to stop yourself fromвђhow did you so poetically put it oh yes sampling meвђ im not going to touch you again the gritty fury in his voice only made her smile sweeten well then i suggest you make the best of the breakfast youve let get cold then well get to work he was true to his word they worked together for hours and he never made any physical contact it cost him she had a way he discovered of shifting her body tilting her head looking up under her lashesвђall of which seemed designed to make a sane man beg by the end of the day nick was no longer sure he was sane thats good good freddie murmured scanning notes even as nick played them someone with maddy ohurleys range is going to really kick on that i didnt say this was maddys solo nick snapped but that wasnt the point he thought the point was that freddie was reading his mind and his music much too clearly he had an odd and uncomfortable vision of himself as a fish nibbling at the bait and it was freddie holding the rod maybe i was thinking of using it for the second leads a duet no you werent she said calmly enough but fine if you want to play it that way ive got some ideas for lyrics for their number she slid him a sidelong look they dont really fit this music but i can adjust maybe if you pick up the tempo i dont want to pick up the tempo its fine as it is not for the second leads duet now for maddys solo it should go something likeвђ you made me forget today and tomorrow if youвђ nick interrupted her are you trying to tick me off no im trying to work with you she made a quick note on one of the sheets of paper propped up on the piano then shifted enough to smile at him i think you need a break i know when i need a break he snatched a pack of cigarettes off the top of the piano lighted one just shut up a minute and let me work on this sure with her tongue in her cheek freddie slid off the bench she rolled her shoulders stretched as he fiddled with the notes changing them she noted when they both knew they needed no changing he was fighting her she noted and realized nothing could have pleased her more if he was fighting that meant there was something there he had to defend against testing she laid her hands on his shoulders and rubbed his system shot immediately into overdrive cut it out fred youre all stiff and tight his hands crashed down on the keys i said cut it out touchy she murmured but backed off im going to get something cold want anything bring me a beer she lifted a brow well aware that he rarely drank anything but coffee when he worked as she stood in the kitchen opening a beer and a soft drink she heard the quick rap on the door the shout of greeting youre busted alex stanislaski called out from the other room for keeping my niece chained to a piano all afternoon wheres your warrant cop alex only grinned and caught nick in a headlock i dont need no stinking warrant where is she lebeck uncle alex thank god youve come freddie dashed into the living room and jumped into his arms its been horrible all day long half notes sharps diminished ninths there there baby im here now he gave her a quick kiss before holding her at arms length bess said you were prettier than ever this guy been giving you a hard time yes she slipped an arm around her uncles waist and smiled smugly at nick i think you should haul him in for impersonating a human being that bad huh well im here to take you away from all this how about dinner id love it then you can tell me all about the promotion bess was bragging about its nothing alex muttered causing nick to stop playing long enough to look over his shoulder thats not what i heard the sneer was automatic and friendly captain its not official alex gave nick a punch on the shoulder police brutality since freddie hadnt brought it out nick rose to get his beer and one for alex from the kitchen hes always had it in for me should have tossed away the key the night i caught you climbing out of the window of that electronics shop cops have memories like elephants when it comes to punks comfortable alex leaned against the piano that was a nice sound you were making you two really collaborating on this musical thing thats the rumor freddie answered only nicks having a hard time splitting his energy between being my partner and my surrogate father oh he trailed me on a date last night i did not disgusted nick took a swallow of beer she has delusions of adulthood a little wary of the vibes scooting around in the air alex cleared his throat she looks pretty grown up to me why thank you same time tomorrow nick yeah fine you can come on to dinner too you know the invitation was general alex said bess is calling in italian no thanks nick set aside his beer and ran his fingers over the keys ive got stuff to do suit yourself come on fred im starved i spent a hard day catching bad guys im out the door deliberately she leaned over and kissed nicks cheek see you tomorrow alex waited until theyd gotten outside before he went for the subject so whats going on on where between you and nick not as much as id like freddie said without any preamble and since alex merely stood there stepped to the curb to hail a cab herself ah are you speaking professionally or personally oh professionally were clicking right along he should have something to take the producers early next week why dont we take the subway she suggested after scanning the street its going to be hell catching a cab this time of day he walked along with her toward the subway station youre talkingвђ personally then hmm thats right she smiled approvingly over at him the dimming sunlight haloed around his dark hair making him look to her like a knight just out of battle its so good to be here with all of you uncle alex its good to have you what kind of personally he asked not allowing himself to be sidetracked for an instant from the subject at hand she sighed but there was humor in it exactly what youre worried about i love you uncle alex i love you too fred he hurried after her as she started down the steps to the station look i know you had a crush on nick when you were a kid do you only more amused she dug around in her bag for change sure it was kind of cute we all noticed nick didnt she let her change fall back into the bag when alex pulled out tokens for both of them so hes slow my point is youre not a kid anymore she stopped on the other side of the turnstile put both hands on his face and kissed him full on the mouth i cant tell you what it means to hear someone else say that i really love you alexi i think youre missing my point here taking her elbow he guided her through the crowd waiting for the next train uptown no im not youre worried that im going to do something that ill regret or that nick will regret if i thought hed have anything to regret he wouldnt be able to play a tune for a month she only laughed big talk you love him like a brother his golden eyes went dark it wouldnt stop me from breaking all the bones in his hands if he used them the wrong way she thought it best not to mention just where nicks hands had been a few hours before im in love with him uncle alex she laughed shaking back her hair oh that felt wonderful youre the first one ive told dad and mama dont even know her laugh leveled off to a chuckle when she saw that he was simply gaping at her is it really that much of a surprise he found his voice with an oath then pulled her onto the train that had stopped at the station now listen to me freddieвђ no listen to me first since the car was full she snagged a pole and held on as the train jostled out of the station i know youre thinking i might not know the difference between puppy love and the real thing but i do i do she repeated with such quiet conviction that he remained silent i dont just love the boy i met all those years ago uncle alex or the one i came to know its the man hes become im speaking of with all his faults and his virtues his impatience his kindness and even his streak of mean i love the whole person and he might not know it yet he may not accept it or love me back but that doesnt change whats inside me for him alex let out a long breath you have grown up yes i have and ive had the very best examples ahead of me not just mama and dad but you and bess and all the rest of you so i know when you love deep enough and true enough it lasts he couldnt argue with that what hed found with bess only became more precious and more vital every day nicks as important to me as anyone in the family alex said carefully even you so i can tell you that hes not an easy man freddie hes got baggage he hasnt tossed out i know that i cant say i understand it all but i know it just dont worry too much she asked and took one hand off the pole to touch his cheek and id appreciate it if youd keep this between us for now id like some time before the rest of the family starts looking over my shoulder when freddie returned to the hotel that evening there was a message waiting for her at the desk intrigued she tore open the envelope as she took the elevator up to her floor inside nicks handwriting was scrawled across a sheet of staff paper okay youre right its maddys solo i want lyrics by tomorrow good ones ive scheduled a meeting with valentine and the rest of the suits dont mess up nick she all but danced to her room two hours later she was racing up the steps to nicks apartment she knew he was working the bar and she couldnt be bothered with him instead she sat at his piano and switched on the tape recorder ive got your lyrics nicholas and theyre better than good just listen primed by her own excitement she sang to him as she played his melody the words had been swimming in her head since shed first heard the music refined now polished they melded with the notes as if theyd been born together after the last note died away she closed her eyes what are you doing here she jolted turning quickly toward the doorway where nick stood he didnt look friendly she noted leaving you a message you wanted the song done before your meeting its done i heard and hed suffered listening to it watching her as she sang for him do you know what time it is about midnight i guess i thought youd be busy downstairs we are busy downstairs rio told me you were up here you didnt have to come up i just didnt want to wait until tomorrow her nerves came rushing back how much did you hear enough well impatient she swung her legs over the bench so that she could face him what did you think i think theyll go for it thats it thats all you can say what do you want me to say it was like pulling teeth she thought always what you feel he didnt know what he felt she was somehow drawing him into areas hed never explored never wanted to explore i think he said carefully its a stunning lyric one that goes for the heart and the gut and i think when people walk out of the theater itll be playing in their heads she couldnt speak she was embarrassed when she realized that her eyes had filled lowering them she stared at her linked hands thats a curve i didnt expect from you you know the gift you have fred yes i tell myself i do calmer she looked up again her heart did one slow roll in her breast as she watched him i tell myself a lot of things nick things that dont always hold up when im alone in the middle of the night but what you said will whatever happens he couldnt take his eyes off her hardly realized he was walking to her im going to take what we worked on so far to valentine tomorrow take the day off i can start on the new apartment while im trying not to go insane from nerves fine as if it belonged to someone else his hand reached down for hers drew her to her feet the only light in the room came from the gooseneck lamp atop the piano its glow fell short of them leaving them in soft shadow you shouldnt have come back here tonight why im thinking about you too much its not the way i used to think about you times change she said unsteadily so do people you dont always want them to and its not always for the best this isnt for the best he murmured as he lowered his mouth to hers it wasnt frantic this time shed been prepared for that but this time it was slow and deep and quietly desperate instead of revving for the storm her body simply went limp melting into his like candle wax left too long at the flame it was the innocence he felt her innocence fluttering helplessly against his own driving needs the images that spun through his brain aroused him amazed him appalled him i lied he murmured and pulled back with difficulty i said i wouldnt touch you again i want you to touch me i know he kept his hands firm on her shoulders when she would have swayed toward him what i want is for you to go home back to your hotel now ill get in touch with you after ive seen valentine you want me to stay she whispered you want to be with me no i dont that at least was the truth he didnt want it even if he seemed so violently to need it were family fred and it looks as though we may be collaborators im not going to ruin that neither are you he set her aside stepped away now i want you to go down and have rio flag you a cab every nerve ending in her body was on full alert but while she might have preferred to scream in frustration she could see that his eyes were troubled all right nick ill wait to hear from you she started for the door then stopped and turned but youre still going to think about me nick too much and its never going to be the way it used to be again when the door closed behind her he lowered himself to the piano stool she was right he acknowledged as he rubbed his hands over his face nothing was going to be quite the same again chapter five sunday dinner at the stanislaski household was never a quiet dignified affair it began in the early afternoon with the sounds of children shouting adults arguing and dogs barking then there were always the scents of something wonderful streaming through the kitchen doorway as the family grew the house in brooklyn seemed to stretch at its joints to accommodate them all children tumbled over the floor or were welcomed into laps and there were board games and toys scattered over the wellworn rugs when it came time for the meal leaves were added to the table and everyone sat elbowtoelbow with everyone else in the chaos of conversation bowls and platters being passed around mikhails and sydneys home in connecticut was much larger rachels and zacks apartment more accommodating and alexs and besss airy loft more spacious no one ever considered changing the tradition from yuris and nadias overflowing home because this was where the family began freddie mused as she squeezed between sydney and zack on the ancient sofa this no matter where any of them lived or worked or moved to was home up laurel demanded and began the climb into freddies lap she had the flashing sunburst smile of her father and her mothers cool discerning eye and up you go freddie bounced laurel as the toddler entertained herself with the glint of colored stones on freddies necklace youre pleased with the apartment then sydney reached out to run a hand over her sons hair as he darted past in pursuit of a cousin more than pleased i really appreciate you helping me out its exactly what i was looking forвђsize location good with a mothers instinct sydney kept a wary eye on her oldest just lately hed taken to torturing his sister not that she worried about moira overmuch the girl had a fast and wicked left jab griff she called out and it took no more than that along with a steely maternal look to have the boy reconsider yanking his sisters curling ponytail just to see what would happen are you looking for furniture sydney asked as laurel climbed determinedly from freddies lap to hers halfheartedly freddie admitted there was a bloodcurdling war whoop from upstairs followed by a loud thump no one so much as blinked i picked up a few things over the last couple of days i think ill get more in the swing when i move in next week well theres a shop downtown with good prices on rugs ill give you the name ah zack hmm he tore his eyes from the ball game currently on the television and glanced in the direction sydney indicated his youngest had dragged a chair over to nadias breakfront and had both greedy eyes on a bag of yuris gumdrops on the top shelf forget it gideon gideon beamed all innocence just one daddy papa said ill just bet he did zack rose caught his son around the waist and tossed him in the air to distract him hey mom catch experience and reflex had rachel scooping her son out of the air on the fly the new criminal court judge held her giggling child upside down as she turned to freddie so wheres our temperamental nick exactly the question freddie had been asking herself im sure hell be here shortly hed never miss a meal i talked to him yesterday and he hadnt been able or hadnt been willing to give her an opinion on the producers reaction to their collaboration the wait freddie thought was like sitting on one of nadias pin cushions waiting was something she should excel at by now she thought with a little sigh shed been waiting for nick for ten years she let the conversation and noise flow around her before rising maneuvering with practiced skill around the various sprawled bodies and abandoned toys she wandered into the kitchen bess sat contentedly at the kitchen table putting the finishing touches on an enormous salad while nadia guarded the stove it was a good room freddie mused looking around a nurturing room with its cluttered counters and its refrigerator door totally covered with wildly colorful drawings courtesy of the grandchildren always there was something simmering on the stove and the cookie jar was never empty such things she thought such small things made a home one day she promised herself she would make such a room grandma freddie pressed a kiss to nadias warm cheek she caught the scent of lavender weaving through the aromas of roasting meat can i help no you sit have some wine too many cooks in my kitchen these days bess winked at freddie im only allowed because im getting lessons nadia thinks i should stop doing all my meals with the phone as my only cooking utensil all my children cook nadia said with some pride nick doesnt freddie pointed out and snatched a radish while nadias back was turned i did not say they all cooked well nadia continued to mix the dough for her biscuits she was a small sturdy woman her hair now iron gray around a serene and timelessly lovely face the smoothness freddie realized now came from happiness age had scored a few lines to be sure but none came from discontent when you learn nadia said turning to wag a wooden spoon in besss direction you teach your children bess gave a mock shudder horrible thought just last week carmen emptied an entire bag of flour over her head then added eggs you teach her right nadia smiled your sons too i give you recipes my mama gave to me freddie you make the chicken kiev like i taught you yes grandma unable to resist freddie gave bess a smug smile when im settled in my new apartment ill cook it for you and papa showoff bess muttered there were shouts from the other room of greeting of demands of questions as the noise level rose dramatically nadia opened her oven to check her roast nick is here she announced soon we eat in a move she hoped was casual freddie rose and reached for the jug wine on the counter want something cold aunt bess i wouldnt mind some juice with her tongue caught between her teeth bess sliced cucumbers with concentration and intensity hows the game going i was wondering about the same myself freddie murmured as the door of the kitchen swung open and there was nick a huge bouquet of daisies in one hand a toddler in his other arm and another child clinging to his leg sorry im late he presented the bouquet to nadia with a kiss you bring me flowers so i dont scold you he grinned at her did they work she only laughed youre a bad boy nicholas put these in water use the good vase unhampered by the children hanging on him nick opened a cabinet pot roast he said and turned his head to nip at laurel on his hip almost as tasty as little girls laurel squealed happily and snuggled closer pick me up nick pick me up too nick looked down at the boy tugging on his jeans wait until i have a hand free kyle kyle let nick finish what hes doing bess took the glass of juice freddie offered but mom he picked laurel up wait your turn nick dumped daisies into the vase then bent to scoop the boy up with his arms full again he turned to look at freddie hi kid hows it going you tell me she eyed him over the rim of her glass and damned him for looking so casually beautiful his hands full of children his eyes impersonally friendly as they studied her have you heard back from reed its sunday nick reminded her he and his family are at the hamptons or bar harbor or someplace well hear something in a few days in a few days she would explode he must have had a reaction not really did he listen to the tape nick accommodated kyle who was squirming for attention by tickling the boys ribs sure he listened in a lightning mood swing kyle shifted his affections and held out his arms and wailed for freddie the pass was completed with the fluidity of long practice and she set him on her hip well then what did he say when he heard it not a lot she hissed through her teeth he must have said something indicated something nick merely shrugged he reached down aiming for a slice of carrot from besss salad and got his hand slapped jeez bess whos going to notice i am im working on presentation here color texture shape take this instead she held out a carrot she had yet to slice thanks anyway fred why dont you just play house for a couple days he bit into the carrot and chewed thoughtfully he liked watching the way her eyes went from lake calm to stormy and the way her bottom lip seemed to grow fuller as temper took hold buy your knickknacks and whatever for the new place ill be in touch when i hear anything you just want me to wait as if in sympathy kyle rested his head on freddies shoulder and scowled at nick you just want me to wait he mimicked and had nick grinning thats the idea and dont get that devious brain of yours working on the idea of calling valentine yourself old family friend or not thats not how i work she could only steam in silence as that was exactly what shed been considering i dont see how it would hurtвђ no he said simply and handing her what was left of his carrot walked out with laurel stubborn hardheaded knowitall freddie grumbled knowitall kyle echoed gleefully aunt bess when you have connections you use them dont you bess took a sudden intense interest in the proper way to slice a mushroom you know i think im getting the hang of this its all in the wrist temperamental jerk freddie said under her breath jerk kyle agreed as she strode out with him on her hip they are children one minute men and women the next nadia commented its rough being a grownup thoughtfully nadia rolled out her biscuit dough he looks at her bess raised her head she hadnt been certain nadia would notice what she had of course bess mused she should have known better when it came to family nadia missed nothing she looks back bess said and the two women were suddenly grinning at each other she would push him to be his best bess nodded and hed keep her from being too driven he has such kindness in him such a need for family they both do its good with a chuckle bess lifted her glass of juice its great that was just the first of a number of conversations that night that both freddie and nick would have been stupefied to hear in their loft bess cuddled against alex sleepyeyed and yawning the first trimester of her pregnancies always left her as lazy as a cat in a moonbeam at night alexi hmmm he stroked her hair half listening to the news on the bedroom television half musing about his caseload need something it amused them both that she was the clichгd expectant mother in her early weeks with all the accompanying strange cravings i think there are still some strawberries and peanut butter in the fridge wellвђ she thought it over then shook her head no we seem to be holding our own tonight she smiled as his hand skimmed lightly over her stillflat belly actually i was thinking about freddie and nick cautious his promise to his niece weighing heavily on him alex shifted what about them do you think they know theyre crazy about each other or are they still at that i dont know whats going on around here stage what he sat straight up in bed gaping down at his sleepyeyed tousledhaired wife what i cant decide myself with ease she slithered accommodating herself to his new position its probably a little weird for both of them under the circumstances alex let out a long breath why did he continue to delude himself that besss freewheeling manner made her oblivious of nuances weird he muttered how do you know theyre crazy about each other she drummed up the energy to open one eye how many times do i have to tell you writers are every bit as observant as cops you noticed it didnt you the way theyve started to look at each other circle around maybe he wasnt certain he was entirely comfortable with the idea yet somebody ought to clue natasha in bess gave a lazy snort alexi compared to a mother cops and writers are deaf dumb and blind she snuggled closer strawberries huh across town rachel and zack made a final check on their kids rachel eased the headset off her daughters ears while zack tucked a stuffed rabbit more securely under her limp armвђa tribute rachel often thought to the contrasts of a growing girl she looks more like you every day zack murmured as they stood for a moment watching their firstborn sleep except for that muldoon chin rachel agreed stubborn as stone arm in arm they walked out and across the hall into the room shared by their sons they both let out a long helpless sigh you could if you were a parent and had particularly sharp eyes just make out the two sprawled bodies amid the debris clothes toys models sports equipment were scattered piled or precariously perched on nearly every surface on the top bunk jakes arm and leg draped over the mattress a devoted guardian angel or pure good luck kept him from rolling over and falling into a heap on a tumble of possessions below gideon was no more than a lump beneath the tangled sheets are you sure theyre ours rachel wondered as she gave her older son a nudge that had him muttering in his sleep and rolling to safety i ask myself that same question every day i caught gideon telling one of miks kids that if they tied on bed sheets like a cape then jumped off yuris roof theyd fly back to manhattan rachel closed her eyes and shuddered dont tell me some things im better off not knowing she uncovered gideons head on the pillow discovered it was his feet and tried the other side i meant to ask you how do you feel about nick and fred working together i think its great zack swore as his stockinged foot stepped hard on an airplane propeller damn it ive told you to wear hip boots in here and thats not what i meant i meant how do you feel about the romance one hand massaging his wounded instep zack stopped dead what romance whose romance nick and fred keep up with the tour muldoon he straightened very slowly what are you talking about about the fact that freddie is head over heels in love with nick and the fact that he keeps shoving his hands into his pockets whenever she gets within arms reach like hes afraid if he touches her hellвђ hold on just hold on because his voice rose she shushed him and he grabbed her arm to pull her into the hall are you telling me that the two of them are interested inвђ id say theyre way beyond interested amused rachel tilted her head whats the matter muldoon worried about your baby brother no yes no frustrated he dragged a hand through his hair are you sure about this of course i am and if you werent so used to looking at nick as if he were still a teenager with delinquent tendencies youd have seen it too zack let his shoulders sag against the wall behind him maybe i did see it something about the way he acted when she went out with this friend of ours rachels sense of fun kicked into high gear uhohвђjealous was he sorry i missed it he was ready to strangle me for introducing them slowly zacks lips curved then a laugh rumbled up son of a gun freddie and nick whod have thought anybody with eyes shes been mooning over him for years youre right and she may be a sweetheart but shes no pushover id say my little brother has trouble on his hands he looked back at his wife her hair was loose and tumbled she was wearing only a thin robe that tended to slip just a little bit off her right shoulder his grin widened and speaking of romance your honor i just had a thought may it please the court leaning forward he whispered something in her ear that had her brows shooting up and her own mouth bowing well well thats a very interesting suggestion muldoon why dont we discuss itвђin my chambers thought youd never ask in their rambling house in the connecticut countryside sydney lay sprawled over her husband her heart was still pounding like a jungle drum her blood singing in harmony amazing she thought after all these years she never quite got used to just what the man could do to her body she hoped she never would cold he murmured skimming a hand over her naked back are you kidding she lifted her stillglowing face to his meeting his eyes in the flickering glow of candlelight youre so beautiful mikhail dont start that she chuckled and trailed a line of kisses up his chest i love you mikhail that you can start he let out a contented sigh as she settled into the curve of his shoulder for a time they lay in blissful silence watching the shadows dance do you think we will plan a wedding soon he asked sydney didnt ask what wedding though they hadnt yet discussed it she understood what he meant and who nicks not sure of his moves or his needs i think freddies sure of the latter for herself but far from sure of the former its sweet watching them watch each other reminds me of another time he mused another couple she shifted to smile at him oh does it you were very stubborn milaya you were very arrogant yes it didnt offend him in the least and if i had been less youd have been an old maid married to your business he barely registered the punch in the stomach but i saved you from that now whos going to save you she rolled on top of him blissfully unaware of her familys interest freddie grabbed her justhookedup cordless phone in her new apartment almost dancing with excitement she punched out the number quickly her father she knew would be in class but her mother would be at the toy store mama clutching the receiver she turned three circles making her way across the living room toward the kitchen guess where i am yes her laughter echoed through the nearly empty rooms its wonderful i cant wait for all of you to see it yes i know at the anniversary party everythings fabulous she did a quick boogie over the antique oriental shed picked up in the shop sydney had recommended i saw them all on sunday grandma made pot roast a present she stopped her improvised jitterbug to listen from dad yes ill be here all day what is it she rolled her eyes and began a new dance all right ill be patient yes i got the dishes you sent thank you i even lined the kitchen cupboards to honor them ive picked up some essentials she snagged a cookie from the bag on the kitchen counter and twostepped back into the living room no im going to buy a bed here i really hoped youd keep mine in my room it makes me feel like im still sort of there oh and tell brandon i havent had a chance to get to yankee stadium yet but im hoping to take in a game next week and ive already got tickets for the ballet two tickets she thought shed get nick there come hell or high water tell katie ill commit every movement every pliг and fouettee turn to memory oh and tell dadвђoh theres too much to tell everyone ill talk you all senseless when you come up andвђhold on someones buzzing me yes mama she said with a smile ill make sure i know who it is first just wait yes she called into her intercom miss frederica kimball delivery for you papa who you think came the strongly accented voice frank sinatra come on up frankie im in d i know where you are little girl yes its papa freddie said into the phone hell want to say hello if youve got time she was already unlocking her door and swinging it open you should see mamaвђive got this great elevator iron grates and everything and my neighbor across the halls a struggling poet who wears nothing but black and speaks in this tony british accent with just a hint of the bronx underneath i dont think she ever wears shoes oh heres the elevator papa it wasnt only yuri behind him mikhail came bearing an enormous box pots and pans mikhail told her when he set the box down with a dangeroussounding thud your grandma is afraid you dont have anything to cook with thanks mamas on the phone let me have it mikhail snatched the receiver even as her grandfather gathered freddie into a bear hug yuri was a big broadly built man who squeezed her as if it had been years rather than days since hed seen her how is my baby wonderful he smelled of peppermint tobacco and sweat a combination she associated with love and perfect safety let me give you the grand tour yuri adjusted his belt took one long pursedlipped look at her living room you need shelves well she snuck her arm around his waist and fluttered her lashes actually i was thinking that if i just knew a carpenter who had some timeвђ i build you shelves where is furniture im picking it up a little at a time i have table in my shop goes well right here he stalked over to the windows checked to see that they had adequate locks and moved smoothly up and down good he pronounced he was checking the baseboards and the level of the counters in the kitchen when nick strolled in so yuri said you come to unload boxes no nick shoved a large blooming white african violet at freddie housewarming present she couldnt have been more thrilled if hed come in on one knee with a diamond ring the size of a spotlight in his hands its beautiful i remembered you liked plants figured youd want one with his hands already seeking the safety of his pockets he scanned the room i thought you said it was just a little place it would fit two of his apartment he noted and shook his head so went the perceptions of the rich and privileged you shouldnt leave your door open she lifted her brows im not exactly alone papa tash wants to talk to you fred you got something to drink in here in the fridge she told mikhail watching nick so did you come by to look the place over give it the lebeck seal of approval more or less he wandered out of the living room into the bedroom that held nothing more than a closet which was already full of clothes a few boxes and a rug that he figured probably cost the equivalent of a years rent for him where are you going to sleep im expecting a sofa bed to be delivered today i want to take my time picking out a real bed hmmm he wandered out again dangerous area he realized thinking of her in bed her bed his bed any bed you want to keep these windows locked he said as he strolled through that fire escapes an invitation im not an idiot nicholas no youre just green he glanced up in time to catch the can of soda mikhail tossed at him you need a dead bolt on that door i have a locksmith coming at two anything else daddy he only scowled at her he was mulling over the proper retort when her buzzer sounded again it seemed there was another delivery for miss kimball probably the sofa freddie mused as nick lighted a cigarette and looked around for an ashtray she found him a porcelain soapdish shaped like a swan but it wasnt a sofa her mouth fell open and stayed open as three broadshouldered men muscled in the base of a grand piano where you want it lady oh god oh my god dad her eyes filled to overflowing instantly put it over there nick told them as freddie sniffled and wiped her cheeks a steinway he noted thrilled for her figures nothing but the best for our little fred shut up nick still sniffling she took the phone from yuri mama oh mama the men went about their business as she wept into the phone he should have left with the rest of them nick told himself when he found himself alone with freddie thirty minutes later she was busy tuning the glorious gleaming instrument between bouts of weeping cut it out will you shifting uncomfortably on the new bench nick hit middle c some of us have emotions and arent ashamed to express them give me an a god what a piece he murmured makes my little spinet sound like a tin can she glanced over as she hit a chord they both knew he could have replaced the spinet with an instrument every bit as magnificent as this but he was attached to it looks like well be able to work here too if we want to she waited a beat flexed her fingers tried out an arpeggio if we have anything to work on yeah about that entranced with the piano nick began improvising a blues listen to that tone i am as delighted as he she picked up his rhythm and filled in on the bass about that she prompted hmm oh youve got yourself a gig fred youll have contracts by the end of the week youve lost the tempo he complained when her hands faltered pick it up she only sat her hands still on the keys staring straight ahead i cant breathe try sucking air in blowing it out i cant giving in she swiveled let her head fall between her knees they liked it she managed as nick awkwardly patted her back they loved it all of it valentine told me maddy ohurley said it was the best opening number of her career and she wanted more she dug the love song too of course it was my melody that caught her cram it lebeck but despite her sharp tone her eyes were wet when she lifted her head dont start leaking again youre a professional im a songwriter jittery with success she threw her arms around him and clung were a team looks that way he found his face buried in her hair youve got to stop wearing this stuff what stuff that perfume its distracting she was too overwhelmed by possibilities to worry about taking careful steps i like distracting you heedlessly she slid her lips up his throat until she found the vulnerable lobe of his ear and nipped he nearly gave in to the compelling need to turn his suddenly hungry mouth to hers and swore cut that out taking her firmly by the shoulders he pushed her back weve got a professional relationship here i dont want things clouded up withвђ with what hormones he decided im past the age where i think with my glands fred and you should be too she ran her tongue over her lips am i bothering your glands nicholas shut up he rose knowing he was safer with some distance what we need is some ground rules fine she couldnt stop the wide smile or the sparkle in her eyes what are they ill let you know meanwhile were partners business partners he decided it wasnt wise to seal the arrangement with a handshake not when she had those soft narrow incredibly sensitive hands professionals professionals she agreed she tilted her head and crossed her legs in a slow fluid way that had him staring carefully at a spot above her head so when do we startвђ partner chapter six nick knew freddies mind wasnt focused on her work theyd cruised along smoothly enough for two weeks but as the time approached for her family to come to new york for nadias and yuris anniversary party her work came more in fits and starts than in a flow he hadnt meant to snap at her really but the way her mind was darting from subject to subjectвђa new recipe for canapгs she just had to give to rio the art deco lamp shed bought for her living room the jumpy tonguetwisting lyrics shed come up with for a number in the second actвђthey werent getting any real work done why dont you just go shopping get your nails done do something really important freddie sent him a bland look and forced herself not to look at her watch again her family was scheduled to arrive in less than three hours i bet stephen sondheims taking an afternoon off wouldnt have sent broadway into a crisis he knew that and if she hadnt assumed they were taking the rest of the day off hed have suggested it himself weve got an obligation i take obligations seriously so do i im only talking about a few hours a few hours here a few hours there he refused to look at her as he reached up to change a note on the sheet of music youve already had plenty of those the last few days he picked up the cigarette hed left burning and drew deep it must play hell having your social life get in the way of your hobby she took a careful breath hoping it would help it didnt it must play hell having your creativity always at war with your sanctimonious streak that little barb stung as shed meant it to why dont you try doing your job i cant keep carrying you now her breath hissed out nobody has to carry me im here arent i for a change he tossed the cigarette back in the ashtray to smolder now why dont you try contributing something so we can earn our keep some of us dont have daddys money behind us and have to work for a living thats not fair thats the fact kid and i dont want a partner who only wants to play at songwriting when it suits her busy schedule freddie pushed back on the stool swiveledвђthe better to glare at him ive been working every bit as hard as you seven days a week for nearly three weeks now except when you had to go buy sheets or a lamp or wait for your bed to be delivered he was baiting her and even knowing it she swallowed the lure whole i wouldnt have had to take time off if youd agreed to work at my place yeah great working with all the sawdust and noise while yuri builds you shelves i need shelves she did her best to rein in the temper he seemed hellbent on driving to a gallop and it was hardly my fault that the delivery was three hours late i finished the chorus from the first solo in the second act while i was there i told you that needs work ignoring her nick started to play again its fine it needs work she let out a huff of breath but she refused to lower herself to the childish level of arguing back and forth all right ill work on it it would help if the melody wasnt flat that tore it dont tell me the melodys flat if you cant figure out how to write for it ill do it myself oh really and youve got such a way with words too sarcasm dripped as she rose from the bench go ahead then lord byron write us some poetry when his eyes snapped to hers they were dangerously sharp and ready to slice dont throw your fancy education in my face fred going to college doesnt make you a songwriter and neither do connections im giving you a break here and the least you can do is put in the time it takes youre giving me a break there was a growl in her voice feral and furious you conceited selfimportant idiot all youve given me is grief i make my own breaks i dont need you for this and if youre not satisfied with my work habits or the results take it to the producers she stormed across the room snatching up her bag en route where the hell do you think youre going to get my nails done she tossed back and made it to the door before he caught her were not done here now sit down and do what youre getting paid to do she would have shaken him off but after one attempt she decided she preferred dignity to freedom lets get something straight here were partners partners nicholas which means you are not my boss dont confuse the fact that ive let you call the shots so far with subservience youve let me call the shots nick repeated enunciating each word thats exactly right and ive tolerated your mercurial moods your sloppiness and your indulgent habit of sleeping until after noon tolerated them because i chose to attribute them to creativity ill work in this sty you live in arrange my schedule to accommodate yours even struggle to make something worthwhile out of secondrate melodies but i wont tolerate nasty remarks insults or threats his eyes were glittering now another time she might have admired the golden lights among the green nobodys threatened you yet now if youve got your little tantrum out of your system lets get back to work she jabbed her elbow into his ribs remembering his advice about putting her body behind it he was still swearing when she yanked the door open you go to hell she suggested and slammed the door hard in his face he nearly very nearly went after her but he wasnt entirely sure whether he would strangle her or drag her off to bed either way it would be a mistake what had gotten into her he wondered as he nursed his sore ribs on the way back to the piano the girl hed known had always been agreeable a little shy and as sweetnatured as a sunrise showed what happened he supposed when little girls became women a little constructive criticism and they turned into shrews damn it the chorus did need work the lyrics werent up to her usual standard and as he would be the first to admit her usual standard was stunning thoughtfully he ran a hand along the edge of the piano well maybe he hadnt admitted it not exactly but she knew how he felt she was supposed to know how he felt disgusted he rubbed at a headache brewing dead center in his forehead maybe hed been a little hard on her but she needed somebody to crack the whip now and then shed been pampered and indulged all of her life hadnt she it showed in the way she would carelessly shift priorities from work to social issues how long did it take for anyone to set up housekeeping after rachel and zack moved out hed been settled in fine in a couple of hours frowning now nick turned on the bench to face the room so it was a little messyвђit was livedin homey no the place was a sty hed meant to pick it up but since it never stayed that way what was the point and hed planned to paint and maybe get rid of that chair with the broken leg at some point it was no big deal he could take care of it in a weekend he didnt need the kind of palace freddie was setting up a few blocks away he could work anywhere it was irritating that the more time she spent in these rooms the more drab and unkempt they seemed to him but it was his business and he didnt need her making snide comments about the way he chose to live determined to push her out of his mind he set his fingers on the keys began to play after two bars his face was grim damn it the melody was flat in her apartment freddie put the finishing touches on the welcome snack she was preparing for her family already she was regretting not holding out for a larger place if she had rented a twobedroom everyone could have stayed with her instead of bunking in with alex and bess still theyd all have some time together at her place before the party and she wanted it to be perfect your problem exactly she mused and her shoulders slumped as she arranged fruit and cheese everything always has to be perfect to satisfy fred good isnt enough wonderful isnt enough perfection only or toss it out shed swiped at nick because he wasnt perfect hed deserved it though she assured herself making her sound like some spoiled child who was only playing at a career that had hurt hurt more because she wanted his respect every bit as much as she wanted his love the hurt continued to ache because he hadnt understood didnt understand how very much it all meant to her coming to new york was a thrill true but it had also been a wrench to her heart writing the score for the musical was a dream come true but it was also grueling work with the sharp terror of failure always balanced over her head like an ax didnt he know that if she failed as his partner she would have failed at everything shed ever wanted it wasnt just a job to her and it certainly wasnt the hobby hed made it sound like it was very simply her life because thinking of it made her eyes sting she fought to put it out of her mind and concentrate on the evening ahead it would be perfectвђcatching herself she swore and then nearly sliced her finger instead of the stalk of celery it would be wonderful she corrected having the whole family in one place celebrating the endurance and beauty of marriage because it was important to her shed taken on a great deal of the responsibility for planning yuris and nadias anniversary celebration herself shed chosen and ordered the flowers helped rio select the menu and worked out countless other details while nick was sleeping that morning shed already been at lower the boom decorating the bar she and rachel and zack had scrubbed the place down first so that every inch would shine bess had helped her with the balloons and alex had taken an hours personal time to pitch in sydney and mikhail had swung by to help rio with kitchen duty everyone had helped she thought now except for nick no she wasnt going to think about him she promised herself she was only going to think about how they would all make the evening as special for her grandparents as it could possibly be when her buzzer sounded she raced to it her eyes darting everywhere to make sure all was in place yes the kimball crew all present and accounted for dad youre early come up come on up fifth floor on our way freddie hurried to the door dragging at locks pulling at the safety chain unable to wait she raced out to the elevator fidgeting as she heard its mechanical whine she saw them behind the grate first when the car came to a stopвђher fathers gold hair with its gleaming threads of silver her mothers dark dancing eyes brandon with a yankees cap on backward and katie already tugging at the grate fred what a great place already as tall as her sister katie threw her long graceful arms around freddies neck theres a dance studio across the street i could see them rehearsing through the window big deal brandon said wheres the food ready and waiting she assured him brandon was she thought a spectacular melding of their parents gold and exotic doors open she accepted his quick offhand kiss as he brushed by her dad she giggled as she always had when he scooped her off her feet for a hug oh its so good to see you ive missed you she blinked back tears she hadnt expected as she reached out for natasha ive missed you both so much the house isnt the same without you natasha rocked in the tight embrace then eased back but look at you so sleek and polished spence wheres our little girl shes still in there he bent to kiss freddie again we brought you something more presents she laughed and slipped her arms around their waists to lead them to the apartment i havent gotten over the piano yet dad its beautiful he nodded as he stood in the doorway and studied it the dark wood gleamed in the sunlight from the window you chose the right spot for it she started to tell him that nick had chosen the spot then shook her head instead there couldnt be a wrong one you got anything but rabbit food brandon demanded as he strolled out of the kitchen gnawing on a celery stick thats all youre getting here you can stuff yourself at the party mama dad katie called out from the bedroom come here youve got to get a load of this my bed freddie explained to her puzzled parents it just came yesterday it was if she said so herself utterly fabulous the spacious room had allowed her to indulge in kingsize and shed chosen a head and footboard of iron painted a soft green like copper patinated over time the rods curved in a graceful semicircle and were accented by metal flowers and small exotic birds in flight wow was all brandon could say with his mouth full of the scorned rabbit food great isnt it lovingly freddie ran her fingers over the bars and along the ivorytoned lace of the spread shed chosen like sleeping in a fairy tale natasha murmured exactly freddie beamed if anyone would understand and appreciate the sentiment she knew it would be her mother and papa built the shelves here for the carvings uncle mik made me over the years i picked up this mirror at an antique shop downtown she glanced at the ornately framed glass its long oval shape accented by twisting brassandcopper calla lilies then grimaced at the cardboard boxes beneath i havent found the right bureau yet youve accomplished a lot in less than a month spence pointed out there was a little ache just under his heart he expected it would always be there when he thought of his baby living away from him but there was pride as well and that was what showed in his eyes as he draped an arm around her shoulders i hear you and nick are making progress on the score it comes and goes forcing a smile she walked back to the living room where brandon was already sprawled on the sofa and katie was darting from window to window hoping for another glimpse of the dance rehearsal i still need to change for the party freddie said a little later after they made a thorough inspection and caught each other up on their current events well need to get there early you have the tickets dad right here he patted the breast of his jacket two to paris opendated with a certificate for a stay at the honeymoon suite at the ritz mama and papa in paris natasha murmured after all these years for them to go back to europe like this gently spence brushed a hand over her dark corkscrew curls not quite as exciting as traveling through the mountains in a wagon no she smiled the memory of their escape from the ukraine the fear and the bitter bitter cold had never faded but i think theyll prefer it she noted as she had several times over the past hour the trouble lurking in freddies eyes i think you and the kids should go over now spence see if zack and nick need any help she smiled again sending a silent message to her husband ill stay here and primp with freddie curiosity came and went in his eyes before he nodded sounds like a plan save the first dance for me he added kissing his wife always natasha waited nudging her younger children along then accepting freddies offer of a glass of wine show me what youll wear tonight when i bought it i figured wearing it tonight would make me the sexiest woman there pride glowed on her face as she studied her mother exotic as a gypsy in flowing carmine silk after seeing you i guess ill have to settle for the second sexiest with a quick throaty laugh natasha led the way into the bedroom dont mention looking sexy around your father he isnt quite ready for it but hes all right isnt he about the move he misses you and sometimes he looks in your room as if he still expects to see you thereвђin pigtails so do i natasha admitted and sat on the edge of the bed but yes hes all right with it more than heвђboth of us are so proud of you not just because of the music but because of who you are no one was more surprised than natasha when freddie dropped on the bed beside her and burst into tears oh my love my baby what is it drawing freddie close natasha stroked and soothed there sweetheart tell mama im sorry giving up freddie pressed her face into natashas soft welcoming shoulder and wept i guess this has been building up all dayвђall week all my life maybe i am spoiled and indulged instantly insulted natasha leaned back to look at freddie spoiled youre not spoiled and not indulged what would put such nonsense in your head not what who disgusted with herself freddie dug around in her pocket for a tissue oh mama i had such an awful fight with nick today of course natasha thought with a little inward sigh she should have suspected it we often fight with those we care about freddie you shouldnt take it so hard it wasnt just a spat not like weve had before we said awful things to each other he doesnt have any respect for who i am or what im trying to do as far as hes concerned im just here to kick up my heels knowing if i trip you and dad will be there to catch me and so we would if you needed us thats what family is for it doesnt mean youre not strong and selfreliant just because you have someone who would reach out if you needed help i know i know that but it helped enormously to hear it all the same he just thinksвђoh i wish i didnt care what he thought freddie added bitterly but i love him i love him so much i know natasha said gently no mama taking a steadying breath freddie shifted so that her eyes were level with natashas its not like with brandon and katie or the rest of the cousins i love him i know the ache in natashas own heart swelled as she smoothed back freddies tumbled hair did you think i wouldnt see it you stopped loving him as a child loves years ago and it hurts comforted freddie rested her head on natashas shoulder again i didnt think it was supposed to it was always so easy to love him before she sniffled now look at me crying like a baby you have emotions dont you you have a right to express them she had to smile as her mothers words so closely echoed the ones she herself had thrown at nick days before i certainly expressed them this afternoon i told him he was sloppy and selfimportant well he is with a watery chuckle freddie got up to pace damn right he is hes also kind and generous and loving its just hard to see it sometimes through that shell hes still got covering him his life hasnt been simple freddie and mine has she reached out to trace the carving of a sleeping princess mikhail had made her with her finger dad worked hard to give me the kind of home every child should have and then you came and completed the circle you and the whole family i know nick was already a man when we came into his life and that the years before left scars its the whole person im in love with mama then youll have to learn to accept and deal with the whole person im beginning to understand that i had it all worked out she said turning with a wry smile on her face i had a carefully outlined plan but its not a simple thing convincing a man to fall in love with you do you really want it to be simple i thought i did now i dont know what i want or what to do about it you can make one part simple rising natasha took the tattered tissue from freddies hand and dried her daughters tears herself be yourself be true to that to your heart patience she laughed when freddie rolled her eyes i know thats difficult for you but patience freddie see what happens if you step back instead of bounding forward if he comes to you youll have what you want patience more settled freddie heaved an exaggerated sigh i guess i could try it she cocked her head mama am i bossy perhaps a little stubborn natasha tucked her tongue in her cheek perhaps more than a little amused at herself freddie smiled flaws or virtues both natasha kissed freddies nose i wouldnt change either trait a woman in love needs to be a little bossy and more than a little stubborn now go wash your face youre going to make yourself beautifulвђand make him suffer good idea nick decided he wouldnt hold a grudge since it was yuris and nadias night he wouldnt spoil it by sniping at fred however much she deserved it and maybe just maybe he felt a little guilty especially after coming downstairs and seeing firsthand how much time and effort shed put into making the place festive if someone had bothered to wake him up hed have given her a hand with a flick of his finger he sent the lacy white wedding bells over the bar spinning he wouldnt have thought of wedding bells he admitted or of the baskets and buckets of flowers that filled the room with color and scent he wouldnt have come up with the feathery doves hanging from the ceiling or the elegant candles in silver holders at the tables it would have taken her a lot of time to track down the decorations he supposed so maybe he should have been a little more patient with her dashing out on him or dashing in with her mind so obviously elsewhere hed forgive her and let bygones be bygones hey nick did you try those meatballs he turned cocked a smile at brandon i saw them and nearly got my hand chopped off reaching for a sample rio likes me better smug brandon slid a meatball from a toothpick into his mouth hey did you get a load of freddies bed her bed guilt fear and secret lust sharpened his voice of course not why would i its a real piece of work big as a lake brandon slid onto a stool and tried his most charming smile so nick how about a beer dont mind if i do i meant for me brandon complained when nick helped himself sure kid in your dreams he glanced over as the door opened and was very grateful hed already swallowed natasha was striking an elegant gypsy in swirling red silk but nicks gaze was riveted to freddie she looked as though shed draped herself in moonlight he tried to tell himself the dress was gray but it glinted and danced with silver lights and she was poured into it the simple scooped neckline and snugly cinched waist enhanced her slim fragile build and the way her hair was left loose and tousled made it appear shed just gotten out of that lakesize bed brandon had just told him about natasha immediately walked over to hug him and freddie offered him a quick distant smile but avoided meeting his eyes new suit freddie asked at random realizing she had to say something and shed been staring at his lapel for several seconds she approved of the tailored lines of the black jacket but certainly wasnt going to say anything about it i figured the occasion called for it but not for a tie she noted the open collar of the black shirt suited himвђas did the beer in his hand and the challenging glint in his eyes when she finally looked up she hoped her careless shrug masked her thoughts of just how dangerousвђand excitingвђhe looked the man didnt deserve her compliments after his behavior that day you look very handsome natasha put in thanks everything looks perfect i had a wonderful time arranging it all freddie said turning a slow circle to be certain everything was in place you did a good job in here it was nick thought a suitable white flag but she only tossed him a carefully bland look over her shoulder it looks great he continued wishing hed kept his mouth shut in the first place must have taken a lot of time ive got nothing but time according to some people brandon how about giving me a hand uncle mik will be bringing papa and grandma along any time hes not bringing them nick muttered into his beer what do you mean hes not bringing them of course he is i arranged it i unarranged it nick shot back then added theyre coming in a limo she blinked a limo i got the idea from someone he said and sent her a sneer its their anniversary after all its not like theyre just going out to dinner freddie made a sound in her throat that had brandon wiggling his eyebrows at his mother battle stations he murmured and leaned forward to enjoy the fray that was very considerate of you nicholas freddies voice was cool and controlled again causing her brother to sigh in disappointment im sure theyll appreciate it and of course it takes hardly any time and effort at all to pick up the phone and order a car im going to help rio she sashayed out or so nick described it to himself muttering he pushed aside his beer it looked as though it were going to be a very long night chapter seven freddie hated the fact that she couldnt stay mad at nick aloof maybe the bar was crowded with so many bodies the room filled with so much noise that it wasnt difficult to stay aloof from one man but she just couldnt hold on to her temper not after what nick had done for her grandparents in any case there wasnt time to brood over it or over him there were toasts to be drunk food to be eaten dances to be danced not that nick asked her to dance he partnered her aunts her mother nadia family friends and relations and of course the stupendously sexy lorelie well if he was playing the aloof game she would play harder great party ben shouted near her ear it is she managed to work up a smile for him as he awkwardly led her around the crowded dance floor im glad you could make it wouldnt have missed it ive known zacks inlaws for years terrific people the best her smile bloomed a bit when she spotted alex twirling his mother the very best i was thinkingвђ ben missed a step and barely missed her toes sorry failed my dance class youre doing fine though he was in danger of breaking her wrist as he pumped her arm like a well handle to keep his time she grabbed the first distraction she could think of to save herself have you tried the food rios really outdone himself then lets get some plates look at her nick thought darkly scowling at freddie as lorelie draped herself over him flirting with ben anyoneвђeven benвђshould have the sense to see that she wasnt interested just leading him on typical female nick honey lorelies creamy voice invaded his thoughts she sent him a melting look youre not paying attention i feel like im dancing by myself he sent her a quick charming smile that made even the savvy lorelie almost believe he thought of no one but her i was just wondering if i should check the bar you checked it five minutes ago lorelie pouted prettily she knew when she didnt have a mans full attentionвђand how to take it philosophically as attractive as nick was there were always other fish to fry well why dont you get me a glass of champagne then sure coming right up relieved he left her shed been clinging to him all night like poison ivy on an oak nick thought that kind of possessiveness always made him determined to shake loose the truth was they just werent clicking he didnt think he was going to break her heart or anything quite so melodramatic but nick had learned through sad experience that women didnt always take even the most compassionate breakup well hed have to let her down gently no doubt the sooner he backed off the better it would be for her the idea made him feel so altruistic and relieved that he opened a fresh bottle of champagne with a celebratory pop how come we get music only from that box yuri caught nick in a headlock that would have felled a grizzly are you a piano player or not sure but im kind of tied up here i want music from my family its my party yes the man who could deny a request from yuri was a tougher man than nick lebeck you bet papa ill get right on it here take this he handed yuri the glass of champagne no dont drink it with a quick laugh nick gestured across the room see the brunette over there the one with the bigвђ personality yuri grinned lavishly who could miss take it to her will you explain ill be playing for a while and dont lay on too much charm im very controlled then he rhumbaed over to lorelie prepared to enjoy himself nick made his way through the crowd to the piano his smile dimmed considerably when he spotted freddie already sitting on the bench youre in my spot she shot him a look that said in no uncertain terms that she was no more pleased with the arrangement than he they want both of us it only takes one its papas party yes he caught himself struggling with a grin at her imitation looks that way move over he sat deliberately shifting to avoid touching her tempting creamy shoulder and angled toward the keyboard beside the piano what do they want cole porter maybe or gershwin with a grunt nick began the opening bars of embraceable you freddie shrugged and flowed with him into the tune twenty minutes later she was too pleased with the partnership to attempt to be aloof not too shabby i can hold my own with forties stuff hmm automatically she picked up on the boogiewoogie hed slid into he was enjoying too much the way she always seemed to anticipate him in any improvisation and her perfume was driving him insane you can take five if you want i can handle this bens probably getting lonely ben blank she glanced up again oh ben i think he can survive without me but you go ahead and take a break im sure lorelie misses you shes not the possessive type to cover the lie he switched tempos trying to catch her but she kept pace with him easily really couldnt prove that by me the way she was hanging all over you of course some menвђ she broke off as applause erupted look at them she laughed everything inside her warming as she watched yuri and nadia jitterbugging arent they great the best why dont weвђson of a bitch what she bunked then refocused it appeared the lonely ben and lorelie were finding solace with each other if solace was quite the word freddie mused for the way they were nuzzling in the corner shes sitting in his lap i see where shes sitting so much for letting him down easy freddie muttered just as nick echoed the same sentiments applied to lorelie he snapped back first what what did you say nothing i didnt say anything what did you say nothing suddenly they were grinning at each other wellвђ freddie let out a quick breath as her fingers continued to move over the keys dont they make a cute couple adorable now theyre going to dance too bad for her freddie said with feeling bens a nice guy but he dances like hes drilling for oil i think he dislocated my shoulder she can handle it but lets slow this down before yuri kills himself he segued into someone to watch over me freddie sighed yearned romantic tunes always tugged at her heart flowing with it she looked over at nick maybe while she was feeling so in tune with him the taste of crow wouldnt stick in her throat it was lovely what you did for grandma and papa no big deal i just made a phone call like you said truce she murmured and touched a hand to his for a moment it wasnt just the limo nick though that was wonderful stocking it with all those white roses caviar iced vodka it was very thoughtful i figured theyd get a kick out of it as usual her simple sweetness layered guilt over his black mood pass the crow i came down pretty hard on you earlier i should have taken into consideration all the time and effort you put into getting things ready for tonight and setting up your apartment though why it took you so long to look for a lamp is beyond me her art deco lamp was her current pride and joy why dont you stick with the apology you did a nice job on the party thanks pleased with the small victory she signaled to her father to take over for her and since you talk so sweet she added leaning over to give him a kiss i forgive you i wasnt asking youвђ but she was already up and gone nick scowled when spence took his daughters place women couldnt have put it better myself shes certainly grown into an attractive independent one she was a nice kid nick mused you shouldnt have let her grow up spence noted with a glance at nicks face that natashas theory on romance probably was on the mark there was an ache around his heart spence supposed there always would be at the idea of his little girl moving into her own separate life but there was pride as well seamlessly he meshed with nick on a ray charles classic you know he continued boys are already coming by the house flirting with katie no way shock raced into nicks eyes first then the uncomfortable feeling of at thirty actually beginning to feel old no way if i had a daughter no way id let that happen realitys tough spence agreed then let the devil take over you know nick it certainly eases my mind to know that youre around to look after freddie id worry a lot more if i didnt have someone i trusted keeping an eye out yeah nick cleared his throat right listen id better take over at the bar for a while spence grinned to himself and added a flourish to the notes you shouldnt tease him natasha said from behind him laying a hand on her husbands shoulder its my job as a father to make his life a living hell and just think with the practice i have how good ill be at it when its katies turn i shudder to think it was after two before the party broke now only nick and freddie and a few straggling family members remained with a satisfied look freddie glanced around the bar it looked as though an invading army had suddenly pulled up stakes and gone off to another battle tattered crepe paper hung drunkenly so that white doves flew at halfmast the tables that had been loaded with food had been thoroughly decimated and all that was left of rios piece de resistance the fivetiered wedding cake were crumbs and a few smears of silvery icing there were glasses everywhere some enterprising soul had built a fairly impressive pyramid of lowball glasses in the corner she saw a forest of crumpled napkins littering the floor and oddly a single gold shoe with a stiletto heel she wondered how its owner had managed to walk out without lurching leaning against the bar zack took his own survey and grinned looks like everybody had a good time ill say rachel picked up a cloth and gave the bar a halfhearted swipe papa was still dancing on his way out and my ears are ringing from ukrainian folk songs you belted out a few yourself zack reminded her vodka does that to me wasnt it wonderful seeing their faces when we gave them their gift grandma just cried freddie murmured and papa stood there telling her not to nick put in while he was crying himself it was a wonderful idea freddie rachels eyes filled again as she thought of it lovely romantic perfect i knew we wanted to give them something special id never have thought of it if mama hadnt mentioned it you couldnt have come up with better rolling her weary shoulders rachel took another look around look i vote we leave this mess and tackle it in the morning im with you more than willing to turn his back on the destruction zack took her hand and drew her around the bar abandon ship you two go ahead freddie said casually she didnt want the night to end and if prolonging it meant dealing with dirty dishes so be it i just want to make a dent guilt had rachel hesitating i suppose we couldвђ no freddie aimed a quiet meaningful look go home youve got a babysitter to deal with i dont another hour wont matter zack said squaring his shoulders but well leave it to you rachel said stepping hard on her husbands foot butвђ zack finally caught the drift and the ensuing kick in the shin oh right you kids get a start on it im exhausted can hardly keep my eyes open to add emphasis he tried an exaggerated yawn well finish up what you dont tomorrow night freddie not sure if he should wink or issue a sharp warning in nicks direction zack merely stared nick yeah see you after the door closed nick shook his head he was acting weird he was just tired freddie said as she loaded glasses onto a tray no theres tired and theres weird that was weird which nick realized was pretty much how he felt now that he and freddie were alone listen theyve got the right idea its late why dont we pretend this is done and go away itll still be here tomorrow go on up if youre tired freddie marched toward the kitchen with her loaded tray i couldnt sleep knowing id left all this not that it would bother you she said over her shoulder as the door swung behind her its not like i made this mess myself nick muttered loading another tray i think i spotted one or two other people using glasses around here tonight did you say something freddie called out no nothing he carted his tray into the kitchen where she was already filling the dishwasher and set it down with a clatter you dont go to hell for leaving dishes in the sink you dont win any prizes either i said go on up to bed i can handle it i can handle it he mimicked in a mumble as he dragged out a pail he stuck it in the sink added a hefty dose of cleaner and a hard spray of hot water when he stalked out moments later she was grinning for the next twenty minutes they worked in silence that became more and more companionable it pleased her to see the food cleared away the bar gleaming again and she thought while nick wasnt exactly whistling while he worked his mood was definitely clearing up i noticed that ben and lorelie left together freddie began you dont miss much but his lips twitched they had a fine old time everybody did youre not upset he shrugged it wasnt serious lorelie and i neverвђ whoops watch your step we just didnt click she couldnt prevent the overwhelming sense of glee but she did manage to conceal it humming a little she picked up a chair upended it onto a table in the area nick had already mopped he swabbed a bit closer since she was being so easy about things he thought it was time to clear the decks fred i wanted to talk to you about this afternoon all right you know if we clean up any more zack will think we dont need him i dont want to hurt his feelings but she wandered over to the jukebox loitered over the choices inspired she pushed buttons turned you didnt dance with me tonight nick didnt i he knew very well he hadnt and why no she walked to him as the slow shuffling notes seeped out if i didnt care she thought the platters perfect you dont want to hurt my feelings do you nicholas no butвђ but she was already slipping her arms around him he laid his hand on the small of her back and led her into the dance his movements were smooth and surprisingly stylish always had been she remembered as she rested her head on his shoulder the first time she danced with him shed thrilled to them but there was a different kind of thrill now for the woman rather than the adolescent girl she fit so well he thought always had he remembered as he drew her closer but shed never smelled like this before and he couldnt remember her hair teasing him into brushing his lips over it they were alone and the music was right hed always been susceptible to music it tempted him now to rub his lips over her temple nibble lightly at her ear catching himself he swung her out in a slow spin that made her laugh her eyes were glowing when she turned back into his arms she followed his every move as though shed been born in his arms seemed to anticipate him as he walked her circled her twirled her again in a move as gracefully choreographed as the dance she lifted her head and his mouth was waiting he simply slid into her into the kiss the warmth the simplicity of it her arms came up encircled his neck her fingers skimming up threading into his hair he didnt hear the music end for it was playing in his head their own intimate symphony he thought he could absorb her if she would let him her skin her scent that wonderfully generous mouth as the kiss deepened lengthened he imagined how perfectly simple it would be to pick her up carry her upstairs to his bed the clarity of the vision shocked him enough to have him pulling her back fredвђ no dont talk her eyes were clouded dreamily just kiss me nick just kiss me her mouth was on his again making him long to forget all the reasons why it shouldnt be however confused those reasons were becoming he put his hands firmly on her shoulders and stepped back were not doing this why youre on dangerous ground here he warned her now get your things your purse whatever im taking you home i want to stay here with you her voice was calm even if her pulse rate wasnt i want to go upstairs with you to bed the knot in his stomach tightened like a noose i said get your purse its late her experience might be limited but she thought she knew when to advance and when to retreat on legs that werent quite steady she walked behind the bar to get her purse fine well play it your way but you dont know what youre missing afraid he did he dragged a hand through his hair where did you learn this stuff i pick it up as i go along she said over her shoulder as she yanked open the door coming it had just occurred to him that it might be a betterвђsaferвђidea to get her a cab but she was already outside just hold on he slammed the bar door behind him and locked it freddie began to stroll down the street beautiful night nick muffled his muttering and methodical cursing yeah just dandy give me your purse what just give it to me he snatched the glittery fancy and shoved it into his jacket pocket for the first time he noticed her earrings i bet those rocks are real these automatically she lifted a hand to the sapphireanddiamond clusters yes why you should know better than to walk around with a years rent on your earlobes its no use having them if im not going to wear them she pointed out with perfect logic theres a time and a place and walking on the lower east side at am doesnt qualify for either want to put them in your pocket too freddie said dryly before he could tell her it was just what he had in mind someone called his name yo nick glancing across the deserted street nick saw the shadow recognized it just keep walking he told freddie automatically shifting her to his far side and dont say anything breathless from the short jog a thinfaced man in baggy pants fell into step beside them so nick hows it hanging cant complain jack freddie opened her mouth but only a muffled squeak came out when nick crushed all the major bones of her hand fancy stuff jack winked at nick and gave him an elbow dig you always had the luck the man was too pitiful to bother decking yeah im loaded with it weve got places to go jack bet thing is nick im short until payday when wasnt he nick thought come by the bar tomorrow ill float you appreciate it thing is im short now still walking nick dug into his pocket pulled out a twenty he knew exactly where it would go if jack could link up with his dealer at this hour thanks bro the bill disappeared into the baggy pants ill get it back to you sure when icicles drip in hell see you around jack bet once a cobra always a cobra not nick thought if he could help it furious at being forced into the encounter and that freddie had been touched by the slimy edge of his past he quickened his pace you know him from the gang you used to belong to freddie said quietly thats right now hes a junkie nickвђ he hangs around the neighborhood sometimes during the day odds are he wont remember you he was already buzzed but if you run into him just keep running hes bad news all right she would have reached for him tried to comfort him somehow drive away the misery lurking just behind his eyes but they had reached her building and he was pulling her purse out of his pocket nick took out her keys himself and unlocked the front door then stepped inside and pressed the button for the elevator go upstairs lock your door come up with me stay with me he wanted to touch her just once more but his fingers still felt soiled where they had brushed jacks over a crumpled twentydollar bill do you have any idea what happened just now nick demanded we just ran into part of my life and if i hadnt been along he would have taken more from you than your pretty earrings he isnt part of your life she said calmly he isnt your friend but you gave him money so maybe he wont mug the next person he sees youre not one of them anymore nick i doubt you ever really were he was suddenly so weary so horribly tired giving in he rested his brow against hers you dont know what i was what i still might be now go upstairs fred nickвђ to silence her he gripped her shoulders and brought his mouth down hard on hers when she could breathe again she would have staggered but his hands steadied her as he pushed her into the elevator she could only stare system sizzling as he snapped the grate closed lock your door he said again and walked out he took a careful look up the street down then turned and waited until he saw her light flash on he took the long way home chapter eight shed had incredible dreams true shed gotten only a few hours sleep but she saw no reason to complain in fact freddie had awakened early feeling wonderful since she had time to spare she walked over to the village and spent the morning haunting some of the more interesting shops picking up what nick liked to call her knickknacks by the time shed cabbed home dropped off her newest treasures and walked out again she was running a little behind but the day was too gorgeous for her to worry about it spring was in full swing now with just a hint of the summer to come teasing the edges it made the day balmy and bright with none of the horrendous heat that could plague the city during the dog days she was freddie decided one of the luckiest women in the world she lived in an exciting city was embarking on a new equally exciting career she was young and in love and unless her female intuition was faulty she was very close to convincing the man she loved that he loved her right back every step of her plan was falling into place since she was feeling generous she stopped by a sidewalk vendor to buy both herself and nick a jumbo pretzel as she was slipping her change back into her pocket she spotted the man leaning on the front of the building across the street the thin face the baggy clothes with a little inward shiver she recognized the man nick had called jack from the night before he was smoking bringing a cigarette to his lips in quick greedy puffs as his eyes darted right and left like wary birds even though those eyes lingered a moment on her before passing on she saw no recognition in them relieved she turned away not that she would have spoken to him unless it was unavoidable freddie thought still she wouldnt have cared to explain to nick about any interaction she had with one of his old gang comrades she quickened her pace heading toward the bar without looking back though the back of her neck prickled she pushed jack out of her mind as she stepped into the kitchen and loitered there a few moments to praise rio for his success with last nights food nibbling on her pretzel she started upstairs her sunny mood didnt cloud over even when nick yanked open the door and scowled at her youre late so much she thought for loverlike greetings i wasnt even sure youd be up yet we had a late night he didnt care to be reminded of it im up and im working which is more than i can say for you hed had much worse than a late night he hadnt slept more than an hour and even that had been restless and sweaty old dreams and new ones had plagued him hed been raw then and he was raw now suffering from a combination of emotional and physical frustration hed never experienced before and he knew just where to lay the blame for it she was standing right in front of him looking as bright and golden as a sunbeam though she was well aware of his foul mood freddie smiled at him tilted her head he hadnt bothered to shave she noted but she didnt object to the look the angry eyes and stubbled chin gave him a sort of reckless and dangerous edge that was appealing in its way she had a feeling hed had trouble sleeping and couldnt have been happier rough night nick have a pretzel since she all but shoved it into his mouth he had little choice but to take a bite but he didnt have to like it wheres the mustard get your own she crossed to the piano and sat ready to work ive been working what else was there to do when you couldnt sleep what have you been doing shopping figures and before you start hammering me i happened to have finished the lyrics to youre not here pleased to be able to put him in his place she opened her briefcase and pulled them out i polished them up before the shops opened he muttered something but joined her on the bench in spite of himself his mood began to lift as he read them he should have known theyd be perfect still there was no use indulging her vanity theyre not too bad she rolled her eyes thank you richard rodgers his mouth quirked youre welcome stephen sondheim now that he looked at her really looked his gaze narrowed what did you do to your hair instinctively she reached up to pat it i pulled it back and put it up it gets in the way i like it in the way to prove it he started yanking out pins stop it flustered she batted at his hands he simply caught her wrists bracketing them with one hand while he used the other to pull her careful hairdo apart by the time the damage was to his liking he was laughing and she was swearing at him there he decided much better now youre a fashion consultant you look cute when it sort of sproings all over the place she blew it out of her face sproings thanks now her eyes gleamed maybe ill do some rearranging on yours she made her dive but he was quicker it had always been a disappointment to her that she couldnt quite outmaneuver him he just wrestled her backward until she was breathless and giggling it took her a moment to realize he wasnt smiling anymore but was staring at her staring with a sharp focused intensity that had her pulse stuttering and her throat going dry her legs had gotten tangled with his so that she was all but sitting on his lap a tug a sweet gradual pull stretched from her heart down to her center nick were wasting time he let his hands fall away untangled himself he just had to get on the right track he was sure of it and hed stop having these sudden voracious cravings for her well run through the number you just finished see how it plays patience she reminded herself and wiped her damp palms on her trousers fine whenever youre ready after a rocky start the work smoothed out both of them became focused on the music so that they could sit hip to hip as collaborators as friends one hour passed into two and two into three and more at one point rio brought up some leftovers from the party and stayed awhile to listen with a smile on his wide face they nibbled at food polished argued over small points and nearly always agreed on the big ones nearly it should be romantic comedic nick disagreed its their wedding night exactly he took time out for a cigarette secretly pleased that he was cutting down on his tobacco intake daily theyve rushed headlong into marriage theyve known each other three days theyre in love they dont know what they are thoughtfully he took a slow drag setting the scene in his head theyve just rushed off to a jp for a ridiculous ceremony now theyre in a brokendown hotel room wondering what theyve gotten into and what the hell theyre going to do about it that may be but its still their wedding night youre writing a dirge he only grinned ever really listened to the wedding march fred to prove his point he crushed the cigarette out and began to play it freddie had to admit it was solemn serious and a little scary okay youve got a point play it again and let me think she got up to pace letting nicks music run through her and she watched him and wondered what was it about him that pulled her so his looks perhaps that had been true years ago when a young girl first saw those restless green eyes but she looked deeper now his manner that made her smile hardly that however kind and loving nick could be he could be equally brusque and careless of feelings not that he meant to hurt others feelings she thought he simply forgot about them it was his heart she decided that had always called to hers and always would but what if she had met him only yesterday what if they had come together as strangers and she had simply irrevocably lost that heart to him would she be frightened unsure excited who is this man she murmured who calls me his wife it takes more than a gold ring to change a girls life she wrinkled her nose when nick glanced back needs to be sharper she said thinking she took another turn around the room till death do us part thats a deal with no heart love honor and cherish from now till i perish he turned and grinned i like it marriage and death quite a pair i can do better who is this man waiting outside the door whats he want me to be a wife a lover a whore hes going to see me naked theres no way i can fake itвђ she stopped laughed rubbed the back of her neck im getting punchy its the right theme he told her panic maybeвђ maybe she walked back to him what if we started out the way you have it slow funerealвђa celloandorgan thing then we pick up the tempo faster then faster panic building with a key change good try here to demonstrate she leaned over his shoulder putting her hands over his on the keys yeah i got the picture he wished to god her breasts werent pressing into his back youre crowding me fred the strain in his voice alerted her am i sorry but she wasnt not a bit she eased back a little listening to him work i think weve got it gently she laid her hands on his shoulders and began to rub youre tight his fingers fumbled infuriated him youre still crowding me i know her hair brushed his cheek and that damned perfume she wore shot straight to his loins intending on snarling at her he turned his headвђhis first mistakeвђand ended up staring into those wide gray eyes am i making you nervous nicholas she murmured as she slid onto the stool beside him the simple truth came out before he could stop it youre making me crazy good she leaned forward and pressed a soft lascivious kiss with just a hint of tongue full on his lips before he could evade youve been making me crazy for years its about time i had a turn his breath was backing up in his lungs he thought he understood exactly how a man feels when he goes down for the third time choking floundering and fighting a losing battle with fate his voice hardened in defense this isnt a game fred and you dont know the rules she slid her hands up his forearms rested them on his shoulders then moved in slowly until her mouth was nearly on his i imagine you could teach me he was holding on to control by a thread a slippery frayed thread that kept dancing out of his hands if you knew what id like to teach you youd run and run fast all the way home to daddy that statement had pride kicking in her chin shot up and her eyes dared him try me it was insane he knew it was insane to drag her against him to plunder that teasing tormenting mouth with his he told himself hed wanted to frighten her to make her leap up and race for the door for her own good but it was a lie when her body quivered against his then strained then melted that thin thread snapped and sent him tumbling damn it damn both of us he dragged her off the stool caught her up in his arms in a gesture every woman dreams of youre not walking away this time her breath might have come in shallow gasps but she met his eyes levelly im not the one thats been walking away nick and youre not going to get me to run either then god help you god help us both his mouth was on hers again wild and free as he whirled her into the bedroom the sheets were in tangles on the unmade bed a testament to his restless night the lateafternoon sun beat on the windows so that the light was harsh and unforgiving another time he might have given some thought to ambience to the romantic trappings she might have hoped for but now he simply fell with her onto the bed and plundered his hands were already dragging at her blouse and his lips were everywhere she didnt protest the speed or the urgency but met it beat for beat after waiting for him for so long it seemed right to hurry perhaps there was a small seed of panic lodged inside her the fear that she would fumble when it counted most would there be pain she wondered humiliation then his mouth was hot on hers again and the seed died withered by the heat before it had the chance to grow shed never imagined it could be like this so violent and intense a need so exciting all her fantasies her longheld dreams and quiet hopes paled against the brilliance of reality he couldnt get enough of her it seemed as if hed waited all his life for this one moment she was a banquet of flavors tart sweet tangy and he a starving man her skin was ivorypale with a fire just underneath that seduced and enraptured each small movement she made as fluid as the dance theyd shared the night before aroused him beyond belief part of his brain understood that she was innocent he knew she was small delicate he could feel that fragile skin those subtle curves under his hands so without even realizing it he slowed his pace and began to savor there was sweetness in her the shape of her mouth the curve of her shoulder gently he skimmed his lips down her throat calling on patience now to allow her to adjust to each new level of pleasure so he played her with care with skill adding notes and small flourishes letting them linger sustain and as he felt each response shiver through her saw it mirrored on her face he found there was no need to hurry after all she couldnt keep her eyes open they were too heavy odd how light the rest of her felt like thin fragile glass and he stroked and cupped her in those wonderful artists hands as if he knew she might break then his mouth moved down circling teasing then capturing her breast the pleasure arrowed into her and quivered there to touch him she thought hazily at last to touch him to feel that wiry strength those muscles covered by taut skin murmuring her approval she ran her hands over him freely delighted with each new discovery those soft testing caresses had the blood pounding in his head when his mouth came back to hers again he demanded just a little moreвђjust a little deeper a little longer he thought she looked like a princess under glass with her eyes closed her skin glowing and her hair like a sunburst over his pillow but she was trembling beneath him her lips were full and swollen from his patient relentless assault and her breath was quickening focused on her only her he eased her gently toward the next level when he cupped her she was hot and wet and irresistible her eyes flew open at the new intimacy and the pressure the unbearable pressure that seemed to press outward through her body threatening to shatter her promising to overwhelm even as she shook her head in denial she arched against him he took her flying toward the first peak so that she cried out shocked staggered by the impact her nails bit heedlessly into his back in response to the violence that gripped her held her helpless and made her crave then the tension spurted out of her leaving her limp she thought she heard him groan felt him shudder even as she shuddered but he was taking her high again so quickly so skillfully that she could only cling and let him lead his hands were balled into fists as he eased himself into her slowly so slowly that sweat sprang to his skin and his body seemed to scream out for release he knew he would hurt her damage her invade her but she opened for him fluidly as if shed been waiting all along he would burn in hell for what hed done nick cursed himself over and over but he couldnt find the strength to move he was still sprawled over her still inside her trying to recover from the climax of his life hed had no right to take her less to find any pleasure in it he wished she would say something anything so that he would have some clue to how to handle the situation but she only lay there limply with one hand resting lightly on his back his responsibility he reminded himself and it was time to face the music as gently as possible he shifted rolled off her she made some sound vaguely feline as he moved then simply curled to him he would certainly bum in hell he thought for wanting her all over again theres nothing i can do to make up for this nothing she said with a sigh and rested her hand on the old scar above his heart he stared fiercely at a spot on the ceiling can i get you something brandy maybe brandy puzzled she drummed up enough energy to move her head and look at him i havent been in an accident or been caught in an avalanche why would i need brandy for theвђ shock he supposed water then he said disgusted with himself something the lovely pink mists were clearing from her brain clearing enough that she could see the regret and selfcondemnation in his eyes youre not going to tell me youre sorry this happened damned right im sorry for whatever good it does i should never have touched you never have let things get this far i knew it was your first time pride wobbled how he finally shot her a look lets just say it was obvious i see perhaps after such stunning pleasure there could be humiliation was i inadequate inвђ he let out a breath then a curse the woman had turned him inside out now she wanted to know if she was inadequate no you werent inadequate you were amazing i was her lips began to curve amazing he recognized that smug tone and wondered how at such a time it could amuse him thats not the point i think its a good one though understanding and sorry for the torment she heard in his voice she shifted until she could look down at his face i always knew youd be my first nicholas i always wanted you to be he wondered why the thrill that sent through him didnt shame him i took advantageвђ she cut him off with a delighted laugh no way maybe you want to delude yourself that you ravished the virgin nicholas but i seduced you and i worked damned hard at it im trying to take responsibility here he said patiently youre making it tough you made me happy she murmured and lowered her mouth lightly to his i hope we made each other happy why should knowing that make you sad it didnt seem to make much sense but he found himself smiling at her youre supposed to be weepy and trembling and shocked oh she pursed her lips well maybe if we take it from the topвђso to speakвђill get it right the next time later he left her in his bed and went down to the bar for his shift for the first time in years he caught himself watching the clock though he drew drafts and mixed drinks with the ease of experience he nearly snarled at the few customers who lingered through last call the minute the last one was out the door he locked up he gave the bar no more than a cursory cleanup before rushing back upstairs she was sleeping her head nestled in his pillow her arm thrown out over the space where he would soon be he found himself grinning delighted just to watch her to listen to the slow even sound of her breathing the little catch in it when she shifted in sleep and rustled the sheet then an idea began to form in his brain that had him grinning and unbuttoning his shirt he left his clothes in a heap on the floor then eased down at the edge of the bed he tugged the sheet aside and picked up her foot freddie drifted awake on a tingle of pleasure it seemed to creep along her skin seep into her blood she heard herself sigh with it a lovely dream then she shot fully awake and into a sitting position when nick scraped his teeth along her instep nick disoriented pulse pumping she pushed the hair out of her eyes and blinked at the shadow at the bottom of the bed what are you doing waking you up his eyes well adjusted to the dark gleamed like a cats a wolfs he found it endearing arousing that when she discovered she had no sheet to cover herself she crossed an arm over her breasts and looked flustered too late he murmured ive already seen you naked feeling foolish she lowered her arm a little i had this interesting fantasy about nibbling on your toes and working my way up im indulging myself oh the idea had heat rushing through her come to bed eventually i want toвђ she trailed off sliding bonelessly back down as his tongue did amazing and wicked things to her ankle i figured since you seduced meвђ he progressed inch by devastating inch up her calf вђit was only right that i return the favor who would have thought she wondered that the back of a knee could be so wonderfully sensitive wellвђ her voice was weak fairs fair when freddie let herself into her apartment the next morning she was singing not only was she in love she thought but nick lebeck was her lover and she was his she did three quick pirouettes across her living room buried her face in the tiny white blooms of the violet hed given her then spun away again everything in her life was suddenly and absolutely perfect she would have deserted her beautiful new apartment and moved into the pigsty he lived in in an instant bag and baggage but she could easily imagine nicks face if she brought up the idea total shock she acknowledged and a good dose of fear well there was no need to rush she reminded herself not now but if he didnt make a move before too much longer she would have to take the initiative herself and propose still at the moment she was more than content all she wanted was a showerвђthe one shed taken with nick that morning didnt countвђand a change of clothes she was due back at nicks in an hour they still had a score to finish she was just stepping dripping out of the shower when her buzzer sounded coming coming coming tugging on a robe as she ran she rushed to the intercom yes fred open up the sound of his voice still had the power to thrill her nick youve got to stop following me haha now open up i wouldnt have had to run all the way over here if youd answered your phone i was in the shower she pressed the buzzer to admit him then undid her locks before dashing back to the bathroom she managed to tuck her hair into a towel and slather on some moisturizer before he walked in dont ever leave your door unlocked like that always the sweettalker she thought you were on your way up ever he repeated then eyed her didnt you just take a shower an hour ago she tilted her head then shoved the towel back into place as it tipped i put that more in the class of water games than grooming what are you the water police distracted he reached out to toy with her lapel what do you call this thing she glanced down at her short plumcolored silk robe a robe what do you call it an invitation but we havent got time get packed her brows shot up im leaving were leaving maddy ohurley called five minutes after you left she wants us to come to her house for a few days up at the hamptons in the hamptons whatever since the towel refused to stay in place freddie pulled it off now thats the idea her weekend homes there and shes got the family with her idly he reached out and tugged one of her wet curls she thought it would be an opportunity for us to work together and have a little r and r while were at it sounds like a plan so hurry up will you impatience was shimmering around him now ive got to get back and do my own packing rent a car and arrange for someone to take over my shift at the bar okay go get busy ill be ready when you are you wouldnt want to put any money on it would you holy hell hed backed into the bedroom as he spoke and now stood gaping what is that a bed she told him stepping forward to run a loving hand over the curved footboard my bed fabulous isnt it he grinned arabian nights or sleeping beauty i cant decide which something in between she arched a brow its bigger than yours it would make three of mine he fingered the lace of the spread he would have banked on her choosing lace slowly he turned his head looked back at her with a gleam in his eyes and lust in his heart so fred just how fast can you pack fast enough she promised and leaped onto the bed with him chapter nine freddie didnt see why she couldnt drive the snappy convertible nick had rented for the trip was a pleasure and she enjoyed having the wind rush through her hair the blast of the radio but shed have preferred being behind the wheel how come you get to drive she demanded because ive driven with you fred you poke i do not poke i simply obey the law poke enjoying himself he increased the pressure on the gas pedal there was nothing like driving fullout with ray charles pumping out of the stereo if you were driving we wouldnt get there until next week youve already managed to get one ticket she reminded him primly ten miles out of the city nick thought in disgust and hed been busted traffic cops have no sense of adventure but nick did and proved it by taking a turn fast this baby handles he murmured okay navigator check when our next turns coming i think were almost on it freddie glanced down at the directions snickered you passed it hotshot about a half a mile back no problem he zipped the car into a tight uturn that had freddie caught between a scream and laughter the general population can sleep easy knowing you live in manhattan and dont own a car make a left she instructed and slow down id like to get there in one piece he eased backвђa littleвђand scanned the big rambling houses they passed lots of lawn he mused lots of glass lots of money big rooms he imagined filled with oriental rugs and pricey antiques or glossy floors and stunning modern furnishings swimming pools with sparkling water and cushy lounge chairs set around them though of course those would be sheltered by trimmed shrubbery and grand old trees just the sort of neighborhood he would have been barred from a decade or so before now he was here by invitation its that one freddie leaned forward the cedar with the weeping cherries in the front oh arent they beautiful the blossoms were just past their peak already littering the ground with fragile pink petals but they did make a show nick couldnt claim to know a lot about horticulture but he thought the scent tickling his senses was lilac when he turned into the sloping driveway he was rewarded by the sight of a majestic bush loaded with lavenderhued spikes not bad for a weekend getaway he murmured studying the multileveled structure of glass and wood it must have twenty rooms probably i wonder ifвђ freddie broke off as a horde of children raced around from the far side of the house though of varying sizes and shapes they appeared as a mass until a slim darkhaired boy took another child out with a flying tackle that was likely to jar internal organs taking the cue the rest of them piled on shouting and wrestling i see maddy meant it literally when she told you the family would be here the whole family from the looks of it freddie observed thats maddys oldest boy trying to murder one of traces kids i think she smiled as a pixiesize girl with wild red curls and an unidentifiable smear on her cheek spotted them and waved mom the girl shouted hey mom company as an afterthought she gave the cousin she held in a headlock one last jab in the ribs then scrambled up and raced to the car hi im julia remember me of course i do after shed climbed out of the car freddie gave maddys youngest daughter a welcoming kiss nick this is julia valentine i wont try to sort the others out for you quite yet hi julia she had the look of her mother he thought if maddy ohurley really looked like the woman hed seen on stage and on billboards youve got quite a war going on hi julia beamed a smile at him we like to fight were irish nick had to grin that accounts for it theres a lot of us cause most everybody had twins trace had two sets of twins but aunt chantel had triplets she wrinkled her nose all boys come in ill take you inside being female if only seven julia focused on nick im going to be a dancer on broadway like mom you can write my music thanks as julia opened the door they were greeted by a small towheaded boy with a maniacal gleam in his eye and a croaking frog in his hands put chauncy back aaron julia ordered with the perfect disdain of older sibling for younger he doesnt scare anybody he will when he gets teeth aaron said darkly and scrambled out thats my little brother hes a pain before anyone could comment a redhaired rocket fired down the stairs she was wearing ragged cutoff shorts no shoes and an oversize faded tshirt that claimed she loved new york maddy ohurley broadways baby made her entrance with style aaron you little beast where are you didnt i tell you to keep this lizard in the aquarium spotting her visitors she screeched to a halt holding a very annoyedlooking silvery reptile by the middle oh she blew the hair out of her eyes so much for elegant entrances freddie she started to leap forward for a hug remembered and held the lizard out to her daughter julia do me a favor and put this thing back where it belongs that disposed of she caught freddie in a hard embrace its so good to see you im glad you could come so am i and youre nick with an arm still around freddies shoulders she held out a hand its great to meet you at last ive admired your work for a long time nick knew he was staring and didnt care she did look like the woman hed seen on the stage on billboards porcelain skin expressive face and despite being the mother of four a dancers gracefully athletic build my first broadway show he said ten eleven years ago you were headlining ive never seen anything like you before or since well maddy decided a handshake wasnt enough and kissed him instead im going to like you lets go see who else is around we can take your stuff upstairs later the house wandered and was full of light from wide glass doors bow windows skylights there were occasional obstaclesвђtoy trucks a baseball mitt someones disreputable sneakers those touches of home melded easily with the elegance of the architecture in a spacious sun room decked with exotic flowers and lacy ferns a hollywood legend lounged chantel ohurley had her feet up and her eyes closed nearby stood a man whose tough build and stance shouted cop to nicks wellschooled brain brents holding his own quinn doran said watching the children through the glass he may be the runt of our litter angel but hes game monsters chantel murmured but there was a mothers indulgence in the word why if i was going to have triplets couldnt they have been nice wellmannered little girls theyd have bored you to death besides who showed them how to use a slingshot she smiled to herself of course she had her boys she thought hers after years of longing being afraid to hope shed netted three at one time lazily she held out a hand the way a woman does when she knows it will always be taken come over here quinn before someone finds us too late maddy announced company nick my sister chantel doing her cleopatra impression and her husband quinn doran freddie chantel shifted fluidly to kiss freddies cheek but her gaze lifted to nick what excellent taste you have darling i think so now nick wasnt just staring he was goggling the blond goddess aimed her sizzling blue eyes at him and smiled every nerve ending in his body went on full alert youre writing the score for maddys new musical from what im told youve enough talent to make her sound professional maddy simply sniffed shes just jealous because i have two tonys and she only has one measly oscar satisfied maddy signaled come on well see who else we can find just a minute freddie murmured as she and nick passed out of the room through the doorway she dabbed lightly at the corner of his mouth what is it oh nothing just a little drool funny but he didnt resist one last look over his shoulder at the vision lounging on the floral chaise shes even better in person pull yourself together nicholas id hate to have quinn kill you in your sleep rumor is hed know how to do it quickly and quietly before he could comment freddie let out a shout trace while nick watched narroweyed she launched herself into the wellmuscled arms of a tawny man with a boxers build freddie trace kissed her lavishly hows my pretty girl im fine slinging an arm around traces neck she beamed back at nick trace ohurley nick lebeck nice to meet you though he was friendly enough his eyes skimmed over nick in a way that shouted cop again odd nick mused hed thought the guy was a musician hed even admired his work but a cops eyes were a cops eyes most everybody else is in the kitchen trace continued abbys cooking thank god maddy put in shes the only one we can trust are you hungry well iвђ you must be hungry she linked an arm through nicks and barreled on before he could finish the thought im always frantic to eat after a trip she led the way down a zigzagging hall nick noted that trace didnt bother to set freddie back on her feet but carried her along like some kind of white knight with a damsel the noise reached them first and then maddy swung open a door the kitchen was huge but so crowded with bodies and motion that it seemed cozy only the blond woman stirring something at the stove appeared at rest a scrawny man with thinning hair was whirling a middleaged woman around the room their steps meshed almost magically and they miraculously avoidedвђthrough some internal radar nick supposedвђcollisions with chairs counters and onlookers then when we went into the last number frank announced as he spun molly in three tight circles we brought the house down with impressive grace he whipped his wife into the arms of the man leaning against the kitchen counter then picked himself up a redhead molly knows ive got two left feet dylan crosby chuckled and passed his motherinlaw to his oldest son here ben dance with your grandmother before i damage her spotting trace frank grinned widely ive got your wife tracey the girl would have a career on the boards if shed just give up science he dipped gillian fluidly then spun her back hi there freddie girl seamlessly trace passed freddie to frank so that she was caught up in surprisingly ropey arms and became part of the dance you dance boy he shouted at nick actually iвђ dad let them catch their breath chuckling abby turned from the stove and moved to nick welcome to bedlam im abby crosby you were an ohurley first her father reminded her abby ohurley crosby she corrected and if you sit down quickly enough dad wont be able to make you learn to do a time step they were quite a crew nick discovered before he fell into his own extended family he hadnt really believed people lived this way but like the stanislaskis this confusing noisy group was a family and nick had learned that such families often talked over each other around each other and very often through each other they picked petty fights argued over nothing chose sides and united like steel against any outside foe he knew he was going to enjoy them could already tell some of the kids apart by the time the chaotic meal they shared was over twins and triplets abounded just to confuse things but it was no surprise he supposed as maddy and her sisters were triplets themselves after the kitchen was cleared both freddie and nick had agreed willingly with maddys suggestion that they run through a few numbers it didnt take long for nick to adjust himself to the households jumpy rhythm they even managed to get a little work done between distractions mom maddys oldest girl came to the music room doorway douglas is being a jerk again cassandras gaze was dark as she complained about her twin hes just a male honey maddy told her you have to be patient reed shot his wife a bland look over her opinion of his species cassie your mothers working remember i remember cassie heaved a sigh no interruptions unless theres blood maybe there will be she muttered before moving off why dont we take it from the second verse maddy suggested obviously unconcerned about the possibility of fratricide dont stop now ive got places to go people to see from the diaphragm maddy frank instructed as he strolled in three measures later you wont reach the back row that way its a nice tune he told nick and freddie had me whistling in fact i was thinking about the movements you know if weвђ dad we really need to get the vocals before we worry about choreography wheres mom maddy asked before he could tell her why she was wrong oh off with some of the kids now i was thinkingвђ probably went for ice cream if her mother wasnt around to jerk his chain maddy knew she had to resort to dirty tactics i heard a rumor about fudge ripple oh franks eyes glazed then gleamed well then id better go find them cant have the children overindulging dentists bills you know sorry maddy lifted a hand as her father scooted out my family no problem nick tried a new chord ive got one of my own second verse he said then lost every thought in his head as chantel sauntered in oh dont mind me she purred ill just sit over in the corner quiet as a mouse a rat maddy muttered go away chantel youre distracting my composer amused that it was no less than the truth chantel shrugged her creamy shoulders well if youre going to be temperamental ill go out by the pool maybe some of the kids want to take a dip she aimed a last melting smile at nick and glided away dont worry maddy patted nicks shoulder as he stared blankly at the keys she affects men that way testosterone poisoning second verse nick freddie helped the reminder along with an elbow to his ribs right i was justвђ thinking he made the effort managed to complete the verse move into the chorus but then abby raced by the music room window screaming with laughter as she was pursued by her husband with a very large water gun the children reed said and shook his head why dont we consider this a successful days work and take a break a swim sounds like a good idea a brilliant one maddy agreed you go ahead freddie picked up a sheet of music id like to fiddle with this for a few minutes come out when youre done then maddy reached for reeds hand if you can face it nick craned his neck to try to get a glimpse of the pool do you think shell wear a bikini freddie lifted a brow maddy they both knew who hed meant but the alternative wasnt an image a man would sneeze at either seeing that nick was lost in consideration of numerous bikiniclad ohurleys freddie laughed animal he ran his tongue over his teeth you think abbys going swimming too i think you can get in trouble ogling married women now if you can get your hormones under control id like to run through youre not here maddy might like to work on it later its rough yet i know but the cores there true enough he thought and it might smooth out the edges if they could work on it with maddy facetoface okay i was thinking if we tried it this wayвђ freddie closed her eyes listened as the first notes drifted out nodding to herself she added her voice to his music on the patio maddy held up a hand then laid it on abbys shoulder listen its lovely abby murmured as her eyes misted sad and lovely she doesnt hide it very well when she sings being in love with him no chantel slipped an arm around abbys waist so that the three of them stood together i guess theyll muddle through it we did with the music floating over them maddy gazed out over the lawn toward the pool there was dylan coaching one of traces girls in a back flip and chantels triplets in a heated lap race with gillian and cassie playing referee douglas was being the jerk his twin considered him splashing traces other daughter her father sat eating fudge ripple ice cream with traces twin boys on either knee ben and chris the boys abby had raised alone for a time were tall handsome young men arguing about which cassette to put into the portable stereo quinn and trace sat in the shade sharing a beer and war stories while molly applauded abbys only daughter eva on her underwater somersaults aaron and abbys youngest boy searched the grass for anything with more than two legs julia turned cartwheels to annoy them my family she thought as she lifted a hand to wave to reed all present and accounted for i feel good maddy drew in a deep breath threw her face back to the sun and i have a strong feeling that those two at the piano are going to help me cop another tony unable to resist chantel slid her gaze toward her sister oh darling do you have one already with a rollicking laugh chantel ran with maddy inches behind late late at night when the house was finally quiet nick drew freddie to him so that her head rested on his shoulder since maddy had been considerate enough to give them adjoining rooms hed felt no guilt about sneaking into freddies bed it was good to simply lie there with his heartbeat leveling toward normal and his body sated from the slow quiet love theyd made she felt so natural curled up against him he wondered how hed ever slept without her tired he asked her hmm relaxed its been a terrific day i loved seeing all of them again how much the kids have grown everything theyre quite a group they are that i think its great the way they all juggle their schedules so they can have a week or two each year with everyone in the same place sometimes they go to dylan and abbys farm in virginia she sighed sleepily and cuddled closer when his fingers began to stroke along her shoulder we visited there once its beautiful all rolling hills horses grazing space youd need a lot of room with all these kids abby has the twin girls right no thats trace and gillian abby has fourвђben chris eva and jed and she had them one at a time four he shuddered you love kids she shifted turning her head so that she could study his face it was beautiful in the splash of moonlight dreamy and heroic like something out of an arthurian legend sure i do but it always amazes me that some people can handle so many want to handle so many she was caught up in the way he looked that cool sculpted face the seagreen eyes the way it felt to press against him warm exciting and right i like big families i was an only child for a few years i wasnt lonely because dad was always there but everything just clicked into place when natasha came into our lives i wanted a baby sister she remembered but brandon came first and that suited me fine nick had been an only child himself but hed had no father to be there i used to wish for a brother then i had zack he shrugged he went to sea and i didnt her generous heart ached for the boy hed been it was hard on you his leaving he did what he had to do at the time it seemed like he was leaving me just me i got over it the wave of love rolled over her making her careless with words so now you have a brother again and an enormous family you never have to be alone unless you want to thats why id like at least three children myself a little warning blip sounded in his brain he glanced down at her then focused carefully on the ceiling well succinctly put freddie thought but she didnt allow herself to sigh it was much too soon to think about children their children it was a good time as nick saw it to change the subject chantel doesnt look like anyones mother now freddie lifted a brow well she is and if you dont mind a little friendly advice you really should try to keep your tongue from hanging out every time she walks into the room he looked at her again leered jealous she surprised and insulted him by bursting into delighted laughter it rocked her hard enough that she was forced to sit up and try unsuccessfully to catch her breath looking down at his scowling face only started her up again youre overdoing it he complained jealous gasping for air she pressed a hand to her stomach oh right nicholas im green no doubt shed toss quinn aside in a heartbeat to run off with you anyone can see they only tolerate each other thats why the air starts to sizzle when theyre in the same room together his pride was injured a little so shes stuck on her husband anyway how do you figure he handles those steamy love scenes she plays on the screen by knowing shes not playing a scene when shes with him i imagine unable to resist she brushed her fingers through his hair thats what marriage is all about isnt it trust and respect as well as love and passion another warning blip i suppose he said and let it stop there zacks going to drop his teeth when i get back and tell him about meeting her hes seen some of her movies enough times to recite the dialogue so youll gloat damn right relaxed again he glanced down at her she looked so pretty soвђ magical he supposed in the streams of moonlight that poured through the skylight her hair was a mess the way he liked it best and her lips were barely curved as if she were thinking of something that pleased her not tired huh more than interested she walked her fingers up his chest she had been thinking of something that pleased her shed been thinking of him i wondered if youd get back to that just building up my strength good laughing she rolled on top of him cause youre going to need it chapter ten youre telling me you met chantel ohurley the chantel ohurley thats what i said it was a big charge for nick to pull one off on zack it was no secret that the blond goddess was one of zacks little fantasies as rachel dryly put it the same chantel ohurley whose movies you buy on video the minute they hit the stands he hefted another crate of club soda into the storeroom wait a minute just a minute going in behind nick emptyhanded zack tugged on his sleeve you mean you met her in the flesh shes got some terrific flesh too let me tell you it didnt hurt to gloat i had dinner with her a couple of times nick made sure it sounded offhand added a shrug for good measure of course her sisters arent chopped liver either theyre bothвђ yeah yeah well talk about her sisters later you had dinner i mean like dinner with her zack found he had to clear his throat together with her thats right of course the meal had been shared by an entire household kids included but there was no need to mention those small details i told you i was going to spend a couple of days with maddy and reed i wasnt thinking zack muttered didnt put it together if you really met her had dinner with her whats she like nick turned pursed his lips in an exaggerated kiss come on youre killing me a victim of his own fantasies zack hurried out after nick i mean how does she look just hanging around she filled out her bikini just fine bikini overcome zack pressed a hand to his heart you saw her in a bikini we took a couple swims together sure actually he and freddie had been entertaining her triplets with water polo but why get technical swam with her zack swallowed hard gotвђ wet usually do swimming mindful of his blood pressure zack decided to ease back from that particular image hed save it for later and you talked to her had conversations all the time shes got a sharp brain that sort of adds to the appeal i think after all im not an animal im just asking it was a harmless diversion zack thought for a happily married man who adored and lusted after his own wife you really met her he sighed lifted a crate of soft drinks i not only met her i kissed her get out of town no youre right i didnt kiss her zack snorted no kidding she kissed me nick leaned on a dolly of crates tapping his finger to his lips she planted one on me right here youre standing there telling me chantel ohurley kissed youвђon the mouth hey would i lie to you zack thought about it no he decided you wouldnt before nick had a clue of his intention zack grabbed him jerked him forward and kissed himвђas chantel hadвђfull on the mouth damn it zack another flurry of oaths followed as nick grimaced and rubbed his mouth with the back of his hand are you crazy hey i figure its as close as ill ever get satisfied zack carried in the next case a man has his dreams pal well keep your dreams away from me nick gave his mouth another swipe for good measure man what if somebody saw you do that just us here bro and i do appreciate you coming in to give me a hand so soon after you got back in town dont mention it and i mean dont mention it so how did freddie like her trip to the rich and famous shes used to it nick scratched his neck as a line of sweat began to dribble its her kind of background i guess youre right its hard to tell shes just freddie around here they finished unloading the cases and finished off by having tall glasses of the iced tea rio had stored in the refrigerator hot for june zack commented youre going to have to hook the air conditioner up in the apartment before long it seemed a good opening zack mused for something that had been preying on his mind i was thinking with the way your careers moving and everythingвђ everything was freddie but it didnt seem quite the time to bring that up you might not want to stay on here upstairs yeah that and here working at the bar puzzled nick set down his glass are you firing me hell no the truth is i dont know what id do without you right now but i was beginning to worry that youre feeling obligated bartending wasnt your dream for your future it wasnt yours either nick said quietly thats different zack began then shook his head when he caught nicks look okay maybe it wasnt i had my shot made my choice and the fact is i love this place it makes me happy now i dont want either one of us to lose sight of the fact that youve got something else going still looking out for me habit nicks lips curved well lets put it this way sooner or later youre going to have to find yourself another bartender and parttime piano player but for the present working the night shift doesnt interfere with my composing and if the plays a bomb i need a backup it wont be a bomb youre right it wont but lets just let things float the way they are for a while he glanced at the clock swore damn im late i told freddie wed start a half hour ago see you later alone zack wandered back into the bar no he thought it wasnt the deck of a ship and he wasnt at the helm and rachel wasnt a blond movie queen he grinned and gulped down the rest of his iced tea and he was a very very happy man for another change of scenery nick had decided it was time they gave freddies piano a try despite the distractions the noise and the temptation to spend their time playing instead of working while visiting the ohurleys they had managed to buckle down long enough to make some real progress nicks tendency might have been to float on that for a day or two but freddie couldnt wait to get back to it so they settled in her apartment for the afternoon putting the finishing touches on act s closing chorus number it pops nick decided its a good thing we didnt finish this when frank was around hed already be working on the choreography well i like it but i thinkвђ nope time to stop thinking he snagged her pulling her into his arms as he rose put me down we havent even started on the opening for act tomorrow today she said laughing as she tried to wiggle free nick its the middle of the day even better youre the one who always says we have work to do that was when i was trying to avoid doing just what im going to do right now he dropped her onto the bed from a height designed to make her bounce we havent finished our quota for the day when he grinned at her and began to unbutton his shirt she pushed herself up thats not the quota i meant going to make me seduce you huh no instantly she thought better of it tilting her head she gave him a long considering look well maybeвђ if you think you can hed already unbuttoned his shirt the idea of a challenge put a new spin on the easy pleasure hed anticipated she slid her gaze away then back to him when he sat on the side of the bed just looking at me isnt very seductive i like looking at you now and again her brows lowered even as he smiled thats very smooth mr romance you have to remember youre not really my typeвђaccording to an unimpeachable source he merely caught her around the waist and pinned her when she started to spring off the bed in a huff im not interested she said coolly let me up oh youre interested this little pulse in your throatвђ he lowered his lips to it grazed over its hammering thats annoyance no when youre really annoyed you get this line right here with a fingertip he traced between her brows smiling when the line formed yeah like that he kissed her forehead as well satisfied when it smoothed i dont want you toвђ her words slipped down her throat when his mouth cruised teasingly over hers what toвђmmmm thats what i thought how could any man resist that slow melt she did that quiet purr in the back of her throat when a kiss drew out long and lazy and it was that way he wanted to make love with her now lazily so that his system could absorb every small and subtle change in hers a touch and she shifted to him a murmur and she sighed out her pleasure it seemed there was nothing he could do or ask that she didnt respond to willingly he wanted to see her all of her while the sun streamed in the windows and the spurting sound of midday traffic rattled against the panes his hands were patient and slow as he flicked open the buttons of her blouse one by one beneath she wore clinging cotton with a fuss of lace at the bodice he traced a fingertip along the edge dipped under it while her breath caught and quickened it was always this way she thought hazily effortless and lovely whether they came together frantic or teasing quiet or with shock waves it was always so simple so perfect she could feel her own arousal blossom inside her like a rose petal by petal it was just that easy to open for him to bring him to her so that their mouths met and their bodies fit the faint breeze from the open windows drifted over her as lazily as his hands so that her skin was warmed then cooled warmed then cooled dreamlike the sounds from the street below the streak of sunlight all faded into a background a kind of stage set for the fantasy she arched to help him when he drew the cotton away when he loosened her trousers in concert she slipped his open shirt from his shoulders letting her hands glide along the wiry strength of his arms she wasnt sure when the pace began to quicken or the heat to build the underlying urgency seeped into her like a drag then shot straight through her bloodstream now she was clinging to him moving frantically beneath him i want you now nick the explosive spurt of energy had her rolling over the bed straggling even as he straggled to possess the pleasure was suddenly dark dangerous careening from misty dreams into a rage of greed the hunger stabbed so sharp so voracious that both of them shuddered no one had ever given him this now she said gasping out the word as she mounted him crying out in triumph as she enclosed him stunned by the lightning change in her staggered by the force of his own appetite he gripped her hips hard and let her ride him it was later when he thought of it later when they lay together exhausted as children after a romp hed never given her the slightest hint of romance none of the pretty trappingsвђthe candles and wine the quiet corners and long walks she deserved better then again hed tried to convince her right from the start that she deserved better than what he had to offer since she hadnt listened the least he could do was give her something back he wished he could give her everything where had that thought come from he wondered and let out a quiet careful breath emotion whirled through him buffeting him like a storm he thought warming him like light calling to him like music when had he gone from enjoying her to craving her to loving her back up back up he warned himself it would be disastrous for both of them if he let whatever was bubbling inside him get out of control better to move on the initial idea he decided and pretend hed never thought any farther than giving her a special evening youve got a lot of fancy duds in that closet it amused her that he would have taken notice of her wardrobe even in west virginia we manage to shop and wear something other than overalls occasionally dont get testyвђi like west virginia it was where shed grown up in a big house with antique furniture and a livein housekeeper and hed grown up over a bar and on the streets with a stepfather who liked his whiskey just a little too much best to remember that lebeck before you get any crazy ideas i was just thinking you could pick out something jazzy and wed go out go out intrigued now she sat up blinking sleepily where wherever you like he wished she wouldnt look at him as if hed just conked her on the head with a bat theyd gone out before more or less ive got some connections i could get tickets for a show not mine he added before she could speak i dont want my own tunes competing inside my head she shifted again foolishly delighted by the idea of a date its kind of late in the day to snag tickets for anything not if you know who to call he trailed a finger lightly down her arm in a way that made her want to sigh she wondered if he knew he touched her just like that now and again without thinking about it we could have a late supper afterward at that french place you like not just a date she thought dazed a power date that would be nice she wasnt sure how to react and before she could he was up and tugging on his clothes get spruced up then ill go make some calls and meet you at my place an hour he leaned over to give her a quick kiss then was gone leaving her staring after him maybe he wasnt sir lancelot she thought with a shake of her head but tarnished armor or not he had his moments it took her every bit of an hour to pull herself together she hoped nick would consider the offtheshoulder plum silk jazzy enough she did wish theyd arranged to meet at her place however when she narrowly avoided getting her heel caught in the sidewalk she breezed past rio with a wave and a quick pirouette when he whistled at her a quick knock at the top of the stairs and she walked in this time youre late she called out had to help zack with a delivery oh she nibbled on her lip i didnt even think about your shift its my night off he strolled out of the bedroom still tugging on his jacket he gave her a long look and a nod of approval very nice youve got such a way with compliments nicholas how about this he grabbed her lifted her to her toes and kissed her until her head threatened to blow off her shoulders okay she said when she could breathe again thats pretty good abruptly nervous he let her go again weve got enough time before curtain for a drink why dont i play your personal bartender why dont you then a little white wineвђbartenders choice i think ive got something youll approve of hed snagged the bottle of cristal from zacks stash well freddies eyes widened this is certainly turning into a night to remember thats the idea he decided he liked surprising her doing something out of the ordinary for her he popped the cork with an experts flourish and poured it into two flutes hed commandeered from the bar to family ties he said and touched his glass to hers she smiled as she lifted her own glass what kind of a mood are you in i cant quite pin it down that stirring was going on again needs and longings tangling together in his stomach just around his heart im not so sure myself and the fact that he wasnt didnt make him as nervous as it should have because he was happy incredibly completely happy and he only got happier every time he looked at her he was certain he could go on looking at her for a lifetime and when that unexpected curve rounded like a fastball in his stomach his breath caught and wheezed out slowly are you all right solicitous freddie thumped him on the back im fine love a lifetime imвђ fine now it was her turn for nerves so she took a small step back why are you looking at me like that like what like youve never seen me before i dont know but that was a lie he hadnt seen her before not through the eyes of a man flustered by love he had he realized done the most amazing thing hed fallen head over heels in love with his closest friend lets sit down he needed to all right cautious she settled on the sofa nick if youre not feeling well we can take a rain check on the show no im fine didnt i say i was fine you dont look fine youre pale he supposed he was hed never been in love before hed danced around it toyed with it teased the edges of it but now it looked as though hed fallen headfirst into the pit with fred he was just getting used to the fact that he could make love to her but being in love was going to take a lot more thought it was a pity he couldnt wrap his brain around anything that wasnt sheer emotion fredвђ things have moved pretty fast between us she lifted a brow do you call a decadeplus fast he waved that away you know what i mean i was thinking that i might be hemming you in between the work and everything else the shiver that ran up her spine was icy and full of fear but her voice was calm enough are you trying to let me down gently nick no the very thought appalled him losing her nowвђit was unthinkable no he repeated and gripped her hand so tightly she jolted i want you fred im just beginning to realize how much her heart turned slowly over in her breast and swelled you have me nick she said quietly you always have things have changed he wasnt sure how to phrase it not in a way that would satisfy them both but he had to let her know something of what he was feeling not just because weve gone to bed together not just because what i have with you there is different stronger than anything ive ever had before nick swamped with love she lifted their joined hands to her cheek youve never said anything like that to me before i never thought you would neither had he now all at once he was afraid he wouldnt get the words the right ones out fast enough i dont want to push things fred for either of us but i think you should knowвђ the thud of heavy footsteps on the stairs had nick swearing and freddie cursing fate neither of them moved when rio opened the door looking grim nick youd better come downstairs a hard fist of fear rammed into his throat zack no its not zack rio glanced apologetically at fred but youd better come stay here nick ordered fred but rio countermanded him no she should come too she can help as nick passed him rio clamped a hand on his shoulder its maria nick hesitated looked back at freddie there was no way to keep her out of it how bad is she rio only shook his head and waited for nick and freddie to precede him the name meant nothing to freddie she thought it might be some old flame whod stormed into the bar in a jealous or worse drunken rage but the tableau that greeted her in the kitchen wiped that image out of her head the woman was dark thin and had probably been pretty once before trouble and fatigue dug lines into her face but it was hard to tell much of anything because of the bruises she sat absolutely still a young holloweyed boy gripping the back of her chair a smaller girl sitting at her feet with her thumb in her mouth in the womans lap a baby of perhaps three months cried thinly nick wanted to shout at her to rage he wanted to shake this woman this girl he had once known and nearly loved until she lost that empty hopelessly beaten look instead he went to her gentry lifted her chin the first tear spilled over onto her cheek as she looked at him im sorry nick im so sorry i didnt know where else to go you never have to be sorry for coming here hey carlo he tried a smile on the boy though he laid a hand very lightly on the boys shoulders carlo still stiffened and drew inward big hands the child knew were never to be trusted and whos this big girl is this jenny nick picked the girl up set her on his hip with her thumb still in her mouth she rested her head on his shoulder rio why dont you grill up some burgers for the kids already on jenny want to sit on the counter and watch rio cook when she nodded nick settled her there it only took a look to have carlo creeping over and out of the way i dont want to be any trouble to you nick maria began rousing herself to rock the baby want some coffee without waiting for her assent he walked to the pot the babys hungry maria i know with what seemed like a terrible effort she shifted reaching for the paper bag at her feet i cant nurse her im dried up but i got some formula why dont i fix it with a bolstering smile freddie held out her arms is it all right if i hold her sure shes a good baby really its just thatвђ she trailed off and began to weep without a sound youre going to be all right now freddie murmured as she slipped the baby out of marias hold everythings going to be all right now im so tired maria managed its just that im tired dont the order was quick and harsh as nick set the coffee in front of her he knocked you around again didnt he nick freddie sent a warning glance at the children you think they dont know whats going on but he lowered his voice welcome to reality he sat beside maria took her hands and set them around the cup are you going to call the cops this time i cant nick his snort of disgust seemed to shrink her i dont know what hed do if i did he gets crazy nick you know how crazy reece gets when hes drinking yeah absently he rubbed a hand over his chest he had the scars to remind him you told me you were going to leave him maria i did i swear i did i wouldnt lie to you nick ive been in that apartment you helped me get before the baby was born i wouldnt take him back not after the last time the last time nick recalled reece had knocked her down the stairs shed been six months pregnant so howd you get the split lip the black eye she looked wearily down at her coffee lifted it mechanically to drink rio set a plate in front of her im going to take the kids inside to eat thanks she swiped at another tear you two be good you hear dont make any trouble for mr rio she nearly smiled as freddie sat down to feed the baby her names dorothyвђlike in the wizard of oz the kids picked it out shes a lovely baby good as gold hardly ever cries and sleeps right through the night nick interrupted her patience straining maria in response maria took one shuddering breath hes been calling me wanting to see the kids he said he doesnt give a damn about those kids i know it marias lip trembled but she managed to firm it so do they but he sounded so sad on the phone and he came by once and bought them ice cream so i hoped maybe this timeвђ she trailed off knowing that hope was more than foolish it was deadly i wasnt going to take him back or anything it just seemed as if i should let him see the kids now and again as long as i was right there to make sure he didnt drink or get mean but tonight when he came around i was in the bedroom with the baby and jenny let him in it was too late nick i could see right away he was drunk and i told him to get out but it was too late okay take it slow he rose to wrap some ice for her swollen lip but she couldnt take it slow not now that it was pouring out of her like poison shed been forced to drink he just started smashing things and screaming i got the kids into the bedroom got them away so he wouldnt hurt them that only made him madder so he went after me i dont know how i got away from him but i got into the bedroom with the kids locked the doors we got out by the fire escape and we ran nick freddie murmured take the baby she rose passing him the dozing infant lets clean you up she said briskly and ran water on a cloth with gentle hands she smoothed it over marias face as she tried to soothe the bruises clean the cuts she talked softly about marias children caring for a new baby when she felt maria begin to respond she sat again took the womans hand there are places you can go safe places for you and your children she needs to call the cops however fierce his voice nick cradled the sleeping baby tenderly on his shoulder i dont disagree with him freddie picked up the wrapped ice offered it to maria but i think i understand being afraid theyd help you at a womens shelter help your children nick said i should go before but i thought it was better to handle it on my own everybody needs help sometime maria closed her eyes and tried to find some tattered rag of courage i cant let him hurt my kids not anymore ill go if you say its right to nick it was more than hed expected he knew he owed part of the win to freddies quiet support fred upstairs in the drawer under the kitchen phone theres a number it says karen over it call it ask for her and explain the situation all right as she walked away she heard maria begin weeping again shed hardly completed the arrangements when nick came in he took a moment to study herвђthe slim woman in the elegant dress im going to dump on you fred im sorry our whole evening is shot and its not over yet its all right but i dont know what you mean oh nick that poor woman his eyes only darkened i want you to take her and the kids to the shelter theyre not too happy having a man come around there in the first place small wonder id feel better knowing you were with her saw her settled in of course id be glad to ill come back as soon asвђ no go home the order snapped out just go home when youre done ive got something to do but nickвђ i dont have time to argue with you he strode out slamming the door behind him he had something to do all right and nick figured it would take very little legwork to locate his old gang captain reece still ran in the same circles they had when they were teenagers he still haunted the same streets and the same dingy rooms where a few dollars would buy anyone of any age drugs liquor or a woman he found reece huddled over a whiskey in a dive less than fifteen blocks from lower the boom the atmosphere wasnt designed to draw a discerning clientele the air was choked with smoke and grease the floors littered with butts and peanut shells and the drinks were as cheap as the single hooker at the end of the bar staring glassily into her gin reece hed put on weight over the years not the muscle of maturity but the heaviness of the drunk he turned slowly on the stool the sneer already in his eyes before it twisted his mouth well well if it isnt the upstanding lebeck bring my friend a gentlemans drink gus and hit me again put em both on his tab the thought struck reece so funny he nearly rolled off the stool save it nick told the bartender too good to have a drink with an old friend lebeck i dont drink with people who shoot me reece hey i wasnt aiming at you reece tossed back his whiskey and slapped the empty glass on the bar as a signal for another and i served my time remember five years three months ten days he took out a crumpled pack of cigarettes and pulled one out with his teeth youre not still sore i hooked up with maria are you she always had a thing for me old buddy hell i was doing her back when you thought she was your one and only a smart man learns to forget about yesterday reece but you were never too smart but its maria were going to deal with here and now my old ladys my business so are the brats was maybe the wolf was in nicks eyes now as he leaned closer to reece and the wolf had fangs youre not going near them again ever if you do ill have to kill you it was said quietly with a casualness that made the bartender check for his louisville slugger just under the cash register reece only snorted he remembered nick from the old days hed never had the guts to follow through on a threat with any real meat the bitch come running to you again i guess you figure she got off easyвђa split lip a few bruises she didnt have to go into the hospital this time a mans got a right to show his wife whos in charge brooding over it reece swirled his liquor shes always asking for it she knew i didnt want that last brat hell the first one aint even mine but i took her on didnt i her and that damn little bastard so dont you come around telling me i cant teach my own woman whats what im not going to tell you im going to show you nick rose stand up reece reeces reddened eyes began to gleam at the possibility of spilling blood going to take me on bro stand up nick repeated seeing the bartender make a move out of the corner of his eye nick reached for his wallet he pulled out bills tossed them on the bar that should cover the damages the bartender scooped up the money counted it and nodded i got no problem with that youve been needing the highandmighty beat out of you lebeck reece slid off his stool crouched im just the one to do it it wasnt pretty at first blood the hooker deserted her gin and crept out the door the few others who inhabited the bar stood back and prepared to enjoy drunk he might be but the whiskey only made reece more vicious his meaty fist caught nick at the temple shooting jagged lights behind his eyes and then another fist plowed into his gut nick doubled over but as he came up again his fist drove hard into reeces jaw he followed through methodically coldbloodedly concentrating on the face blood spurted out of reeces nose as he tumbled back against a table wood splintered under his weight with a roar of outrage reece charged nick like a bull head lowered fists pumping nick evaded the first rush landed a fresh blow but in the narrow confines of the bar there was little room to maneuver outweighed he went down hard under reeces lunge he felt reeces hands around his neck choking off air ears buzzing he pried at them sucking in air and gathering strength to drive a shortarmed punch reeces teeth tore his knuckles but he continued to hammer almost blindly now until the stranglehold loosened there was an animal in him it eyed reece ferally wrestled the bigger man over the floor there was the sound of smashed glass the sting of it pricking and biting at skin hate made him strong and wild and merciless he could smell the blood and taste it even as reeces eyes rolled back and his body sagged nick continued to pound enough it took the bartenders and two others to drag nick up i dont want nobody beat to death in my place you done what you come to do now get out nick staggered once wiped the blood off his mouth with the back of his hand you tell him when he comes to if he raises his hand to a woman again ill finish the job chapter eleven freddie considered going home after delivering maria and her family to the abuse shelter god knew she was drained as emotionally and physically exhausted as shed ever been in her life shed gone no farther than the entryway of the shelter herself but shed been relieved that it didnt seem like an institution nick had done his research well thered been childrens drawings tacked up on the wall and a small sitting room off to the side where the furnishings were spare but comforting the woman who greeted them had seemed weary yet her voice had been soothing freddies last glimpse of maria had been watching her being led up the stairs with the woman murmuring to her so she didnt go home despite nicks insistence but went back to wait for him figured youd be back rio said when she stepped into the kitchen you got maria and the kids away okay yes she sat let her shoulders sag against the chair it seemed like a good place a safe one i dont think she even realized where she was she just followed along like the children youve done all you can do rio set a plate in front of her you eat something now no arguments i wont give you any freddie picked up her fork and dipped into the chicken and rice who is she rio a girl nick used to know he didnt see much of her for a while after he got settled down here with zack and rachel when she got pregnant with the boy carlo her family booted her out heartless freddie murmured how can people be so heartless what about the father wasnt interested i guess rio shrugged caught himself and turned to her the boy isnt nicks you dont have to tell me that rio hed never have left them to fend for themselves setting her fork aside she rubbed her hands over her face this man the one who did this to her he isnt carlos father nope she didnt get tangled up with him until about four years ago he was doing time when the boy was born a real prince oh reece is a royal bastard all right rather than the coffee shed expected rio set a cup of herbal tea in front of her i guess the name isnt ringing any bells with you no she frowned sniffed the tea chamomile it almost made her smile should it he nearly killed nick rios dark eyes went grim a little over ten years ago he broke in here with a couple of his cobra slime buddies juiced up and armed to the teeth figured on robbing the place he was going to shoot zack the blood drained out of her face i remember oh god i remember nick pushed zack away and took the bullet rio finished i thought we were going to lose him but hes tough nicks always been tough very slowly as if her bones might shatter from the movement she rose where is he rio wheres nick he could have lied to her but he chose to tell her straight i gotta figure he went looking for reece and i gotta figure he found him she had to fight to get the air out of her lungs to pull it back again we have to tell zack we have toвђ zacks out looking right now sos alex he set a huge and gentle hand on her shoulder theres nothing to do but wait honey so she waited eventually going upstairs to pace nicks apartment every sound on the street from the bar below had her holding her breath every wail of a siren had her trembling hes tough nicks always been tough she didnt give a damn how tough he was she wanted him home whole and safe tormented by the images rolling through her brain she kept her hands busy she began to tidy the room then to dust then to scrub when she heard footsteps on the stairs she was down on her knees washing the kitchen floor she scrambled up raced toward the door nick oh god nick all but shattered with relief she threw her arms around him he let her cling for a moment though the pressure had the aches in his body singing when he found the energy he peeled her away i told you to go home fred i dont care what you told me i wasвђoh youre hurt her eyes went huge as relief jerked into shock his face was bloody one eye nearly swollen shut his clothes were torn and stained with more blood you need to go to the hospital i dont need a damn hospital he lurched away from her gave in to his weakened legs and sank into a chair and prayed to any god that might be listening that he wouldnt be sick dont start on me ive already been through this with zack go away fred instead she said nothing walked into the bathroom and gathered up every first aid supply she could find armed with antiseptic bandages and dampened cloths she came back to find him sitting as shed left him he took one look would have scowled if his face hadnt felt as though it would crack open at the movement i dont want you nursing me just be quiet her hands were a great deal steadier than her voice when she dabbed at the blood i imagine im supposed to ask how the other guy looks you had no business going after him it is my business she meant something to me once he hissed then settled when she pressed the cool cloth to his swollen eye and even if id never seen her before any man who knocks a woman around tosses kids around deserves a beating i dont disagree with the sentiment she murmured only with your method this is going to sting some more than some he discovered and swore ripely i wish to hell youd go away well im not she tried to comfort herself with the thought that the cuts on his face werent deep enough for stitches then she saw his hands whitehot fury erupted inside her your hands look what youve done to your hands you idiot why cant you use your head instead of your glands she could have wept with grief his beautiful talented artists hands were torn and bleeding dark ugly bruises had already formed marring them swelling them they ran into his teeth a few times isnt that just like you isnt that just typical nicholas lebecks first rule of order if you cant solve the problem batter it down she was wrapping cold cloths around his hands as she spoke you could have called alex dont hassle me fred you heard her she isnt going to file charges shes in the shelter isnt she she and the children and he just walks not this time experimentally nick flexed his fingers they were stiff and painful but it was the torso freddie had yet to see that was agonizing he tried to kill my brother once and did less than six years for it the system says hes rehabilitated so he gets out and starts hammering on maria so screw the system my way works he nearly killed you before her lips trembled as she rose he could have done it again he didnt did he now back off he dragged himself to his feet and limped into the kitchen he managed to locate the aspirin quickly enough but with his injured hands he found he couldnt pry off the lid her own movements stiff from a different kind of pain freddie took the bottle from him she opened it set it on the counter for him then poured him a glass of water how far nick her voice was controlled too controlled how far do you want me to back off he didnt turn only stayed where he was his hands braced on the counter his body throbbing with a thousand hurts i cant talk about this now if you want to do something for me youll go home leave me alone i dont want you here fine i should have remembered the lone wolf prefers to slink off on his own to lick his wounds ill just leave you to it as wounded as he now she spun on her heel she was halfway across the living room when zack came in brushing an impatient hand over her damp cheek she kept walking be careful she warned i think hes rabid freddieвђ but she was moving fast her heels already clattering on the stairs zack marched into the kitchen what did you do to make her cry nick only swore and dumped four aspirin on the counter stay out of it he winced as the water he swallowed burned his abused throat im not in the mood for company zack you arent getting company sit down damn it before you keel over that at least seemed like a reasonable idea with careful movements nick lowered himself into a kitchen chair standing back zack took a survey freddie had done some good he supposed but his brother still looked like the wrong end of a punching bag did a number on you didnt he he got in a few lets get whats left of that shirt off and take a look im not much interested in seeing but he couldnt drum up the energy to object as zack began removing the torn material zacks slow vicious oaths confirmed the worst that bad he got in more than a few damn it nick did you have to go looking for trouble i didnt have to look far did i he looked up then met zacks eyes coolly it was a long time coming now its done zack merely nodded began to open cupboards is that liniment still around here someplace under the sink maybe once he located it zack came back to finish what freddie had started youre going to feel worse tomorrow thanks just what i needed to hear got a cigarette on you i lost mine zack took one out lighted it placed it between nicks swollen fingers i hope he looks as bad as you oh worse the sour grin hurt a lot worse thats something then im surprised you had the energy left to fight with freddie i wasnt fighting with her i just wanted her out she shouldnt have been around this any of it maybe not but id say she can handle herself she was sure of it it seemed clear after two days that nick was determined to avoid her still licking his wounds she imagined as she walked back from nicks apartment yet again still she hadnt expected the locked door her only consolation was that zack had assured her nick was healing she was tired of worrying about him she decided and since work wasnt an option until his hands were better shed found other ways to fill her time shed enjoyed taking toys over to the shelter more than anything else maria still seemed nervous and strained but the children were already relaxing the highlight of freddies day had been when the solemneyed carlo smiled at her time she thought they only needed time and care and what she wondered did nick need apparently he didnt think it was freddie kimball at least not at the moment so shed give him the distance he wanted right now but sooner or later she was going to get sick of standing back and waiting love shouldnt be so complicated she brooded looking down at the sidewalk it all had seemed so simple when she left home to come to new york everything shed planned and hoped for had slowly come to be now because of some blip from his past it was falling apart on her with a sigh she opened the security door of her building the sudden jab from behind had her stumbling she would have fallen if an arm hadnt come around her jerking her back keep walking the voice ordered and keep quiet feel that its a knife you dont want me to use it calm she ordered herself dont panic it was broad daylight theres money in my purse you can have it well talk about that open the elevator the idea of being closed in with him with the knife had her struggling she bit back a cry when the blade pierced open the elevator or ill cut you open right here fighting to keep part of her mind cool free from the panic that had her body shuddering she obeyed once they were inside and moving he shifted her and she could see him the thin face the glazed eyes it was the man nick had called jack youre a friend of nicks she managed to keep her voice level i was with him the night he gave you money if you need more ill give it to you youre going to give me more than money jack lifted the knife running the flat of the blade over her cheek its a matter of honor baby i dont understand her wild hope of rushing out ahead of him screaming when they reached her floor was smashed when he twisted her arm behind her back not a peep he warned were going to walk straight to your place and i know which one it is ive seen your light come on then youre going to unlock the door and well go inside nick wouldnt want you to hurt me too bad about nick you pull anything out of that bag but your keys baby and youll be bleeding she took out her keys her movements deliberately sluggish if she stalled long enough someone would see someone would help move it jack yanked her arm higher so that she whimpered when the last lock opened he was sweating when he shoved her inside now then its just you and me he pushed her into a chair nick shouldnt have gone after reece once a cobra always a cobra reece put you up to this a new glimmer of hope tormented her jack you dont have to do this reece is just using you reece is my friend my bro his eyes began to glitter lots of the others they forgot what it was like in the old days but not reece he keeps the faith freddie might have felt pityвђfor surely the man was pitifulвђif fear hadnt had its bony fingers clutched around her throat if you hurt me youll be the one to pay not reece let me worry about that now take off your clothes now the fear screamed in her eyes seeing it jack grinned he was flying now hed used the money reece had given him for a nice solid hit of coke we might as well have a little fun first strip baby ive got a feeling nicks picked himself another winner he would rape her she thought and as hideous as that was she felt she could survive it but she knew in some cold corner of her brain that he couldnt intend for her to survive he would rape her then he would kill her and hed enjoy both please dont hurt me she let the terror ring in her voice she would use it to fight back you do what i tell you youre nice to me nobody has to get hurt he licked his lips stand up and strip or ill have to start cutting you dont hurt me she said again she braced herself she would need momentum and a great deal of luck if she didnt follow through she wouldnt get a second chance ill do anything you want anything bet now get up he gestured with the knife grinned she let her eyes slide toward the bedroom door go wide jack was just stupid enough to follow her glance and she sprang the keys he hadnt bothered to take away from her were clamped between her tensed knuckles like daggers without a moments hesitation or regret she went straight for the eyes he screamed shed never heard a man scream like that high and wild with one hand clutching his eyes he swung out blindly with the knife with every ounce of her strength freddie struck him over the head with her prized art deco lamp the blade clattered to the floor as he crumpled breathing hard she stared down at him for several seconds as if in a dream she walked to the phone uncle alex i need help she didnt faint shed been terrified she would but she managed to follow alexs instructions and leave the apartment she was outside swaying at the curb when the first cop car pulled up alex was thirty seconds behind it youre all right youre okay his arms came around her hard and the veteran cop buried his face in her hair did he hurt you baby no i dont think im dizzy sit down honey sit right here he helped her to the buildings stoop head between the knees thats a girl take it slow get upstairs he ordered the uniform get that lowlife out of my nieces apartment book him on assault with a deadly attempted rape i want the knife measured if its over the legal limit slap him with that too he said reece told him to freddie said dully dont worry well take care of it ill take you to the hospital i wont leave you alone there i dont need the hospital she lifted her head again the wavering dizziness had passed but she still felt oddly lightheaded he cut me a little i think testing she brushed her fingers over her side stared dumbly at the smear of red in a flash she was cradled in alexs arms the hospital he said again no please its not deep it stings some but its almost stopped bleeding it just needs a bandage at the moment he would have indulged her in anything still holding her he looked up as two of his men carried out a limp and bleeding jack he couldnt take her back upstairs alex thought and he wanted her away from the perp and the crime scene okay honey the bars close by ill take you there and well have a look if i dont like what i see your next stops the er all right she let her head rest on his shoulder discovering that all she really wanted to do was sleep this creep needs a doctor one of the officers told alex he needs one bad take him in then see that he gets fixed up i want him in shape when i lock him in a cell all freddie remembered from the short trip to lower the boom was alexs soothing voice it reminded her of being rocked when she was a child and had the chicken pox i didnt let him hurt me uncle alex no baby you took care of yourself just let me take over now rio let out a shout of alarm when alex pushed the kitchen door open sit her down sit her down right here who hurt my baby who hurt my sweetheart nick he bellowed it out before either alex or freddie could answer get your ass down here now moving like a bulldozer he shoved open the door between the kitchen and bar muldoon i want the good brandy in here pronto you just sit easy honey he continued in a voice that had lowered by several decibels and softened like silk im all right rio really already soothed she turned her face into the wide paw hed laid on her cheek looks shallow alex sighed with relief hed expected the worst when he tugged freddies blouse out of her waistband to examine the cut well patch it up for you what the hells all the commotion obviously annoyed by the shouted orders zack came in holding a bottle of brandy one look at freddie had him darting over and crouching in a position that mirrored alexs give her room to breathe though shaken rio snatched the bottle and poured a hefty two fingers into a tumbler drink it down freddie she would have obeyed if nick hadnt come stalking down the stairs his injured eye was more open than closed now but a rainbow of bruises and scrapes had bloomed on his face when he saw her the blood drained out of it what happened were you in an accident fred are you hurt he snagged her free hand nearly crushing the bones give her a minute alex ordered drink the brandy freddie take your time im okay but the jolt of brandy as it hit her system cleared the fog and brought on the trembling is that blood nick stared horrified at the stain on her blouse for gods sake shes bleeding were taking care of it alex took the antiseptic rio passed him and dabbed it on gently i want you to come home with me freddie when youre feeling better ill take your statement i can do it now id rather do it now what do you mean statement were you mugged nick demanded damn it fred how many times have i told you to be careful she wasnt mugged alex snapped out your old pal jack wasnt interested in her money as soon as he said it alex cursed himself pale as death nick dropped freddies hand and stepped back jack as fury filled the hole shock had dug his eyes turned to hard green slits where is he in custody whats left of him alex stroked a hand over freddies hair before taking out a pad and switching into cop mode tell me from the beginning everything you remember i was going home she began nick listened the bitterness burning his throat the impotence dragging at him because of him he thought all of it every instant of terror shed been through was because of him his need to settle debts to handle a problem his own way could have cost freddie her life then i called you freddie finished i could see he was bleeding his eyesвђ she had to swallow let me worry about him alex told her i want you to put it all out of your mind for now ill go back to your place and get some things for you you can stay with us as long as you like i appreciate that really i do but i need to go home she took his hand before he could protest i cant be afraid to stay in my own home uncle alex hed have gotten to me then dont you see im not going to let that happen hardhead he kissed her gently if you change your mind it only takes a call he rose then skimmed his gaze over the three men standing by you look after her ive got to get to the station and take care of this in a mute apology he laid a hand on nicks shoulder make her rest shell listen to you when he left freddie felt three pairs of eyes on her im not going to fall apart she said nick said nothing simply stepped to her scooped her off the chair i dont need to be carried shut up just shut up im taking her upstairs shes going to lie down i can lie down at home ignoring her he started up the steps you dont want me here as if to complete the day tears began to burn her eyes do you think i cant tell you dont want me here heres where youre staying he carried her inside and straight to the bedroom youre going to rest until you get some color back in your face i dont want to be with you a quick stab in the heart made him wince but he couldnt blame her im going to leave you alone dont worry his voice was quiet distant dont fight me on this fred please he drew the rumpled spread over her neglecting to take off her shoes im going downstairs he stepped back dipped his hands into his pockets do you want anything want me to call rachel or one of me others no she closed her eyes now that she was horizontal she wasnt sure she could get up again i dont want anything try to sleep for a while he moved over to tug down the shades on the window and plunged the room into soft gloom if you need anything just call down to the bar she kept her eyes closed wishing him to leave willing it even when she heard the soft click of the door closing she didnt open them again he hadnt offered the loving compassion alex had or the quick forceful concern of rio or zack oh hed been angry she thought furious over what had nearly happened to her she knew he cared theyd been part of each others lives for too long for him not to but he hadnt held her not the way she so desperately needed him to she wondered if he ever would chapter twelve she hadnt thought she would sleep it was a surprise to wake groggy in the halflight freddie wasnt certain if it was a good sign or a bad one that she remembered immediately and clearly what had happened and why she was alone in nicks bed in the middle of the day wincing a little as the bandage on her side pulled she tossed the spread aside she was unbearably thirsty and the brandy she was only vaguely aware of having drunk had left her a head full of cotton at the kitchen sink she filled a glass of water to the rim and drank it down it was odd and annoying she thought that she still felt so shaky then it occurred to her that she hadnt eaten since breakfast and that hadnt been much of a meal without much hope she opened nicks refrigerator she had her choice of a chocolate bar and an apple feeling greedy she took them both she was just pouring another glass of water when nick walked in carrying a tray his heart lurched when he saw her standing there so small so delicate and when he thought of what might have happened to her in defense he kept his voice neutral so youre up it appears so she said in the same distant tone rio thought you might want to eat something he set the tray on the table your colors back im fine like hell i said im fine youre the one who looks like hes been run over by a truck i went looking for my fight he said evenly you didnt and we both know where the blame lands in this one with reece in an attempt to keep himself calm he took out a cigarette reece wouldnt have given two damns about you if it hadnt been for me and if you hadnt been with me in the first place jack wouldnt have known where to find you she took a moment to steady herself so i see this is all about you in your twisted logic i was threatened with a knife and rape because i happened to have walked down the street with you one night the knife rape it froze his blood theres nothing twisted about the logic reece wanted to pay me back and he found a way i cant do much about it since alexвђ do she repeated interrupting him what would you do nick go beat reece up again pound on jack is that supposed to make it come out right no i cant make it come out right and that was the worst of it there was nothing he could do to change what had happened only what might happen next he crushed out the cigarette he found he didnt want you and i have to settle things though i think you should work at home when you feel up to it again i can send the music over to you what exactly does that mean just what i said i figure weve reached a point in the score where its just as constructive maybe more so to work separately his eyes shot to hers hardened and i dont want you around here i see she needed her pride now every ounce of it i take that to mean on both professional and personal levels thats the idea im sorry are you isnt that nice sorry fred times up she whirled on him ive loved you all my life i love you too and this is the best for both of us i love you too she repeated snagging him by the shirtfront how dare you come back with some watereddown patonthehead response when i tell you that very slowly very firmly he pried her fingers from his shirt i made a mistake hed convinced himself of it and now im trying to fix it i understand that you might get emotions confused with sex she shocked them both by slapping him and putting her weight behind it for a motionless moment there was only the sound of her unsteady breathing then she exploded do you think it was just sex that what happened between us was just heat and flash damn you it wasnt you know it wasnt maybe it was the only way i could get to you the only way i could think of but it mattered it all mattered i worked every step of the way to make you see it see me i planned it out step by step untilвђ planned he cut her off with one searing look you planned it you came to new york convinced me to work with you had me take you to bed and it was all part of some grand scheme she opened her mouth closed it again it sounded so cold so calculated that way it hadnt been hadnt been meant to be not when you added love i thought it through she began oh i bet you did the slip had given him the outlet he needed for his rage and distance i bet you figured it all out in that sharp little head of yours you wanted something and did whatever it took to get it yes she sat down now weakened by shame i wanted you to love me and whats the rest of the plan fred tricking me into marriage family white picket fences no i wouldnt trick you you wouldnt think of it that way but that was the goal wasnt it close enough she murmured i can see it he snarled out as he stormed around the kitchen freddies list of goals move to new york work with nick sleep with nick marry nick raise a family the perfect family he added in a tone that made her wince it would have to be perfect right you always want everything neat and tidy sorry to disappoint you not interested thats clear enough she started to rise but he pressed a hand to her shoulder and held her down you think its that easy i want you to take a look a good long one at what you were fishing for im two steps away from the guy who held a knife on you i know it the family knows itвђthe family youre basing all these halfbaked fantasies on isnt that the way you saw it fred like the stanislaskis why wouldnt i she tossed back humiliated that she was close to tears why wouldnt you because ive been around and you havent how many people do you think there are out there like them youre using topgrade for your yardstick theres nothing wrong with that it works it can work for them a few others is that what started cooking in your head when we were with the ohurleys another big happy family she lifted her chin it should prove my point it can work for them he slapped his palms on the table forcing her to stare into his face take another look here whats happened in the last few days is my world fred battered women frightened kids drunks who brawl in bars men who think rape is an entertaining pastime and you want to start a family on that you need to be committed youre not responsible for what happened to maria or to me no his lip curled look at the thread im the thread maybe ive been pulled out of that whole world he said but it only happened because of the family what do you think theyd say if they knew ive been sleeping with you dont be ridiculous they love you yeah they do and i owe them plenty do you think im going to pay them back by shacking up with you over a bar do you think im crazy enough to think about marriage and kids kids for gods sake where i come from i dont even know who my father was but i know who i am and im not passing it on i care about you sure i doвђenough to get you the hell out you care she said slowly so youre breaking it off thats exactly right i was out of my mind to let it get this far and i nearlyвђ now he broke off remembering how close hed come only a few days before to declaring himself what matters is you worked on me and i let things get temporarily out of hand it ends here for the sake of the family well try to forget any of it happened forget all of it im not going to risk hurting you any more and i sure as hell dont want to hurt the rest of the family theyre all ive gotвђthe only people who ever wanted me or cared about me poor poor nick she said with ice poor lost unwanted nick you really think youre the only one whos faced that kind of rejection or wondered just what lack might have been passed onto him well its time you learned to live with it i have you dont know anything about it my mother never wanted me thats bull natashasвђ not mama she said coldly my biological mother that stopped him it was so easy to forget spence had been married before she died when you were a kid a baby you dont know how she felt i know exactly there was no bitterness in her voice that was what tugged at him there was no emotion at all dad would have kept it from me i doubt he has a clue i ever overheard him talking to his sister or with mama i was nothing more than a mistake shed made then decided to forget she left me when i was an infant without a second thought and her bloods in me that coldness that callousness but ive learned to live with it and to overcome it he couldnt imagine her harboring that kind of pain that kind of doubt im sorry i didnt know no ones ever talked about her he wished he could have held her then offered comfort until her body lost that uncharacteristic rigidness he didnt dare offer her anything but that doesnt change whats here no it doesnt you wont let anything change freddie was crying now but the tears were hot more of anger than of grief you knew i was in love with you and you knew in the end i would have made any compromise any adjustment to make you happy but you dont make compromises nick lebeck youre too upset to handle this now im going to get you a cab youre not going to get me a cab she shoved at him youre not going to send me anywhere ill go when im ready to go and i can take care of myself i proved that today didnt i i dont need you she let the words hang closed her eyes on them a moment when she opened them again they were fierce i dont need you what a concept in my life i can live without you nicholas so you neednt worry that ill come around mooning over you i thought you could love me her breath came out steady strengthening her my mistake you arent capable of loving that way i wanted so pitifully little from you so pitifully little im ashamed he couldnt stop himself from reaching out fred no damn you ill finish this not once did you ever tell me you loved me not the way a man tells a woman and not once did you try to show me except in bed and thats not enough not one soft word not one you couldnt even drum up the effort to pretend and tell me even once that you thought i was beautiful no flowers no music unless we made it for someone else no candlelight dinners except when i arranged them myself i did all the courting and that makes me pathetic i was willing to settle for crumbs from you and thats exactly what i got it wasnt like that it appalled him that she should think so of course i think youre beautiful now whos pathetic she snapped back if i didnt think about romance it was because things got confused so fast that was a lie and he knew it yet he wondered why he was defending himself why he felt such panic at the steely disinterested look she sent him when hed been so hellbent on pushing her away i cant give you what you need thats very clear im better off without you thats very clear too so well do just as you suggested well forget it he put a hand on her arm as she started to walk out fred wait a minute dont touch me she said in such a low furious voice that his fingers dropped well finish our commitment to the musical and well make polite conversation around the family other than that i dont want to see you you live three damn blocks away he called after her that can be changed running home after all she shot one frigid look over her shoulder not on your life he thought about getting drunk it was an easy escape and would hurt no one but him but he just couldnt work up any enthusiasm for it he got through the night though he didnt sleep the music he tried to write in the dawn hours was flat and empty hed done what he needed to do he told himself so why was he so miserable shed had no right to attack him not after she told him that everything that had happened since shed come to new york was part of some plot he was the victim here and still hed done his best to protect her in the end imagine him married trying to raise kids he snorted then dropped into a chair because the whole picture was suddenly so appealing insane maybe he mused but appealing a family of his own a woman who loved him surely that was insane insane or not it was hopeless now the woman who had walked out the day before didnt love him all she felt for him was disdain saw to that didnt you lebeck you idiot hed had a shot it was all so clear now that it was over hed had a chance to love and be loved to make a life with the only woman who had ever really meant anything to him how could he have been so stupid so blind it had always been her if he had good news she was the first one he wanted to share it with if he was down he knew it would only take her voice over the phone to bring him up again friends he supposed that was what had thrown him all along theyd been friends and when he felt more than friendship for her hed tried to block it ignore it deny it hed used every excuse available to hide the real one he hadnt believed he deserved her even when their relationship changed hed held part of himself back shed been right hed never given her soft words hed never shared the reins of courtship now hed lost her he let his head fall back closed his eyes she was better off without him he was sure of that had been sure the knock on the door had him springing up shed come back was all he could think all the pleasure died from his face when he saw rachel well thats quite a greeting sorry dutifully he pecked her cheek i wasвђ nothing what you are doing here paying you a visit i dont have to be in court for another couple of hours she walked over to a chair sat gestured to another sit down nick i want to talk to you it was her lawyers voice that put him on guard whats the problem you are i believe sit when he did she laid a hand on his i love you yeah i know so i just wanted to get that out of the way so i can tell you what an absolute jerk you are the hand that had rested so gently over his balled into a fist and rapped his shoulder what a stupid idiotic inconsiderate blind male boob you are whats the deal he said between clenched teeth as shed squarely hit a spot that was still raw from reece he supposed he deserved the pain i stayed with freddie last night she didnt want me to but we ganged up on her oh he let out a careful breath so how is she as far as the attack on her shes holding up as far as your attack shes pretty hurt hold on i didnt attack her objection overruled i pried most of what happened out of her its bad enough that youve broken her heart nick but to mess up your own life while you were at it takes real skill his defense mechanism clicked in before he could stop it look we slept together a few times i realized it was a mistake and put the brakes on dont insult me nick she said coolly or freddie or yourself he let his eyes close with an oath the hell with it he thought the hell with defending himself with pride with anything else that blocked the way i love her rachel i didnt realize how much how bad it was until she walked out the door it was hard but rachel restrained herself from offering the comfort the sympathy that stirred inside her have you bothered to tell her you love her not the way she needed its one of the things i neglected so i gathered i wasnt prepared for it he pushed himself up to prowl the room she had it all worked out in her head one of her stepbysteps and you found that insulting rachel put in which proves youre a fool some more intelligent men might have found being found attractive and desirable by an attractive desirable woman a compliment it threw me okay it all threw me everything i was feeling for her hit me like a wall i didnt know it could be like this so to fix it you tossed her out she walked do you want her to keep on walking she will and if you dare tell me that youre not good enough that you havent got what it takes to make her happy ill really hit you next time theres only part of the boy i got stuck with all those years ago left in you nick and its the best part he wanted to believe it hed tried for more than a decade to make it true i dont know if i can give her what she wants then you wont rachel snapped back without sympathy and shell survive shes cried herself dry and shes purged most of the rage the woman i left a little while ago was very controlled and determined to forget you i want her back the thought wasnt as frightening as hed assumed it would be in fact it felt incredibly right i want it all back then youd better get to work pal she rose took him by the shoulders and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek my moneys on you lebeck nick wasnt sure hed take the bet himself the odds were long he decided as he carted his bags toward freddies building it was going to take some pretty fancy footwork to squeeze an entire courtship into one crowded balcony scene nick glanced up to the fifth floor of freddies apartment building and headed for the fire escape and where do you think youre going lebeck the beat cop nick had known half his life strolled up tapping his baton hows it going officer mooney but the wily veteran eyed nicks bags suspiciously my question was where are you going i need a break here mooney do you now well why dont you tell me about it see that window nick pointed waited until mooneys eyes lifted and focused the woman i love lives up there captain stanislaskis niece lives up there and the girls had a spot of trouble i know shes the one im in love with shes a little annoyed with me at the moment do tell i messed up and i want to fix it look shes not going to let me in the front you think im going to let you climb up to the ladys window nick shifted his bags mooney how long have you known me too long but he smiled a little what have you got in mind by the time nick finished telling him mooney was grinning tell you what im going to do since ive watched you grow from a snotnosed punk into an upstanding citizen im going to stand right down here and let you give it your best shot if the lady isnt receptive youre coming right back down deal listen it could take a little time shes pretty stubborn arent they all ill give you a leg up boy with mooneys help nick managed to yank down the ladder after a climb that reminded him that his bruises were still very much around he tapped on freddies window moments later she jerked it open her eyes were a little swollen and that cheered him even if the expression in them wasnt welcoming fred i want toвђ she slammed the window down and flipped the lock strike one nick mooney called up a man came out of the bakery behind him and paused next to the cop whats going on the boy up theres trying to charm the lady nick prayed it was just temper if shed finally written him off hed lose everything that mattered he only had to get her attention he assured himself and wiped a damp nervous hand on his jeans he pulled the flowers out first theyd gotten a little crushed but he didnt think shed notice he rapped again harder open up fred i brought you flowers look more than a little desperate he waved the bouquet when her face appeared on the other side of the glass yellow roses your favorite her answer was to yank the drapes smartly shut strike two nick shut up mooney he muttered he was drawing a crowd now but he ignored it as he pulled out his next weapon after arranging the candles in their holders he lighted them he turned to the blank window and tried to pitch his voice loud enough so fred would have to hear him but not so loud that hed get commentary from below hey ive got candlelight out here fredвђ did i ever tell you how beautiful you look in candlelight the way your eyes sparkle and your skin kind of glows you look beautiful in any light really sunlight or moonlight i should have told you that i should have told you a lot of things nick shut his eyes a moment took a breath i was afraid id mess up and ruin your life fred so i messed up anyway and nearly ruined both our lives his hands were pressed against the window glass now as if he could will her to open it let me fix it ive got to fix it just let me tell you everything i should have told you like the way the smell of you haunts me i breathe you for hours even when youre not there like youre inside me thats pretty good mooney noted to several people whod stopped to watch they all agreed with him open the window fred i need to touch you he wasnt even sure if she was listening all he could see was the insulated barrier of draperies he set up the portable keyboard to the hoots and calls of encouragement of the crowd below we wrote this song for each other fred and i didnt even know it he played the opening chord from it was ever you and tossing pride away sang he was into the second verse before she snapped the drapes aside and tossed up the window stop it she demanded youre making a fool out of yourself and embarrassing me now i want you toвђ i love you that stopped her he saw tears swim into her eyes before she fought them back im not putting myself through this again now go away ive always loved you freddie he said quietly thats why there was never anyone else who meant anything or could i was wrong stupid to think i had to let you go i need you to forgive me fred to give me another chance because theres nothing without you the first tear fell oh why are you doing this id made up my mind i should have done it a long time ago dont leave me fred give me a chance nick picked up the flowers again and offered them after a moments hesitation she took them it isnt just flowers nick i was angry then itsвђ i was afraid to love you he murmured because it was so big so huge i thought it might swallow me whole and i was afraid to show you her gaze lifted from the flowers held his shed once dreamed about seeing that look in his eyes the tenderness the strength and the love i never wanted you to be anything but what you are nick come on out his eyes never left hers when he held out his hand welcome to my world she sniffled then shook her head with a laugh all right but well probably be arrested for arson no problem ive got a cop watching even as she stepped out on the crowded platform she looked down besides the uniform there were several others in the audience someone waved at her nick this is ridiculous we can talk this through inside i like it out here shed wanted romance by god he was going to give it to her and theres not much to talk aboutвђjust tell me you still love me i do swamped with it she lifted a hand to his cheek i do love you forgive me i wasnt going to ever i was going to live without you nick thats what i was afraid of he laid a hand over the one resting on his cheek and now you havent left me much choice she brushed a tear away what were you thinking of candles and music before noon shed already forgiven him he realized humbled i thought it was time i did the courting do you want me to go to the next step in my master plan i want to apologize about that i hope you wont he lifted her hand and kissed it in a gesture that made her blink i intend to remind you for the rest of your life that you came gunning for me im glad you did he kissed her hand again im going to need a long time to show my gratitude watching her he shifted and took a small box out of his pocket im hoping youll give it to me marry me fred he flipped the top on the box to reveal an elegantly simple traditional diamond no ones ever loved you the way i do no one ever will nick she pressed her hand to her mouth this wasnt a dream she realized not a fantasy not a stage in some careful plan it was real and wrenching and perfect yes oh yes on a watery laugh she threw herself into his arms looks like the boy hit a home run after all mooney observed he gave himself the pleasure of watching the couple five stories up kiss as if theyd go on that way through eternity then he tapped his stick okay lets move along give them some privacy whistling mooney sauntered away he glanced back once smiled as he saw the pretty woman toss her bouquet high in the air nick lebeck mooney thought the boy had come a long way epilogue broadway rhythm by angela browning after last nights wildly successful opening of first last and always starring the luminous maddy ohurley and the delicious jason craig theres no doubt about these two stellar performers niche on the great white way the audience including yours truly adored them from the dynamic colorful opening scene to the wryly romantic closing number miss ohurley in particular proved her range and scope in her captivating portrayal of caroline from quirky ingenue to mature woman while these two stars and the inspired supporting cast lit up the stage it was the music that drove the production take it from meвђas of last night broadway has two new darlings the team of nicholas lebeck and frederica kimball have created a score that soared and dipped that raised the roof and touched the heart believe me there were few dry eyes in the house last night when the two leads reprised the haunting it was ever you notes and lyrics are certainly the heartbeat of any musical and this heart pumped with fresh energy and spirit mr lebecks debut score for last stop earned him rave reviews and sang with potential with first last and always hes proven himself his partner is every bit his match miss kimballs lyrics range from the gently poetic to the smugly cynical to the brashly funny slipping so truly into lebecks notes that its not possible to tell which came first like all great collaborations this one appears seamless perhaps this is due to the fact that the team of lebeck and kimball are not only musical partners but newlyweds married only three months the bride and groom had plenty of reason to smile after last nights smash opening i for one wish them a long happy and productive partnership how many times are you going to read that freddie sighed she sat crosslegged in the middle of the rumpled bed copies of all the early reviews spread around her and over nick her hair had long since fallen out of the sophisticated twist shed worn to the opening the sleek black gown shed spent days shopping for was tossed carelessly on the floorвђwhere it had landed when nick peeled it off of her theyd come in giggling sometime past dawn high on celebratory champagne success and healthy lust it was wonderful he grinned thanks with a laugh she swatted him with the newspaper and watched her wedding ring glint in the sunlight that streamed through the window it still gave her a wonderful jolt to see it on her finger not thatвђbut that wasnt bad either the night she said closing her eyes to bring it all back the crowds the people the lights and music the applause god i loved the applause remember how people stood up and cheered at the end of im leaving you first he folded his arms behind his head and continued to grin she looked so cute so pretty sitting there in one of his tshirts her hair curling everywhere her eyes glowing she looked soвђ his did they i didnt notice sure thats why you broke all the fingers in my hand squeezing it i was just trying to keep you from leaping on stage and taking a bow i felt like it freddie admitted i wanted to jump up and dance they loved it nick they loved what we made together so did i i loved sitting frontrow center and hearing what we created over the bar on my old piano and remembering what happened to us while we wrote the words and music she laid a hand over his linked fingers it was the most exciting time of my life and last night just made it all the more special everyone looked so wonderful all the family it was almost like our wedding day with everyone dressed up and beaming and you were almost as nervous you were every bit as beautiful nick watched her color come up her smile spread she wasnt used to him remembering to tell her he knew or being able to say it so easily mrs lebeck he sat up to comb his fingers through her hair to meet her mouth with his i love you nick she pressed her cheek to his and held tight its all so perfect i knew it would be if i waited long enough and somehow i know its only going to get better were a team and were a hit lebeck and kimball broadways new darlings she chuckled then nuzzled his neck you read it this time his hands had already slipped under the tshirt now after she murmured then with a laugh rolled over the rave reviews with him
