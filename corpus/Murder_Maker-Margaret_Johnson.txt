 chapter one the start of it all i used to think that murderers were born murderers but now i know differently now i know they can be made in my case it was shock that did it four brutal words that changed my life forever and who spoke those words you congratulations you created a murderer but even though ive killed three people im not to blame you are because you betrayed me and the sad thing is theres still a part of me that cant believe you did it still a part of me that loves you but dont worry ill deal with that i wont allow a little emotion like love to stop me from killing you but until then im hoping it will make me feel just a little bit better to write this whole story of sorrow and revenge down ive got to do something to stop myself from going crazy the day you dropped those first seeds of murder into my heart was a hot summer sunday afternoon in midaugust august to be precise charlotte and rebecca had escaped from the heat and were indoors in front of the tv quarrelling about what programme to watch no i didnt hear them quarrelling but when dont your daughters quarrel anyway they werent around even the puppy was asleep lying unconscious on the concrete after a morning of chasing flies and as for our neighbours they were all relaxing with the newspapers after their sunday lunches content in the knowledge that their gardens were tidy and their cars were shiny and clean and you and i we were lying on a blanket together in the garden side by side in each others arms beneath my favourite trees the tall grey poplar trees that marked the boundary of the garden i loved them for their changing colours but most of all for their music they sang and they whispered to us that afternoon just as they had sung and whispered to us on many other afternoons since i had moved to live in your house its still all so clear in my mind like a scene from a film i remember you had your eyes closed and a mixture of shadows and sunshine was painting your face your handsome face dark light dark light shadows sunshine shadows sunshine dappled shade you called it dappled shade was your favourite place to be if we ever had a picnic youd say lets sit in the dappled shade and if we went camping thats where we put the tent in the dappled shade i prefer full sunshine i must admit but i never told you that because what good was sunshine on my own you and the dappled shade were a million times better to me than full sunshine on my own you my man my property mine i was completely confident of my status as your lifelong partner lying there beneath the grey poplars i had no doubt at all that we would be together forever that we would be walking hand in hand by the sea together after our hair had turned white and your daughters were busy with their own lives you and me together forever right up until one of us died pathetic really especially as you killed me with your words right there in the garden on august and the worst of it was there was no warning at all nothing to prepare me for those four little words of destruction one moment i was lying sleepily next to you under the trees watching the stripes of sunshine painting your face and the next moment i heard you give a strange nervous cough carla you said and something about your voice made me feel instantly afraid i remember turning my body towards you and holding my hand to keep the sun out of my eyes whats wrong darling i must have said or something very similar poor innocent creature i thought you were ill or something i was worried about you tell me whats wrong mark please well you told me you certainly did you looked at me with your beautiful dark eyes and you said im sorry carla im so sorry theres no easy way to say this so ill just come right out and say it i ive met somebody else ive been busy in the last twelve months ive changed my hairstyle moved to a new city and started a new job had a string of affairs some of the sex was even quite good i think i was a bit crazy for six months or so i certainly didnt care very much what happened to me or what i did so i did pretty much whatever i wanted anything i thought might limit the pain and sometimes it even worked for a short time then one rainy morning i woke up next to some man id met in a nightclub the previous evening and i couldnt even remember his name there was an empty bottle of vodka on the bedside table and my headache was so bad i knew i was responsible for drinking at least half of it i went to the bathroom and when i looked at my reflection in the mirror i didnt like what i saw my face was as white as a ghosts and there were black circles beneath my eyes i looked wild and out of control and worst of all i knew that all the time i was suffering you were with another woman i doubted whether you even thought about me any more at all suddenly as i stood there looking at my reflection in the bathroom mirror the injustice of everything hit me right in the stomach like a hard punch i had loved you with all my heart and in return you had stamped me into the dust after id thrown the stranger out of my bed and out of my flat i stood under the shower with the water mixing with my tears until the water ran cold then as i dried my shivering body i decided that enough was enough i couldnt go on like this i had to do something to make me feel better and drinking vodka and spending time with anonymous men clearly wasnt working a few weeks earlier id seen an advert in the newspaper for a special course for people who have experienced a broken relationship it was a restart course i dialled the number in the advert and two weeks later i was sitting in a classroom for the first session and thats where i met diane gemma and cathy let me tell you theyre worth at least a hundred of you and for the moment theyre my family or the only family that counts let me introduce them first up theres diane fiftytwo brutally rejected by her husband of twentyfive years in an email from cuba then theres cathy thirtytwo abandoned by her husband after several years of depression next theres gemma fortyfive who made her escape from a twentyyear marriage to a man who cruelly abused her and then theres me carla thirtyfive replaced by a blonde business studies teacher you met on holiday while i was at home loyally looking after your daughters after the weekly restart class the girls and i always go to the pub next to the college to have a few drinks and to laugh away some of the tension and later on we inevitably start to remember happier times my alec and i used to have such fun when we were first together got into trouble all the time thats diane long blonde hair loud laugh turning heads left right and centre even though shes old enough to be cathys mother one night on our honeymoon we decided to make love outdoors exciting and romantic you know anyway wed just taken our clothes off when a group of elderly walkers came round the corner i dont know who was more embarrassed them or us diane tried to kill herself earlier this year with a combination of alcohol and headache pills fortunately she was discovered before it was too late but she was seriously ill for some time and alec the father of their three daughters didnt even bother to get up from beneath his cuban beauty to find out how she was diane gemma and cathy ive hardly known them any time at all but somehow i feel ive known them forever if a life can be so completely changed in the space it takes someone to say four short words then the whole idea of time means nothing anyway he sent me another charming email from havana today diane continues hes disputing my solicitors claim that i should receive half his pension the horrible man gemma exclaims and then she goes on to tell us about a story she read in the newspaper that day about a woman who took revenge on her cheating husband his hobby was collecting valuable wine she told us gemmas really pretty and shes gradually becoming more confident now shes got rid of her horrible husband anyway his wife was so angry with him she went right round their village leaving bottles of his wine outside peoples houses we all laughed me especially i could just imagine how satisfying it must have been for that woman getting rid of all her husbands precious wine so a little later on in the evening when cathy told us all she was thinking of going away on holiday gemmas story and the idea of a holiday connected in my mind revenge holiday after the way youd treated me i deserved a holiday and why not go to cuba it was a country youd always wanted to visit if you ever found out id been there before you youd be sick with jealousy yes it would be a kind of revenge in a way to go there first not as extreme as the wine story of course but it would be a start yes i could view it as a first step a practice for some sort of serious revenge i could spend my time in cuba planning what to do to you or perhaps better still i could practise first on someone else so i turned towards diane and said casually im going on holiday to cuba next month do you want me to pay your husband a visit chapter two whispers and echoes i experienced havana through your eyes no that doesnt express it properly it wasnt an intellectual thing at all i didnt think mark would have liked this or mark would have done that it was more as if i became you as if your spirit possessed me in some strange way making me respond to my surroundings the way you would the dilapidated havana streets are alive with shady characters especially old havana or habana vieja as its called in spanish the streets of habana vieja are no place for a foreign woman to walk alone after dark i can tell you or probably even during the day for that matter but the very first night i was in havana i left the normal tourist routes far behind and wandered past the nearruined houses along dark streets and i wasnt afraid i walked tall with my shoulders back all my senses working overtime as they absorbed the unique mixture of sights and sounds that is a real havana night tourists mostly experience a cuba with its sundaybest clothes on a poor but cheerful country where everybody smiles constantly and tries their very best to please you in a country where a tour guide earns more than a doctor i suppose this isnt very surprising certainly behind every smiled welcome theres a hunger they want your money but theyre very polite about it its not the same as when we went on holiday to india and we had crowds of beggars running after us no cuban people are prepared to be nice to you in order to get their hands on your dollars its only when you examine those smiles a little more closely that you begin to see how false they are really theyre jealous of you with your expensive watch designer sunglasses and above all your passport and freedom to travel in a country where the supermarket shelves are often almost empty a tourist is like a precious jewel in a pile of dusty stones the real havana is a city of whispers and echoes youd love it you really would lovers kiss in dark passages while music drifts in the humid winds paint peels from the front of oncegrand buildings and men sit in doorways smoking cigars and drinking rum and of course there are all the wonderful old cars left over from the days when hollywood stars visited the city in the s before the revolution cadillac cars sail along the streets curiosities from another time polluting the atmosphere as they go money that could be spent on clothes or food is spent on cars by people with nowhere to go and nothing to do havana is a city populated by people waiting for something to happen and as i walked along the dark streets of habana vieja carrying the spirit of you inside me many of the people sitting in doorways decided that i might be what they were waiting for an opportunity they used the traditional cuban way to attract my attention by making a sound that isnt quite a whistle or a shout but a strange hiss like a water bird on a lake and some of the younger men found the energy to get up from their steps to follow me bringing the smell of cigars and rum along with them hey senorita where are you going senorita you are very beautiful and somehow perhaps because i was away from the regular tourist routes their smiles seemed more genuine than usual was i in danger i honestly dont know im not even sure i cared very much oh i suppose i didnt really want any actual harm to come to me but since losing you i have been very aware of how unpredictable life can be of how at risk and vulnerable we are all the time the dark streets of habana vieja just didnt seem any more or less dangerous than anywhere else thats all anyway i was alone in those unpredictable havana streets for a reason alec cartwright was renting a room somewhere near to where i was i had his address in my pocket written by diane on a piece of expensive notepaper but it would be no use going straight round there to challenge him after all what would i say what would i do no i needed time to observe him time to find out about his habits and his way of life that way i could identify any weak spots which could form the basis of my revenge plans you see i wasnt thinking of murder then only of some sort of simple revenge but in order to study alec cartwright i needed to find myself a base somewhere close to where he lived fortunately luck was on my side suddenly in the dull light from an antique streetlamp i saw a card in the front window of a tiredlooking house the card was stained brown by age or damp or possibly both of course it was written in spanish but it was simple spanish and my command of the language was sufficient to understand it room to rent apply bar escorpion i found the bar right at the end of the street if i tell you it matched the houses around it then youll probably guess that the paint on the walls was faded and peeling and that the metal sign was rusty it certainly seemed highly unlikely that any tourists had ever passed through its doors before but i didnt care i walked in and i wasnt even put off when a quick glance around the dark interior of the bar revealed territory that was strictly male youd have loved it im sure because it was straight out of one of those cowboy films youve got such a passion for i dont know why they all seem the same to me or at least they all start the same way a stranger arrives in a sleepy town gets off his horse beats the dust from his clothes with his hat and walks into the bar as the doors close behind him everyone stops talking well i didnt have a horse and my clothes werent dusty but just like in those films all conversation stopped when i walked in but i just gave a general smile around the room at everybody then i went up to the bar and ordered a beer by the time id been served and had settled myself at an empty table in a corner the conversations had started up again i guessed that most people were probably talking about me but i simply chose not to be concerned about it i didnt care it wasnt important i suppose my desire for revenge had given me a real sense of purpose but looking back i think at that moment in time i actually felt quite relaxed after a while i intended to ask about the room but there was no hurry there was plenty of time to just sit and drink my beer who knew perhaps alec cartwright himself would come in for a neighbourly chat before supper but when the doors did open a few minutes later it was to admit a man who was the very opposite in looks to the greybearded fiftyyearold in the photograph diane had lent me before i left england the man filling the doorway had skin like milk chocolate and a smile that spread sunshine to all who received it and it was only a matter of seconds before i was on the receiving end of some of that warming sunshine luis for i soon discovered that was his name walked straight up to my table and sat himself down in the empty seat opposite me for a while he said absolutely nothing just looked at me studying every millimetre of my face then a glass of rum arrived as if by magic on the table in front of him he put his head on one side and picked the drink up i am a reader of faces he stated grandly do you want me to tell you what your face says to me well i said impressed by the standard of his english it appears to tell you my nationality anyway instantly he smiled and i noticed there was a gap between his front teeth no your guidebook told me that he said his eyes sparkling and i smiled back at him remembering that my rough guide to cuba was sticking out of the top of my shoulder bag which id hung from my chair you are english he went on still looking carefully at my face and you have only been in cuba for a few days because i havent got a suntan right i guessed and once again that gaptoothed smile shone out at me yes he agreed because your skin is still pale by now i was enjoying myself id almost forgotten about alec cartwright and the true reason i was here tell me something a little less obvious i encouraged him but immediately regretted it when his face grew more thoughtful youre looking for something or someone he said slowly and suddenly it wasnt a game any longer its very important that you find him he said a persons life depends on it the room seemed suddenly cold despite the humid air drifting in through the open windows and i shivered avoiding his eyes of course he noticed my tension am i right he asked casually and i remember how exposed i felt my new confidence had abandoned me but with a huge effort i managed to keep my feelings from my face or at least i think i did theres an element of truth in that statement i said but if id hoped to confuse luis by using long words then i was quickly disappointed his command of the english language was astonishingly good why dont you tell me all about it he suggested of course i wasnt about to betray my plans to a total stranger even one as attractive and friendly as luis not that i had a plan beyond finding alec cartwright and making him sweat you see even then i didnt know just what i was capable of i suspected i was capable of blackmail and of inflicting emotional pain perhaps even severe emotional pain but i had no suspicion of that potential for violence living just beneath my skin a potential that was swelling and increasing every second like undiscovered cancer cells im here to do a favour for a friend i said she wants me to find a missing reptile for the first time luiss mind didnt quite connect with the meaning of my words has your friend lost a snake in havana he asked and i laughed out loud luis looked slightly offended so i quickly apologised actually i said youre almost right shes lost her husband and i gather he is something of a snake i see luis said and what is his name this snake husband of your friend alec i told him alec cartwright and then suddenly it was luiss turn to laugh what i asked him curious whats so amusing alec cartwright is my neighbour he explained finally and thats when i came to the conclusion that fate must be on my side it wasnt coincidence that had brought me into this bar at the same time as alec cartwrights neighbour it was fate someone somewhere intended me to get my revenge it was almost as if i was an actress in a play speaking the lines of a writers plot the situation was out of my control and every bit as inevitable as night following day chapter three mr mouthwash i bought luis another drink tell me about alec cartwright i said luis looked at me and suddenly his expression was very cuban there was a sort of measuring look on his face and i could almost see his mind thinking whats in this for me how can i turn this situation to my advantage then he asked me casually what is it that you want to know everything there is to know i replied equally casual luis pulled an expressive face alec cartwright is fat and his clothes are too small he said his voice full of disgust his big white belly hangs over his trousers and his neck is purple and tired like the neck of a turkey the man is ugly ugly he almost spat the word at me across the table but worst of all he went on are his eyes alec cartwright has small suspicious eyes and he never looks into your face when he speaks to you he paused then i think to give his last words emphasis i would not trust a man like that if he and i were the only two men left alive on this planet i hadnt been impressed when diane had first shown me that photograph i have to admit but the picture luis was painting was even more unappealing it was certainly difficult to imagine that this was the same man who had made love to diane outdoors on their honeymoon in fact the very idea made me shiver id put the photograph diane had lent me inside my rough guide to cuba to keep it safe now i took it out and showed it to luis is this the same man i asked him he took the photograph from me and immediately nodded yes he said his face screwed up with disgust thats him he is older than that and uglier but its him he returned the photograph to me and i replaced it inside my book thoughtfully maybe alec cartwright had changed considerably with age maybe its just something thats inevitable something that happens to everybody even you maybe if you lived to the age of fifty your muscles wouldnt be firm any longer perhaps youd be fat too and bald but as it is none of that is going to happen youll die a handsome man im doing you a favour really anyway back in that havana bar luis was continuing with his story about alec cartwright it was around eleven oclock in the evening by then and the room was full of chat and cigar smoke but somehow although we were surrounded by people i was only really aware of luis it was almost the same as the effect you had on me when we first met at that party however despite all these things luis was saying i wasnt surprised when alec managed to get a cuban girlfriend the man wears dull clothes it is true he does not look like a rich man and he lives here in these streets instead of in an expensive tourist hotel but he travels around the city in taxis and he sits in bars drinking cocktails no i was not surprised about his girlfriend but i am surprised when you sit here and you tell me that he has a wife in england who is concerned about him luis shook his head in disbelief the man is an animal with the habits of an animal he said every day he rises at five in the morning every day at five in the morning he uses his bathroom and you understand the pipes in these houses are very old when somebody uses the water the pipes they knock and bang about like builders on a building site my work is mostly at night and for this reason i normally go to bed one hour before alec cartwright gets up and as soon as i go to sleep those pipes they wake me up again and after im awake i lie in bed and i have to listen to him in his bathroom every day he uses a mouthwash and every day i lie there and i have to listen to that mouthwash bubbling around in his throat how is it possible for someone to make so much noise with a mouthwash can you tell me that i tell you it is the sound of the devil luiss voice was very loud by now and i became aware that people were looking in our direction all other conversations in the bar had stopped and luis hadnt finished yet every day i wish for alec cartwright to move away to pack his tight dusty clothes into his suitcase with his mouthwash and disappear at that luis picked up his glass and drank the rest of his rum in one swallow his handsome face looking dangerous i wondered what work took him away regularly at night and i wondered too what he would do to anyone who really annoyed him when just the thought of alec cartwrights mouthwash could make him look so fierce then the next moment he was smiling at me and the tension was lifting from his face you know carla he said these old havana buildings they are full of insects we cubans learn to ignore them most of the time they are familiar to us you understand a part of our environment and our daytoday lives but some insects they are too unpleasant to ignore alec cartwright is such an insect the worst type of ugly stinging insect and if you say to me that you want to persuade him it is a good idea to return to england to the arms of your friend then i will do anything in my power to assist you in fact it would be my very great pleasure and thats how i ended up staying in luiss apartment as his guest and no i dont suppose i would have accepted his invitation if he hadnt been a young attractive man but he was attractive very attractive and charming interesting too we sat together on his sofa and talked about everything england cuba politics art i even told him about you i think he placed you in the same category as alec cartwright an insect ha ha and yes we kissed of course as i said luis was a very attractive and charming man but then before things could go any further there was a loud noise from next door alec cartwright luis announced crossly moving away from me slightly he has returned and now he makes preparations for bed is that really the pipes making all that noise i asked and luis nodded yes indeed that is the pipes but you are fortunate he does not use the mouthwash at night soon after that luis changed into black trousers and a black shirt and left for work telling me to make myself at home in his apartment alone i looked around properly for the first time there was nothing expensive in the apartment but it definitely had style unfortunately however nothing could disguise the smell of the damp coming from the walls and later when i climbed into his bed the sheets felt chilly not surprisingly i couldnt get to sleep straight away the pillows held the smell of luiss aftershave it was a nice smell sexy like luis but somehow it made me think about you about your smell the bare skin of your shoulder beneath my cheek as you held me in your arms after lovemaking the smooth soft place behind your ears the warm hollow of your throat gemma has a theory about smell she thinks its the basis of what makes you fall in love with somebody that if someone doesnt smell right for you then youll never fall in love with them shes probably right anyway lying in luiss bed surrounded by luiss smell i thought about you and i felt more sad and alone than i had for weeks but i refused to allow myself to cry since the split id cried enough tears for a lifetime enough tears to know that crying changes nothing you and your special smell were gone from me forever and i just had to accept that and deal with it which was precisely why i was here in havana to deal with it or rather to practise dealing with it because by the time id found ways to get revenge for diane and then gemma and cathy i would be an expert and then i would be ready to take my revenge on you after that alarming noise from the pipes there were no more sounds from alec cartwrights apartment and i finally drifted off to sleep i didnt even wake up properly when luis came back from work but when the pipes started up again i found myself lying in luiss arms with his face pressed into my hair and his chest against my back and when luis swore in spanish i could feel the movement of his lips i shivered and luis pulled me closer to him wrapping his arms around me from behind it felt comforting somehow and despite the sound of the pipes i found myself slipping into a light sleep but i woke up again immediately when alec cartwright started to use his mouthwash and it wasnt only because luis gave a groan of despair it really was a ridiculously loud noise for an activity taking place on the other side of the wall a detailed sort of noise somehow certainly it was possible to imagine the liquid of the mouthwash moving around every one of alec cartwrights yellow teeth i didnt know then that his teeth were yellow of course but it seemed inevitable considering the lack of care he appeared to take with the rest of his body luis sat upright in bed swearing loudly in spanish then he threw a book at the wall it landed face down on the floor and i noticed it was my rough guide to cuba alec cartwrights photograph came to rest on the carpet next to luiss black leather shoes and the face in the photograph seemed to stare back at us stubbornly ill use my mouthwash when i want to and for as long as i want to it seemed to say are the walls in these buildings thin i asked luis when at last the sounds from next door had stopped and he ran an annoyed hand through his black hair swinging his long legs out of the bed no he said they are not thin but all the buildings in havana are full of cracks and holes perhaps the sound travels through these holes or through the pipes i dont know it is just another mystery of this city i will make us some coffee he put on a black dressing gown and went into the kitchen and soon the delicious smell of strong coffee reached my nostrils according to my watch it was only five thirty in the morning but i doubted whether i would get back to sleep again there was too much to think about luis for example what had he been doing for half the night here he said handing me a steaming mug of coffee and as he leant across the bed to give it to me his dressing gown fell open revealing a long scar down the length of his chest he saw me looking at it i used to be a bad boy he told me arent you a bad boy anymore i asked he drank some of his coffee no not anymore he said and smiled well not often anyway bad boy or not i knew i had nothing to fear from luis in fact i felt very safe as i sat in bed drinking coffee with him safe and protected so what has your friend told you about her husband luis asked hes a doctor i told him hes a doctor and hes here to do a piece of research into why your medical services are so good when your country is so i broke off realising just in time that what id been about to say was hardly tactful but luis supplied the missing word from my sentence anyway poor he said its ok you can say it i will not be offended cuba is poor i was embarrassed yes well apparently he was only supposed to be here for six months but his contract was extended perhaps the doctor is taking his time with his research luis suggested you mean on purpose he nodded of course gina is a very beautiful girl he gestured with his hands to draw the outline of a woman in the air gina thats his girlfriend yes she is twentythree years old a nurse at the hospital she had a cuban boyfriend until mr mouthwash arrived mr mouthwash thats funny i started to laugh and when luis laughed too i found myself thinking what a nice laugh he had deep and dark extremely sexy yours was always a bit boyish for my taste really a silly schoolboy laugh though i loved it of course because it was yours a part of you but it didnt make my knees go weak you only had to look into my eyes to make me melt but i cant remember your laugh ever making me tremble with desire luiss laugh came from deep inside his chest and somehow i found myself reaching out to stroke that chest as it moved my fingers drawing a line down the length of his scar and across his muscles and suddenly he wasnt laughing any more and when i looked up into his face he was looking down at me seriously then he bent to kiss me and desire swept through my body like a tide and i doubt whether either of us would have heard if alec cartwright had decided to use his mouthwash again chapter four playing detective by nine oclock that morning i was sitting on a bench outside a park close to the medical building where alec cartwright was based it was still slightly too early for the tourists to have found their way out of their hotels so no cubans had asked me whether i wanted a taxi a guide a ticket for la tropicana or a date for that night i had a date anyway the key to luiss apartment was secure in the back pocket of my shorts and he had promised me dinner that evening and before that we were meeting for coffee at eleven oclock this morning luis had gone back to sleep after wed made these arrangements and thats where id left him lying peacefully in bed unaware of the shouts of the children on their way to school beneath his apartment window by the way theres an enthusiasm about children in cuba they dont drag their feet and quarrel with each other all the way to school the way your daughters do and they certainly dont get a lift to school and back anyway back to luis id spent enough time with him by then to realise that he was a complex man one moment relaxed and smiling the next tense and angry he was unpredictable and possibly even slightly dangerous when there was a need for him to be i doubted whether anyone really knew him he was the type to always keep a part of himself hidden perhaps even from himself time spent in his company certainly wouldnt be boring and i was confident we could stay on good terms for as long as my business with alec cartwright took i yawned and stretched keeping my eyes fixed on the plain grey medical building on the other side of the road the musical song of a tocororo bird reached my ears from the small park behind my seat brightly coloured cadillacs smoked past every now and then on the road in front of me a bicycle taxi a red white and blue flash of colour as the tocororo flew away a group of young cuban women passed by dressed in tight tshirts and short skirts and carrying shopping bags i smiled at them and they smiled back before walking on chatting to each other in voices every bit as musical as the song of the tocoroco bird i stretched and yawned the smile still on my face my body felt tired after the previous nights activities but it was a pleasant sort of tiredness and even though id hardly had any sleep my mind was alert which was just as well because at that moment a taxi pulled up outside the medical building and a man got out grey hair small beard tight white shirt stretched over a huge belly it could only be alec cartwright then i realised that he wasnt alone someone else was getting out of the taxi a young cuban woman in a nurses uniform she could only be gina luis had been right she was beautiful and young the taxi drove away and the couple stood and kissed each other right there on the pavement it wasnt a quick kiss either no this kiss was deep and passionate the kiss of lovers who regret the time apart that work makes necessary finally they broke apart they spoke a few words to each other before alec gave the girl a final squeeze and went into the grey building gina waited until he had completely disappeared from sight then walked quickly off up the street i guessed alec cartwright would be working inside until at least lunchtime so i got off my bench deciding to follow gina i wanted to find out more about the girl he had abandoned diane for she had a good figure at least what i could see of it from behind her legs were long and her waist was tiny and she walked with a sort of confident rhythm swinging her hips i could imagine her being an excellent dancer and i wondered if alec cartwright ever took her dancing it seemed unlikely up ahead i saw a sign for the hospital thats why shes hurrying i thought shes late for work but then to my surprise she turned down a narrow side street to the right away from the hospital i followed her keeping my distance and found myself in a dark street of tall old apartment buildings it took a while for my eyes to adjust but i thought i saw the girl look at her watch and then her pace increased again she was obviously late for something but if it wasnt work then what was it i soon found out just as i was starting to think i might lose her she stopped suddenly to knock on a door instantly i slowed down taking my guidebook out of my bag to make myself look like a tourist but i neednt have bothered gina was knocking on the door again and looking up towards a rusty metal balcony on the third floor far from noticing me she wasnt even aware that i existed carlos i heard her shout and by then i was near enough to get a good look at her face framed as it was by her curly black hair it was lovely young and fresh with a beautiful bone structure and dark eyes the only thing that spoiled it slightly was her anxious expression but this disappeared as soon as the window behind the balcony opened and a dark male head looked out carlos gina smiled immediately and the man smiled back gina mi amor he called sweetly and threw down a key to her gina waved up at him giving a laugh which made her sound like one of the excited school children id heard earlier that day then she picked the key up from the dusty road and used it to let herself into the apartment building and the arms of her waiting lover for it was perfectly obvious to me that carlos was her lover and not a friend or a brother well i thought alecs got a rival well well well there were no convenient cafes in the dark street and i didnt particularly fancy waiting in one of the doorways until gina had finished with carlos i would only draw attention to myself if i did anyway it was almost ten oclock and i was meeting luis at eleven so i walked slowly back the way id come the picture of ginas lovely face turned up towards the window fixed in my mind dianes an attractive woman too believe me she takes very good care of her appearance visiting the beauty salon every week and she always wears expensive stylish clothes youd definitely approve of her taste in clothes youd like her sense of humour too and her intelligence but if you had to choose between a fiftytwoyearold woman or a beautiful twentysixyearold youd do exactly what alec had done and choose the twentysix yearold wouldnt you of course you would i know you would my replacement was ten years younger than me after all as i walked back the way i had come i thought how unfair it was i knew that diane had supported loved and encouraged alec for all of their married lives and she had given birth to their daughters the only crime she had committed was to obtain a few age lines on her wellcaredfor face lines that reminded alec cartwright that he wasnt young man any longer each time he looked at them i wondered whether alecs conscience ever bothered him whether he ever thought of diane as he was making love to gina if there was a corner of his mind that regretted how much he had hurt her is there a corner of your mind that regrets how much you hurt me how much you used me probably not i think youre probably just like alec cartwright i think youve conveniently forgotten just how good i was to you a bus went past in a cloud of polluting black smoke and i looked at my watch it was still a little too early to meet luis but i decided to head for the cafe we were to meet in anyway in case it took me a while to find it so i got out my map and set off on foot doing my best to absorb myself in the grand but faded architecture of the buildings i was passing my bitterness and anger was going to come in useful later on when i was serving up revenge but i didnt want it to spoil my entire visit to cuba in the end i found the cafe quite easily so i ordered a coffee and settled down with my guidebook the book fell open at an article about santeria one of the religions practised in cuba its related to african religions and it involves things like sacrificing chickens to keep the gods happy people who follow the religion dress all in white and id seen a few of them around havana as i read the article it reminded me of black magic and in particular the practice of making an image of your enemy for the purposes of revenge a doll or effigy very interesting sitting at a table by the window with the havana sunshine shining in on me i smiled to myself as i imagine making an effigy of alec cartwright and sticking needles into it or better still making an image of you and sticking needles into it it was exactly what you deserved and i imagined you jumping about with sudden mysterious pains as i put the needles into the effigy i was so absorbed in my reading and my pleasant fantasies i would probably have missed luis if hed walked up to the cafe however luis didnt walk he drove up to the cafe and not in some rusty old russian car bearing the scars of numerous crashes either no of course not luis drove up in the most beautiful red cadillac id seen since arriving in havana it had an open top and perfect paintwork and luis drove it with just one hand on the steering wheel in the other hand he held a cigar which he waved at me to say hello everyone looked at him the tourists of course half a dozen of them surrounded his car to have their photographs taken almost as soon as hed parked but the ordinary cubans looked too at him and his car luis had such style and he looked extremely good as he pushed open the doors of the cafe and walked towards me a big smile on his face i cant deny i felt a sense of pride that this was the man whod held me in his arms in his bed that morning the man who hopefully would be doing the same thing again later on querida he said in his deep voice bending to kiss me on both cheeks tell me about your morning what have you discovered so far about our mr mouthwash enough to make him very miserable indeed i said smiling up into his handsome face enough to blackmail girlfriend and to destroy his dreams of happyeverafter forever quite a victory for one morning dont you think chapter five cadillac cruising luis ordered coffee for himself and a refill for me and then he sat and listened to my account of that mornings activities he didnt seem as impressed as id expected him to be in fact by the time id finished he wasnt looking very happy at all what is it luis i asked him puzzled whats wrong luis stirred several spoonfuls of sugar into his coffee then sighed looking at me thoughtfully i know that it is hard for you to imagine what it is like for cubans he said cuba is our country and we are proud to be cuban but at the same time we have no real hope for ourselves no ambition what is there to have ambition for we are poor and we will be poor always it is inevitable a fact of our lives the way the sun coming up in the morning is a fact of our lives tourists they come here to experience our country but they leave without ever knowing what it is to be cuban you dont want me to blackmail gina do you i guessed and luis shook his head no querida he said you are right i do not he sighed and took my hand in both of his then he looked deep into my eyes willing me to understand you see it is probably true that gina is how do you say it exploiting yes that is it gina is exploiting alec cartwright perhaps that is cruel but i dont think so because he is exploiting her too is he not she is a victim too no the real cruelty in this case is to her man to carlos and to gina herself of course because it is not right that she feels she has to be the pet of alec cartwright when all that she truly wants is to live with carlos and to have many babies with him by now passion and strength of feeling had increased the volume of luiss voice and he was waving his hands in the air to emphasise his point do you think that gina is happy lying in that old mans arms he asked do you think she smiles with affection as she lies in his bed and listens to him using his mouthwash no she does not but i tell you her mother will be happy about it he nodded when i looked doubtful it is true querida yes i can assure you of this ginas mother will be delighted that her daughter has the chance to have money and a good life the chance to escape luis shook his head at the injustice of it then looked at me appealingly no carla he urged me do not blackmail gina save her instead remove the man who stands in the way of her happiness with carlos remove alec cartwright from her life remove alec cartwright from her life was that the moment i wonder the moment when my thoughts of revenge turned into thoughts of murder i dont know i wasnt aware of it at the time but looking back i realise now that there was a finality about the way luis spoke that word remove all right i told him i wont blackmail gina i didnt really want to anyway she looks like a nice person she is a nice person luis declared with authority and i looked at him surprised do you know her personally then i asked and he smiled of course he said i know many many people in havana and later today i will take you to meet gina we will have a little conversation with her about alec cartwright but before that finish your coffee we will go for a drive he paused looking at me that is he asked if you wish it i glanced out of the window at the beautiful red car and then i turned back to grin at him yes please i said and luis laughed come on then he said standing up lets go the cadillac was superb so were the views and so was luiss company i hadnt had so much fun for ages i honestly dont think i thought about you once for two whole hours luis and i laughed together the whole time and we waved and called out to people when they stopped to admire the car and whenever we had to stop at traffic lights we kissed it was impossible to believe that i had known luis for less than twentyfour hours but then something happened to remind me that i didnt really know him at all he stopped the car by the malecon sea wall and got out glancing at me only briefly wait here for me please querida he said i have a little business to attend to so i sat obediently in the cadillac and watched luis as he approached a group of men sitting on the wall i wasnt close enough to see their expressions but i was close enough to get the impression that they respected luis no perhaps it was even more than that perhaps it was more that he dominated them they smiled at him and he shook hands with all of them but somehow he seemed to be more powerful than any of them almost as if he was their boss or something then as i watched i saw two of the men give him something though i couldnt see what it was if i had to guess id say that it was money changing hands why i didnt know and perhaps i didnt want to know perhaps i suspected that luiss business with the men was something illegal but anyway when luis returned even though his smile was the same as ever things seemed different between us somehow he was the same luis and yet he was changed for me perhaps because i now suspected he was some kind of criminal he seemed to guess something of what i was thinking but he didnt offer me any explanations instead he just smiled that charming smile of his and patted my knee come he said let us find gina and have our conversation with her i nodded yes i said lets it was time to remember my reason for being in havana time to get down to business luis drove back into habana vieja and i soon recognised the dark street where gina had gone to meet carlos we didnt need to knock on the door however because as soon as the cadillac pulled up outside the house both carlos and gina looked down into the street from the rusty balcony luis carlos called down and i smiled at luis for probably the first time since leaving the malecon sea wall is there anyone you dont know in havana i asked him and he grinned at me there are still one or two people who are strangers to me he said and then he directed his attention to the rusty balcony speaking quickly in spanish there was no hope of me understanding but it wasnt important what was important was that five minutes later gina was at ground level kissing carlos goodbye then she climbed into the back of the car and we drove away i have to start work at the hospital in one hour she said in spanish and i looked at her reflection curiously in the mirror trying to decide whether she was anxious or not but her pretty features were expressionless and i decide that either she had no idea as yet who i was and what this was about or that she was simply resigned to her fate luis stopped the car a few blocks away and looked at me ok he said you have half an hour to convince her that she is making a mistake you can speak in english she will understand if you keep it simple i will stand over there in case you need me to translate and with that he got out of the car and leant against a wall to smoke a cigar i got out of the car myself and climbed into the back with gina she moved over a little to give me space staring down at her hands to avoid looking at me gina i asked do you know who i am she looked up and spoke clearly yes i know she said meeting my eyes you are the friend of alecs exwife i shook my head no i said slowly im not im the friend of his wife alec isnt divorced gina hes still married chapter six delivery girl i could tell it was a shock for gina to discover that alec was still married and maybe it was cruel of me but im afraid i didnt give her the chance to recover before i continued alec is married to a woman who really loves him i told her they have three children three daughters and alecs very close to them very close he would never do anything to hurt them he loves his wife too i know he does he isnt going to leave her gina wasnt looking at me she was pulling at the material of her uniform with the fingers of one hand her beautiful face looking miserable i sighed look i know alecs probably made you lots of promises gina i went on but according to diane youre not the first girl hes lied to like this he does it all the time i think he just loves the excitement of being with someone new especially someone young and pretty like you but it never lasts he always ends up going back to diane because deep down he really loves and needs her in any case i told her even if you do eventually manage to marry alec hell soon get tired of you thats what englishmen are like they only stay with a woman for a few years and then they look for somebody else and when that happens youll be trapped on your own in a cold wet country with no friends or family and no money to come back home to cuba youll die a lonely old lad dreaming about carlos as you shiver by the fire there were tears in ginas eyes but i couldnt really feel guilty because there was more than an element of truth in what i had told her besides i did my best to make it up to her as she sat there weeping at the very unattractive prospect id described i reached into my pocket for the money id withdrawn from the bank earlier that day five hundred dollars a lot of money for a girl like gina here i said holding it out to her take this its for you and carlos i know my friend would want you to have it forget all about alec cartwright and marry carlos you deserve a better life than the life alecs offering you gina you deserve to be happy i meant it she did deserve to be happy slowly she nodded and wiped her face with the back of her hands then she reached out and took the money putting it away carefully in the front pocket of her dress ok she promised at last i will never see alec again it is finished i tell you i could hardly believe how easy it had been to convince her i was relieved though and very very pleased and when luis stepped forward to suggest that gina write a quick note to alec telling him it was over i agreed enthusiastically imagining how fantastic it would feel to give the letter to him when i watched alec reading ginas words and saw the heartbreak in his face i would have done my duty towards diane my revenge as far as alec cartwright was concerned would be complete or at least thats what i thought then we drove gina to the hospital and as i watched her going in through the main entrance i wondered just for a moment what she was thinking and feeling now she knew she was likely to stay in cuba for the rest of her life i was only human after all and i did have some sympathy for her situation you have done her a favour querida luis assured me turning the cadillac around and setting off in the direction of his apartment and now you must do me a favour too i looked at him quickly and something in my expression made him laugh do not worry querida he said i only ask that you present the letter to alec cartwright as soon as possible so that he hurries back to england with his mouthwash at the earliest opportunity i expect the relief showed in my face because luis laughed again did you think i was going to ask you to murder someone for me my carla he joked his eyes sparkling and when i laughed too the rest of the tension between us disappeared i think youre a man whos full of surprises i told him and this belief proved true almost as soon as we got back to the apartment when luis took me to see his garden at the back of the apartment building luis its beautiful i said admiring the flower borders and the pots the garden was small but very attractive with an area for tools and garden equipment and two comfortable garden seats as well as all the flowers did you do it all yourself but of course luis said gardening is very relaxing for me yes out here i have only the weeds to fight and i have a good friend to help me to do that he smiled pointing in the direction of a small innocentlooking bottle standing among the gardening equipment my weedkiller it is very strong those weeds they have not got a chance i bent to smell some particularly beautiful red flowers but i said apart from battles with the weeds its peaceful out here yes he agreed mostly unless a certain person chooses to use his bathroom while i am tending my flowers he nodded in the direction of the low wall that separated his garden from its neighbour then looked at me and smiled however let us not think of such unpleasant subjects please sit in my garden and enjoy the flowers while i cook some dinner for us i thanked him taking him up on his invitation and it wasnt long before the smell of cooking combined with the scents and bright colours of his flowers infected my senses until i felt almost drunk on it all cuba i decided happily was a very surprising rich and exciting mixture as unique and precious as a rare perfume all around me in other gardens and on balconies families were catching up on the events of their day and i listened to their musical spanish voices closing my eyes to drink in every last drop of atmosphere until suddenly completely without warning that atmosphere was brutally destroyed somebody somebody very close by indeed began to cough in a particularly unpleasant way a really heavy thick cough the cough of a smoker who thinks himself alone i knew the cough belonged to alec cartwright it had to apart from the fact that it was very close by it was the kind of unselfconscious cough a loud mouthwash user would possess my body instantly grew stiff with tension and i was no longer aware of the family conversations around me or luiss singing i was suddenly too hot my clothes wet through with sweat and i think i knew vaguely that i was afraid very afraid though i didnt analyse why at the time looking back now i suppose it was because i was about to meet the man id been thinking about ever since id arrived in cuba my first target for revenge suddenly the cough stopped and i held my breath listening i wasnt sure whether alec cartwright was still in his bathroom or not but then i was presented with clear evidence that he was first i heard the sound of a toilet and then a second or so afterwards a window opened and finally that awful coughing started up again even louder now with the window open combining with my nervous stomach to make me feel sick i tell you i hardly dared to breathe sitting there in luiss garden knowing that the man id travelled thousands of miles to find was actually standing in his bathroom only a few metres away from me and the strangest thing of all was that he didnt even know i was there not only that but he was totally unaware of my existence and the role i was about to play in his life i felt powerful actually i think even though my legs were trembling alec cartwrights fate was in my hands and i took ginas letter from my handbag and looked at it imagining the effect it was going to have on him already in my mind i could hear the sound of that cough being replaced by the sound of alec cartwrights grief carla what is it querida what is wrong you are so very pale luis had come outside without me noticing and i saw vaguely that he was holding two glasses of rum i walked shakily over to him so that i could whisper into his ear your neighbours returned i said against his skin im going to pay him a visit luiss eyes burned down into mine be patient querida he urged me very soon he will come out into his garden and then we can both witness his reaction i hesitated for just a second before nodding my agreement to this plan there was a selfish part of me that wanted to keep the destruction of alec cartwrights happiness to myself but luis had helped me to get this far so i wasnt in a position to refuse him this request so i waited and just as luis had predicted a few minutes later my patience was rewarded by the sound of a door opening and footsteps bringing that cough outside and then finally i got my first closeup view of alec cartwright mr mouthwash he looked smaller somehow on his own without the beautiful gina in his arms and the important medical building behind him he just seemed like an ordinary overweight middleaged man with an unattractive beard and a cough harmless really and for a second or two i think i hesitated perhaps doubting whether i should give him ginas letter at all but fortunately luis touched me with his elbow bringing me back to my senses excuse me i said nervously over the wall moving towards him and alec cartwright immediately looked round surprised to hear an english voice yes he said and something about his voice removed those last stupid doubts from my mind yes is a very small word its true but even so alec cartwright managed to say it in a way which reminded me that he was an unpleasant man a very unpleasant man a man who had treated my good friend diane like dirt i have something for you i said handing the letter to him over the wall he took it without a word certainly without thanking me his face remaining expressionless as he tore the envelope open and thats exactly the way his face remained as he read the letter expressionless it also describes the sound of his voice when he spoke to luis after hed finished the letter expressionless women he said calmly in a mantoman kind of voice they always make the mistake of thinking they cant be replaced when in actual fact the very reverse is the case he looked down at the letter again speaking to it as if it were gina my dear he said your departure is an inconvenience i assure you and not the tragedy you so fondly seem to imagine it is and then he laughed and if i hadnt hated him before believe me i hated him at that moment with the darkest blackest hatred it is possible to feel yes he said smiling at luis over the wall women eh and then he folded the letter up put it into his top pocket and disappeared back inside i think you should sit down carla it was only when luis spoke to me that i realised i was feeling dizzy that i was shaking from head to foot with a combination of anger hatred and disappointment in fact my feelings were so extreme i was in severe danger of fainting it was the blanket in the dappled shade all over again you see it was almost as if you were looking at me and saying those words again im sorry carla im so sorry theres no easy way to say this so ill just come right out and say it i ive met somebody else my failure to make alec cartwright suffer was like being rejected all over again i felt a glass being pressed against my lips and when i opened my mouth obediently the strong taste of rum filled my mouth i swallowed automatically and the strong liquid travelled down my throat and into my stomach returning a little colour to my face luiss arms were around me and his kindness made me want to cry but i refused to give in to tears i wanted to hold on to my anger instead perhaps somewhere deep inside i knew i would need it to give me strength for what i had to do next luis and i talked for a while or rather luis talked to me ive no idea what about i expect he tried to tell me that wed be able to find another way to deal with alec i dont know anyway i eventually managed to convince him id be ok on my own so he went back indoors to finish cooking our meal only coming out again briefly to let me know that hed seen alec go out he was wearing a suit he told me so perhaps he has gone to find himself a new girlfriend i nodded but actually i wasnt interested in why alec had gone out i was only interested in the fact that he had and that this meant that his apartment was now empty and i hadnt heard him lock his back door chapter seven my first murder i tell you i climbed over that wall and opened that door in less time than it takes to blink and as easily as if id committed burglaries each day of my life since the age of six except that burglary was the very last thing on my mind at that moment once inside the apartment i paused all my senses alert checking that i was indeed alone it was quite dark in the room after the bright sunshine outside dark and untidy i could see halfhidden shapes of furniture and junk shapes that seemed strange and frightening in the darkness but i could also hear the faint but familiar sounds of luis in his kitchen coming through the wall from next door his deep singing voice and the sharp sound of a spoon making contact with the side of a saucepan it reminded me that at any moment luis might come out to check up on me and that there was no time to waste so i crept quickly through the room and out into the hallway turning left to where i knew the bathroom must be once in the bathroom with the light on it didnt take me long to spot alec cartwrights bottle of mouthwash there it was standing in pride of place in the centre of the shelf above his sink i dont think anyone can ever be truly aware of how theyll behave in such circumstances of what theyre really capable of when theyve been driven so very far quite beyond the point of compromise am i trying to justify what i did next perhaps i dont know i only know that i was on the slippery slope heading towards becoming a murderer and for whatever reason i just didnt choose to stop myself from falling its as simple as that as i reached out and took that bottle of mouthwash down from the shelf and unscrewed the top there were tears running down my face but i wasnt crying because i was imagining alec cartwright dying a painful death in a few hours time no not at all as i took the top off the bottle of weedkiller id borrowed from luiss garden and began to pour it into the bottle of mouthwash i was imagining your face not alec cartwrights i was seeing you in the garden in the dappled shade i was hearing your voice as you spoke the words that broke my heart into little pieces ive met somebody else ive met somebody else as i said at the beginning youre the murderer not me standing there at the sink in alec cartwrights bathroom i took a few deep breaths to drive away the emotion emotion was a luxury i couldnt afford at that moment i needed my brain to be perfectly clear if i wasnt going to give the game away or leave any evidence so i took those deep breaths and then i carefully shook the bottle of mouthwash to mix the two liquids together once id finished i held the bottle up to the light to check whether it looked ok fortunately the weedkiller was colourless and the mouthwash was blue so there were absolutely no signs of what id done wiping the bottle carefully with one of alec cartwrights towels i replaced it on the shelf then i left the bathroom and went back the way id come stopping only to wipe anything i remembered touching my eyes were used to the darkness now and when i was nearly at the outside door i paused catching sight of a letter on the coffee table ginas letter i picked it up and put it into my pocket with the weedkiller then i let myself out of the flat once outside i climbed back over the wall and sat down in my chair in luiss garden the whole trip next door had probably taken me two minutes at the very most but i was exhausted and i had to just sit in that chair for several minutes breathing as deeply as i could until my heart stopped beating so quickly why did i pick up the letter i can explain it now looking back i didnt want gina to be connected to murder because i liked her at the time i didnt think much at all i just acted it was as if a different part of my mind had taken over a cold logical part of my mind that dealt with hiding evidence and coping with murder dinner is served senorita luis said brightly a few minutes later he came out to fetch me with absolutely no idea of what id just done im sure it was a very very long time since luis could accurately have been described as innocent but he was definitely innocent at that moment poor man he wanted to impress me with his talents as a chef i suppose and thats what he was thinking about it didnt occur to him to think that id just popped round to poison his neighbours mouthwash while he was preparing dinner i managed to do justice to his cooking somehow though i shall never know how because i had no appetite whatever pictures formed in my mind very clear pictures of alec cartwright using his poisoned mouthwash trying to spit it out holding his throat and struggling to breathe collapsing onto the bathroom floor moving around on the floor like a fish taken out of the water and finally lying there dead his eyes wide open and staring and all the time these pictures were in my mind luis and i ate our meal drank wine and listened to music we even laughed and joked although ive no idea what about now i didnt feel as if i was inside my body at all it was almost as if i was floating in the air somewhere above the table looking down at me and luis talking and laughing below nothing seemed real at that table the only reality was the bottle of mouthwash on the bathroom shelf next door waiting for alec cartwright and his nighttime habits do you have to work tonight i asked luis after the meal was finally over id love to go out dancing somewhere will you take me dancing luis please i looked at him appealingly as i spoke moving my chair so that i could put my arms around his neck i dont have to work until much later he said we can go dancing before that yes i would like to take you dancing i will teach you to salsa actually i told him i can already salsa but luis didnt look convinced nobody can say they can dance the salsa until they have danced it in cuba he said i didnt bother to argue partly because suspected he was right but mostly because i was anxious to go out before alec cartwright got back i really had fun with luis that night yes even though i knew that while we were dancing alec was probably dying on his bathroom floor luis was such a dynamic man and he was also a superb dancer expertly sweeping me along and spinning me around the dance floor wed stopped off at my hotel room so that i could get changed and id chosen a dress with a full skirt it flowed out around us as we danced and i think we looked good together we seemed to attract quite a lot of attention anyway i smiled and i laughed and i pressed my face close to luiss face whenever i could and i didnt think about the bottle of weedkiller id placed in the hotel dustbin or ginas letter which i had torn into tiny pieces and got rid of down the toilet in the bar downstairs when luis dropped me off at my hotel before he went off to his work it was almost one oclock in the morning and i was pretty sure that alec cartwright was already dead you are sure that you do not want to wait for me at my apartment luis asked me holding me close to him outside the hotel entrance i reached up to kiss him no i said come to me here room ask reception to phone through to me and ill unlock the door for you but you will be asleep he said concerned and i smiled youre worth waking up for i told him and he laughed ok see you later he said giving me a final kiss before he left i watched him go then i went into the hotel to tell the receptionist to expect him i wanted her to be able to confirm that shed seen him if anyone asked her about it afterwards i didnt want anyone to be able to accuse luis of being in the flat next door when alec cartwright used his mouthwash what i didnt anticipate was that luis would hear about the result of my plans so quickly that he would come so silently into my hotel room when i opened the door to him sit on the edge of my bed and wait for me to join him luis i hadnt put the light on when i answered the door and i spoke his name uncertainly in the darkness when i heard him sigh there didnt seem to be much point asking him what was wrong or in trying to deny it are you angry with me i asked him instead my throat dry with tension angry he repeated slowly i am not sure about that in a strange way i suppose i admire you although the drama of what you have done is a little inconvenient shall we say a man like alec cartwright is easily lost in havana if somebody wishes it you understand however i appreciate that such a death is not as satisfying as the agony of a death from poison have you been back to your apartment i asked him urgently no he said i have not a friend came to find me he warned me that an ambulance had taken my neighbour away to hospital and that the police were asking questions he isnt dead i asked covering my mouth with my hands in horror even the weeds do not die within minutes querida luis said and his voice had grown very quiet suddenly as quiet and as soft as silk dangerous but i licked my lips nervously he will die wont he luis nodded oh yes he said still in that dangerously quiet voice he will die it will take several days but yes he will die there is no cure for the effects of that poison there was something about the sound of his voice that made me suddenly wonder whether id made a mistake when id decided to trust him what if he blackmailed me or made me confess what after all did i really know about him he was involved in something illegal i was sure of that unless his illegal activities were just a cover for the fact that he actually worked for the cuban government my thoughts were beginning to spin out of control when luis moved towards me on the bed where is the bottle of weedkiller querida he asked and suddenly i imagined myself locked away in a cuban prison for the rest of my life or worse than that dead oh its safe i said honestly it is that is i mean i got rid of it luis nodded then reached across me to switch the bedside lamp on why dont you tell me all about it he suggested tell me everything so i started to talk my voice trembling and all the time luis stared deeply into my eyes sometimes he nodded and sometimes he interrupted me to ask a question and after id finished there was silence for a moment i honestly couldnt predict what he was going to do next so i can tell you i was very surprised indeed when what he did do was reach out and take me into his arms and even more surprised when he kissed me i responded to that kiss of course even though my mind was still going round and round like a washing machine on the spin programme but i was still afraid it was a relief when luis pulled away slightly do not worry my carla he said and something in his face gave me a little bit of hope everything will be all right i will see to it it was exactly what i wanted to hear and as if by magic my fear suddenly vanished i laughed out loud with pure relief and luis laughed too his laugh sounding deep and loud and comforting in the plain hotel room we started to kiss again after that and well we made love too of course and yes it was good very very good how could it be otherwise luis was a sophisticated experienced man besides our hearts and our minds were connected by a shared knowledge of murder remember how we always used to fall asleep in each others arms after wed made love well thats exactly what luis and i did that night and somehow i felt safer than id felt for a very long time i trusted luis you see we had something in common he and i wed both been forced into being bad by our circumstances and i knew luis would do everything in his power to protect me so it was very disappointing to wake up the next morning and find myself alone there was a note from luis on the pillow next to me i suggest you leave cuba as soon as possible querida he had written change your flight and go today if you can i will not mention you to the police but anyway do not worry what connection could you have to what has happened goodbye i shall always remember you luis but i couldnt take luiss advice straight away because all the flights to heathrow were booked up it was almost three days before i managed to make my escape i spent that time hidden in my hotel room expecting the police to knock on my door at any moment but nobody came well apart from room service that is bringing food i didnt really want to eat not the police not luis nobody i watched television constantly but there was no mention of the unexplained death of a foreigner then finally on wednesday morning i settled my bill and left the hotel in a taxi i boarded a plane for london heathrow and my adventures in cuba were over however my adventures in norfolk england were just about to begin chapter eight a widows grief id been away from england for less than a week but even so autumn seemed to have arrived while id been in cuba the people in the train from london were all wearing jeans and jumpers while i shivered in my shorts and tshirt rain was falling against the train window and the passing fields looked grey and empty it was still just too early for the leaves to start changing colour but the trees had a definite defeated look about them as if they knew winter was already on its way all in all it was a very depressing welcome home as im sure you can imagine my brain struggled to cope with the contrast between that view out of the train window and memories of events in cuba and you know for once i actually didnt think about you but about luis poor luis left behind in the exciting but hopeless environment that was cuba forever and yet somehow it was impossible to imagine luis anywhere else but cuba certainly not here in england what job could he do in england that would earn him enough money to support the kind of lifestyle he would surely want here a job that allowed him to use all his charm and his intelligence but which only required him to work a few hours each day no cuba was the right place for luis to be and whether i liked it or not england was the right place for me to be it just didnt feel like that on that depressing train journey back to norwich with the memories of cuban sunshine fresh in my mind i had cheered up a bit by the time i got home though for one thing the sun had come out and my little house always looks at its best when its full of sunlight there was a nice pile of letters waiting for me on the doormat too and you know how i love to get post and the red light on my answerphone was flashing call me childish if you like but it felt good to know people had been thinking about me while id been away anyway i kicked off my shoes pressed the play button on the answerphone and sank into the comfort of my sofa to read my letters i was halfway through a postcard from my brother who was on holiday somewhere in wales when dianes voice sounding shaken and panicked filled the room carla ive got to talk to you hes dead alecs dead i had a phone call early this morning and i cant believe it i simply cant believe it the girls are just well their hearts are broken of course and i well i dont know what to think carla look please please phone me just as soon as you get back ive got to know whether you saw him or not whether he said anything to you or youd hate my answerphone its the sort that gives people a time limit to leave their message so it would be useless for most of your friends anyway on this occasion it was useless for diane because her time ran out and the machine made an ugly sound before it cut her off i was still looking at the photograph of the welsh mountains on the front of the postcard or rather my eyes were turned in that direction but i couldnt focus on it properly dianes voice still filled my head and i felt confused and anxious shed sounded absolutely desperate desperate and lost and desperate and lost were the exact opposite of how id been expecting her to feel about the death of the dreadful alec cartwright id been prepared for surprise of course but as shed always spoken about him with such dislike and bitterness and i knew how badly hed treated her i suppose id expected her reaction to be one of relief as i sat there thinking about it the phone rang again when i answered it was diane herself good she said briefly youre back im coming round diane i i started to say but it was too late shed already hung up and fifteen minutes later she was on my doorstep hammering on the door the minute i answered it she burst inside and i have to say she looked a mess as i told you before diane usually looks fantastic but that day her hair wasnt even brushed and she wasnt wearing any makeup and worst of all when she took her sunglasses off i could see that her eyes were red and swollen from crying well she asked did you see him do you know anything and right there and then i decided to lie well can you blame me she was obviously really upset and i well i just lost my courage i shook my head and put a sympathetic arm around her shoulders no di i lied softly i did find out where he lived but he wasnt in when i called round and then when i tried again it was already too late one of the neighbours said he well they told me hed died oh di im so very sorry she totally believed me thats the sad thing or anyway judging by the way she broke down and cried as if her heart was broken id say she believed me it was a very long time before she could speak and then it went something like this who would do such a dreadful thing to him he wasnt perfect but he didnt deserve to die like that nobody deserves to die like that now therell never be a chance for us to get back together again thank goodness i have you and my other friends i dont know how id survive this otherwise etc eventually she was exhausted and i drove her home in her car her daughters arrived just as i was leaving and i could tell theyd been crying as well diane collapsed into their arms and all four of them burst into an explosion of tears right there in the hall i made my escape at that point but none of them even noticed me leave and i walked back home again feeling completely puzzled their grief was a mystery to me but then id seen alec kissing gina passionately in front of the medical building and only a short while after that id witnessed him opening that rejection letter from her in his garden seen the expression on his face and the coldness in his eyes women hed said they always make the mistake of thinking they cant be replaced when in actual fact the very reverse is the case he didnt care about you i wanted to run back and shout at the four crying women the only person alec cartwright cared about was himself but of course i didnt go back and i didnt say any such thing they wouldnt have believed me anyway i did feel a little lonely walking back to my house from dianes though i suppose it had suddenly hit me that the only person in the entire world who knew what id done was luis and he was thousands of kilometres away in cuba i could never tell anybody else about it because of the risk of being arrested it had to remain my personal secret forever and yet i couldnt regret what id done alec cartwright had deserved to die i knew that and some time in the future diane and her daughters would come to realise that too and then they would be grateful to his murderer chapter nine a cheap disguise i started planning my next murder straight away well i suppose thats not strictly true i did make plans to seek out terry gemmas exhusband but at that stage i again only had thoughts of revenge in my mind id managed to convince myself that the alec cartwright affair had been a oneoff the result of unique circumstances anyway the day after i got back from cuba gemma and i met for coffee in norwich city centre in a cafe overlooking the market place gemma reminds me of your sister except gemmas far more beautiful she loves talking gemma does just like your sister and we sat there in the cafe and she chatted on about her family and diane and the mystery of what had happened in cuba i made the occasional contribution to the conversation but gemma never needs much encouragement to speak and most of the time i was free to daydream so i drifted in and out of the conversation my mind absorbed in the view of the busy market place and the severe architecture of city hall the council building standing behind it on the hill i suppose a part of me was still in cuba and it was probably inevitable that i would make comparisons between norwich and havana norwich market was practically bursting with the latest fashions and fresh fruit and vegetables and the contrast between this and the aching poverty of similar markets id seen in havana was huge i had an awful argument on the phone with terry the other day gemma said at last regaining my full attention why i asked whats he done now well gemma said her pretty face suddenly marked by frown lines you know my daughter kirsty is getting married next month well terrys insisting on brining sharon his latest woman to the wedding he says he wont come otherwise and you know how upset kirsty will be if he doesnt turn up but honestly carla you should see this sharon shes awful so cheaplooking shell turn up to the wedding wearing a lowcut top and short skirt i just know she will i dont want her there spoiling things i really dont i havent mentioned anything to kirsty about it yet of course but i tell you carla i dont know what to do about the situation i honestly dont it occurred to me suddenly that gemma sounded a bit like a child a spoilt child who hasnt got exactly what she wanted for her birthday perhaps she wasnt quite as nice as id first thought but then the truth was i didnt really know her very well i didnt know any of my new friends very well anyway my new opinion of gemma wasnt enough to put me off you see i never forgot that by taking revenge for my friends i was actually practising taking my revenge on you where did you say terry lives i asked casually he still lives at forest grange our family home she answered sounding bitter about the fact its out in the countryside just the other side of wroxham why do you ask no reason i lied i just wondered does she live there too this sharon gemma shook her head no she lives in norwich somewhere although from what i can gather she stays with terry most of the time did i tell you hes having a swimming pool built that must be for her to sunbathe beside because the terry i lived with for all those years couldnt even swim she sighed i dont know carla she said lifes so unfair isnt it since i left terry his business has been doing so well it practically manages itself these days what is his business he runs a riding stables only i get the impression he hardly goes into work at all anymore unless he fancies a ride himself that is hes got a manager to do everything for him he spends all his time riding his horses and watching his swimming pool being built and no doubt making love to his awful girlfriend did i tell you she was almost the same age as kirsty we parted company shortly after that gemma to do a bit of clothes shopping to help her forget about terry and me to go home to catch up on some sleep later after id woken up and had a snack i got the car out and drove to wroxham by then it was about six thirty and the rushhour traffic was just coming to an end i didnt know exactly where to look for forest grange but i knew the general direction it was in so i drove slowly up and down the lanes searching for it i was just about to turn the car around and go back to ask for directions at a pub id passed a few kilometres back when i spotted a big white house set back from the road behind some fir trees i slowed down to look at the house name at the end of the driveway forest grange id found it i didnt turn into the drive and neither did i find somewhere to park near the house to wait in case terry passed i knew i needed a more subtle approach than that instead i drove back to norwich working out my plan of action as i went this time i wouldnt be able to count on my victims neighbour to help me to achieve my revenge terrys nearest neighbour was the pub the kings arms unless just as i was driving over wroxham bridge i remembered seeing a sign outside the kings arms advertising bed and breakfast terry was likely to be a regular at the pub and if i stayed there id meet him sooner or later and even if he didnt come in the landlord would know about him i could pretend to be a tourist wanting to learn how to ride but first of all i needed a disguise unlike havana wroxham was only a few kilometres from norwich i needed to be completely anonymous besides a disguise would be fun do you remember that fancy dress party we went to a few years ago when you went as elvis presley and i dressed up as a pop star with a long blonde hairpiece and leather trousers well thats the look i adopted for my disguise except that i wore a short red skirt and high heels instead of the leather trousers my makeup was just as heavy though i even managed to match my lipstick exactly with the skirt i tell you by the time id put on a lowcut tightfitting black top i looked exactly the way gemma thought sharon was going to look at kirstys wedding when i looked at my reflection in the mirror i hardly recognised myself the long blonde hair on its own would have made me look completely different but the long blonde hair and the clothes together well i honestly dont think youd have recognised me if youd walked past me in the street anyway i packed a change of clothes and a few essentials into an overnight bag and jumped back into my car and by eight oclock that evening i was installed in the bar at the kings arms with a rum and coke in front of me and my overnight bag in the best guest room upstairs the landlord was called gordon and he was very friendly the pub wasnt busy so he was leaning on the beer pumps with his shirtsleeves rolled up chatting to me id told him my tourist and horseriding story and hed given me a list of possible stables to try the next day including terrys forest grange riding stables would be able to sort you out he assured me theyre definitely the nearest i dont think theyre too busy now either with all the kids back at school for the new term madeleine might be in here later with her boyfriend ill introduce you if i get the chance is she the owner i asked and he shook his head no the manager the owner lives near here too but i dont think hed be able to tell you if they could fit you in for lessons no madeleines the one you need but in the end neither madeleine nor terry came into the pub that evening i didnt feel as if all my efforts with the fancy dress had been wasted though id had the chance to practise being the type of woman my clothes suggested i was and i had proof that my disguise was a success there was a crowd of men around me by the end of the evening and i dont think they were there to listen to my intellectual conversation you men really are pathetic you know why cant you see how false all that makeup and hair colour makes us women look but then thats it isnt it you dont want reality any of you reality is boring reality gives you itchy feet thats because youre all so shallow anyway i fully exploited the shallowness of the male sex the next morning by putting on my lowcut black top again only this time because of the prospect of riding i wore it with trousers really tight trousers and loads of makeup of course downstairs i ate a light breakfast while gordon chatted on about a latesummer barbecue he was organising for his regulars the following saturday then i said my goodbyes and headed out to my car turning out of the pub i drove off in the direction of forest grange this time when i got there i indicated left and turned into the drive and when i got to the house i stopped the car and got out arranging my long hair attractively around my shoulders i fixed a pleasant smile onto my painted lips and knocked firmly on the front door after a bit of a wait it was answered by a man terry i guessed wearing a white towelling dressing gown his hair what there was of it was standing up on end and he needed a shave id obviously got him out of bed there was a short pause while he looked me up and down adjusting his annoyed expression to one of surprise and pleasure is this forest grange riding stables i asked him sweetly oh dear i havent made a mistake have i i have come to the right place havent i terry smiled at me hastily smoothing down his hair and pulling the belt of his dressing gown tighter well he said in an attractively deep voice this isnt the stables but i wouldnt call waking up and finding you on my doorstep a mistake terry called a female voice from somewhere indoors who is it come back to bed im missing you already terrys only acknowledgement of the voice was to step out onto the doorstep pulling the door almost closed after him the stables are along the next turning on the right he told me im going there for a ride later this morning myself actually i hope youll still be there then im the owner you see i could give you a guided tour if you like he held out his hand terry montague automatically i put my hand into his and he shook it firmly vienna francis i introduced myself giving him the name id used at the pub yes i know vienna i can just imagine how amusing youd find that but i dont care what you think i think its got style thats a very generous offer i told him thank you id like a tour very much terrys smile turned into a satisfied grin great well run along and have your lesson and ill see you afterwards if im not around just ask for me bye for now he waved his fingers at me then went back inside presumably to return to bed and the impatient sharon and i got back into my car and followed his directions to the stables as you know i grew up in horseriding country i went riding every saturday right through my teens my dad resisted buying a horse despite extreme pressure from me but the horse i rode every week lightning he was called almost felt like my very own i knew him and his habits so well anyway the point is i dont need riding lessons when you have that much experience at something you dont forget how to do it overnight and after id got to the stables and convinced madeleine of that i was allowed to go riding through the woods near the stables on my own it was really enjoyable actually the weather had cheered up a little and the leaving sunlight was slicing through the trees leaving pools of light on the ground it was really pretty and for the first time since returning from cuba i felt good about being back in england i allowed myself to simply enjoy the ride and didnt think at all about terry or you or luis or alec cartwright in fact it was only when i turned my horse around and headed back towards the stables that i started to think about the whole revenge thing again judging by terrys response to me on his doorstep it seemed reasonable to conclude that it wasnt going to be too difficult to get him away from sharon terry seemed like the kind of man who would cheat on his woman without a second thought unfortunately this probably meant that using blackmail for revenge wasnt a very promising option because if terry didnt really care about sharon at all then he wasnt likely to be bothered if terry and i had a love affair and i threatened to tell her about it no blackmail probably wouldnt work unless of course i could discover some other scandal terry wanted to keep quiet knowing my best immediate plan was to get to know terry better i urged my horse on towards the riding stables to see whether hed arrived yet i didnt see him at first madeleine took the horse from me and we exchanged a few words about my ride and the pleasantness of the woods when i asked her whether terry was around she pointed me in the direction of a low stable block on the other side of the yard i said goodbye to her and walked across to it as i got close i heard a man shouting and i slowed down to listen it was terry stand still you disobedient beast you he was saying and as i listened i heard a distinct slapping sound and the frightened response of a horse i said stand still terry shouted again and this was followed by yet another slap i really hate cruelty to animals as you well know remember the shock you got when we got the puppy and i thought he needed more attention than just one meal and one walk a day you were jealous because i thought of him as more of a companion than a pet refusing to leave him shut up in the house on his own well the way i see it animals trust us theyre defenceless completely dependent upon us and only cowards abuse them so you can imagine i expect how i felt standing outside those stables listening to terry abusing his horse i was sick to my stomach and so furious that i think if id had a knife or some other weapon with me id have rushed straight into that stable and used it on terry without a single thought for the consequences but i didnt have a weapon and somehow i forced myself to wait to stand in that stable yard and take a series of deep breaths until i was a little calmer but looking back now i tend to think that terrys fate was sealed right there and then as i stood listening to that terrified horse blackmail certainly seemed far too good for him anyway and i was suddenly convinced that the world would be a better place without him in it well hello there terry finally came out of the stable smiling at me as if he had never been in a bad temper at all somehow i dont know how i managed to smile back at him as if nothing was wrong hello i said brightly isnt it a lovely day ive just had the most delightful ride through the woods i am pleased about that he said looking me up and down and your timing is perfect i was just going to make myself a cup of coffee why dont you join me and then we can do that guided tour i agreed to all this and he took me to the office talking cheerfully all the way about goodness knows what and all the time walking across the yard inside the office and later on the tour of the stables terry was always standing just a little too close to me it was a deliberate invasion of my space i was breathing the same oxygen as terry experiencing an intense charm attack my nostrils were filled by the smell of his aftershave my ears with the soft deepness of his voice he looked me directly in the eyes as he spoke and at every opportunity he reached out to touch my leg i hated terry because of how he had just treated his horse and of course how he had treated gemma and yet i was still extremely aware of his attractiveness because he was attractive oh he was middleaged with an overlarge stomach and hair going a little thin on top but he possessed the selfconfidence of someone whos been attractive all his life someone whos used to having women falling at his feet of course he had no doubt whatsoever that i was going to be his next victim and obviously i did all i could to encourage this belief i laughed a lot and i touched his leg when i spoke i looked deeply into his eyes and i did my best to give him the impression that he was the most entertaining and attractive man id ever had a conversation with in my entire life and by the end of the guided tour terry had invited me to dinner that evening at his house eight oclock he said and make sure youre hungry im an excellent cook i smiled into his eyes im sure youre very talented i said deliberately licking my lips as terry watched my tongue travel over my lips he made a little sound of desire i think he wanted to grab hold of me right there in the stable yard actually anyway it was obvious to me that it wasnt only going to be terrys cooking on the menu that night until eight oclock then he said leaning towards me to kiss my cheek until eight i agreed beginning to walk away then i hesitated looking back at him over my shoulder by the way i said wont your girlfriend object to me coming to your house or is she going to be there too he did a good job at looking surprised oh he said do you mean the woman who was there this morning oh dont worry about her thats just a very casual relationship nothing important ill send her home to norwich well be completely alone i promise you good i said with a final smile then turned and walked slowly away towards my car making sure i moved my hips the way gina had moved hers in the streets of old havana like a salsa dancer a sexy salsa dancer chapter ten vienna in hawaii by the time i got back to the kings arms i had a terrible headache it had really taken a lot out of me to hide the way i felt about terry i can tell you and its absolutely exhausting pretending to be somebody else but i think the main reason my head hurt the way it did was because terrys words were still beating around my brain do you mean the woman who was there this morning hed said oh dont worry about her thats just a very casual relationship nothing important is that what you said about me when you met her on that skiing holiday is it oh dont worry about carla thats just a very casual relationship nothing important i bet you did say that or something very similar and you know i loved you i really loved you just as sharon probably loved terry as gemma had once loved him and diane had loved alec cartwright oh yes it was hatred making my head ache all right pure hatred but i had a bit of a sleep and a nice long bath and by the time i had my vienna francis disguise back on i felt a lot better i was wearing the short red skirt and high heeled shoes again and i felt more than reasonably confident that terry would approve of both bye vienna gordon called to me from behind the bar whoever he is hes a very lucky man as i waved goodbye to him and left the pub i felt a shiver of excitement run down my spine i had no idea what i was going to do in order to get revenge for gemma but that lack of knowledge was half the thrill terry came to the door dressed in white trousers a blue hawaiian shirt with bright red flowers on it and sunglasses his appearance was quite a surprise i must say and he laughed when he saw my expression i thought wed have a hawaiianstyle evening he explained to celebrate my new swimming pool and he proceeded to place a large orange flower behind my ear i smiled at him reaching up to touch the flower rather nervously and secretly wondering whether terry was mad but when he bent to kiss me i smelt his breath and realised that he had been drinking weve got hawaiian music and im cooking hawaiianstyle chicken he said taking my hand and leading me into the house and theres a fruit punch a very strong fruit punch if you know what i mean my own recipe would you like to try a glass now id love to i smiled right back in a minute when terry left to get me a drink i looked around the lounge was mainly white with white leather sofas and square black coffee tables there was also a red sheepskin rug in front of a huge fireplace and lots of mirrors the room was full of expensive fashionable furnishings but it didnt feel like a home it didnt seem genuine somehow but it did suit someone who dressed in loud shirts and who wore sunglasses indoors and from what i could see sharon didnt seem to have made any impression on it there was no evidence that she spent any time there at all one extra strong fruit punch terry said returning i took the glass from him thank you i said and tried some the punch did taste of fruit but only just it tasted more of alcohol very strong alcohol clearly terry wanted to get me very drunk very quickly oh its nice terry i told him very nice he smiled it is isnt it and just wait until you try the chicken its my speciality even if i do say so myself im sure it is i said trying some more of my punch and your house is so lovely too youve got such excellent taste i like to think so he boasted but you havent seen anything yet come and see my new pool he took my free hand and was about to sweep me from the room when the phone started to ring damn he swore id better answer that you go on ahead down the hall to the end and through the glass doors i wont be long i started to follow his directions but as soon as i was out of sight i stopped and waited to see whether i could hear his telephone conversation i could easily whether it was because he was a bit drunk or because he was angry i dont know but i could hear every word and i very quickly realised who he was speaking to look i dont want to talk about the wedding now its weeks away no im not being unreasonable youre the one being unreasonable such ridiculous attention to detail anyone would think you were inviting the royal family yes i know shes my daughter i should know im the one whos paid for her clothes and her cars and her horses all these years dont be ridiculous of course i love her what has that got to do with anything by that point id heard enough id already decided that terry was an extremely unpleasant man and id just had that opinion completely confirmed the swimming pool when i got there was the kind of pool youd expect to find in the home of a hollywood film star not the kind of pool belonging to somebody who felt he needed to complain about the cost of maintaining his only daughter at least that isnt a fault i can accuse you of you were never mean with money and you were certainly never mean towards your daughters they always got everything they wanted sometimes even before they knew they wanted it to be frank they were spoilt anyway i sat myself down at a table by the poolside to wait for terry listening to the hawaiian music and wondering how to kill him because i knew by then that i was going to kill him it was exactly what he deserved i just didnt know how i was going to do it i looked around the poolside for a suitable weapon but there was nothing immediately obvious there were some large heavylooking vases which looked as if they could knock somebody out if you hit them over the head with one but a giant vase is hardly a subtle weapon leaning against one wall there was a large net on the end of a long pole presumably for fishing leaves out of the pool and next to it there was a display of tropical plants but i doubted whether any of them were poisonous and i had no way of finding out there were some large stones arranged on the ground around the plants though and i quickly picked one up and put it in my handbag in case it came in useful later the last thing i did before terry made an appearance was to pour my punch into a plant pot it was essential for me to keep a clear head so i had to remain sober however it would definitely help my plans if terry got even drunker than he was now when terry finally appeared he had a big smile on his face he also had a jug of punch in one hand and a dish of food in the other starters he said placing the dish on the table in front of me help yourself youd have been so surprised if youd been able to see me at that poolside sharing that meal with terry i was very calm and entertaining i laughed at terrys jokes as if they were the funniest jokes id heard in my life and pretended i was as drunk as he was but every time terry walked unsteadily into the house to fetch more punch or more food i fed the contents of my glass to one of the plants there was no way terry could have predicted how vulnerable he became as he drank more and when he finally moved unsteadily towards me to try to take me into his arms it only took a very little push to keep him away no terry i said gently oh yes he said coming at me again and this time i pushed him harder very hard you know ive always enjoyed going to the gym well my arm muscles are very strong these days ok i wouldnt have been able to push terry into the pool if hed been sober but he wasnt sober he was very drunk indeed there was a huge splash when his body hit the water huge the water shot right up into the air and splashed down again like a waterfall terry had landed face down and was soon gasping for breath but i didnt give him the chance to breathe properly i reached for the net and put it into the water pole end first not to try to save terry oh no to push him under time and time again push push push until finally he sank beneath the surface and all i could see were bubbles and then the bubbles stopped and i had committed my second murder chapter eleven ice cream monsters i havent written anything in this book for several months now after the past few terrible months i havent had the heart for it in fact i was going to stop there to leave my story incomplete but in the end i decided to carry on with it it stops me from going completely crazy writing it all down and it helps to fill the long empty hours its all so very strange looking back christmas is almost here now and in some ways those events of early autumn seem so distant sometimes its as if im looking back through a telescope but ive got the telescope the wrong way round i can see myself and yet im just a tiny dot in the distance at other times its as if the telescopes the right way round and im looking directly into my face everythings close up and i can see all the changing emotions crossing my features and thats when i know that the memories will always be preserved in my mind just as fresh and as strong as if it all happened yesterday a living nightmare i suppose id gained rather a false sense of security about killing after two relatively easy murders i certainly wasnt anticipating any difficulties when i set out to meet cathys ex a couple of weeks after terry died but i havent told you about that yet have i about what happened after i killed terry well to be honest the answer is nothing nothing happened at least not to me oh a fullscale murder investigation took place but nobody ever connected the mysterious vienna francis at the stables with me there was one very disappointing incident though actually it was almost a repeat of what had happened with diane after id returned from cuba the disappointment was gemma her reaction to terrys death i can still hear her voice when she phoned to tell me about it full of selfpity and anger she actually blamed terry for spoiling their daughters wedding by dying how logical is that he always was a selfish man she said he could never do anything right getting himself murdered like that within weeks of his daughters wedding how can poor kirsty get married with all this going on the shame of it all well have to cancel all the arrangements the poor girl will have to go to a funeral instead as i put the phone down i began to think my friends were very ungrateful indeed of course they didnt know they had anything to thank me for but they could at least have been grateful to fate if nothing else the men who had made their lives a misery for so long had been removed they were now both free to move forward to grow to find happiness id done them both a big favour and all they could do was moan about it actually do you know what it reminded me of it reminded me of all those times i had dragged myself to the supermarket in search of something your daughters would eat then id return home loaded down with heavy carrier bags and id spend another hour chopping stirring and cooking and were they grateful when i put those lovingly prepared meals down in front of them at the table no they were not they said things like whats this this is disgusting i dont want to eat this daddy the darling princesses well i felt there was more than a hint of princess behaviour in the way both diane and gemma had reacted to the death of their nogood husbands so it was quite encouraging when cathy phoned me to spill her heart out about the thoughtlessness of her ex poor little cathy shes always been the most vulnerable of the four of us often suffering from depression and dependent upon the unwilling pete for financial support she hardly ever saw her little son pete says he cant afford to give me any money anymore she cried down the phone to me he says i should look for more work and he knows i find the amount of work i already do completely exhausting its a struggle to survive as it is how can he expect me to stop getting depressed when hes behaving like this i offered cathy a few words of comfort asked just enough questions to find out roughly where pete lived and then set out almost immediately to carry out my plans for revenge i was convinced that cathy at least would be grateful to me for one thing although cathy and pete had been separated for over a year they werent divorced so if pete died cathy would inherit his money and her son would go back to living with her all the time it all seemed very simple and straightforward as i left my flat on that sunny september morning i had no idea what was about to happen to me of how very complex my life was about to become pete was an engineer when i met him living on the edge of norwich in a village called trowse trowse is a small place very pretty theres a river a couple of lakes some woods a bakery and a pub oh and a boat club pete loved to sail in trowse its possible to imagine youre in the countryside when the city is only a kilometre or two away pete liked it because as he said to me on that day we first met ive got the best of both worlds here the stars above my garden and a supermarket around the corner anyway as ive said trowse is a small place and although i didnt know the number of petes house that morning when i set out to find him i did know it was on the road leading to the lakes at whitlingham country park i was familiar with whitlingham because id gone for a walk there in the summer with cathy her son ben and her little dog chalkie and now i came to think of it i could remember little ben pointing out of the car window and saying theres daddys house theres daddys house of course after all this time i couldnt remember which house it had been so i parked in the car park at whitlingham country park and walked back along the road casually looking at each house in search of clues well i found a clue all right more than a clue evidence solid evidence ben i walked around a corner and there he was in the front garden of one of the cottages and as soon as he saw me he tore open the garden gate and threw himself into my arms carla he shouted carla carla carla i hugged him automatically and as i did so a shadow made me aware that he wasnt alone i looked up straight into the deep brown eyes of a man i knew must be pete well he said smiling i think your name must be carla and he laughed ten minutes later the three of us were sitting on a blanket in the front garden eating ice creams from petes freezer little ben was chatting away to me describing a boat trip he and his father had gone on the previous day and his strawberry ice cream was melting right down the front of his tshirt his hands were pink and so was his mouth there were even pink spots on the blanket next to him do you think my sons turning into an ice cream pete asked me and ben laughed with delight dont be silly daddy he said or perhaps said pete hes turning into an ice cream monster ben approved of this idea and he leapt up holding his ice cream out in front of him like a weapon yes daddy im an ice cream monster he cried excitedly and for the next few minutes he proceeded to chase his father around the garden as i watched them it was impossible not to smile at the fun they were having they looked so alike with their curly brown hair and dark eyes i never had been able to identify any of cathys features or characteristics in little ben and now i knew why he took after his father i expect you can already see the picture im beginning to paint for you a pretty cottage flowers in the garden hardly any traffic to disturb the peace sunshine strawberry ice cream and the sound of male laughter father and son a contented unit like you and the girls were whenever i wasnt around you never thought i was very good with children did you it never occurred to you to consider whether the three of you made it easy for me to fit in to become a true part of your happy unit you made your decisions and you consulted me afterwards or rather you made your decisions and then just announced them to me come to think of it there was very little consultation involved at all that day in petes garden i felt included straight away when they were both worn out from their ice cream monster game father and son collapsed next to me on the blanket laughing and struggling to get their breath ben took my hand examining my arm carefully youre very brown carla he said have you been on holiday i have to cuba i told him wheres cuba ben wanted to know is it further away than london pete laughed but i nodded seriously yes its much further away than london i told him its very far away across the sea near america im going to go to cuba one day ben announced and then he got bored sitting on the blanket and ran off to chase a butterfly which was flying above the flowers when we were alone pete leant on one elbow to look at me ben obviously likes you a lot he said have you spent much time with him ive only met him three or four times i said thinking about it but i like him a lot too hes a lovely little boy pete smiled watching his son yes he is he agreed which is something of a small miracle considering some of the things that have happened during his short lifetime though actually i think cathys periods of illness have probably made the two of us closer we were together a lot while she was in hospital or resting did she go to hospital i asked i didnt know that oh yes he said four times altogether during our marriage shes also tried to kill herself twice he looked at me you didnt know that either did you i shook my head no i said i didnt he frowned then shook his head im sorry he apologised this is an unpleasant subject for a very pleasant afternoon he made himself smile you didnt say what you were doing in trowse oh i replied casually just exploring i havent lived in the area for that long oh he said and what made you move here i gave a him a bitter little smile lets just say its another unpleasant subject for a nice afternoon he was quiet for a while thinking and then he said i understand if you met cathy on that course then you must have recently split up with somebody i smiled good guess and you moved here to make a new start another good guess well he said taking my hand exactly the way ben had just done im very glad you chose to move here carla in fact i think it was the perfect choice i dont expect youll be surprised to learn that i stayed for dinner however since you think im so bad with children you might be surprised to hear that i put ben to bed and read him a story and that he insisted on kissing me good night after wed eaten and ben was asleep pete and i went back outside with our glasses of wine to sit on the blanket it was dark and the stars were just coming out my original motives for seeking pete out were long forgotten at that moment sitting close to pete on the blanket under the stars revenge was definitely the very last thing on my mind yes youve guessed it if anything was on my mind just then i suppose it was romance crazy i know after all id only known pete for a few hours but somehow it wasnt as crazy as youd think because pete wasnt like alec or terry he was young attractive and above all nice and i was hungry for nice after you and its very very lonely having to be strong all the time believe me always having to keep a part of me secret and yet of course there was a barrier in the way of pete and me getting together cathy chapter twelve poetry and passion i think i knew even then that i didnt intend to carry out any acts of revenge on pete out there on the blanket in the dark sleepy garden i encouraged him to talk about the past i think i wanted to be convinced that he was a good man that he deserved to live tell me i said tell me about your ghosts he looked at me you mean cathy he asked and then he sighed and lay down on the blanket with his eyes closed for a while i thought he wasnt going to make any further response but then he began to speak and his voice was sad with remembered pain i dont know what shes told you he said but im not the big bad monster in all of this honestly im not when i first met cathy i loved her very much we were so happy and we got married really quickly he sighed heavily i really believed it would last forever he paused there but i didnt fill the waiting silence with questions and he soon continued with his story unfortunately after wed been married for a few years cathy became depressed seriously depressed i did all i could to try and help her but i felt completely inadequate nothing i did seemed to make any difference at all so when she said she thought shed feel better if we had children i wasnt sure but she begged me and begged me and finally i agreed i suppose i should have known it wouldnt help but as i said i loved her all i wanted was for her to be happy again to have the cathy id first met back again so it didnt help at all when ben was born i asked and pete shook his head no he said sadly quite the opposite she was even more depressed than ever and he went on to describe the desperate years of coping with cathys periods of depression the times in hospital and the different doctors the trials with various drugs the attempts to kill herself what he described seemed like a catalogue of despair and false hopes i know youre a friend of cathys carla pete said to me at last but the truth is i did all i could for her she was completely unpredictable and it simply wasnt safe to leave ben alone with her so i couldnt work we were desperately poor and although i knew cathy was ill i didnt feel she was really trying to help herself so eventually you left he nodded yes eventually i left but i assure you it was the hardest thing ive ever had to do but i had to think of ben and funnily enough although i know cathys found it difficult since i left i think shes has been making more of an effort she joined that course where she met you for a start and now shes got a circle of friends shes got her parttime job too i didnt make any comment about this and he sighed again accurately interpreting my silence cathys told you about my decision to cut payments to her hasnt she he said and i nodded shes very worried about how shes going to manage i said i know she is pete said sounding miserable but the thing is im just not going to be able to afford her payments any longer im going back to university soon to study creative writing ive always dreamed of being a writer and after so many years of looking after other people i want to do something for myself is that so very selfish of me i glanced up and found him looking at me intensely his dark eyes demanding an answer perhaps even approval is that so selfish of me carla he repeated is it and do you know somehow i found myself shaking my head no i said i dont think it is well you know how ive always been interested in literature and anyway there was a bond of sympathy between us a common understanding we were connected by the experience of despair and we were both survivors besides the moon was shining down on the garden from over the trees and the sky above us was filled with a million stars we were lying next to each other on a blanket beneath those stars our shoulders touching there had been an unspoken attraction between us right from the very start and i know that if ben hadnt woken up from a nightmare at that very moment that attraction would have been acknowledged we would have kissed i know we would but as it was pete went indoors to comfort his son and by the time he came down again the moment had passed come out sailing with us tomorrow carla pete said squeezing my hands in his ben would love to see you again and so would i i blushed at that and i dont think i ever did that with you pete had such a warm intense way of looking at me it made me feel wanted needed and it was a very long time since id truly felt either of those things being with you was always so complex somehow it was either fantastic or awful depending on your mood but pete was different and i think i sensed that difference straight away i knew i would be able to wake up next to him in the morning and feel confident that he was the same man id gone to sleep next to the night before so i blushed and i smiled at him and i said thank you id love to go sailing with you and he smiled back and said good ill always remember that first day pete ben and i went sailing on the norfolk broads it was a truly perfect day the weather was lovely with not a cloud in the sky pete was an expert sailor and little ben seemed to be an equally expert helper despite his age there was nothing for me to do but sit and enjoy the view and it was a very fine view with tall grass and wild flowers on the river bank and water birds swimming next to us when i wasnt looking at the view i watched ben and his father together admiring how they worked as a team pete had a way of giving ben tasks to do that made the boy feel important and it was such a contrast to the way cathy treated ben cathy seemed to want ben to be dependent upon her she treated him more like a baby than an intelligent capable young boy and as a result he behaved like a baby more than once id seen ben really lose his temper when hed been with cathy shouting and crying and stamping his foot when he didnt get his own way about something but that day on the boat he was very different daddy theres a man selling ice creams he said once pointing at the river bank can i have one not just now son its nearly lunch time an ice cream will spoil your appetite you can have one later and ben gave the ice cream man one final look then started to play with a piece of rope which was lying on the deck im impressed i told pete if cathy had tried to say that to him hed have gone mad but she wouldnt have said it would she pete pointed out shed have let him have the ice cream and then wondered why he didnt want to eat any lunch it was true i had to admit and i couldnt help thinking as i sat there on the boat with the sun on my face and a soft wind in my hair that your daughters would have benefited a lot from such an approach you spoilt them by giving them everything they wanted whenever they asked for it at lunch time we tied the boat up at a picnic area and ate sandwiches and fruit afterwards ben ran around entertaining himself by chasing butterflies and pete and i chatted about the course he was about to start at university he told me that hed always written stories and poems and that poetry had been his lifeline during the long unhappy years with cathy everyone needs to be able to express themselves dont they he said ive always loved finding out about writers and reading their books its fascinating the times ive got into trouble for reading when i shouldnt be reading at work even on my honeymoon i cant seem to help it if i see an interesting piece of writing ive started reading before i know it and now ive got the chance to become a writer myself its fantastic we were sitting on a blanket again this time beneath some willow trees the long branches were moving about in the wind making sunshine patterns on petes face as he spoke dappled shade just like in our garden when you told me it was all over and yet that afternoon with pete i cant honestly remember thinking about you or how you so brutally ended our relationship at all i was just enjoying being with pete admiring his enthusiasm appreciating the brightness in his eyes that day on the river bank you were just a vague misty memory and so was my very recent past dont you think the mind is a strange thing to some extent it can select what you remember until something happens to make sure you face up to the truth i want to know more about you pete was saying people are so fascinating to me but particularly you i want to know all your likes and dislikes i know lets start with poetry its something very close to my own heart whats your favourite poem i was able to answer straight away summer with monica by roger mcgough he smiled reaching out to stroke the hair from my face ah he said a love story and then he leaned over and he kissed me that kiss was as gentle as one of bens butterflies would have felt if it had landed on my mouth and yet it set off a fierce storm of desire in both me and pete we pulled apart and looked at each other i think we were both a little shocked by the force of our feelings maybe we should slow down pete told me softly i looked into his face and i suppose i probably looked worried because he reached out to touch my cheek i like you carla he said i like you a lot i dont want to rush into things and spoil them lets keep things special yes when you first told me our relationship was over i felt as if i would never recover i didnt know who i was or what i was going to do but there in petes arms with him smiling down at me and talking about keeping things special i found myself again yes i said lets keep things special and i felt happy and sad at the same time happy because pete accepted me exactly as i was and sad because he would never ever know exactly what i was like because how could i ever tell him he was holding a double murderer in his arms chapter thirteen hot water for the next two weeks i only returned to my flat once to fetch some clothes the three of us went out on the boat on fine days which was nearly every day and in the evenings pete and i talked cooked each other meals and kissed in the middle of the second week cathy came to collect ben to take him to stay with her for a few days i kept upstairs out of the way while cathy was there it seemed the least complicated option somehow and as i lay on the bed with the bedroom door open i listened to cathy talking to pete nobody knows where my friend carlas gone cathy said shes just disappeared it isnt like her to go off like that not without telling anybody and gemmas going half crazy trying to organise a funeral and a wedding its taken the police a while to release her husbands body and they still havent got a clue who killed him and dianes had to go to cuba to sort everything out over there carla was the only one of us who hadnt had anything dramatic happen to her and now shes gone and disappeared look cathy i heard pete interrupt her im going to have to ask you to go ive got an appointment to get to i noticed that pete sounded different talking to cathy when he spoke to me his voice was soft and unhurried as if he had all the time in the world but when he spoke to cathy there was a distinct edge of impatience to his voice cathy was clearly annoyed at being cut off in full flow well pardon me for wasting your valuable time she said angrily dont be like that cathy pete said obviously doing his best to be more patient its just that im really busy today too busy to speak to the mother of your child i suppose cathy went on too busy to discuss how im going to afford to buy food when you cut off your payments ill see what i can do about the payments i heard pete say tiredly and cathys voice immediately changed youll carry on with them she said excitedly really do you promise ill try pete replied thats all i can say now i really must get ready their voices became more distant and i guessed they were heading towards the front door youve got an interview havent you i heard cathy guess wrongly youve got an interview and youve given up the idea of going to university after hed finally got rid of her pete came upstairs and collapsed onto the bed beside me dont say anything he warned me half joking i know im weak but i just couldnt stand another one of her moods thats all i put my arms around him and we lay together in comfortable silence for a while then after hed calmed down he looked at me your friends lead dramatic lives dont they he observed two murders in the space of two weeks and one unexplained disappearance i joked hoping to change the subject pete laughed would you like to disappear with me forever he asked kissing the side of my neck and the thing is i wanted to say yes i was so happy being around pete he made me feel totally safe and loved in a way you never did yes i said lets do it he seemed astonished pulling back to look at me do what he asked disappear i said make a new start somewhere else somewhere where nobody knows us i think i probably sounded a bit too eager even perhaps a little desperate because he looked at me strangely well he said after a while i cant can i theres ben to consider and cathy she might be a bit of a pain but she is his mother i cant deny him his mother besides theres my university course i did my best to smile recovering as quickly as possible i could tell from his reaction that my voice had probably sounded dangerously similar to cathys of course there is i said youre right it was just a silly idea are you sure he asked sounding concerned you seemed is everything all right carla i laughed and to my relief the laugh sounded quite normal im fine i assured him fine as i said it was just a silly idea now are you going to lie there talking all afternoon or are you going to make love to me he smiled at that and started to kiss me but although i responded for the first time since wed been together i didnt really experience much pleasure from our passion i was filled with too much regret and i thought about you for the first time in days with hatred because it was your fault that i had secrets i needed to keep from the man i loved your fault that i was a murderer life carried on as normal for the next few days petes holidays were over and he had to go back to work i knew i should look for a new job myself my savings werent going to last forever but somehow i didnt feel motivated to buy a newspaper or visit the job centre i dont think i realised it at the time but looking back now i think i was feeling very uncertain about what the future might bring and quite rightly so because one afternoon i came back from a peaceful walk around the lake at whitlingham to find that pete was already home and the first thing i saw when i let myself in through the back door was this notebook lying open on the kitchen table i think my heart stopped i know i couldnt breathe properly and i had to grab hold of the kitchen table to stop myself from falling i stood there for a long time staring at the open book and holding on to the table my body frozen by horror i didnt leave it there like that did i i know i was sitting there writing but i put it back in my bag surely i did he wouldnt have taken it out of my bag would he the words crashed around inside my head over and over again and suddenly i remembered our conversation about reading when wed been sitting on the river bank the first time wed gone out in the boat the times ive got into trouble for reading when i shouldnt be reading pete had said at work even on my honeymoon i cant seem to help it if i see an interesting piece of writing ive started reading before i know it eventually my limbs must have unlocked i suppose because i managed to move over to the book to look down at the open pages trying to see what hed been reading i kept having to blink because my eyes wouldnt focus properly maybe i was crying i dont know i only know that at first my handwritten words in the notebook swam around in front of my eyes making no sense to me but when at last the words became steady enough to make sense i could see that the book wasnt open at the page i had been writing on and one word in particular leapt straight out from the page at me weedkiller im not sure what i would have done if pete hadnt chosen that exact moment to call down to me from upstairs maybe i would just have grabbed my book and run away disappeared out of petes life forever moved abroad had plastic surgery to change my identity but he did call down to me carla im up here in the bath come and join me ive got something i want to talk to you about i didnt stop to analyse the sound of his voice i was totally convinced he was going to ask me about the notebook to accuse me of murder as i made my way slowly up the stairs listening to the sound of pete in the bath i had no idea of what i was going to do i didnt go up there with the intention of killing him i really didnt to be honest i didnt even feel i was inhabiting my body properly it was as if i was floating somewhere above myself watching with curiosity as i reached the top of the stairs there was a small electric fire on the landing with a long cable i bent to plug it in and picked it up carefully walking with it towards the open door of the bathroom then i threw it into the bathwater with pete chapter fourteen tidying up prison is a very boring place oh they give you work to do you have a job but you dont exactly receive careers advice or get to choose the job you want choice doesnt come into it you do what youre told they told me to clean the kitchens so thats what i do every day my hands are red and rough and my skin is white from being indoors so much and ive only been here two months but id better put you right youll be thinking ive been arrested and locked up for murder no thats not what happened at all the truth is much harder to believe during the long hours im locked up in my cell i think to myself if only i knew a writer if only i could tell a writer my story it would be a bestselling book but of course i get depressed when i start to think things like that because i did know a writer and i killed him i screamed after id thrown the fire into the bath screamed and screamed and screamed with my hands over my ears i didnt realise it was me doing the screaming at first as soon as i did i stopped but the tears were still pouring down my face and i was groaning like an injured animal it was just the same as in the kitchen i was paralysed again completely unable to move only this time instead of my open book i was standing there staring at the face of my dead lover a face turned ugly by death there was a magazine in the water a magazine pete had been reading before he died a travel brochure as i stared at it the significance of its presence in the bath sent a wave of pure terror sweeping right through me and suddenly i was running away from the murder scene along the landing down the stairs but no matter how fast i ran i couldnt escape my thoughts why would pete have been reading a travel brochure in the bath if he was about to accuse me of murder in the kitchen i reached for my notebook my eyes desperately travelling over the lines of writing gardening is very relaxing for me i read luiss words in his little garden yes out here i have only the weeds to fight and i have a good friend to help me to do that my weedkiller it is very strong those weeds they have not got a chance i quickly turned the pages searching for my account of alec cartwrights murder i had to turn quite a few pages before i reached it and suddenly it was difficult to breathe suddenly i knew that it was quite possible i had just made the biggest most heartbreaking mistake of my entire life that it was quite possible pete hadnt known anything about my murders at all i didnt stop to think about any evidence or clues i might have left in the house i did hurry around collecting what clothes and possessions i could see but i didnt wipe any objects i might have touched i was far too upset to think in such a logical way i had just murdered the man i loved and i needed to escape except of course that there was no escape there is never any escape especially at night when i lie awake in the darkness and i see petes dead eyes staring back at me from the bath but as i ran from petes house i dont think i quite realised just how impossible it was going to be to escape i ran to my car and drove off my tyres screaming i didnt even return to my house why would i there was nothing for me there anymore so i just drove and drove i didnt even make the decision to drive north it just turned out that way and apart from getting petrol i didnt stop i didnt even know i was heading towards whitby until i saw the first road sign why did i choose whitby i wonder our place how was it possible that even then after everything that had just happened i was still thinking about you because whitby was the place we went to for a romantic holiday soon after we met our special place a place for walking hand in hand on the windswept sands and eating fish and chips on the harbour wall but i didnt walk on the sands or eat fish and chips this time because i was involved in a car crash before i got there on the a to be precise just south of york the driver of the other vehicle was a welldressed woman in her fifties and when i got out of my car to inspect the damage she began to shout at me accusing me of dangerous driving threatening me with her solicitor and suddenly id had enough so i hit her i hit her very hard and while she was recovering i hit her again and again when she fell to the ground i kicked her and who knows what else i might have done but at some point a lorry driver grabbed me and kept hold of me until the police arrived but i dont suppose i need to tell you all of this do i you must know about it just about everybody in the whole of england knows about it because the aggressive woman was a politician and her picture and mine appeared on the front of just about every newspaper in the country and on television quite a coincidence wasnt it out of all the thousands and thousands of drivers on the al that evening i had to be involved in an accident with her when i look at that picture now her with her cut bruised face and me staring straight at the camera i hardly recognise myself theres no conscience in my face at all no sign of regret or shame well i didnt feel neither regret nor shame and i couldnt pretend otherwise thats why i got such a long sentence i think such displays of senseless aggression cannot be allowed to go unpunished the judge concluded at the court case it is this courts intention to make an example of you i therefore sentence you to the maximum term for such a crime you will go to prison for two years in my mind however im in prison for life because surely its only a matter of time before the investigations by the police into those three separate unsolved murders lead them in my direction and in some ways it will be a relief except that if i do stay in prison for the rest of my life then nothing will ever happen to you youll bring up your spoilt girls to be spoilt young women and youll forget that you ever had a girlfriend called carla the most wonderful thing has happened i had three visitors this afternoon can you guess who actually when the guard first told me i had visitors i was expecting them to be the police either that or some boring relative but it was diane gemma and cathy the girls i was so pleased to see some friendly faces that i forgot for a moment that they might not be friendly i had after all murdered their exhusbands you all look so good i said and it was true all three of them were dressed smartly with styled hair and perfect makeup they could have stepped straight from the pages of a fashion magazine i cant say the same about you im afraid diane said and i blushed with sudden embarrassment my hand going up to my unwashed hair there doesnt seem much point in making an effort in here i said softly and diane shook her head no she said i dont suppose there does there was a silence then and i could feel each one of them looking at me hard it didnt come as too much of a surprise when gemma finally said we know carla we know what you did i suppose i could have tried to deny it but suddenly i didnt have the energy any longer im sorry i said and i looked down at my rough red hands feeling ashamed there was another silence and this time i risked looking up all three of them were still staring at me as if i were an object on display in an exhibition how how did you find out i asked we asked questions talked to people drew conclusions diane said we guessed a lot of it gemma added ben told me you were at petes cathy said i reacted at the mention of his name i couldnt help it but they didnt seem to notice or if they did then they assumed i was reacting out of fear not out of heartbreak so after cathy found the body diane said whispering now she called us and we went round and did a thorough cleaning job before we phoned the police i stared at them feeling completely confused and gemma suddenly burst out laughing were grateful to you she said all of us very grateful diane agreed but i started to say but she interrupted me i know i was upset at first well that was before i went over to cuba and met your friend luis he made me face up to what my husband was really like lovely man luis he asked after you by the way sent you his love if i were you id get myself back over to cuba the minute they set you free from this place im rich gemma continued with a huge smile as our divorce still wasnt final i inherited all his money kirsty had the most wonderful wedding you should have seen her carla oh she looked beautiful there was even a feature about it in hi society magazine and ive got my little boy living with me all the time cathy said instantly i was in petes garden in trowse watching little ben playing at ice cream monsters with his father and i thought of you you who had first planted those seeds of murder in my heart with your cruelty you who were at that very moment in time living your life happily in the house which was once my home too so what we want to know diane was saying is what we can do to show you how grateful we are yes gemma agreed if theres anything we can do carla just name it anything at all cathy said anything i was still thinking of you when i started to smile at them it was the first thing id smiled about since pete had died yes i said there is something you can do for me some rubbish you can get rid of for me then i began to laugh the end
