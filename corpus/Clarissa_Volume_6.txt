of an earth in which innocent and benevolent spirits are sure to be considered as aliens the history of clarissa harlowe letter i mr lovelace to john belford esq sat midnight no rest says a text that i once heard preached upon to the wicked and i cannot close my eyes yet only wanted to compound for half an hour in an elbowchair so must scribble on i parted with the captain after another strong debate with him in relation to what is to be the fate of this lady as the fellow has an excellent head and would have made an eminent figure in any station of life had not his early days been tainted with a deep crime and he detected in it and as he had the right side of the argument i had a good deal of difficulty with him and at last brought myself to promise that if i could prevail upon her generously to forgive me and to reinstate me in her favour i would make it my whole endeavour to get off of my contrivances as happily as i could only that lady betty and charlotte must come and then substituting him for her uncles proxy take shame to myself and marry but if i should jack with the strongest antipathy to the state that ever man had what a figure shall i make in rakish annals and can i have taken all this pains for nothing or for a wife only that however excellent and any woman do i think i could make good because i could make any woman fear as well as love me might have been obtained without the plague i have been at and much more reputably than with it and hast thou not seen that this haughty woman forgive me that i call her haughty and a woman yet is she not haughty knows not how to forgive with graciousness indeed has not at all forgiven me but holds my soul in a suspense which has been so grievous to her own at this silent moment i think that if i were to pursue my former scheme and resolve to try whether i cannot make a greater fault serve as a sponge to wipe out the less and then be forgiven for that i can justify myself to myself and that as the fair invincible would say is all in all as it is my intention in all my reflections to avoid repeating at least dwelling upon what i have before written to thee though the state of the case may not have varied so i would have thee to reconsider the old reasonings particularly those contained in my answer to thy last expostulatory nonsense and add the new as they fall from my pen and then i shall think myself invincible at least as arguing rake to rake see vol v letter xiv i take the gaining of this lady to be essential to my happiness and is it not natural for all men to aim at obtaining whatever they think will make them happy be the object more or less considerable in the eyes of others as to the manner of endeavouring to obtain her by falsification of oaths vows and the like do not the poets of two thousand years and upwards tell us that jupiter laughs at the perjuries of lovers and let me add to what i have heretofore mentioned on that head a question or two do not the mothers the aunts the grandmothers the governesses of the pretty innocents always from their very cradles to riper years preach to them the deceitfulness of men that they are not to regard their oaths vows promises what a parcel of fibbers would all these reverend matrons be if there were not now and then a pretty credulous rogue taken in for a justification of their preachments and to serve as a beacon lighted up for the benefit of the rest do we not then see that an honest prowling fellow is a necessary evil on many accounts do we not see that it is highly requisite that a sweet girl should be nowandthen drawn aside by him and the more eminent the girl in the graces of person mind and fortune is not the example likely to be the more efficacious if these postulata be granted me who i pray can equal my charmer in all these who therefore so fit for an example to the rest of her sex at worst i am entirely within my worthy friend mandevilles assertion that private vices are public benefits well then if this sweet creature must fall as it is called for the benefit of all the pretty fools of the sex she must and theres an end of the matter and what would there have been in it of uncommon or rare had i not been so long about it and so i dismiss all further argumentation and debate upon the question and i impose upon thee when thou writest to me an eternal silence on this head waferd on as an afterwritten introduction to the paragraphs which follow marked with turned commas thus lord jack what shall i do now how one evil brings on another dreadful news to tell thee while i was meditating a simple robbery here have i in my own defence indeed been guilty of murder a bl y murder so i believe it will prove at her last gasp poor impertinent opposer eternally resisting eternally contradicting there she lies weltering in her blood her deaths wound have i given her but she was a thief an impostor as well as a tormentor she had stolen my pen while i was sullenly meditating doubting as to my future measures she stole it and thus she wrote with it in a hand exactly like my own and would have faced me down that it was really my own handwriting but let me reflect before it is too late on the manifold perfections of this everamiable creature let me reflect the hand yet is only held up the blow is not struck miss howes next letter may blow thee up in policy thou shouldest be now at least honest thou canst not live without her thou wouldest rather marry her than lose her absolutely thou mayest undoubtedly prevail upon her inflexible as she seems to be for marriage but if now she finds thee a villain thou mayest never more engage her attention and she perhaps will refuse and abhor thee yet already have i not gone too far like a repentant thief afraid of his gang and obliged to go on in fear of hanging till he comes to be hanged i am afraid of the gang of my cursed contrivances as i hope to live i am sorry at the present writing that i have been such a foolish plotter as to put it as i fear i have done out of my own power to be honest i hate compulsion in all forms and cannot bear even to be compelled to be the wretch my choice has made me so now belford as thou hast said i am a machine at last and no free agent upon my soul jack it is a very foolish thing for a man of spirit to have brought himself to such a height of iniquity that he must proceed and cannot help himself and yet to be next to certain that this very victory will undo him why was such a woman as this thrown into my way whose very fall will be her glory and perhaps not only my shame but my destruction what a happiness must that man know who moves regularly to some laudable end and has nothing to reproach himself with in his progress to do it when by honest means he attains his end how great and unmixed must be his enjoyments what a happy man in this particular case had i been had it been given me to be only what i wished to appear to be thus far had my conscience written with my pen and see what a recreant she had made of me i seized her by the throat there there said i thou vile impertinent take that and that how often have i gave thee warning and now i hope thou intruding varletess have i done thy business puling and lowvoiced rearing up thy detested head in vain implorest thou my mercy who in thy day hast showed me so little take that for a rising blow and now will thy pain and my pain for thee soon be over lie there welter on had i not given thee thy deaths wound thou wouldest have robbed me of all my joys thou couldest not have mended me tis plain thou couldest only have thrown me into despair didst thou not see that i had gone too far to recede welter on once more i bid thee gasp on that thy last gasp surely how hard diest thou adieu unhappy man adieu tis kind in thee however to bid me adieu adieu adieu adieu to thee o thou inflexible and till now unconquerable bosom intruder adieu to thee for ever letter ii mr lovelace to john belford esq sunday morn june four oclock a few words to the verbal information thou sentest me last night concerning thy poor old man and then i rise from my seat shake myself refresh newdress and so to my charmer whom notwithstanding her reserves i hope to prevail upon to walk out with me on the heath this warm and fine morning the birds must have awakened her before now they are in full song she always gloried in accustoming herself to behold the sun rise one of gods natural wonders as once she called it her window salutes the east the valleys must be gilded by his rays by the time i am with her for already have they made the uplands smile and the face of nature cheerful how unsuitable will thou find this gay preface to a subject so gloomy as that i am now turning to i am glad to hear thy tedious expectations are at last answered thy servant tells me that thou are plaguily grieved at the old fellows departure i cant say but thou mayest look as if thou wert harassed as thou hast been for a number of days and nights with a close attendance upon a dying man beholding his drawingon hour pretending for decencys sake to whine over his excruciating pangs to be in the way to answer a thousand impertinent inquiries after the health of a man thou wishedest to die to pray by him for so once thou wrotest to me to read by him to be forced to join in consultation with a crew of solemn and parading doctors and their officious zanies the apothecaries joined with the butcherly tribe of scarficators all combined to carry on the physical farce and to cut out thongs both from his flesh and his estate to have the superadded apprehension of dividing thy interest in what he shall leave with a crew of eagerhoping nevertobesatisfied relations legatees and the devil knows who of private gratifiers of passions laudable and illaudable in these circumstances i wonder not that thou lookest before servants as little grieved as thou after heirship as if thou indeed wert grieved and as if the most wryfacd woe had befallen thee then as i have often thought the reflection that must naturally arise from such mortifying objects as the death of one with whom we have been familiar must afford when we are obliged to attend it in its slow approaches and in its facetwisting pangs that it will one day be our own case goes a great way to credit the appearance of grief and that it is this seriously reflected upon may temporally give a fine air of sincerity to the wailings of lively widows heartexulting heirs and residuary legatees of all denominations since by keeping down the inward joy those interesting reflections must sadden the aspect and add an appearance of real concern to the assumed sables well but now thou art come to the reward of all thy watchings anxieties and close attendances tell me what it is tell me if it compensate thy trouble and answer thy hope as to myself thou seest by the gravity of my style how the subject has helped to mortify me but the necessity i am under of committing either speedy matrimony or a rape has saddened over my gayer prospects and more than the case itself contributed to make me sympathize with the present joyfulsorrow adieu jack i must be soon out of my pain and my clarissa shall be soon out of hers for so does the arduousness of the case require letter iii mr lovelace to john belford esq sunday morning i have had the honour of my charmers company for two complete hours we met before six in mrs moores garden a walk on the heath refused me the sedateness of her aspect and her kind compliance in this meeting gave me hopes and all that either the captain and i had urged yesterday to obtain a full and free pardon that reurged i and i told her besides that captain tomlinson was gone down with hopes to prevail upon her uncle harlowe to come up in person in order to present to me the greatest blessing that man ever received but the utmost i could obtain was that she would take no resolution in my favour till she received miss howes next letter i will not repeat the arguments i used but i will give thee the substance of what she said in answer to them she had considered of every thing she told me my whole conduct was before her the house i carried her to must be a vile house the people early showed what they were capable of in the earnest attempt made to fasten miss partington upon her as she doubted not with my approbation surely thought i she has not received a duplicate of miss howes letter of detection they heard her cries my insult was undoubtedly premeditated by my whole recollected behaviour to her previous to it it must be so i had the vilest of views no question and my treatment of her put it out of all doubt soul over all belford she seems sensible of liberties that my passion made me insensible of having taken or she could not so deeply resent she besought me to give over all thoughts of her sometimes she said she thought herself cruelly treated by her nearest and dearest relations at such times a spirit of repining and even of resentment took place and the reconciliation at other times so desirable was not then so much the favourite wish of her heart as was the scheme she had formerly planned of taking her good norton for her directress and guide and living upon her own estate in the manner her grandfather had intended she should live this scheme she doubted not that her cousin morden who was one of her trustees for that estate would enable her and that as she hoped without litigation to pursue and if he can and does what sir let me ask you said she have i seen in your conduct that should make me prefer to it an union of interest where there is such a disunion in minds so thou seest jack there is reason as well as resentment in the preference she makes against me thou seest that she presumes to think that she can be happy without me and that she must be unhappy with me i had besought her in the conclusion of my reurged arguments to write to miss howe before miss howes answer could come in order to lay before her the present state of things and if she would pay a deference to her judgment to let her have an opportunity to give it on the full knowledge of the case so i would mr lovelace was the answer if i were in doubt myself which i would prefer marriage or the scheme i have mentioned you cannot think sir but the latter must be my choice i wish to part with you with temper dont put me upon repeating part with me madam interrupted i i cannot bear those words but let me beseech you however to write to miss howe i hope if miss howe is not my enemy she is not the enemy of your person sir as you would be convinced if you saw her last letter to me but were she not an enemy to your actions she would not be my friend nor the friend of virtue why will you provoke from me mr lovelace the harshness of expression which however which however deserved by you i am unwilling just now to use having suffered enough in the two past days from my own vehemence the lady innocently means mr lovelaces forged one see vol v letter xxx i bit my lip for vexation and was silent miss howe proceeded she knows the full state of matters already sir the answer i expect from her respects myself not you her heart is too warm in the cause of friendship to leave me in suspense one moment longer than is necessary as to what i want to know nor does her answer absolutely depend upon herself she must see a person first and that person perhaps see others the cursed smugglerwoman jack miss howes townsend i doubt not plot contrivance intrigue stratagem undergroundmoles these women but let the earth cover me let me be a mole too thought i if they carry their point and if this lady escape me now she frankly owned that she had once thought of embarking out of all our ways for some one of our american colonies but now that she had been compelled to see me which had been her greatest dread and which she might be happiest in the resumption of her former favourite scheme if miss howe could find her a reputable and private asylum till her cousin morden could come but if he came not soon and if she had a difficulty to get to a place of refuge whether from her brother or from any body else meaning me i suppose she might yet perhaps go abroad for to say the truth she could not think of returning to her fathers house since her brothers rage her sisters upbraidings her fathers anger her mothers stillmoreaffecting sorrowings and her own consciousness under them all would be unsupportable to her o jack i am sick to death i pine i die for miss howes next letter i would bind gag strip rob and do any thing but murder to intercept it but determined as she seems to be it was evident to me nevertheless that she had still some tenderness for me she often wept as she talked and much oftener sighed she looked at me twice with an eye of undoubted gentleness and three times with an eye tending to compassion and softness but its benign rays were as often snatched back as i may say and her face averted as if her sweet eyes were not to be trusted and could not stand against my eager eyes seeking as they did for a lost heart in hers and endeavouring to penetrate to her very soul more than once i took her hand she struggled not much against the freedom i pressed it once with my lips she was not very angry a frown indeed but a frown that had more distress in it than indignation how came the dear soul clothed as it is with such a silken vesture by all its steadiness was it necessary that the active gloom of such a tyrant of a father should commix with such a passive sweetness of a willless mother to produce a constancy an equanimity a steadiness in the daughter which never woman before could boast of if so she is more obliged to that despotic father than i could have imagined a creature to be who gave distinction to every one related to her beyond what the crown itself can confer see vol i letters ix xiv and xix for what she herself says on that steadiness which mr lovelace though a deserved sufferer by it cannot help admiring i hoped i said that she would admit of the intended visit which i had so often mentioned of the two ladies she was here she had seen me she could not help herself at present she even had the highest regard for the ladies of my family because of their worthy characters there she turned away her sweet face and vanquished an halfrisen sigh i kneeled to her then it was upon a verdant cushion for we were upon the grass walk i caught her hand i besought her with an earnestness that called up as i could feel my heart to my eyes to make me by her forgiveness and example more worthy of them and of her own kind and generous wishes by my soul madam said i you stab me with your goodness your undeserved goodness and i cannot bear it why why thought i as i did several times in this conversation will she not generously forgive me why will she make it necessary for me to bring lady betty and my cousin to my assistance can the fortress expect the same advantageous capitulation which yields not to the summons of a resistless conqueror as if it gave not the trouble of bringing up and raising its heavy artillery against it what sensibilities said the divine creature withdrawing her hand must thou have suppressed what a dreadful what a judicial hardness of heart must thine be who canst be capable of such emotions as sometimes thou hast shown and of such sentiments as sometimes have flowed from thy lips yet canst have so far overcome them all as to be able to act as thou hast acted and that from settled purpose and premeditation and this as it is said throughout the whole of thy life from infancy to this time i told her that i had hoped from the generous concern she had expressed for me when i was so suddenly and dangerously taken ill the ipecacuanha experiment jack she interrupted me well have you rewarded me for the concern you speak of however i will frankly own now that i am determined to think no more of you that you might unsatisfied as i nevertheless was with you have made an interest she paused i besought her to proceed do you suppose sir and turned away her sweet face as we walked do you suppose that i had not thought of laying down a plan to govern myself by when i found myself so unhappily overreached and cheated as i may say out of myself when i found that i could not be and do what i wished to be and to do do you imagine that i had not cast about what was the next proper course to take and do you believe that this next course has not caused me some pain to be obliged to there again she stopt but let us break off discourse resumed she the subject grows too she sighed let us break off discourse i will go in i will prepare for church the devil thought i well as i can appear in those everydayworn clothes looking upon herself i will go to church she then turned from me to go into the house bless me my beloved creature bless me with the continuance of this affecting conversation remorse has seized my heart i have been excessively wrong give me farther cause to curse my heedless folly by the continuance of this calm but soulpenetrating conversation no no mr lovelace i have said too much impatience begins to break in upon me if you can excuse me to the ladies it will be better for my minds sake and for your credits sake that i do not see them call me to them overnice petulant prudish what you please call me to them nobody but miss howe to whom next to the almighty and my own mother i wish to stand acquitted of wilful error shall know the whole of what has passed be happy as you may deserve to be happy and happy you will be in your own reflection at least were you to be ever so unhappy in other respects for myself if i ever shall be enabled on due reflection to look back upon my own conduct without the great reproach of having wilfully and against the light of my own judgment erred i shall be more happy than if i had all that the world accounts desirable the noble creature proceeded for i could not speak this selfacquittal when spirits are lent me to dispel the darkness which at present too often overclouds my mind will i hope make me superior to all the calamities that can befal me her whole person was informed by her sentiments she seemed to be taller than before how the god within her exalted her not only above me but above herself divine creature as i thought her i called her i acknowledged the superiority of her mind and was proceeding but she interrupted me all human excellence said she is comparative only my mind i believe is indeed superior to yours debased as yours is by evil habits but i had not known it to be so if you had not taken pains to convince me of the inferiority of yours how great how sublimely great this creature by my soul i cannot forgive her for her virtues there is no bearing the consciousness of the infinite inferiority she charged me with but why will she break from me when good resolutions are taking place the redhot iron she refuses to strike o why will she suffer the yielding wax to harden we had gone but a few paces towards the house when we were met by the impertinent women with notice that breakfast was ready i could only with uplifted hands beseech her to give me hope of a renewed conversation after breakfast no she would go to church and into the house she went and up stairs directly nor would she oblige me with her company at the teatable i offered by mrs moore to quit both the table and the parlour rather than she should exclude herself or deprive the two widows of the favour of her company that was not all the matter she told mrs moore she had been struggling to keep down her temper it had cost her some pains to do it she was desirous to compose herself in hopes to receive benefit by the divine worship she was going to join in mrs moore hoped for her presence at dinner she had rather be excused yet if she could obtain the frame of mind she hoped for she might not be averse to show that she had got above those sensibilities which gave consideration to a man who deserved not to be to her what he had been this said no doubt to let mrs moore know that the gardenconversation had not been a reconciling one mrs moore seemed to wonder that we were not upon a better foot of understanding after so long a conference and the more as she believed that the lady had given in to the proposal for the repetition of the ceremony which i had told them was insisted upon by her uncle harlowe but i accounted for this by telling both widows that she was resolved to keep on the reserve till she heard from captain tomlinson whether her uncle would be present in person at the solemnity or would name that worthy gentleman for his proxy again i enjoined strict secresy as to this particular which was promised by the widows as well as for themselves as for miss rawlins of whose taciturnity they gave me such an account as showed me that she was secretkeepergeneral to all the women of fashion at hampstead the lord jack what a world of mischief at this rate must miss rawlins know what a pandoras box must her bosom be yet had i nothing that was more worthy of my attention to regard i would engage to open it and make my uses of the discovery and now belford thou perceivest that all my reliance is upon the mediation of lady betty and miss montague and upon the hope of intercepting miss howes next letter letter iv mr lovelace to john belford esq this fair inexorable is actually gone to church with mrs moore and mrs bevis but will closely attends her motions and i am in the way to receive any occasional intelligence from him she did not choose a mighty word with the sex as if they were always to have their own wills that i should wait upon her i did not much press it that she might not apprehend that i thought i had reason to doubt her voluntary return i once had it in my head to have found the widow bevis other employment and i believe she would have been as well pleased with my company as to go to church for she seemed irresolute when i told her that two out of a family were enough to go to church for one day but having her things on as the women call every thing and her aunt moore expecting her company she thought it best to go lest it should look oddly you know whispered she to one who was above regarding how it looked so here am i in my diningroom and have nothing to do but to write till they return and what will be my subject thinkest thou why the old beaten one to be sure selfdebate through temporary remorse for the blow being not struck her guardian angel is redoubling his efforts to save her if it be not that and yet what power should her guardian angel have over me i dont know what it is that gives a check to my revenge whenever i meditate treason against so sovereign a virtue conscience is dead and gone as i told thee so it cannot be that a young conscience growing up like the phoenix from the ashes of the old one it cannot be surely but if it were it would be hard if i could not overlay a young conscience well then it must be love i fancy love itself inspiring love of an object so adorable some little attention possibly paid likewise to thy whining arguments in her favour let love then be allowed to be the moving principle and the rather as love naturally makes the lover loth to disoblige the object of its flame and knowing that to an offence of the meditated kind will be a mortal offence to her cannot bear that i should think of giving it let love and me talk together a little on this subject be it a young conscience or love or thyself jack thou seest that i am for giving every whiffler audience but this must be the last debate on this subject for is not her fate in a manner at its crisis and must not my next step be an irretrievable one tend it which way it will and now the debate is over a thousand charming things for love is gentler than conscience has this little urchin suggested in her favour he pretended to know both our hearts and he would have it that though my love was a prodigious strong and potent love and though it has the merit of many months faithful service to plead and has had infinite difficulties to struggle with yet that it is not the right sort of love right sort of love a puppy but with due regard to your deityship said i what merits has she with you that you should be of her party is hers i pray you a right sort of love is it love at all she dont pretend that it is she owns not your sovereignty what a d l i moves you to plead thus earnestly for a rebel who despises your power and then he came with his ifs and ands and it would have been and still as he believed would be love and a love of the exalted kind if i would encourage it by the right sort of love he talked of and in justification of his opinion pleaded her own confessions as well those of yesterday as of this morning and even went so far back as to my ipecacuanha illness i never talked so familiarly with his godship before thou mayest think therefore that his dialect sounded oddly in my ears and then he told me how often i had thrown cold water upon the most charming flame that ever warmed a ladys bosom while but young and rising i required a definition of this right sort of love he tried at it but made a sorry hand of it nor could i for the soul of me be convinced that what he meant to extol was love upon the whole we had a noble controversy upon this subject in which he insisted upon the unprecedented merit of the lady nevertheless i got the better of him for he was struck absolutely dumb when waving her present perverseness which yet was a sufficient answer to all his pleas i asserted and offered to prove it by a thousand instances impromptu that love was not governed by merit nor could be under the dominion of prudence or any other reasoning power and if the lady were capable of love it was of such a sort as he had nothing to do with and which never before reigned in a female heart i asked him what he thought of her flight from me at a time when i was more than half overcome by the right sort of love he talked of and then i showed him the letter she wrote and left behind her for me with an intention no doubt absolutely to break my heart or to provoke me to hang drown or shoot myself to say nothing of a multitude of declarations from her defying his power and imputing all that looked like love in her behaviour to me to the persecution and rejection of her friends which made her think of me but as a last resort love then gave her up the letter he said deserved neither pardon nor excuse he did not think he had been pleading for such a declared rebel and as to the rest he should be a betrayer of the rights of his own sovereignty if what i had alleged were true and he were still to plead for her i swore to the truth of all and truly i swore which perhaps i do not always do and now what thinkest thou must become of the lady whom love itself gives up and conscience cannot plead for letter v mr lovelace to john belford esq sunday afternoon o belford what a hairsbreadth escape have i had such a one that i tremble between terror and joy at the thought of what might have happened and did not what a perverse girl is this to contend with her fate yet has reason to think that her very stars fight against her i am the luckiest of me but my breath almost fails me when i reflect upon what a slender thread my destiny hung but not to keep thee in suspense i have within this halfhour obtained possession of the expected letter from miss howe and by such an accident but here with the former i dispatch this thy messenger waiting letter vi mr lovelace in continuation thus it

to rejoice that she did see letter iii of this volume my worthy friend mrs bevis thought one sermon a day well observed enough so staid at home to bear me company the lady and mrs moore had not been

wait for an answer fellow no i cannot say as that i was but i was bidden to observe how you looked and how you was and if you did write a line or two to take care of it and give it only to our young landlady in secret widow you see i look strangely not so well as i used to do fellow nay i dont know that i ever saw you but once before and that was at a stile where i met you and my young landlady but knew better than to stare a gentlewoman in the face especially at a stile widow will you eat or drink friend fellow a cup of small ale i dont care if i do widow margaret take the young man down and treat him with what the house affords fellow your servant madam but i staid to eat as i come along just upon the heath yonder or else to say the truth i had been here sooner thank my stars thought i thou didst a piece of powdered beef was upon the table at the sign of the castle where i stopt to inquire for this house and so thoff i only intended to wet my whistle i could not help eating so shall only taste of your ale for the beef was woundily corned prating dog pox on thee thought i he withdrew bowing and scraping margaret whispered i in a female voice whispering out of the closet and holding the parlourdoor in my hand get him out of the house as fast as you can lest they come from church and catch him here peggy never fear sir the fellow went down and it seems drank a large draught of ale and margaret finding him very talkative told him she begged his pardon but she had a sweetheart just come from sea whom she was forced to hide in the pantry so was sure he would excuse her from staying with him ay ay to be sure the clown said for if he could not make sport he would spoil none but he whispered her that one squire lovelace was a damnation rogue if the truth might be told for what said margaret and could have given him she told the widow who related to me all this a good dowse of the chaps for kissing all the women he came near at the same time the dog wrapped himself round margery and gave her a smack that she told mrs bevis afterwards she might have heard into the parlour such jack is human nature thus does it operate in all degrees and so does the clown as well as his practises yet this sly dog knew not but the wench had a sweetheart locked up in the pantry if the truth were known some of the ruddyfaced dairy wenches might perhaps call him a damnation rogue as justly as their betters of the same sex might squire lovelace the fellow told the maid that by what he discovered of the young ladys face it looked very rosy to what he took it to be and he thought her a good deal fatter as she lay and not so tall all women are born to intrigue jack and practise it more or less as fathers guardians governesses from dear experience can tell and in love affairs are naturally expert and quicker in their wits by half than men this ready though raw wench gave an instance of this and improved on the dropsical hint i had given her the ladys seeming plumpness was owing to a dropsical disorder and to the round posture she lay in very likely truly her appearing to him to be shorter he might have observed was owing to her drawing her feet up from pain and because the couch was too short she supposed adso he did not think of that her rosy colour was owing to her grief and headache ay that might very well be but he was highly pleased that he had given the letter into mrs harriots own hand as he should tell miss howe he desired once more to see the lady at his going away and would not be denied the widow therefore sat up with her handkerchief over her face leaning her head against the wainscot he asked if she had any partiklar message no she was so ill she could not write which was a great grief to her should he call the next day for he was going to london now he was so near and should stay at a cousins that night who lived in a street called fetterlane no she would write as soon as able and send by the post well then if she had nothing to send by him mayhap he might stay in town a day or two for he had never seen the lions in the tower nor bedlam nor the tombs and he would make a holiday or two as he had leave to do if she had no business or message that required his posting down next day she had not she offered him the halfguinea i had given her for him but he refused it with great professions of disinterestedness and love as he called it to miss howe to serve whom he would ride to the worldsend or even to jericho and so the shocking rascal went away and glad at my heart was i when he was gone for i feared nothing so much as that he would have staid till they came from church thus jack got i my hearts ease the letter of miss howe ad through such a train of accidents as makes me say that the ladys stars fight against her but yet i must attribute a good deal to my own precaution in having taken right measures for had i not secured the widow by my stories and the maid by my servant all would have signified nothing and so heartily were they secured the one by a single guinea the other by half a dozen warm kisses and the aversion they both had to such wicked creatures as delighted in making mischief between man and wife that they promised that neither mrs moore miss rawlins mrs lovelace nor any body living should know any thing of the matter the widow rejoiced that i had got the mischiefmakers letter i excused myself to her and instantly withdrew with it and after i had read it fell to my shorthand to acquaint thee with my good luck and they not returning so soon as church was done stepping as it proved into miss rawlinss and tarrying there awhile to bring that busy girl with them to drink tea i wrote thus far to thee that thou mightest when thou camest to this place rejoice with me upon the occasion they are all three just come in i hasten to them letter vii mr lovelace to john belford esq i have begun another letter to thee in continuation of my narrative but i believe i shall send thee this before i shall finish that by the enclosed thou wilt see that neither of the correspondents deserve mercy from me and i am resolved to make the ending with one the beginning with the other if thou sayest that the provocations i have given to one of them will justify her freedoms i answer so they will to any other person but myself but he that is capable of giving those provocations and has the power to punish those who abuse him for giving them will show his resentment and the more remorselessly perhaps as he has deserved the freedoms if thou sayest it is however wrong to do so i reply that it is nevertheless human nature and wouldst thou not have me to be a man jack here read the letter if thou wilt but thou art not my friend if thou offerest to plead for either of the saucy creatures after thou hast read it to mrs harriot lucas at mrs moores at hampstead june after the discoveries i had made of the villanous machinations of the most abandoned of men particularized in my long letter of wednesday last you will believe my dearest friend that my surprise upon perusing yours of thursday evening from hampstead was not so great as my indignation had the villain attempted to fire a city instead of a house i should not have wondered at it all that i am amazed at is that he whose boast as i am told it is that no woman shall keep him out of her bedchamber when he has made a resolution to be in it did not discover his foot before and it is as strange to me that having got you at such a shocking advantage and in such a horrid house you could at the time escape dishonour and afterwards get from such a set of infernals see vol v letter xx ibid see letter xxi i gave you in my long letter of wednesday and thursday last reasons why you ought to mistrust that specious tomlinson that man my dear must be a solemn villain may lightning from heaven blast the wretch who has set him and the rest of his remorseless gang at work to endeavour to destroy the most consummate virtue heaven be praised you have escaped from all their snares and now are out of danger so i will not trouble you at present with the particulars i have further collected relating to this abominable imposture for the same reason i forbear to communicate to you some new stories of the abhorred wretch himself which have come to my ears one in particular of so shocking a nature indeed my dear the mans a devil the whole story of mrs fretchville and her house i have no doubt to pronounce likewise an absolute fiction fellow how my soul spurns the villain your thought of going abroad and your reasons for so doing most sensibly affect me but be comforted my dear i hope you will not be under a necessity of quitting your native country were i sure that that must be the cruel case i would abandon all my better prospects and soon be with you and i would accompany you whithersoever you went and share fortunes with you for it is impossible that i should be happy if i knew that you were exposed not only to the perils of the sea but to the attempts of other vile men your personal graces attracting every eye and exposing you to those hourly dangers which others less distinguished by the gifts of nature might avoid all that i know that beauty so greatly coveted and so greatly admired is good for o my dear were i ever to marry and to be the mother of a clarissa clarissa must be the name if promisingly lovely how often would my heart ache for the dear creature as she grew up when i reflected that a prudence and discretion unexampled in woman had not in you been a sufficient protection to that beauty which had drawn after it as many admirers as beholders how little should i regret the attacks of that cruel distemper as it is called which frequently makes the greatest ravages in the finest faces sat afternoon i have just parted with mrs townsend i thought you had once seen her with me but she says she never had the honour to be personally known to you she has a manlike spirit she knows the world and her two brothers being in town she is sure she can engage them in so good a cause and if there should be occasion both their ships crews in your service for the account of mrs townsend c see vol iv letter xlii give your consent my dear and the horrid villain shall be repaid with broken bones at least for all his vileness the misfortune is mrs townsend cannot be with you till thursday next or wednesday at soonest are you sure you can be safe where you are till then i think you are too near london and perhaps you had better be in it if you remove let me the very moment know whither how my heart is torn to think of the necessity so dear a creature is driven to of hiding herself devilish fellow he must have been sportive and wanton in his inventions yet that cruel that savage sportiveness has saved you from the sudden violence to which he has had recourse in the violation of others of names and families not contemptible for such the villain always gloried to spread his snares the vileness of this specious monster has done more than any other consideration could do to bring mr hickman into credit with me mr hickman alone knows from me of your flight and the reason of it had i not given him the reason he might have thought still worse of the vile attempt i communicated it to him by showing him your letter from hampstead when he had read it and he trembled and reddened as he read he threw himself at my feet and besought me to permit him to attend you and to give you the protection of his house the goodnatured man had tears in his eyes and was repeatedly earnest on this subject proposing to take his chariotandfour or a set and in person in the face of all the world give himself the glory of protecting such an oppressed innocent i could not but be pleased with him and i let him know that i was i hardly expected so much spirit from him but a mans passiveness to a beloved object of our sex may not perhaps argue want of courage on proper occasions i thought i ought in return to have some consideration for his safety as such an open step would draw upon him the vengeance of the most villanous enterpriser in the world who has always a gang of fellows such as himself at his call ready to support one another in the vilest outrages but yet as mr hickman might have strengthened his hands by legal recourses i should not have stood upon it had i not known your delicacy since such a step must have made a great noise and given occasion for scandal as if some advantage had been gained over you and were there not the greatest probability that all might be more silently and more effectually managed by mrs townsends means mrs townsend will in person attend you she hopes on wednesday her brothers and some of their people will scatteringly and as if they knew nothing of you so we have contrived see you safe not only to london but to her house at deptford she has a kinswoman who will take your commands there if she herself be obliged to leave you and there you may stay till the wretchs fury on losing you and his search are over he will very soon tis likely enter upon some new villany which may engross him and it may be given out that you are gone to lay claim to the protection of your cousin morden at florence possibly if he can be made to believe it he will go over in hopes to find you there after a while i can procure you a lodging in one of our neighbouring villages where i may have the happiness to be your daily visiter and if this hickman be not silly and apish and if my mother do not do unaccountable things i may the sooner think of marrying that i may without controul receive and entertain the darling of my heart many very many happy days do i hope we shall yet see together and as this is my hope i expect that it will be your consolation as to your estate since you are resolved not to litigate for it we will be patient either till colonel morden arrives or till shame compels some people to be just upon the whole i cannot but think your prospects now much happier than they could have been had you been actually married to such a man as this i must therefore congratulate you upon your escape not only from a horrid libertine but from so vile a husband as he must have made to any woman but more especially to a person of your virtue and delicacy you hate him heartily hate him i hope my dear i am sure you do it would be strange if so much purity of life and manners were not to abhor what is so repugnant to itself in your letter before me you mention one written to me for a feint i have not received any such depend upon it therefore that he must have it and if he has it is a wonder that he did not likewise get my long one of the th heaven be praised that he did not and that it came safe to your hands see vol v letters xxi and xxii i send this by a young fellow whose father is one of our tenants with command to deliver it to no other hands but yours he is to return directly if you give him any letter if not he will proceed to london upon his own pleasures he is a simple fellow but very honest so you may say anything to him if you write not by him i desire a line or two as soon as possible my mother knows nothing of his going to you nor yet of your abandoning the fellow forgive me but he is not entitled to good manners i shall long to hear how you and mrs townsend order matters i wish she could have been with you sooner but i have lost no time in engaging her as you will suppose i refer to her what i have further to say and advise so shall conclude with my prayers that heaven will direct and protect my dearest creature and make your future days happy anna howe and now jack i will suppose that thou hast read this cursed letter allow me to make a few observations upon some of its contents it is strange to miss howe that having got her friend at such a shocking advantage c and it is strange to me too if ever i have such another opportunity given to me the cause of both our wonder i believe will cease so thou seest tomlinson is further detected no such person as mrs fretchville may lightning from heaven o lord o lord o lord what a horrid vixen is this my gang my remorseless gang too is brought in and thou wilt plead for these girls again wilt thou heaven be praised she says that her friend is out of danger miss howe should be sure of that and that she herself is safe but for this termagant as i often said i must surely have made a better hand of it new stories of me jack what can they be i have not found that my generosity to my rosebud ever did me due credit with this pair of friends very hard belford that credits cannot be set against debits and a balance struck in a rakes favour as well as in that of every common man but he from whom no good is expected is not allowed the merit of the good he does i ought to have been a little more attentive to character than i have been for notwithstanding that the measures of right and wrong are said to be so manifest let me tell thee that character biases and runs away with all mankind let a man or woman once establish themselves in the worlds opinion and all that either of them do will be sanctified nay in the very courts of justice does not character acquit or condemn as often as facts and sometimes even in spite of facts yet impolitic that i have been and am to be so careless of mine and now i doubt it is irretrievable but to leave moralizing thou jack knowest almost all my enterprises worth remembering can this particular story which this girl hints at be that of lucy villars or can she have heard of my intrigue with the pretty gipsey who met me in norwood and of the trap i caught her cruel husband in a fellow as gloomy and tyrannical as old harlowe when he pursued a wife who would not have deserved ill of him if he had deserved well of her but he was not quite drowned the man is alive at this day and miss howe mentions the story as a very shocking one besides both these are a twelvemonth old or more but evil fame and scandal are always new when the offender has forgot a vile fact it is often told to one and to another who having never heard of it before trumpet it about as a novelty to others but well said the honest corregidor at madrid a saying with which i encroached lord ms collection good actions are remembered but for a day bad ones for many years after the life of the guilty such is the relish that the world has for scandal in other words such is the desire which every one has to exculpate himself by blackening his neighbour you and i belford have been very kind to the world in furnishing it with opportunities to gratify its devil miss howe will abandon her own better prospects and share fortunes with her were she to go abroad charming romancer i must set about this girl jack i have always had hopes of a woman whose passions carry her to such altitudes had i attacked miss howe first her passions inflamed and guided as i could have managed them would have brought her into my lure in a fortnight but thinkest thou and yet i think thou dost that there is any thing in these high flights among the sex verily jack these vehement friendships are nothing but chaff and stubble liable to be blown away by the very wind that raises them apes mere apes of us they think the word friendship has a pretty sound with it and it is much talked of a fashionable word and so truly a single woman who thinks she has a soul and knows that she wants something would be thought to have found a fellowsoul for it in her own sex but i repeat that the word is a mere word the thing a mere name with them a corkbottomed shuttlecock which they are fond of striking to and fro to make one another glow in the frosty weather of a singlestate but which when a man comes in between the pretended inseparables is given up like their music and other maidenly amusements which nevertheless may be necessary to keep the pretty rogues out of active mischief they then in short having caught the fish lay aside the net he alludes here to the story of a pope who once a poor fisherman through every preferment he rose to even to that of the cardinalate hung up in view of all his guests his net as a token of humility but when he arrived at the pontificate he took it down saying that there was no need of the net when he had caught the fish thou hast a mind perhaps to make an exception for these two ladies with all my heart my clarissa has if woman has a soul capable of friendship her flame is bright and steady but miss howes were it not kept up by her mothers opposition is too vehement to endure how often have i known opposition not only cement friendship but create love i doubt not but poor hickman would fare the better with this vixen if her mother were as heartily against him as she is for him thus much indeed as to these two ladies i will grant thee that the active spirit of the one and the meek disposition of the other may make their friendship more durable than it would otherwise be for this is certain that in every friendship whether male or female there must be a man and a woman spirit that is to say one of them must be a forbearing one to make it permanent but this i pronounce as a truth which all experience confirms that friendship between women never holds to the sacrifice of capital gratifications or to the endangering of life limb or estate as it often does in our nobler sex well but next comes an indictment against poor beauty what has beauty done that miss howe should be offended at it miss howe jack is a charming girl she has no reason to quarrel with beauty didst ever see her too much fire and spirit in her eye indeed for a girl but thats no fault with a man that can lower that fire and spirit at pleasure and i know i am the man that can for my own part when i was first introduced to this lady which was by my goddess when she herself was a visiter at mrs howes i had not been half an hour with her but i even hungered and thirsted after a romping bout with the lively rogue and in the second or third visit was more deterred by the delicacy of her friend than by what i apprehended from her own this charming creatures presence thought i awes us both and i wished her absence though any other woman were present that i might try the differences in miss howes behaviour before her friends face or behind her back delicate women make delicate women as well as decent men with all miss howes fire and spirit it was easy to see by her very eye that she watched for lessons and feared reproof from the penetrating eye of her milder dispositioned friend and yet it was as easy to observe in the candour and sweet manners of the other that the fear which miss howe stood in of her was more owing to her own generous apprehension that she fell short of her excellencies than to miss harlowes consciousness of excellence over her i have often since i came at miss howes letters revolved this just and fine praise contained in one of them every one saw that the preference they gave you to themselves exalted you not into any visible triumph over them for you had always something to say on every point you carried that raised the yielding heart and left every one pleased and satisfied with themselves though they carried not off the palm miss howe in vol iii letter xix says that she was always more afraid of clarissa than of her mother and in vol iii letter xliv that she fears her almost as much as she loves her and in many other places in her letters verifies this observation of lovelace see vol iv letter xxxi as i propose in a more advanced life to endeavour to atone for my useful freedoms with individuals of the sex by giving cautions and instructions to the whole i have made a memorandum to enlarge upon this doctrine to wit that it is full as necessary to direct daughters in the choice of their female companions as it is to guard them against the designs of men i say not this however to the disparagement of miss howe she has from pride what her friend has from principle the lord help the sex if they had not pride but yet i am confident that miss howe is indebted to the conversation and correspondence of miss harlowe for her highest improvements but both these ladies out of the question i make no scruple to aver and i jack should know something of the matter that there have been more girls ruined at least prepared for ruin by their own sex taking in servants as well as companions than directly by the attempts and delusions of men but it is time enough when i am old and joyless to enlarge upon this topic as to the comparison between the two ladies i will expatiate more on that subject for i like it when i have had them both which this letter of the vixen girls i hope thou wilt allow warrants me to try for i return to the consideration of a few more of its contents to justify my vengeances so nearly now in view as to mrs townsend her manlike spirit her two brothers and the ships crews i say nothing but this to the insolent threatening let em come but as to her sordid menace to repay the horrid villain as she calls me for all my vileness by broken bones broken bones belford who can bear this porterly threatening broken bones jack d n the little vulgar give me a name for her but i banish all furious resentment if i get these two girls into my power heaven forbid that i should be a second phalaris who turned his bull upon the artist no bones of theirs will i break they shall come off with me upon much lighter terms but these fellows are smugglers it seems and am not i a smuggler too i am and have not the least doubt but i shall have secured my goods before thursday or wednesday either but did i want a plot what a charming new one does this letter of miss howe strike me out i am almost sorry that i have fixed upon one for here how easy would it be for me to assemble a crew of swabbers and to create a mrs townsend whose person thou seest my beloved knows not to come on tuesday at miss howes repeated solicitations in order to carry my beloved to a warehouse of my own providing this however is my triumphant hope that at the very time that these ragamuffins will be at hampstead looking for us my dear miss harlowe and i so the fates i imagine have ordained shall be fast asleep in each others arms in town lie still villain till the time comes my heart jack my heart it is always thumping away on the remotest prospects of this nature but it seems that the vileness of this specious monster meaning me jack has brought hickman into credit with her so i have done some good but to whom i cannot tell for this poor fellow should i permit him to have this termagant will be punished as many times we all are by the enjoyment of his own wishes nor can she be happy as i take it with him were he to govern himself by her will and have none of his own since never was there a directing wife who knew where to stop power makes such a one wanton she despises the man she can govern like alexander who wept that he had no more worlds to conquer she will be looking out for new exercises for her power till she grow uneasy to herself a discredit to her husband and a plague to all about her but this honest fellow it seems with tears in his eyes and with humble prostration besought the vixen to permit him to set out in his chariotandfour in order to give himself the glory of protecting such an oppressed innocent in the face of the whole world nay he reddened it seems and trembled too as he read the fair complainants letter how valiant is all this women love brave men and no wonder that his tears his trembling and his prostration gave him high reputation with the meek miss howe but dost think jack that i in the like case and equally affected with the distress should have acted thus dost think that i should not first have rescued the lady and then if needful have asked excuse for it the lady in my hand wouldst not thou have done thus as well as i but tis best as it is honest hickman may now sleep in a whole skin and yet that is more perhaps than he would have done the ladys deliverance unattempted had i come at this requested permission of his any other way than by a letter that it must not be known that i have intercepted miss howe thinks i may be diverted from pursuing my charmer by some newstarted villany villany is a word that she is extremely fond of but i can tell her that it is impossible i should till the end of this villany be obtained difficulty is a stimulus with such a spirit as mine i thought miss howe knew me better were she to offer herself person for person in the romancing zeal of her friendship to save her friend it should not do while the dear creature is on this side the moon she thanks heaven that her friend has received her letter of the th we are all glad of it she ought to thank me too but i will not at present claim her thanks but when she rejoices that the letter went safe does she not in effect call out for vengeance and expect it all in good time miss howe when settest thou out for the isle of wight love i will close at this time with desiring thee to make a list of the virulent terms with which the enclosed letter abounds and then if thou supposest that i have made such another and have added to it all the flowers of the same blow in the former letters of the same saucy creature and those in that of miss harlowe which she left for me on her elopement thou wilt certainly think that i have provocations sufficient to justify me in all that i shall do to either return the enclosed the moment thou hast perused it letter viii mr lovelace to john belford esq sunday night monday morning i went down with revenge in my heart the contents of miss howes letter almost engrossing me the moment that miss harlowe and mrs moore accompanied by miss rawlins came in but in my countenance all the gentle the placid the serene that the glass could teach and in my behaviour all the polite that such an unpolite creature as she has often told me i am could put on miss rawlins was sent for home almost as soon as she came in to entertain an unexpected visiter to her great regret as well as to the disappointment of my fairone as i could perceive from the looks of both for they had agreed it seems if i went to town as i said i intended to do to take a walk upon the heath at least in mrs moores garden and who knows what might have been the issue had the spirit of curiosity in the one met with the spirit of communication in the other miss rawlins promised to return if possible but sent to excuse herself her visiter intending to stay with her all night i rejoiced in my heart at her message and after much supplication obtained the favour of my beloveds company for another walk in the garden having as i told her abundance of things to say to propose and to be informed of in order ultimately to govern myself in my future steps she had vouchsafed i should have told thee with eyes turned from me and in a halfaside attitude to sip two dishes of tea in my company dear soul how anger unpolishes the most polite for i never saw miss harlowe behave so awkwardly i imagined she knew not how to be awkward when we were in the garden i poured my whole soul into her attentive ear and besought her returning favour she told me that she had formed her scheme for her future life that vile as the treatment was which she had received from me that was not all the reason she had for rejecting my suit but that on the maturest deliberation she was convinced that she could neither be happy with me nor make me happy and she injoined me for both our sakes to think no more of her the captain i told her was rid down post in a manner to forward my wishes with her uncle lady betty and miss montague were undoubtedly arrived in town by this time i would set out early in the morning to attend them they adored her they longed to see her they would see her they would not be denied her company in oxfordshire whither could she better go to be free from her brothers insults whither to be absolutely made unapprehensive of any body else might i have any hopes of her returning favour if miss howe could be prevailed upon to intercede for me miss howe prevailed upon to intercede for you repeated she with a scornful bridle but a very pretty one and there she stopt i repeated the concern it would be to me to be under a necessity of mentioning the misunderstanding to lady betty and my cousin as a misunderstanding still to be made up and as if i were of very little consequence to a dear creature who was of so much to me urging that these circumstances would extremely lower me not only in my own opinion but in that of my relations but still she referred to miss howes next letter and all the concession i could bring her to in this whole conference was that she would wait the arrival and visit of the two ladies if they came in a day or two or before she received the expected letter from miss howe thank heaven for this thought i and now may i go to town with hopes at my return to find thee dearest where i shall leave thee but yet as she may find reasons to change her mind in my absence i shall not entirely trust to this my fellow therefore who is in the house and who by mrs beviss kind intelligence will know every step she can take shall have andrew and a horse ready to give me immediate notice of her motions and moreover go whither she will he shall be one of her retinue though unknown to herself if possible this was all i could make of the fair inexorable should i be glad of it or sorry for it glad i believe and yet my pride is confoundedly abated to think that i had so little hold in the affections of this daughter of the harlowes dont tell me that virtue and principle are her guides on this occasion tis pride a greater pride than my own that governs her love she has none thou seest nor ever had at least not in a superior degree love that deserves the name never was under the dominion of prudence or of any reasoning power she cannot bear to be thought a woman i warrant and if in the last attempt i find her not one what will she be the worse for the trial no one is to blame for suffering an evil he cannot shun or avoid were a general to be overpowered and robbed by a highwayman would he be less fit for the command of an army on that account if indeed the general pretending great valour and having boasted that he never would be robbed were to make but faint resistance when he was brought to the test and to yield his purse when he was master of his own sword then indeed will the highwayman who robs him be thought the braver man but from these last conferences am i furnished with one argument in defence of my favourite purpose which i never yet pleaded o jack what a difficulty must a man be allowed to have to conquer a predominant passion be it what it will when the gratifying of it is in his power however wrong he knows it to be to resolve to gratify it reflect upon this and then wilt thou be able to account for if not to excuse a projected crime which has habit to plead for it in a breast as stormy as uncontroulable this that follows is my new argument should she fail in the trial should i succeed and should she refuse to go on with me and even resolve not to marry me of which i can have no notion and should she disdain to be obliged to me for the handsome provision i should be proud to make for her even to the half of my estate yet cannot she be altogether unhappy is she not entitled to an independent fortune will not col morden as her trustee put her in possession of it and did she not in our former conference point out the way of life that she always preferred to the married life to wit to take her good norton for her directress and guide and to live upon her own estate in the manner her grandfather desired she should live see letter iii of this volume it is moreover to be considered that she cannot according to her own notions recover above one half of her fame were we not to intermarry so much does she think she has suffered by her going off with me and will she not be always repining and mourning for the loss of the other half and if she must live a life of such uneasiness and regret for half may she not as well repine and mourn for the whole nor let me tell thee will her own scheme or penitence in this case be half so perfect if she do not fall as if she does for what a foolish penitent will she make who has nothing to repent of she piques herself thou knowest and makes it matter of reproach to me that she went not off with me by her own consent but was tricked out of herself nor upbraid thou me upon the meditated breach of vows so repeatedly made she will not thou seest permit me to fulfil them and if she would this i have to say that at the time i made the most solemn of them i was fully determined to keep them but what prince thinks himself obliged any longer to observe the articles of treaties the most sacredly sworn to than suits with his interest or inclination although the consequence of the infraction must be as he knows the destruction of thousands is not this then the result of all that miss clarissa harlowe if it be not her own fault may be as virtuous after she has lost her honour as it is called as she was before she may be a more eminent example to her sex and if she yield a little yield in the trial may be a completer penitent nor can she but by her own wilfulness be reduced to low fortunes and thus may her old nurse and she an old coachman and a pair of old coachhorses and two or three old maidservants and perhaps a very old footman or two for every thing will be old and penitential about her live very comfortably together reading old sermons and old prayerbooks and relieving old men and old women and giving old lessons and old warnings upon new subjects as well as old ones to the young ladies of her neighbourhood and so pass on to a good old age doing a great deal of good both by precept and example in her generation and is a woman who can live thus prettily without controul who ever did prefer and who still prefers the single to the married life and who will be enabled to do every thing that the plan she had formed will direct her to do to be said to be ruined undone and such sort of stuff i have no patience with the pretty fools who use those strong words to describe a transitory evil an evil which a mere churchform makes none at this rate of romancing how many flourishing ruins dost thou as well as i know let us but look about us and we shall see some of the haughtiest and most censorious spirits among out acquaintance of that sex now passing for chaste wives of whom strange stories might be told and others whose husbands hearts have been made to ache for their gaieties both before and after marriage and yet know not half so much of them as some of us honest fellows could tell them but having thus satisfied myself in relation to the worst that can happen to this charming creature and that it will be her own fault if she be unhappy i have not at all reflected upon what is likely to be my own lot this has always been my notion though miss howe grudges us rakes the best of the sex and says that the worst is too good for us that the wife of a libertine ought to be pure spotless uncontaminated to what purpose has such a one lived a free life but to know the world and to make his advantages of it and to be very serious it would be a misfortune to the public for two persons heads of a family to be both bad since between two such a race of varlets might be propagated lovelaces and belfords if thou wilt who might do great mischief in the world thou seest at bottom that i am not an abandoned fellow and that there is a mixture of gravity in me this as i grow older may increase and when my active capacity begins to abate i may sit down with the preacher and resolve all my past life into vanity and vexation of spirit this is certain that i shall never find a woman so well suited to my taste as miss clarissa harlowe i only wish that i may have such a lady as her to comfort and adorn my setting sun i have often thought it very unhappy for us both that so excellent a creature sprang up a little too late for my setting out and a little too early in my progress before i can think of returning and yet as i have picked up the sweet traveller in my way i cannot help wishing that she would bear me company in the rest of my journey although she were stepping out of her own path to oblige me and then perhaps we could put up in the evening at the same inn and be very happy in each others conversation recounting the difficulties and dangers we had passed in our way to it i imagine that thou wilt be apt to suspect that some passages in this letter were written in town why jack i cannot but say that the westminster air is a little grosser than that at hampstead and the conversation of mrs sinclair and the nymphs less innocent than mrs moores and miss rawlinss and i think in my heart i can say and write those things at one place which i cannot at the other nor indeed any where else i came to town about seven this morning all necessary directions and precautions remembered to be given i besought the favour of an audience before i set out i was desirous to see which of her lovely faces she was pleased to put on after another night had passed but she was resolved i found to leave our quarrel open she would not give me an opportunity so much as to entreat her again to close it before the arrival of lady betty and my cousin i had notice from my proctor by a few lines brought by a man and horse just before i set out that all difficulties had been for two days past surmounted and that i might have the license for fetching i sent up the letter to my beloved by mrs bevis with a repeated request for admittance to her presence upon it but neither did this stand me in stead i suppose she thought it would be allowing of the consequences that were naturally to be expected to follow the obtaining of this instrument if she had consented to see me on the contents of this letter having refused me that honour before i sent it up to her no surprising her no advantage to be taken of her inattention to the nicest circumstances and now belford i set out upon business letter ix mr lovelace to john belford esq monday june durst ever see a license jack edmund by divine permission lord bishop of london to our wellbeloved in christ robert lovelace your servant my good lord what have i done to merit so much goodness who never saw your lordship in my life of the parish of st martins in the fields bachelor and clarissa harlowe of the same parish spinster sendeth greeting whereas ye are as is alleged determined to enter into the holy state of matrimony this is only alleged thou observest by and with the consent of c c c and are very desirous of obtaining your marriage to be solemnized in the face of the church we are willing that your honest desires honest desires jack may more speedily have their due effect and therefore that ye may be able to procure such marriage to be freely and lawfully solemnized in the parish church of st martins in the fields or st giless in the fields in the county of middlesex by the rector vicar or curate thereof at any time of the year at any time of the year jack without publication of bans provided that by reason of any precontract i verily think that i have had three or four precontracts in my time but the good girls have not claimed upon them of a long while consanguinity affinity or any other lawful cause whatsoever there be no lawful impediment on this behalf and that there be not at this time any action suit plaint quarrel or demand moved or depending before any judge ecclesiastical or temporal for or concerning any marriage contracted by or with either of you and that the said marriage be openly solemnized in the church abovementioned between the hours of eight and twelve in the forenoon and without prejudice to the minister of the place where the said woman is a parishioner we do hereby for good causes it cost me let me see jack what did it cost me give and grant our license as well to you as to the parties contracting as to the rector vicar or curate of the said church where the said marriage is intended to be solemnized to solemnize the same in manner and form above specified according to the rites and ceremonies prescribed in the book of common prayer in that behalf published by authority of parliament provided always that if hereafter any fraud shall appear to have been committed at the time of granting this license either by false suggestions or concealment of the truth now this belford is a little hard upon us for i cannot say that every one of our suggestions is literally true so in good conscience i ought not to marry under this license the license shall be void to all intents and purposes as if the same had not been granted and in that case we do inhibit all ministers whatsoever if any thing of the premises shall come to their knowledge from proceeding to the celebration of the said marriage without first consulting us or our vicargeneral given c then follow the registers name and a large pendent seal with these words round it seal of the vicargeneral and official principal of the diocese of london a good whimsical instrument take it altogether but what thinkest thou are the arms to this matrimonial harbinger why in the first place two crossed swords to show that marriage is a state of offence as well as defence three lions to denote that those who enter into the state ought to have a triple proportion of courage and couldst thou have imagined that these priestly fellows in so solemn a case would cut their jokes upon poor souls who came to have their honest desires put in a way to be gratified there are three crooked horns smartly topknotted with ribands which being the ladies wear seem to indicate that they may very probably adorn as well as bestow the bulls feather to describe it according to heraldry art if i am not mistaken gules two swords saltirewise or second coat a chevron sable between three buglehorns or so it ought to be on a chief of the second three lions rampant of the first but the devil take them for their hieroglyphics should i say if i were determined in good earnest to marry and determined to marry i would be were it not for this consideration that once married and i am married for life thats the plague of it could a man do as the birds do change every valentines day a natural appointment for birds have not the sense forsooth to fetter themselves as we wiseacre men take great and solemn pains to do there would be nothing at all in it and what a glorious time would the lawyers have on the one hand with their noverini universis and suits commenceable on restitution of goods and chattels and the parsons on the other with their indulgencies renewable annually as other licenses to the honest desires of their clients then were a stated mullet according to rank or fortune to be paid on every change towards the exigencies of the state but none on renewals with the old lives for the sake of encouraging constancy especially among the minores the change would be made sufficiently difficult and the whole public would be the better for it while those children which the parents could not agree about maintaining might be considered as the children of the public and provided for like the children of the antient spartans who were as ours would in this case be a nation of heroes how jack could i have improved upon lycurguss institutions had i been a lawgiver did i never show thee a scheme which i drew up on such a notion as this in which i demonstrated the conveniencies and obviated the inconveniencies of changing the present mode to this i believe i never did i remember i proved to a demonstration that such a change would be a mean of annihilating absolutely annihilating four or five very atrocious and capital sins rapes vulgarly so called adultery and fornication nor would polygamy be panted after frequently would it prevent murders and duelling hardly any such thing as jealousy the cause of shocking violences would be heard of and hypocrisy between man and wife be banished the bosoms of each nor probably would the reproach of barrenness rest as it now too often does where it is least deserved nor would there possibly be such a person as a barren woman moreover what a multitude of domestic quarrels would be avoided where such a scheme carried into execution since both sexes would bear with each other in the view that they could help themselves in a few months and then what a charming subject for conversation would be the gallant and generous last partings between man and wife each perhaps a new mate in eye and rejoicing secretly in the manumission could afford to be complaisantly sorrowful in appearance he presented her with this jewel it will be said by the reporter for example sake she him with that how he wept how she sobbd how they looked after one another yet thats the jest of it neither of them wishing to stand another twelvemonths trial and if giddy fellows or giddy girls misbehave in a first marriage whether from noviceship having expected to find more in the matter than can be found or from perverseness on her part or positiveness on his each being mistaken in the other a mighty difference jack in the same person an inmate or a visiter what a fine opportunity will each have by this scheme of recovering a lost character and of setting all right in the next adventure and o jack with what joy with what rapture would the changelings or changeables if thou like that word better number the weeks the days the hours as the annual obligation approached to its desirable period as for the spleen or vapours no such malady would be known or heard of the physical tribe would indeed be the sufferers and the only sufferers since fresh health and fresh spirits the consequences of sweet blood and sweet humours the mind and body continually pleased with each other would perpetually flow in and the joys of expectation the highest of all our joys would invigorate and keep all alive but that no body of men might suffer the physicians i thought might turn parsons as there would be a great demand for parsons besides as they would be partakers in the general benefit they must be sorry fellows indeed if they preferred themselves to the public every one would be married a dozen times at least both men and women would be careful of their characters and polite in their behaviour as well as delicate in their persons and elegant in their dress a great matte each of these let me tell thee to keep passion alive either to induce a renewal with the old love or to recommend themselves to a new while the newspapers would be crowded with paragraphs all the world their readers as all the world would be concerned to see who and whos together yesterday for instance entered into the holy state of matrimony we should all speak reverently of matrimony then the right honourable robert earl lovelace i shall be an earl by that time with her grace the duchess dowager of fiftymanors his lordships oneandthirtieth wife i shall then be contented perhaps to take up as it is called with a widow but she must not have had more than one husband neither thou knowest that i am nice in these particulars i know jack that thou for thy part wilt approve of my scheme as lord m and i between us have three or four boroughs at command i think i will get into parliament in order to bring in a bill for this good purpose neither will the house of parliament nor the houses of convocation have reason to object it and all the courts whether spiritual or sensual civil or uncivil will find their account in it when passed into a law by my soul jack i should be apprehensive of a general insurrection and that incited by the women were such a bill to be thrown out for here is the excellency of the scheme the women will have equal reason with the men to be pleased with it dost think that old prerogative harlowe for example must not if such a law were in being have pulled in his horns so excellent a wife as he has would never else have renewed with such a gloomy tyrant who as well as all other married tyrants must have been upon good behaviour from year to year a termagant wife if such a law were to pass would be a phoenix the churches would be the only marketplace for the fair sex and domestic excellence the capital recommendation nor would there be an old maid in great britain and all its territories for what an odd soul must she be who could not have her twelvemonths trial in short a total alteration for the better in the morals and way of life in both sexes must in a very few years be the consequence of such a salutary law who would have expected such a one from me i wish the devil owe me not a spite for it the would not the distinction be very pretty jack as in flowers such a gentleman or such a lady is an annual such a one is a perennial one difficulty however as i remember occurred to me upon the probability that a wife might be enceinte as the lawyers call it but thus i obviated it that no man should be allowed to marry another woman without his then wifes consent till she were broughttobed and he had defrayed all incident charges and till it was agreed upon between them whether the child should be his hers or the publics the women in this case to have what i call the coercive option for i would not have it in the mans power to be a dog neither and indeed i gave the turn of the scale in every part of my scheme in the womens favour for dearly do i love the sweet rogues how infinitely more preferable this my scheme to the polygamy one of the old patriarchs who had wives and concubines without number i believe david and solomon had their hundreds at a time had they not jack let me add that annual parliaments and annual marriages are the projects next my heart how could i expatiate upon the benefits that would arise from both letter x mr lovelace to john belford esq well but now my plots thicken and my employment of writing to thee on this subject will soon come to a conclusion for now having got the license and mrs townsend with her tars being to come to hampstead next wednesday or thursday and another letter possibly or message from miss howe to inquire how miss harlowe does upon the rustics report of her ill health and to express her wonder that she has not heard form her in answer to hers on her escape i must soon blow up the lady or be blown up myself and so i am preparing with lady betty and my cousin montague to wait upon my beloved with a coachandfour or a sett for lady betty will not stir out with a pair for the world though but for two or three miles and this is a wellknown part of her character but as to the arms and crest upon the coach and trappings dost thou not know that a blunts must supply her while her own is new lining and repairing an opportunity she is willing to take now she is in town nothing of this kind can be done to her mind in the country liveries nearly lady bettys thou hast seen lady betty lawrance several times hast thou not belford no never in my life but thou hast and lain with her too or fame does thee more credit than thou deservest why jack knowest thou not lady bettys other name other name has she two she has and what thinkest thou of lady bab wallis o the devil now thou hast it lady barbara thou knowest lifted up in circumstances and by pride never appears or produces herself but on occasions special to pass to men of quality or price for a duchess or countess at least she has always been admired for a grandeur in her air that few women of quality can come up to and never was supposed to be other than what she passed for though often and often a paramour for lords and who thinkest thou is my cousin montague nay how should i know how indeed why my little johanetta golding a lively yet modestlooking girl is my cousin montague there belford is an aunt theres a cousin both have wit at will both are accustomed to ape quality both are genteelly descended mistresses of themselves and well educated yet past pity true spartan dames ashamed of nothing but detection always therefore upon their guard against that and in their own conceit when assuming top parts the very quality they ape and how dost think i dress them out ill tell thee lady betty in a rich gold tissue adorned with jewels of high price my cousin montague in a pale pink standing on end with silver flowers of her own working charlotte as well as my beloved is admirable at her needle not quite so richly jewelld out as lady betty but earrings and solitaire very valuable and infinitely becoming johanetta thou knowest has a good complexion a fine neck and ears remarkably fine so has charlotte she is nearly of charlottes stature too laces both the richest that could be procured thou canst not imagine what a sum the loan of the jewels cost me

once more here come the ladies attended by susan morrison a tenantfarmers daughter as lady bettys woman with her hands before her and thoroughly instructed how dress advantages women especially those

now have you to be sprightly but not confident cousin charlotte be sure forget not to look down or aside when looked at when eyes meet eyes be yours the retreating ones your face will bear examination o lord lord that so young a creature can so soon forget the innocent appearance she first charmed by and which i thought born with you all five years to ruin what twenty had been building up how natural the latter lesson how difficult to regain the former a stranger as i hope to be saved to the principal arts of your sex once more what a devil has your heart to do in your eyes have i not told

but once more be sure to have a guard upon your eyes never fear nephew never fear cousin a dram of barbadoes each and now we are gone letter xi mr lovelace to john belford esq at mrs sinclairs monday afternoon alls right as heart can wish in spite of all objection in spite of a reluctance next to faintings in spite of all foresight vigilance suspicion once more is the charmer of my soul in her old lodgings now throbs away every pulse now thump thump thumps my bounding heart for something but i have not time for the particulars of our management my beloved is now directing some of her clothes to be packed up never more to enter this house nor ever more will she i dare say when once again out of it yet not so much as a condition of forgiveness the harlowespirited fairone will not deserve my mercy she will wait for miss howes next letter and then if she find a difficulty in her new schemes thank her for nothing will will what why even then will take time to consider whether i am to be forgiven or for ever rejected an indifference that revives in my heart the remembrance of a thousand of the like nature and yet lady betty and miss montague a man would be tempted to think jack that they wish her to provoke my vengeance declare that i ought to be satisfied with such a proud suspension they are entirely attached to her whatever she says is must be gospel they are guarantees for her return to hampstead this night they are to go back with her a supper bespoken by lady betty at mrs moores all the vacant apartments there by my permission for i had engaged them for a month certain to be filled with them and their attendants for a week at least or till they can prevail upon the dear perverse as they hope they shall to restore me to her favour and to accompany lady betty to oxfordshire the dear creature has thus far condescended that she will write to miss howe and acquaint her with the present situation of things if she write i shall see what she writes but i believe she will have other employment soon lady betty is sure she tells her that she shall prevail upon her to forgive me though she dares say that i deserve not forgiveness lady betty is too delicate to inquire strictly into the nature of my offence but it must be an offence against herself against miss montague against the virtuous of the whole sex or it could not be so highly resented yet she will not leave her till she forgive me and till she see our nuptials privately celebrated mean time as she approves of her uncles expedient she will address her as already my wife before strangers stedman her solicitor may attend her for orders in relation to her chancery affair at hampstead not one hour they can be favoured with will they lose from the company and conversation of so dear so charming a new relation hard then if she had not obliged them with her company in their coachandfour to and from their cousin leesons who longed as they themselves had done to see a lady so justly celebrated how will lord m be raptured when he sees her and can salute her as his niece how will lady sarah bless herself she will now think her loss of the dear daughter she mourns for happily supplied miss montague dwells upon every word that falls from her lips she perfectly adores her new cousin for her cousin she must be and her cousin will she call her she answers for equal admiration in her sister patty ay cry i whispering loud enough for her to hear how will my cousin pattys doves eyes glisten and run over on the very first interview so gracious so noble so unaffected a dear creature what a happy family chorus we all will ours be these and such like congratulatory admirations every hour repeated her modesty hurt by the ecstatic praises her graces are too natural to herself for her to be proud of them but she must be content to be punished for excellencies that cast a shade upon the most excellent in short we are here as at hampstead all joy and rapture all of us except my beloved in whose sweet face her almost fainting reluctance to reenter these doors not overcome reigns a kind of anxious serenity but how will even that be changed in a few hours methinks i begin to pity the halfapprehensive beauty but avaunt thou unseasonablyintruding pity thou hast more than once already well nigh undone me and adieu reflection begone consideration and commiseration i dismiss ye all for at least a week to come but remembered her broken word her flight when my fond soul was meditating mercy to her be remembered her treatment of me in her letter on her escape to hampstead her hampstead virulence what is it she ought not to expect from an unchained beelzebub and a plotting villain be her preference of the single life to me also remembered that she despises me that she even refuses to be my wife a proud lovelace to be denied a wife to be more proudly rejected by a daughter of the harlowes the ladies of my own family she thinks them the ladies of my family supplicating in vain for her returning favour to their despised kinsman and taking laws from her still prouder punctilio be the execrations of her vixen friend likewise remembered poured out upon me from her representations and thereby made her own execrations be remembered still more particularly the townsend plot set on foot between them and now in a day or two ready to break out and the sordid threatening thrown out against me by that little fury is not this the crisis for which i have been long waiting shall tomlinson shall these women be engaged shall so many engines be set at work at an immense expense with infinite contrivance and all to no purpose is not this the hour of her trial and in her of the trial of the virtue of her whole sex so long premeditated so long threatened whether her frost be frost indeed whether her virtue be principle whether if once subdued she will not be always subdued and will she not want the crown of her glory the proof of her till now allsurpassing excellence if i stop short of the ultimate trial now is the end of purposes long overawed often suspended at hand and need i go throw the sins of her cursed family into the tooweighty scale abhorred be force be the thoughts of force theres no triumph over the will in force this i know i have said but would i not have avoided it if i could have i not tried every other method and have i any other resource left me can she resent the last outrage more than she has resented a fainter effort and if her resentments run ever so high cannot i repair by matrimony she will not refuse me i know jack the haughty beauty will not refuse me when her pride of being corporally inviolate is brought down when she can tell no tales but when be her resistance what it will even her own sex will suspect a yielding in resistance and when that modesty which may fill her bosom with resentment will lock up her speech vol iv letter xlviii but how know i that i have not made my own difficulties is she not a woman what redress lies for a perpetuated evil must she not live her piety will secure her life and will not time be my friend what in a word will be her behaviour afterwards she cannot fly me she must forgive me and as i have often said once forgiven will be for ever forgiven why then should this enervating pity unsteel my foolish heart it shall not all these things will i remember and think of nothing else in order to keep up a resolution which the women about me will have it i shall be still unable to hold ill teach the dear charming creature to emulate me in contrivance ill teach her to weave webs and plots against her conqueror ill show her that in her smuggling schemes she is but a spider compared to me and that she has all this time been spinning only a cobweb what shall we do now we are immersed in the depth of grief and apprehension how ill do women bear disappointment set upon going to hampstead and upon quitting for ever a house she reentered with infinite reluctance what things she intended to take with her ready packed up herself on tiptoe to be gone and i prepared to attend her thither she begins to be afraid that she shall not go this night and in grief and despair has flung herself into her old apartment locked herself in and through the keyhole dorcas sees her on her knees praying i suppose for a safe deliverance and from what and wherefore these agonizing apprehensions why here this unkind lady betty with the dear creatures knowledge though to her concern and this madheaded cousin montague without it while she was employed in directing her package have hurried away in the coach to their own lodgings only indeed to put up some nightclothes and so forth in order to attend their sweet cousin to hampstead and no less to my surprise than hers are not yet returned i have sent to know the meaning of it in a great hurry of spirits she would have had me to go myself hardly any pacifying her the girl god bless her is wild with her own idle apprehensions what is she afraid of i curse them both for their delay my tardy villain how he stays devil fetch them let them send their coach and well go without them in her hearing i bid the fellow tell them so perhaps he stays to bring the coach if any thing happens to hinder the ladies from attending my beloved this night devil take them again say i they promised too they would not stay because it was but two nights ago that a chariot was robbed at the foot of hampsteadhill which alarmed my fairone when told of it oh heres lady bettys servant with a billet to robert lovelace esq monday night excuse us my dear nephew i beseech you to my dearest kinswoman one night cannot break squares for here miss montague has been taken violently ill with three fainting fits one after another the hurry of her joy i believe to find your dear lady so much surpass all expectations never did family love you know reign so strong as among us and the too eager desire she had to attend her have occasioned it for she has but weak spirits poor girl well as she looks if she be better we will certainly go with you tomorrow morning after we have breakfasted with her at your lodgings but whether she be or not i will do myself the pleasure to attend your lady to hampstead and will be with you for that purpose about nine in the morning with due compliments to your most worthily beloved i am yours affectionately elizab lawrance faith and troth jack i know not what to do with myself for here just now having sent in the above note by dorcas out came my beloved with it in her hand in a fit of phrensy true by my soul she had indeed complained of her head all the evening dorcas ran to me out of breath to tell me that her lady was coming in some strange way but she followed her so quick that the frighted wench had not time to say in what way it seems when she read the billet now indeed said she am i a lost creature o the poor clarissa harlowe she tore off her headclothes inquired where i was and in she came her shining tresses flowing about her neck her ruffles torn and hanging in tatters about her snowy hands with her arms spread out her eyes wildly turned as if starting from their orbits down sunk she at my feet as soon as she approached me her charming bosom heaving to her uplifted face and clasping her arms about my knees dear lovelace said she if ever if ever if ever and unable to speak another word quitting her clasping hold down prostrate on the floor sunk she neither in a fit nor out of one i was quite astonished all my purposes suspended for a few moments i knew neither what to say nor what to do but recollecting myself am i again thought i in a way to be overcome and made a fool of if i now recede i am gone for ever i raised her but down she sunk as if quite disjointed her limbs failing her yet not in a fit neither i never heard of or saw such a dear unaccountable almost lifeless and speechless too for a few moments what must her apprehensions be at that moment and for what an highnotioned dear soul pretty ignorance thought i never having met with so sincere so unquestionable a repugnance i was staggered i was confounded yet how should i know that it would be so till i tried and how having proceeded thus far could i stop were i not to have had the women to goad me on and to make light of circumstances which they pretended to be better judges of than i i lifted her however into a chair and in words of disordered passion told her all her fears were needless wondered at them begged of her to be pacified besought her reliance on my faith and honour and revowed all my old vows and poured forth new ones at last with a heartbreaking sob i see i see mr lovelace in broken sentences she spoke i see i see that at last i am ruined ruined if your pity let me implore your pity and down on her bosom like a halfbrokenstalked lily topheavy with the overcharging dews of the morning sunk her head with a sigh that went to my heart all i could think of to reassure her when a little recovered i said why did i not send for their coach as i had intimated it might return in the morning for the ladies i had actually done so i told her on seeing her strange uneasiness but it was then gone to fetch a doctor for miss montague lest his chariot should not be so ready ah lovelace said she with a doubting face anguish in her imploring eye lady betty would think it very strange i told her if she were to know it was so disagreeable to her to stay one night for her company in the house where she had passed so many she called me names upon this she had called me names before i was patient let her go to lady bettys lodgings then directly go if the person i called lady betty was really lady betty if my dear good heaven what a villain does that if show you believe me to be i cannot help it i beseech you once more let me go to mrs leesons if that if ought not to be said then assuming a more resolute spirit i will go i will inquire my way i will go by myself and would have rushed by me i folded my arms about her to detain her pleading the bad way i heard poor charlotte was in and what a farther concern her impatience if she went would give to poor charlotte she would believe nothing i said unless i would instantly order a coach since she was not to have lady bettys nor was permitted to go to mrs leesons and let her go in it to hampstead late as it was and all alone so much the better for in the house of people of whom lady betty upon inquiry had heard a bad character dropt foolishly this by my prating new relation in order to do credit to herself by depreciating others every thing and every face looking with so much meaning vileness as well as my own thou art still too sensible thought i my charmer she was resolved not to stay another night dreading what might happen as to her intellects and being very apprehensive that she might possibly go through a great deal before morning though more violent she could not well be with the worst she dreaded i humoured her and ordered will to endeavour to get a coach directly to carry us to hampstead i cared not at what price robbers with whom i would have terrified her she feared not i was all her fear i found and this house her terror for i saw plainly that she now believed that lady betty and miss montague were both impostors but her mistrust is a little of the latest to do her service and o jack the rage of love the rage of revenge is upon me by turns they tear me the progress already made the womens instigations the power i shall have to try her to the utmost and still to marry her if she be not to be brought to cohabitation let me perish belford if she escape me now will is not yet come back near eleven will is this moment returned no coach to be got either for love or money once more she urges to mrs leesons let me go lovelace good lovelace let me go to mrs leesons what is miss montagues illness to my terror for the almightys sake mr lovelace her hands clasped o my angel what a wildness is this do you know do you see my dearest life what appearances your causeless apprehensions have given you do you know it is past eleven oclock twelve one two three four any hour i care not if you mean me honourably let me go out of this hated house thoult observe belford that though this was written afterwards yet as in other places i write it as it was spoken and happened as if i had retired to put down every sentence spoken i know thou likest this lively presenttense manner as it is one of my peculiars just as she had repeated the last words if you mean me honourably let me go out of this hated house in came mrs sinclair in a great ferment and what pray madam has this house done to you mr lovelace you have known me some time and if i have not the niceness of this lady i hope i do not deserve to be treated thus she set her huge arms akimbo hoh madam let me tell you that i am amazed at your freedoms with my character and mr lovelace holding up and violently shaking her head if you are a gentleman and a man of honour having never before seen any thing but obsequiousness in this woman little as she liked her she was frighted at her masculine air and fierce look god help me cried she what will become of me now then turning her head hither and thither in a wild kind of amaze whom have i for a protector what will become of me now i will be your protector my dearest love but indeed you are uncharitably severe upon poor mrs sinclair indeed you are she is a gentlewoman born and the relict of a man of honour and though left in such circumstance as to oblige her to let lodgings yet would she scorn to be guilty of a wilful baseness i hope so it may be so i may be mistaken but but there is no crime i presume no treason to say i dont like her house the old dragon straddled up to her with her arms kemboed again her eyebrows erect like the bristles upon a hogs back and scouling over her shortened nose more than halfhid her ferret eyes her mouth was distorted she pouted out her blubberlips as if to bellows up wind and sputter into her horsenostrils and her chin was curdled and more than usually prominent with passion with two hohmadams she accosted the frighted fairone who terrified caught hold of my sleeve i feared she would fall into fits and with a look of indignation told mrs sinclair that these apartments were mine and i could not imagine what she meant either by listening to what passed between me and my spouse or to come in uninvited and still more i wondered at her giving herself these strange liberties i may be to blame jack for suffering this wretch to give herself these airs but her coming in was without my orders the old beldam throwing herself into a chair fell a blubbering and exclaiming and the pacifying of her and endeavouring to reconcile the lady to her took up till near one oclock and thus between terror and the late hour and what followed she was diverted from the thoughts of getting out of the house to mrs leesons or any where else letter xii mr lovelace to john belford esq tuesday morning june and now belford i can go no farther the affair is over clarissa lives and i am your humble servant r lovelace the whole of this black transaction is given by the injured lady to miss howe in her subsequent letters dated thursday july see letters lxvii lxviii lxix letter xiii mr belford to robert lovelace esq watford wedn jan o thou savagehearted monster what work hast thou made in one guilty hour for a whole age of repentance i am inexpressibly concerned at the fate of this matchless lady she could not have fallen into the hands of any other man breathing and suffered as she has done with thee i had written a great part of another long letter to try to soften thy flinty heart in her favour for i thought it but too likely that thou shouldst succeed in getting her back again to the accursed womans but i find it would have been too late had i finished it and sent it away yet cannot i forbear writing to urge thee to make the only amends thou now canst make her by a proper use of the license thou hast obtained poor poor lady it is a pain to me that i ever saw her such an adorer of virtue to be sacrificed to the vilest of her sex and thou their implement in the devils hand for a purpose so base so ungenerous so inhumane pride thyself o cruellest of men in this reflection and that thy triumph over a woman who for thy sake was abandoned of every friend she had in the world was effected not by advantages taken of her weakness and credulity but by the blackest artifice after a long course of studied deceits had been tried to no purpose i can tell thee it is well either for thee or for me that i am not the brother of the lady had i been her brother her violation must have been followed by the blood of one of us excuse me lovelace and let not the lady fare the worse for my concern for her and yet i have but one other motive to ask thy excuse and that is because i owe to thy own communicative pen the knowledge i have of thy barbarous villany since thou mightest if thou wouldst have passed it upon me for a common seduction clarissa lives thou sayest that she does is my wonder and these words show that thou thyself though thou couldst nevertheless proceed hardly expectedst she would have survived the outrage what must have been the poor ladys distress watchful as she had been over her honour when dreadful certainty took place of cruel apprehension and yet a man may guess what must have been by that which thou paintest when she suspected herself tricked deserted and betrayed by the pretended ladies that thou couldst behold her phrensy on this occasion and her halfspeechless halffainting prostration at thy feet and yet retain thy evil purposes will hardly be thought credible even by those who know thee if they have seen her poor poor lady with such noble qualities as would have adorned the most exalted married life to fall into the hands of the only man in the world who could have treated her as thou hast treated her and to let loose the old dragon as thou properly callest her upon the beforeaffrighted innocent what a barbarity was that what a poor piece of barbarity in order to obtain by terror what thou dispairedst to gain by love though supported by stratagems the most insidious o lovelace lovelace had i doubted it before i should now be convinced that there must be a world after this to do justice to injured merit and to punish barbarous perfidy could the divine socrates and the divine clarissa otherwise have suffered but let me if possible for one moment try to forget this villanous outrage on the most excellent of women i have business here which will hold me yet a few days and then perhaps i shall quit this house for ever i have had a solemn and tedious time of it i should never have known that i had half the respect i really find i had for the old gentleman had i not so closely at his earnest desire attended him and been a witness of the tortures he underwent this melancholy occasion may possibly have contributed to humanize me but surely i never could have been so remorseless a caitiff as thou hast been to a woman of half this ladys excellence but prythee dear lovelace if thourt a man and not a devil resolve out of hand to repair thy sin of ingratitude by conferring upon thyself the highest honour thou canst receive in making her lawfully thine but if thou canst not prevail upon thyself to do her this justice i think i should not scruple a tilt with thee an everlasting rupture at least must follow if thou sacrificest her to the accursed women thou art desirous to know what advantage i reap by my uncles demise i do not certainly know for i have not been so greedily solicitous on this subject as some of the kindred have been who ought to have shown more decency as i have told them and suffered the corpse to have been cold before they had begun their hungry inquiries but by what i gathered from the poor mans talk to me who oftener than i wished touched upon the subject i deem it will be upwards of in cash and in the funds after all legacies paid besides the real estate which is a clear ayear i wish from my heart thou wert a moneylover were the estate to be of double the value thou shouldst have it every shilling only upon one condition for my circumstances before were as easy as i wish them to be while i am single that thou wouldst permit me the honour of being this fatherless ladys father as it is called at the altar think of this my dear lovelace be honest and let me present thee with the brightest jewel that man ever possessed and then body and soul wilt thou bind to thee for ever thy belford letter xiv mr lovelace to john belford esq thursday june let me alone you great dog you let me alone have i heard a lesser boy his coward arms held over his head and face say to a bigger who was pommeling him for having run away with his apple his orange or his gingerbread so say i to thee on occasion of thy severity to thy poor friend who as thou ownest has furnished thee ungenerous as thou art with the weapons thou brandishest so fearfully against him and to what purpose when the mischief is done when of consequence the affair is irretrievable and when a clarissa could not move me well but after all i must own that there is something very singular in this ladys case and at times i cannot help regretting that ever i attempted her since not one power either of body or soul could be moved in my favour and since to use the expression of the philosopher on a much graver occasion there is no difference to be found between the skull of king philip and that of another man but peoples extravagant notions of things alter not facts belford and when alls done miss clarissa harlowe has but run the fate of a thousand others of her sex only that they did not set such a romantic value upon what they call their honour thats all and yet i will allow thee this that if a person sets a high value upon any thing be it ever such a trifle in itself or in the eye of others the robbing of that person of it is not a trifle to him take the matter in this light i own i have done wrong great wrong to this admirable creature but have i not known twenty and twenty of the sex who have seemed to carry their notions of virtue high yet when brought to the test have abated of their severity and how should we be convinced that any of them are proof till they are tried a thousand times have i said that i never yet met with such a woman as this if i had i hardly ever should have attempted miss clarissa harlowe hitherto she is all angel and was not that the point which at setting out i proposed to try and was not cohabitation ever my darling view and am i not now at last in the high road to it it is true that i have nothing to boast of as to her will the very contrary but now are we come to the test whether she cannot be brought to make the best of an irreparable evil if she exclaim she has reason to exclaim and i will sit down with patience by the hour together to hear her exclamations till she is tired of them she will then descend to expostulation perhaps expostulation will give me hope expostulation will show that she hates me not and if she hate me not she will forgive and if she now forgive then will all be over and she will be mine upon my own terms and it shall then be the whole study of my future life to make her happy see vol iii letter xviii so belford thou seest that i have journeyed on to this stage indeed through infinite mazes and as infinite remorses with one determined point in view from the first to thy urgent supplication then that i will do her grateful justice by marriage let me answer in matt priors two lines on his hopedfor auditorship as put into the mouths of his st john and harley let that be done which matt doth say yea quoth the earl but not today thou seest jack that i make no resolutions however against doing her one time or other the wishedfor justice even were i to succeed in my principal view cohabitation and of this i do assure thee that if i ever marry it must it shall be miss clarissa harlowe nor is her honour at all impaired with me by what she has so far suffered but the contrary she must only take care that if she be at last brought to forgive me she show me that her lovelace is the only man on earth whom she could have forgiven on the like occasion but ah jack what in the mean time shall i do with this admirable creature at present i am loth to say it but at present she is quite stupified i had rather methinks she should have retained all her active powers though i had suffered by her nails and her teeth than that she should be sunk into such a state of absolute insensibility shall i call it as she has been in every since tuesday morning yet as she begins a little to revive and nowandthen to call names and to exclaim i dread almost to engage with the anguish of a spirit that owes its extraordinary agitations to a niceness that has no example either in ancient or modern story for after all what is there in her case that should stupify such a glowing such a blooming charmer excess of grief excess of terror have made a persons hair stand on end and even as we have read changed the colour of it but that it should so stupify as to make a person at times insensible to those imaginary wrongs which would raise others from stupifaction is very surprising but i will leave this subject least it should make me too grave i was yesterday at hampstead and discharged all obligations there with no small applause i told them that the lady was now as happy as myself and that is no great untruth for i am not altogether so when i allow myself to think mrs townsend with her tars had not been then there i told them what i would have them say to her if she came well but after all how many afteralls have i i could be very grave were i to give way to it the devil take me for a fool whats the matte with me i wonder i must breathe a fresher air for a few days but what shall i do with this admirable creature the while hang me if i know for if i stir the venomous spider of this habitation will want to set upon the charming fly whose silken wings are already so entangled in my enormous web that she cannot move hand or foot for so much has grief stupified her that she is at present destitute of will as she always seemed to be of desire i must not therefore think of leaving her yet for two days together letter xv mr lovelace to john belford esq i have just now had a specimen of what the resentment of this dear creature will be when quite recovered an affecting one for entering her apartment after dorcas and endeavouring to soothe and pacify her disordered mind in the midst of my blandishments she held up to heaven in a speechless agony the innocent license which she has in her own power as the poor distressed catalans held up their english treaty on an occasion that keeps the worst of my actions in countenance she seemed about to call down vengeance upon me when happily the leaden god in pity to her trembling lovelace waved over her halfdrowned eyes his somniferous want and laid asleep the fair exclaimer before she could go half through with her intended imprecation thou wilt guess by what i have written that some little art has been made use of but it was with a generous design if thoult allow me the word on such an occasion in order to lessen the tooquick sense she was likely to have of what she was to suffer a contrivance i never had occasion for before and had not thought of now if mrs sinclair had not proposed it to me to whom i left the management of it and i have done nothing but curse her ever since lest the quantity should have for ever dampened her charming intellects hence my concern for i think the poor lady ought not to have been so treated poor lady did i say what have i to do with thy creeping style but have not i the worst of it since her insensibility has made me but a thief to my own joys i did not intend to tell thee of this little innocent trick for such i designed it to be but that i hate disingenuousness to thee especially and as i cannot help writing in a more serious vein than usual thou wouldst perhaps had i not hinted the true cause have imagined that i was sorry for the fact itself and this would have given thee a good deal of trouble in scribbling dull persuasives to repair by matrimony and me in reading thy cruel nonsense besides one day or other thou mightest had i not confessed it have heard of it in an aggravated manner and i know thou hast such an high opinion of this ladys virtue that thou wouldst be disappointed if thou hadst reason to think that she was subdued by her own consent or any the least yielding in her will and so is she beholden to me in some measure that at the expense of my honour she may so justly form a plea which will entirely salve hers and now is the whole secret out thou wilt say i am a horrid fellow as the lady does that i am the unchained beelzebub and a plotting villain and as this is what you both said beforehand and nothing worse can be said i desire if thou wouldst not have me quite serious with thee and that i should think thou meanest more by thy tilting hint than i am willing to believe thou dost that thou wilt forbear thy invectives for is not the thing done can it be helped and must i not now try to make the best of it and the rather do i enjoin to make thee this and inviolable secrecy because i begin to think that my punishment will be greater than the fault were it to be only from my own reflection letter xvi mr lovelace to john belford esq friday june i am sorry to hear of thy misfortune but hope thou wilt not long lie by it thy servant tells me what narrow escape thou hadst with thy neck i wish it may not be ominous but i think thou seemest not to be in so enterprising a way as formerly and yet merry or sad thou seest a rakes neck is always in danger if not from the hangman from his own horse but tis a vicious toad it seems and i think thou shouldst never venture upon his back again for tis a plaguy thing for rider and horse both to be vicious the fellow tells me thou desirest me to continue to write to thee in order to divert thy chagrin on thy forced confinement but how can i think it in my power to divert when my subject is not pleasing to myself caesar never knew what it was to be hipped i will call it till he came to be what pompey was that is to say till he arrived at the height of his ambition nor did thy lovelace know what it was to be gloomy till he had completed his wishes upon the most charming creature in the world and yet why say i completed when the will the consent is wanting and i have still views before me of obtaining that yet i could almost join with thee in the wish which thou sendest me up by thy servant unfriendly as it is that i had had thy misfortune before monday night last for here the poor lady has run into a contrary extreme to that i told thee of in my last for now is she as much too lively as before she was too stupid and bating that she has pretty frequent lucid intervals would be deemed raving mad and i should be obliged to confine her i am most confoundedly disturbed about it for i begin to fear that her intellects are irreparably hurt who the devil could have expected such strange effects from a cause so common and so slight but these highsouled and highsensed girls who had set up for shining lights and examples to the rest of the sex are with such difficulty brought down to the common standard that a wise man who prefers his peace of mind to his glory in subduing one of that exalted class would have nothing to say to them i do all in my power to quiet her spirits when i force myself into her presence i go on begging pardon one minute and vowing truth and honour another i would at first have persuaded her and offered to call witnesses to the truth of it that we were actually married though the license was in her hands i thought the assertion might go down in her disorder and charming consequences i hoped would follow but this would not do i therefore gave up that hope and now i declare to her that it is my resolution to marry her the moment her uncle harlowe informs me that he will grace the ceremony with his presence but she believes nothing i say nor whether in her senses or not bears me with patience in her sight i pity her with all my soul and i curse myself when she is in her wailing fits and when i apprehend that intellects so charming are for ever damped but more i curse these women who put me upon such an expedient lord lord what a hand have i made of it and all for what last night for the first time since monday night she got to her pen and ink but she pursues her writing with such eagerness and hurry as show too evidently her discomposure i hope however that this employment will help to calm her spirits just now dorcas tells me that what she writes she tears and throws the paper in fragments under the table either as not knowing what she does or disliking it then gets up wrings her hands weeps and shifts her seat all round the room then returns to her table sits down and writes again one odd letter as i may call it dorcas has this moment given me from her carry this said she to the vilest of men dorcas a toad brought it without any further direction to me i sat down intending though tis pretty long to give thee a copy of it but for my life i cannot tis so extravagant and the original is too much an original to let it go out of my hands but some of the scraps and fragments as either torn through or flung aside i will copy for the novelty of the thing and to show thee how her mind works now she is in the whimsical way yet i know i am still furnishing thee with new weapons against myself but spare thy comments my own reflections render them needless dorcas thinks her lady will ask for them so wishes to have them to lay again under the table by the first thoult guess that i have told her that miss howe is very ill and cant write that she may account the better for not having received the letter designed for her paper i torn in two pieces my dearest miss howe o what dreadful dreadful things have i to tell you but yet i cannot tell you neither but say are you really ill as a vile vile creature informs me you are but he never yet told me truth and i hope has not in this and yet if it were not true surely i should have heard from you before now but what have i to do to upbraid you may well be tired of me and if you are i can forgive you for i am tired of myself and all my own relations were tired of me long before you were how good you have always been to me mine own dear anna howe but how i ramble i sat down to say a great deal my heart was full i did not know what to say first and thought and grief and confusion and o my poor head i cannot tell what and thought and grief and confusion came crowding so thick upon me one would be first another would be first all would be first so i can write nothing at all only that whatever they have done to me i cannot tell but i am no longer what i wasin any one thing did i say yes but i am for i am still and i ever will be your true plague on it i can write no more of this eloquent nonsense myself which rather shows a raised than a quenched imagination but dorcas shall transcribe the others in separate papers as written by the whimsical charmer and some time hence when all is over and i can better bear to read them i may ask thee for a sight of them preserve them therefore for we often look back with pleasure even upon the heaviest griefs when the cause of them is removed paper ii scratchd through and thrown under the table and can you my dear honoured papa resolve for ever to reprobate your poor child but i am sure you would not if you knew what she has suffered since her unhappy and will nobody plead for your poor suffering girl no one good body why then dearest sir let it be an act of your own innate goodness which i have so much experienced and so much abused i dont presume to think you should receive me no indeed my name is i dont know what my name is i never dare to wish to come into your family again but your heavy curse my papa yes i will call you papa and help yourself as you can for you are my own dear papa whether you will or not and though i am an unworthy child yet i am your child paper iii a lady took a great fancy to a young lion or a bear i forget which but a bear or a tiger i believe it was it was made her a present of when a whelp she fed it with her own hand she nursed up the wicked cub with great tenderness and would play with it without fear or apprehension of danger and it was obedient to all her commands and its tameness as she used to boast increased with its growth so that like a lapdog it would follow her all over the house but mind what followed at last some how neglecting to satisfy its hungry maw or having otherwise disobliged it on some occasion it resumed its nature and on a sudden fell upon her and tore her in pieces and who was most to blame i pray the brute or the lady the lady surely for what she did was out of nature out of character at least what it did was in its own nature paper iv how art thou now humbled in the dust thou proud clarissa harlowe thou that never steppedst out of thy fathers house but to be admired who wert wont to turn thine eye sparkling with healthful life and selfassurance to different objects at once as thou passedst as if for so thy penetrating sister used to say to plume thyself upon the expected applauses of all that beheld thee thou that usedst to go to rest satisfied with the adulations paid thee in the past day and couldst put off every thing but thy vanity paper v rejoice not now my bella my sister my friend but pity the humbled creature whose foolish heart you used to say you beheld through the thin veil of humility which covered it it must have been so my fall had not else been permitted you penetrated my proud heart with the jealousy of an elder sisters searching eye you knew me better than i knew myself hence your upbraidings and your chidings when i began to totter but forgive now those vain triumphs of my heart i thought poor proud wretch that i was that what you said was owing to your envy i thought i could acquit my intention of any such vanity i was too secure in the knowledge i thought i had of my own heart my supposed advantages became a snare to me and what now is the end of all paper vi what now is become of the prospects of a happy life which once i thought opening before me who now shall assist in the solemn preparations who now shall provide the nuptial ornaments which soften and divert the apprehensions of the fearful virgin no court now to be paid to my smiles no encouraging compliments to inspire thee with hope of laying a mind not unworthy of thee under obligation no elevation now for conscious merit and applauded purity to look down from on a prostrate adorer and an admiring world and up to pleased and rejoicing parents and relations paper vii thou pernicious caterpillar that preyest upon the fair leaf of virgin fame and poisonest those leaves which thou canst not devour thou fell blight thou eastern blast thou overspreading mildew that destroyest the early promises of the shining year that mockest the laborious toil and blastest the joyful hopes of the painful husbandman thou fretting moth that corruptest the fairest garment thou eating cankerworm that preyest upon the opening bud and turnest the damaskrose into livid yellowness if as religion teaches us god will judge us in a great measure by our benevolent or evil actions to one another o wretch bethink thee in time bethink thee how great must be thy condemnation paper viiii at first i saw something in your air and person that displeased me not your birth and fortunes were no small advantages to you you acted not ignobly by my passionate brother every body said you were brave every body said you were generous a brave man i thought could not be a base man a generous man could not i believed be ungenerous where he acknowledged obligation thus prepossessed all the rest that my soul loved and wished for in your reformation i hoped i knew not but by report any flagrant instances of your vileness you seemed frank as well as generous frankness and generosity ever attracted me whoever kept up those appearances i judged of their hearts by my own and whatever qualities i wished to find in them i was ready to find and when found i believed them to be natives of the soil my fortunes my rank my character i thought a further security i was in none of those respects unworthy of being the niece of lord m and of his two noble sisters your vows your imprecations but oh you have barbarously and basely conspired against that honour which you ought to have protected and now you have made me what is it of vile that you have not made me yet god knows my heart i had no culpable inclinations i honoured virtue i hated vice but i knew not that you were vice itself paper ix had the happiness of any of the poorest outcast in the world whom i had neveer seen never known never before heard of lain as much in my power as my happiness did in yours my benevolent heart would have made me fly to the succour of such a poor distressed with what pleasure would i have raised the dejected head and comforted the desponding heart but who now shall pity the poor wretch who has increased instead of diminished the number of the miserable paper x lead me where my own thoughts themselves may lose me where i may dose out what ive left of life forget myself and that days guile cruel remembrancehow shall i appease thee death only can be dreadful to the bad to innocence tis like a bugbear dressd to frighten children pull but off the mask and hell appear a friend transcribers note portions set off in square brackets are written at angles to the majority of the text as if squeezed into margins oh you have done an act that blots the face and blush of modesty takes off the rose from the fair forehead of an innocent love and makes a blister there then down i laid my head down on cold earth and for a while was dead and my freed soul to a strange somewhere fled ah sottish soul said i when back to its cage again i saw it fly fool to resume her broken chain and row the galley here again fool to that body to return where it condemnd and destind is to mourn i could a tale unfold would harrow up thy soul o my miss howe if thou hast friendship help me and speak the words of peace to my divided soul that wars within me and raises evry sense to my confusion im tottring on the brink of peace an thou art all the hold ive left assist mein the pangs of my affliction when honours lost tis a relief to die deaths but a sure retreat from infamy by swift misfortunes how i am pursud which on each other are like waves renewd the farewell youth and all the joys that dwell with youth and life and life itself farewell for life can never be sincerely blest heavn punishes the bad and proves the best after all belford i have just skimmed over these transcriptions of dorcas and i see there are method and good sense in some of them wild as others of them are and that her memory which serves her so well for these poetical flights is far from being impaired and this gives me hope that she will soon recover her charming intellects though i shall be the sufferer by their restoration i make no doubt but in the letter she wrote to me there are yet greater extravagancies and though i said it was too affecting to give thee a copy of it yet after i have let thee see the loose papers enclosed i think i may throw in a transcript of that dorcas therefore shall here transcribe it i cannot the reading of it affected me ten times more than the severest reproaches of a regular mind could do to mr lovelace i never intended to write another line to you i would not see you if i could help it o that i never had but tell me of a truth is miss howe really and truly ill very ill and is not her illness poison and dont you know who gave it to her what you or mrs sinclair or somebody i cannot tell who have done to my poor head you best know but i shall never be what i was my head is gone i have wept away all my brain i believe for i can weep no more indeed i have had my full share so it is no matter but good now lovelace dont set mrs sinclair upon me again i never did her any harm she so affrights me when i see her ever since when was it i cannot tell you can i suppose she may be a good woman as far as i know she was the wife of a man of honour very likely though forced to let lodgings for a livelihood poor gentlewoman let her know i pity her but dont let her come near me again pray dont yet she may be a very good woman what would i say i forget what i was going to say o lovelace you are satan himself or he helps you out in every thing and thats as bad but have you really and truly sold yourself to him and for how long what duration is your reign to have poor man the contract will be out and then what will be your fate o lovelace if you could be sorry for yourself i would be sorry too but when all my doors are fast and nothing but the keyhole open and the key of late put into that to be where you are in a manner without opening any of them o wretched wretched clarissa harlowe for i never will be lovelace let my uncle take it as he pleases well but now i remember what i was going to say it is for your good not mine for nothing can do me good now o thou villanous man thou hated lovelace but mrs sinclair may be a good woman if you love me but that you dont but dont let her bluster up with her worse than mannish airs to me again o she is a frightful woman if she be a woman she needed not to put on that fearful mask to scare me out of my poor wits but dont tell her what i say i have no hatred to her it is only fright and foolish fear thats all she may not be a bad woman but neither are all men any more than all women alike god forbid they should be like you alas you have killed my head among you i dont say who did it god forgive you all but had it not been better to have put me out of all your ways at once you might safely have done it for nobody would require me at your hands no not a soul except indeed miss howe would have said when she should see you what lovelace have you done with clarissa harlowe and then you could have given any slight gay answer sent her beyond sea or she has run away from me as she did from her parents and this would have been easily credited for you know lovelace she that could run away from them might very well run away from you but this is nothing to what i wanted to say now i have it i have lost it again this foolish wench comes teasing me for what purpose should i eat for what end should i wish to live i tell thee dorcas i will neither eat nor drink i cannot be worse than i am i will do as youd have me good dorcas look not upon me so fiercely but thou canst not look so bad as i have seen somebody look mr lovelace now that i remember what i took pen in hand to say let me hurry off my thoughts lest i lose them again here i am sensible and yet i am hardly sensible neither but i know my head is not as it should be for all that therefore let me propose one thing to you it is for your good not mine and this is it i must needs be both a trouble and an expense to you and here my uncle harlowe when he knows how i am will never wish any man to have me no not even you who have been the occasion of it barbarous and ungrateful a less complicated villany cost a tarquin but i forget what i would say again then this is it i never shall be myself again i have been a very wicked creature a vain proud poor creature full of secret pride which i carried off under an humble guise and deceived every body my sister says so and now i am punished so let me be carried out of this house and out of your sight and let me be put into that bedlam privately which once i saw but it was a sad sight to me then little as i thought what i should come to myself that is all i would say this is all i have to wish for then i shall be out of all your ways and i shall be taken care of and bread and water without your tormentings will be dainties and my strawbed the easiest i have lain in for i cannot tell how long my clothes will sell for what will keep me there perhaps as long as i shall live but lovelace dear lovelace i will call you for you have cost me enough im sure dont let me be made a show of for my familys sake nay for your own sake dont do that for when i know all i have suffered which yet i do not and no matter if i never do i may be apt to rave against you by name and tell of all your baseness to a poor humbled creature that once was as proud as any body but of what i cant tell except of my own folly and vanity but let that pass since i am punished enough for it so suppose instead of bedlam it were a private madhouse where nobody comes that will be better a great deal but another thing lovelace dont let them use me cruelly when i am there you have used me cruelly enough you know dont let them use me cruelly for i will be very tractable and do as any body would have me to do except what you would have me do for that i never will another thing lovelace dont let this good woman i was going to say vile woman but dont tell her that because she wont let you send me to this happy refuge perhaps if she were to know it another thing lovelace and let me have pen and ink and paper allowed me it will be all my amusement but they need not send to any body i shall write to what i write because it will but trouble them and somebody may do you a mischief may be i wish not that any body do any body a mischief upon my account you tell me that lady betty lawrance and your cousin montague were here to take leave of me but that i was asleep and could not be waked so you told me at first i was married you know and that you were my husband ah lovelace look to what you say but let not them for they will sport with my misery let not that lady betty let not that miss montague whatever the real ones may do nor mrs sinclair neither nor any of her lodgers nor her nieces come to see me in my place real ones i say for lovelace i shall find out all your villanies in time indeed i shall so put me there as soon as you can it is for your good then all will pass for ravings that i can say as i doubt no many poor creatures exclamations do pass though there may be too much truth in them for all that and you know i began to be mad at hampstead so you said ah villanous man what have you not to answer for a little interval seems to be lent me i had begun to look over what i have written it is not fit for any one to see so far as i have been able to reperuse it but my head will not hold i doubt to go through it all if therefore i have not already mentioned my earnest desire let me tell you it is this that i be sent out of this abominable house without delay and locked up in some private madhouse about this town for such it seems there are never more to be seen or to be produced to any body except in your own vindication if you should be charged with the murder of my person a much lighter crime than that of honour which the greatest villain on earth has robbed me of and deny me not this my last request i beseech you and one other and that is never to let me see you more this surely may be granted to the miserably abused clarissa harlowe i will not bear thy heavy preachments belford upon this affecting letter so not a word of that sort the paper thoult see is blistered with the tears even of the hardened transcriber which has made her ink run here and there mrs sinclair is a true heroine and i think shames us all and she is a woman too thoult say the beset things corrupted become the worst but this is certain that whatever the sex set their hearts upon they make thorough work of it and hence it is that a mischief which would end in simple robbery among men rogues becomes murder if a woman be in it i know thou wilt blame me for having had recourse to art but do not physicians prescribe opiates in acute cases where the violence of the disorder would be apt to throw the patient into a fever or delirium i aver that my motive for this expedient was mercy nor could it be any thing else for a rape thou knowest to us rakes is far from being an undesirable thing nothing but the law stands in our way upon that account and the opinion of what a modest woman will suffer rather than become a viva voce accuser lessens much an honest fellows apprehensions on that score then if these somnivolencies i hate the word opiates on this occasion have turned her head that is an effect they frequently have upon some constitutions and in this case was rather the fault of the dose than the design of the giver but is not wine itself an opiate in degree how many women have been taken advantage of by wine and other still more intoxicating viands let me tell thee jack that the experience of many of the passive sex and the consciences of many more of the active appealed to will testify that thy lovelace is not the worst of villains nor would i have thee put me upon clearing myself by comparisons if she escape a settled delirium when my plots unravel i think it is all i ought to be concerned about what therefore i desire of thee is that if two constructions may be made of my actions thou wilt afford me the most favourable for this not only friendship but my own ingenuousness which has furnished thee with the knowledge of the facts against which thou art so ready to inveigh require of thee will is just returned from an errand to hampstead and acquaints me that mrs townsend was yesterday at mrs moores accompanied by three or four rough fellows a greater number as supposed at a distance she was strangely surprised at the news that my spouse and i are entirely reconciled and that two fine ladies my relations came to visit her and went to town with her where she is very happy with me she was sure we were not married she said unless it was while we were at hampstead and they were sure the ceremony was not performed there but that the lady is happy and easy is unquestionable and a fling was thrown out by mrs moore and mrs bevis at mischiefmakers as they knew mrs townsend to be acquainted with miss howe now since my fairone can neither receive nor send away letters i am pretty easy as to this mrs townsend and her employer and i fancy miss howe will be puzzled to know what to think of the matter and afraid of sending by wilsons conveyance and perhaps suppose that her friend slights her or has changed her mind in my favour and is ashamed to own it as she has not had an answer to what she wrote and will believe that the rustic delivered her last letter into her own hand mean time i have a little project come into my head of a new kind just for amusementsake thats all variety has irresistible charms i cannot live without intrigue my charmer has no passions that is to say none of the passions that i want her to have she engages all my reverence i am at present more inclined to regret what i have done than to proceed to new offences and shall regret it till i see how she takes it when recovered shall i tell thee my project tis not a high one tis this to get hither to mrs moore miss rawlins and my widow bevis for they are desirous to make a visit to my spouse now we are so happy together and if i can order it right belton mowbray tourville and i will show them a little more of the ways of this wicked town than they at present know why should they be acquainted with a man of my character and not be the better and wiser for it i would have every body rail against rakes with judgment and knowledge if they will rail two of these women gave me a great deal of trouble and the third i am confident will forgive a merry evening thou wilt be curious to know what the persons of these women are to whom i intend so much distinction i think i have not heretofore mentioned any thing characteristic of their persons mrs moore is a widow of about thirtyeight a little mortified by misfortunes but those are often the merriest folks when warmed she has good features still and is what they call much of a gentlewoman and very neat in her person and dress she has given over i believe all thoughts of our sex but when the dying embers are raked up about the halfconsumed stump there will be fuel enough left i dare say to blaze out and give a comfortable warmth to a halfstarved bystander mrs bevis is comely that is to say plump a lover of mirth and one whom no grief ever dwelt with i dare say for a week together about twentyfive years of age mowbray will have very little difficulty with her i believe for one cannot do every thing ones self and yet sometimes women of this free cast when it comes to the point answer not the promises their cheerful forwardness gives a man who has a view upon them miss rawlins is an agreeable young lady enough but not beautiful she has sense and would be thought to know the world as it is called but for her knowledge is more indebted to theory than experience a mere whiptsyllabub knowledge this jack that always fails the person who trusts to it when it should hold to do her service for such young ladies have so much dependence upon their own understanding and wariness are so much above the cautions that the less opinionative may be benefited by that their presumption is generally their overthrow when attempted by a man of experience who knows how to flatter their vanity and to magnify their wisdom in order to take advantage of their folly but for miss rawlins if i can add experience to her theory what an accomplished person will she be and how much will she be obliged to me and not only she but all those who may be the better for the precepts she thinks herself already so well qualified to give dearly jack do i love to engage with these preceptgivers and examplesetters now belford although there is nothing striking in any of these characters yet may we at a pinch make a good frolicky halfday with them if after we have softened their wax at table by encouraging viands we can set our women and them into dancing dancing which all women love and all men should therefore promote for both their sakes and thus when tourville sings belton fiddles mowbray makes rough love and i smooth and thou jack wilt be by that time well enough to join in the chorus the devils int if we dont mould them into what shape we please our own women by their laughing freedoms encouraging them to break through all their customary reserves for women to women thou knowest are great darers and incentives not one of them loving to be outdone or outdared when their hearts are thoroughly warmed i know at first the difficulty will be the accidental absence of my dear mrs lovelace to whom principally they will design their visit but if we can exhilarate them they wont then wish to see her and i can form twenty accidents and excuses from one hour to another for her absence till each shall have a subject to take up all her thoughts i am really sick at heart for a frolic and have no doubt but this will be an agreeable one these women already think me a wild fellow nor do they like me the less for it as i can perceive and i shall take care that they shall be treated with so much freedom before one anothers faces that in policy they shall keep each others counsel and wont this be doing a kind thing by them since it will knit an indissoluble band of union and friendship between three women who are neighbours and at present have only common obligations to one another for thou wantest not to be told that secrets of love and secrets of this nature are generally the strongest cement of female friendships but after all if my beloved should be happily restored to her intellects we may have scenes arise between us that will be sufficiently busy to employ all the faculties of thy friend without looking out for new occasions already as i have often observed has she been the means of saving scores of her sex yet without her own knowledge saturday night by dorcass account of her ladys behaviour the dear creature seems to be recovering i shall give the earliest notice of this to the worthy capt tomlinson that he may apprize uncle john of it i must be properly enabled from that quarter to pacify her or at least to rebate her first violence letter xvii mr lovelace to john belford esq sunday afternoon six oclock june i went out early this morning and returned not till just now when i was informed that my beloved in my absence had taken it into her head to attempt to get away she tripped down with a parcel tied up in a handkerchief her hood on and was actually in the entry when mrs sinclair saw her pray madam whipping between her and the streetdoor be pleased to let me know where you are going who has a right to controul me was the word i have madam by order of your spouse and kemboing her arms as she owned i desire you will be pleased to walk up again she would have spoken but could not and bursting into tears turned back and went up to her chamber and dorcas was taken to task for suffering her to be in the passage before she was seen this shows as we hoped last night that she is recovering her charming intellects dorcas says she was visible to her but once before the whole day and then she seemed very solemn and sedate i will endeavour to see her it must be in her own chamber i suppose for she will hardly meet me in the diningroom what advantage will the confidence of our sex give me over the modesty of hers if she be recovered i the most confident of men she the most delicate of women sweet soul methinks i have her before me her face averted speech lost in sighs abashed conscious what a triumphant aspect will this give me when i gaze on her downcast countenance this moment dorcas tells me she believes she is coming to find me out she asked her after me and dorcas left her drying her redswoln eyes at her glass no design of moving me by tears sighing too sensibly for my courage but to what purpose have i gone thus far if i pursue not my principal end niceness must be a little abated she knows the worst that she cannot fly me that she must see me and that i can look her into a sweet confusion are circumstances greatly in my favour what can she do but rave and exclaim i am used to raving and exclaiming but if recovered i shall see how she behaves upon this our first sensible interview after what she has suffered here she comes letter xviii mr lovelace to john belford esq sunday night never blame me for giving way to have art used with this admirable creature all the princes of the air or beneath it joining with me could never have subdued her while she had her senses i will not anticipate only to tell thee that i am too much awakened by her to think of sleep were i to go to bed and so shall have nothing to do but to write an account of our odd conversation while it is so strong upon my mind that i can think of nothing else she was dressed in a white damask nightgown with less negligence than for some days past i was sitting with my pen in my fingers and stood up when i first saw her with great complaisance as if the day were still her own and so indeed it is she entered with such dignity in her manner as struck me with great awe and prepared me for the poor figure i made in the subsequent conversation a poor figure indeed but i will do her justice she came up with quick steps pretty close to me a white handkerchief in her hand her eyes neither fierce nor mild but very earnest and a fixed sedateness in her whole aspect which seemed to be the effect of deep contemplation and thus she accosted me with an air and action that i never saw equalled you see before you sir the wretch whose preference of you to all your sex you have rewarded as it indeed deserved to be rewarded my fathers dreadful curse has already operated upon me in the very letter of it as to this life and it seems to me too evident that it will not be your fault that it is not entirely completed in the loss of my soul as well as of my honour which you villanous man have robbed me of with a baseness so unnatural so inhuman that it seems you even you had not the heart to attempt it till my senses were made the previous sacrifice here i made an hesitating effort to speak laying down my pen but she proceeded hear me out guilty wretch abandoned man man did i say yet what name else can i since the mortal worryings of the fiercest beast would have been more natural and infinitely more welcome that what you have acted by me and that with a premeditation and contrivance worthy only of that single heart which now base as well as ungrateful as thou art seems to quake within thee and well mayst thou quake well mayst thou tremble and falter and hesitate as thou dost when thou reflectest upon what i have suffered for thy sake and upon the returns thou hast made me by my soul belford my whole frame was shaken for not only her looks and her action but her voice so solemn was inexpressibly affecting and then my cursed guilt and her innocence and merit and rank and superiority of talents all stared me at that instant in the face so formidably that my present account to which she unexpectedly called me seemed as i then thought to resemble that general one to which we are told we shall be summoned when our conscience shall be our accuser but she had had time to collect all the powers of her eloquence the whole day probably in her intellects and then i was the more disappointed as i had thought i could have gazed the dear creature into confusion but it is plain that the sense she has of her wrongs sets this matchless woman above all lesser all weaker considerations my dear my love i i i never no never lips trembling limbs quaking voice inward hesitating broken never surely did miscreant look so like a miscreant while thus she proceeded waving her snowy hand with all the graces of moving oratory i have no pride in the confusion visible in thy whole person i have been all the day praying for a composure if i could not escape from this vile house that should once more enable me to look up to my destroyer with the consciousness of an innocent sufferer thou seest me since my wrongs are beyond the power of words to express thou seest me calm enough to wish that thou mayst continue harassed by the workings of thy own conscience till effectual repentance take hold of thee that so thou mayst not forfeit all title to that mercy which thou hast not shown to the poor creature now before thee who had so well deserved to meet with a faithful friend where she met with the worst of enemies but tell me for no doubt thou hast some scheme to pursue tell me since i am a prisoner as i find in the vilest of houses and have not a friend to protect or save me what thou intendest shall become of the remnant of a life not worth the keeping tell me if yet there are more evils reserved for me and whether thou hast entered into a compact with the grand deceiver in the person of his horrid agent in this house and if the ruin of my soul that my fathers curse may be fulfilled is to complete the triumphs of so vile a confederacy answer me say if thou hast courage to speak out to her whom thou hast ruined tell me what farther i am to suffer from thy barbarity she stopped here and sighing turned her sweet face from me drying up with her handkerchief those tears which she endeavoured to restrain and when she could not to conceal from my sight as i told thee i had prepared myself for high passions raving flying tearing execration these transient violences the workings of sudden grief and shame and vengeance would have set us upon a par with each other and quitted scores these have i been accustomed to and as nothing violent is lasting with these i could have wished to encounter but such a majestic composure seeking me whom yet it is plain by her attempt to get away she would have avoided seeking no lucretialike vengeance upon herself in her thought yet swallowed up her whole mind swallowed up as i may say by a grief so heavy as in her own words to be beyond the power of speech to express and to be able discomposed as she was to the very morning to put such a homequestion to me as if she had penetrated my future view how could i avoid looking like a fool and answering as before in broken sentences and confusion what whata what has been done i i i cannot but say must own must confess hem hemis not right is not what should have been buta but but i am truly truly sorry for it upon my soul i am and and will do all do every thing do what whatever is incumbent upon me all that you that you that you shall require to make you amends o belford belford whose the triumph now hers or mine amends o thou truly despicable wretch then lifting up her eyes good heaven who shall pity the creature who could fall by so base a mind yet and then she looked indignantly upon me yet i hate thee not base and lowsouled as thou art half so much as i hate myself that i saw thee not sooner in thy proper colours that i hoped either morality gratitude or humanity from a libertine who to be a libertine must have got over and defied all moral sanctions her cousin mordens words to her in his letter from florence see vol iv letter xix she then called upon her cousin mordens name as if he had warned her against a man of free principles and walked towards the window her handkerchief at her eyes but turning short towards me with an air of mingled scorn and majesty what at the moment would i have given never to have injured her what amends hast thou to propose what amends can such a one as thou make to a person of spirit or common sense for the evils thou hast so inhumanely made me suffer as soon madam as soon as as soon as your uncle or not waiting thou wouldest tell me i suppose i know what thou wouldest tell me but thinkest thou that marriage will satisfy for a guilt like thine destitute as thou hast made me both of friends and fortune i too much despise the wretch who could rob himself of his wifes virtue to endure the thoughts of thee in the light thou seemest to hope i will accept thee in i hesitated an interruption but my meaning died away upon my trembling lips i could only pronounce the word marriage and thus she proceeded let me therefore know whether i am to be controuled in the future disposal of myself whether in a country of liberty as this where the sovereign of it must not be guilty of your wickedness and where you neither durst have attempted it had i one friend or relation to look upon me i am to be kept here a prisoner to sustain fresh injuries whether in a word you intend to hinder me from going where my destiny shall lead me after a pause for i was still silent can you not answer me this plain question i quit all claim all expectation upon you what right have you to detain me here i could not speak what could i say to such a question o wretch wringing her uplifted hands had i not been robbed of my senses and that in the basest manner you best know how had i been able to account for myself and your proceedings or to have known but how the days passed a whole week should not have gone over my head as i find it has done before i had told you what i now tell you that the man who has been the villain to me you have been shall never make me his wife i will write to my uncle to lay aside his kind intentions in my favour all my prospects are shut in i give myself up for a lost creature as to this world hinder me not from entering upon a life of severe penitence for corresponding after prohibition with a wretch who has too well justified all their warnings and inveteracy and for throwing myself into the power of your vile artifices let me try to secure the only hope i have left this is all the amends i ask of you i repeat therefore am i now at liberty to dispose of myself as i please now comes the fool the miscreant again hesitating his broken answer my dearest love i am confounded quite confounded at the thought of what of what has been done and at the thought of to whom i see i see there is no withstanding your eloquence such irresistible proofs of the love of virtue for its own sake did i never hear of nor meet with in all my reading and if you can forgive a repentant villain who thus on his knees implores your forgiveness then down i dropt absolutely in earnest in all i said i vow by all thats sacred and just and may a thunderbolt strike me dead at your feet if i am not sincere that i will by marriage before tomorrow noon without waiting for your uncle or any body do you all the justice i now can do you and you shall ever after controul and direct me as you please till you have made me more worthy of your angelic purity than now i am nor will i presume so much as to touch your garment till i have the honour to call so great a blessing lawfully mine o thou guileful betrayer there is a just god whom thou invokest yet the thunderbolt descends not and thou livest to imprecate and deceive my dearest life rising for i hoped she was relenting hadst thou not sinned beyond the possibility of forgiveness interrupted she and this had been the first time that thus thou solemnly promisest and invokest the vengeance thou hast as often defied the desperateness of my condition might have induced me to think of taking a wretched chance with a man so profligate but after what i have suffered by thee it would be criminal in me to wish to bind my soul in covenant to a man so nearly allied to perdition good god how uncharitable i offer not to defend would to heaven that i could recall so nearly allied to perdition madam so profligate a man madam o how short is expression of thy crimes and of my sufferings such premeditation is thy baseness to prostitute the characters of persons of honour of thy own family and all to delude a poor creature whom thou oughtest but why talk i to thee be thy crimes upon thy head once more i ask thee am i or am i not at my own liberty now i offered to speak in defence of the women declaring that they really were the very persons presume not interrupted she base as thou art to say one word in thine own vindication i have been contemplating their behaviour their conversation their overready acquiescences to my declarations in thy disfavour their free yet affectedlyreserved light manners and now that the sad event has opened my eyes and i have compared facts and passages together in the little interval that has been lent me i wonder i could not distinguish the behaviour of the unmatronlike jilt whom thou broughtest to betray me from the worthy lady whom thou hast the honour to call thy aunt and that i could not detect the superficial creature whom thou passedst upon me for the virtuous miss montague amazing uncharitableness in a lady so good herself that the high spirits those ladies were in to see you should subject them to such censures i do must solemnly vow madam that they were interrupting me verily and indeed lady betty lawrance and thy cousin montague o wretch i see by thy solemn averment i had not yet averred it what credit ought to be given to all the rest had i no other proof interrupting her i besought her patient ear i had found myself i told her almost avowedly despised and hated i had no hope of gaining her love or her confidence the letter she had left behind her on her removal to hampstead sufficiently convinced me that she was entirely under miss howes influence and waited but the return of a letter from her to enter upon measures that would deprive me of her for ever miss howe had ever been my enemy more so then no doubt from the contents of the letter she had written to her on her first coming to hampstead that i dared not to stand the event of such a letter and was glad of an opportunity by lady bettys and my cousins means though they knew not my motive to get her back to town far at the time from intending the outrage which my despair and her want of confidence in me put me so vilely upon i would have proceeded and particularly would have said something of captain tomlinson and her uncle but she would not hear me further and indeed it was with visible indignation and not without several angry interruptions that she heard me say so much would i dare she asked me to offer at a palliation of my baseness the two women she was convinced were impostors she knew not but captain tomlinson and mr mennell were so too but whether they were so or not i was and she insisted upon being at her own disposal for the remainder of her short life for indeed she abhorred me in every light and more particularly in that in which i offered myself to her acceptance and saying this she flung from me leaving me absolutely shocked and confounded at her part of a conversation which she began with such uncommon however severe composure and concluded with so much sincere and unaffected indignation and now jack i must address one serious paragraph particularly to thee i have not yet touched upon cohabitation her uncles mediation she does not absolutely discredit as i had the pleasure to find by one hint in this conversation yet she suspects my future views and has doubt about mennell and tomlinson i do say if she come fairly at her lights at her clues or what shall i call them her penetration is wonderful but if she do not come at them fairly then is her incredulity then is her antipathy to me evidently accounted for i will speak out thou couldst not surely play me booty jack surely thou couldst not let thy weak pity for her lead thee to an unpardonable breach of trust to thy friend who has been so unreserved in his communications to thee i cannot believe thee capable of such a baseness satisfy me however upon this head i must make a cursed figure in her eye vowing and protesting as i shall not scruple occasionally to vow and protest if all the time she has had unquestionable informations of my perfidy i know thou as little fearest me as i do thee if any point of manhood and wilt scorn to deny it if thou hast done it when thus homepressed and here i have a good mind to stop and write no farther till i have thy answer and so i will monday morn past three letter xix mr lovelace to john belford esq monday morn five oclock june i must write on nothing else can divert me and i think thou canst not have been a dog to me i would fain have closed my eyes but sleep flies me well says horace as translated by cowley the halcyon sleep will never build his nest in any stormy breast tis not enough that he does find clouds and darkness in the mind darkness but half his work will do tis not enough he must find quiet too now indeed do i from my heart wish that i had never known this lady but who would have thought there had been such a woman in the world of all the sex i have hitherto known or heard or read of it was once subdued and always subdued the first struggle was generally the last or at least the subsequent struggles were so much fainter and fainter that a man would rather have them than be without them but how know i yet it is now near six the sun for two hours past has been illuminating every thing about me for that impartial orb shines upon mother sinclairs house as well as upon any other but nothing within me can it illuminate at daydawn i looked through the keyhole of my beloveds door she had declared she would not put off her clothes any more in this house there i beheld her in a sweet slumber which i hope will prove refreshing to her disturbed senses sitting in her elbowchair her apron over her head her head supported by one sweet hand the other hand hanging down upon her side in a sleepy lifelessness half of one pretty foot only visible see the difference in our cases thought i she the charming injured can sweetly sleep while the varlet injurer cannot close his eyes and has been trying to no purpose the whole night to divert his melancholy and to fly from himself as every vice generally brings on its own punishment even in this life if any thing were to tempt me to doubt of future punishment it would be that there can hardly be a greater than that in which i at this instant experience in my own remorse i hope it will go off if not well will the dear creature be avenged for i shall be the most miserable of men six oclock just now dorcas tells me that her lady is preparing openly and without disguise to be gone very probable the humour she flew away from me in last night has given me expectation of such an enterprize now jack to be thus hated and despised and if i have sinned beyond forgiveness but she has sent me a message by dorcas that she will meet me in the diningroom and desires odd enough that the wretch may be present at the conversation that shall pass between us this message gives me hope nine oclock confounded art cunning villany by my soul she had like to have slipped through my fingers she meant nothing by her message but to get dorcas out of the way and a clear coast is a fancied distress sufficient to justify this lady for dispensing with her principles does she not show me that she can wilfully deceive as well as i had she been in the forehouse and no passage to go through to get at the streetdoor she had certainly been gone but her haste betrayed her for sally martin happening to be in the foreparlour and hearing a swifter motion than usual and a rustling of silks as if from somebody in a hurry looked out and seeing who it was stept between her and the door and set her back against it you must not go madam indeed you must not by what right and how dare you and suchlike imperious airs the dear creature gave herself while sally called out for her aunt and half a dozen voiced joined instantly in the cry for me to hasten down to hasten down in a moment i was gravely instructing dorcas above stairs and wondering what would be the subject of the conversation to which the wench was to be a witness when these outcries reached my ears and down i flew and there was the charming creature the sweet deceiver panting for breath her back against the partition a parcel in her hand women make no excursions without their parcels sally polly but polly obligingly pleaded for her the mother mabell and peter the footman of the house about her all however keeping their distance the mother and sally between her and the door in her soft rage the dear soul repeating i will go nobody has a right i will go if you kill me women i wont go up again as soon as she saw me she stept a pace or two towards me mr lovelace i will go said she do you authorize these women what right have they or you either to stop me is this my dear preparative to the conversation you led me to expect in the diningroom and do you thing sic i can part with you thus do you think i will and am i sir to be thus beset surrounded thus what have these women to do with me i desired them to leave us all but dorcas who was down as soon as i i then thought it right to assume an air of resolution having found my tameness so greatly triumphed over and now my dear said i urging her reluctant feet be pleased to walk into the foreparlour here since you will not go up stairs here we may hold our parley and dorcas will be witness to it and now madam seating her and sticking my hands in my sides your pleasure insolent villain said the furious lady and rising ran to the window and threw up the sash she knew not i suppose that there were iron rails before the windows and when she found she could not get out into the street clasping her uplifted hands together having dropt her parcel for the love of god good honest man for the love of god mistress to two passers by a poor a poor creature said she ruined i clasped her in my arms people beginning to gather about the window and then she cried out murder help help and carried her up to the diningroom in spite of her little plotting heart as i may now call it although she violently struggled catching hold of the banisters here and there as she could i would have seated her there but she sunk down halfmotionless pale as ashes and a violent burst of tears happily relieved her dorcas wept over her the wench was actually moved for her violent hysterics succeeded i left her to mabell dorcas and polly the latter the most supportable to her of the sisterhood this attempt so resolutely made alarmed me not a little mrs sinclair and her nymphs are much more concerned because of the reputation of their house as they call it having received some insults broken windows threatened to make them produce the young creature who cried out while the mobbish inquisitors were in the height of their office the women came running up to me to know what they should do a constable being actually fetched get the constable into the parlour said i with three or four of the forwardest of the mob and produce one of the nymphs onioneyed in a moment with disordered headdress and handkerchief and let her own herself the person the occasion a female skirmish but satisfied with the justice done her then give a dram or two to each fellow and all will be well eleven oclock all done as i advised and all is well mrs sinclair wishes she had never seen the face of so skittish a lady and she and sally are extremely pressing with me to leave the perverse beauty to their breaking as they call it for four or five days but i cursed them into silence only ordering double precaution for the future polly though she consoled the dear perverse one all she could when with her insists upon it to me that nothing but terror will procure me tolerable usage dorcas was challenged by the women upon her tears she owned them real said she was ashamed of herself but could not help it so sincere so unyielding a grief in so sweet a lady the women laughed at her but i bid her make no apologies for her tears nor mind their laughing i was glad to see them so ready good use might be made of such strangers in short i would not have her indulge them often and try if it were not possible to gain her ladys confidence by her concern for her she said that her lady did take kind notice of them to her and was glad to see such tokens of humanity in her well then said i your part whether any thing come of it or not is to be tenderhearted it can do no harm if no good but take care you are not too suddenly or too officiously compassionate so dorcas will be a humane good sort of creature i believe very quickly with her lady and as it becomes women to be so and as my beloved is willing to think highly of her own sex it will the more readily pass with her i thought to have had one trial having gone so far for cohabitation but what hope can there be of succeeding she is invincible against all my motions against all my conceptions thinking of her as a woman and in the very bloom of her charms she is absolutely invincible my whole view at the present is to do her legal justice if i can but once more get her out of her altitudes the consent of such a woman must make her ever new ever charming but astonishing can the want of a churchceremony make such a difference she owes me her consent for hitherto i have had nothing to boast of all of my side has been deep remorse anguish of mind and love increased rather than abated how her proud rejection stings me and yet i hope still to get her to listen to my stories of the familyreconciliation and of her uncle and capt tomlinson and as she has given me a pretence to detain her against her will she must see me whether in temper or not she cannot help it and if love will not do terror as the women advise must be tried a nice part after all has my beloved to act if she forgive me easily i resume perhaps my projects if she carry her rejection into violence that violence may make me desperate and occasion fresh violence she ought since she thinks she has found the women out to consider where she is i am confoundedly out of conceit with myself if i give up my contrivances my joy in stratagem and plot and invention i shall be but a common man such another dull heavy creature as thyself yet what does even my success in my machinations bring me but regret disgrace repentance but i am overmatched egregiously overmatched by this woman what to do with her or without her i know not letter xx mr lovelace to john belford esq i have this moment intelligence from simon parsons one of lord ms stewards that his lordship is very ill simon who is my obsequious servant in virtue of my presumptive heirship gives me a hint in his letter that my presence at m hall will not be amiss so i must accelerate whatever be the course i shall be allowed or compelled to take no bad prospects for this charming creature if the old peer would be so kind as to surrender and many a summons has this gout given him a good ayear and perhaps the title reversionary or a still higher would help me up with her proudly as this lady pretends to be above all pride grandeur will have its charms with her for grandeur always makes a mans face shine in a womans eye i have a pretty good because a clear estate as it is but what a noble variety of mischief will ayear enable a man to do perhaps thoult say i do already all that comes into my head but thats a mistake not one half i will assure thee and even good folks as i have heard love to have the power of doing mischief whether they make use of it or not the late queen anne who was a very good woman was always fond of prerogative and her ministers in her name in more instances than one made a ministerial use of this her foible but now at last am i to be admitted to the presence of my angry fairone after three denials nevertheless and a peremptory from me by dorcas that i must see her in her chamber if i cannot see her in the diningroom dorcas however tells me that she says if she were at her own liberty she would never see me more and that she had been asking after the characters and conditions of the neighbours i suppose now she has found her voice to call out for help from them if there were any to hear her she will have it now it seems that i had the wickedness from the very beginning to contrive for her ruin a house so convenient for dreadful mischief dorcas begs of her to be pacified entreats her to see me with patience tells her that i am one of the most determined of men as she has heard say that gentleness may do with me but that nothing else will she believes and what as her ladyship as she always styles her is married if i had broken my oath or intended to break it she hinted plain enough to the honest wench that she was not married but dorcas would not understand her this shows she is resolved to keep no measures and now is to be a trial of skill whether she shall or not dorcas has hinted to her my lords illness as a piece of intelligence that dropt in conversation from me but here i stop my beloved pursuant to my peremptory message is just gone up into the diningroom letter xxi mr lovelace to john belford esq monday afternoon pity me jack for pitys sake since if thou dost not nobody else will and yet never was there a man of my genius and lively temper that wanted it more we are apt to attribute to the devil every thing happens to us which we would not have happen but here being as perhaps thoult say the devil myself my plagues arise from an angel i suppose all mankind is to be plagued by its contrary she began with me like a true woman she in the fault i to be blamed the moment i entered the diningroom not the least apology not the least excuse for the uproar she had made and the trouble she had given me i come said she into thy detested presence because i cannot help it but why am i to be imprisoned here although to no purpose i cannot help dearest madam interrupted i give not way to so much violence you must know that your detention is entirely owing to the desire i have to make you all the amends that is in my power to make you and this as well for your sake as my own surely there is still one way left to repair the wrongs you have suffered canst thou blot out the past week several weeks past i should say ever since i have been with thee canst thou call back time if thou canst surely madam again interrupting her if i may be permitted to call you legally mine i might have but anticip wretch that thou art say not another word upon this subject when thou vowedst when thou promisedst at hampstead i had begun to think that i must be thine if i had consented at the request of those i thought thy relations this would have been a principal inducement that i could then have brought thee what was most wanted an unsullied honour in dowry to a wretch destitute of all honour and could have met the gratulations of a family to which thy life has been one continued disgrace with a consciousness of deserving their gratulations but thinkest thou that i will give a harlot niece to thy honourable uncle and to thy real aunts and a cousin to thy cousins from a brothel for such in my opinion is this detested house then lifting up her clasped hands great and good god of heaven said she give me patience to support myself under the weight of those afflictions which thou for wise and good ends though at present impenetrable by me hast permitted then turning towards me who knew neither what to say to her nor for myself i renounce thee for ever lovelace abhorred of my soul for ever i renounce thee seek thy fortunes wheresoever thou wilt only now that thou hast already ruined me ruined you madam the world need not i knew not what to say ruined me in my own eyes and that is the same to me as if all the world knew it hinder me not from going whither my mysterious destiny shall lead me why hesitate you sir what right have you to stop me as you lately did and to bring me up by force my hands and arms bruised by your violence what right have you to detain me here i am cut to the heart madam with invectives so violent i am but too sensible of the wrong i have done you or i could not bear your reproaches the man who perpetrates a villany and resolves to go on with it shows not the compunction i show yet if you think yourself in my power i would caution you madam not to make me desperate for you shall be mine or my life shall be the forfeit nor is life worth having without you be thine i be thine said the passionate beauty o how lovely in her violence yes madam be mine i repeat you shall be mine my very crime is your glory my love my admiration of you is increased by what has passed and so it ought i am willing madam to court your returning favour but let me tell you were the house beset by a thousand armed men resolved to take you from me they should not effect their purpose while i had life i never never will be yours said she clasping her hands together and lifting up her eyes i never will be yours we may yet see many happy years madam all your friends may be reconciled to you the treaty for that purpose is in greater forwardness than you imagine you know better than to think the worse of yourself for suffering what you could not help enjoin but the terms i can make my peace with you upon and i will instantly comply never never repeated she will i be yours only forgive me my dearest life this one time a virtue so invincible what further view can i have against you have i attempted any further outrage if you will be mine your injuries will be injuries done to myself you have too well guessed at the unnatural arts that have been used but can a greater testimony be given of your virtue and now i have only to hope that although i cannot make you complete amends yet you will permit me to make you all the amends that can possibly be made here sic me out i beseech you madam for she was going to speak with an aspect unpacifiedly angry the god whom you serve requires but repentance and amendment imitate him my dearest love and bless me with the means of reforming a course of life that begins to be hateful to me that was once your favourite point resume it dearest creature in charity to a soul as well as body which once as i flattered myself was more than indifferent to you resume it and let tomorrows sun witness to our espousals i cannot judge thee said she but the god to whom thou so boldly referrest can and assure thyself he will but if compunction has really taken hold of thee if indeed thou art touched for thy ungrateful baseness and meanest any thing by this pleading the holy example thou recommendest to my imitation in this thy pretended repentant moment let me sift thee thoroughly and by thy answer i shall judge of the sincerity of thy pretended declarations tell me then is there any reality in the treaty thou has pretended to be on foot between my uncle and capt tomlinson and thyself say and hesitate not is there any truth in that story but remember if there be not and thou avowest that there is what further condemnation attends to thy averment if it be as solemn as i require it to be this was a cursed thrust what could i say surely this merciless lady is resolved to d n me thought i and yet accuses me of a design against her soul but was i not obliged to proceed as i had begun in short i solemnly averred that there was how one crime as the good folks say brings on another i added that the captain had been in town and would have waited on her had she not been indisposed that he went down much afflicted as well on her account as on that of her uncle though i had not acquainted him either with the nature of her disorder or the evertoberegretted occasion of it having told him that it was a violent fever that he had twice since by her uncles desire sent up to inquire after her health and that i had already dispatched a man and horse with a letter to acquaint him and her uncle through him with her recovery making it my earnest request that he would renew his application to her uncle for the favour of his presence at the private celebrations of our nuptials and that i expected an answer if not this night as tomorrow let me ask thee next said she thou knowest the opinion i have of the women thou broughtest to me at hampstead and who have seduced me hither to my ruin let me ask thee if really and truly they were lady betty lawrance and thy cousin montague what sayest thou hesitate not what sayest thou to this question astonishing my dear that you should suspect them but knowing your strange opinion of them what can i say to be believed and is this the answer thou returnest me dost thou thus evade my question but let me know for i am trying thy sincerity now and all shall judge of thy new professions by thy answer to this question let me know i repeat whether those women be really lady betty lawrance and thy cousin montague let me my dearest love be enabled tomorrow to call you lawfully mine and we will set out the next day if you please to berkshire to my lord ms where they both are at this time and you shall convince yourself by your own eyes and by your own ears which you will believe sooner than all i can say or swear now belford i had really some apprehension of treachery from thee which made me so miserably evade for else i could as safely have sworn to the truth of this as to that of the former but she pressing me still for a categorical answer i ventured plumb and swore to it lovers oaths jack that they were really and truly lady betty lawrance and my cousin montague she lifted up her hands and eyes what can i think what can i think you think me a devil madam a very devil or you could not after you have put these questions to me seem to doubt the truth of answers so solemnly sworn to and if i do think thee so have i not cause is there another man in the world i hope for the sake of human nature there is not who could act by any poor friendless creature as thou hast acted by me whom thou hast made friendless and who before i knew thee had for a friend every one who knew me i told you madam before that lady betty and my cousin were actually here in order to take leave of you before they set out for berkshire but the effects of my ungrateful crime such with shame and remorse i own it to be were the reason you could not see them nor could i be fond that they should see you since they never would have forgiven me had they known what had passed and what reason had i to expect your silence on the subject had you been recovered it signifies nothing now that the cause of their appearance has been answered in my ruin who or what they are but if thou hast averred thus solemnly to two falsehoods what a wretch do i see before me i thought she had now reason to be satisfied and i begged her to allow me to talk to her of tomorrow as of the happiest day of my life we have the license madam and you must excuse me that i cannot let you go hence till i have tried every way i can to obtain your forgiveness and am i then with a kind of frantic wildness to be detained a prisoner in this horrid house am i sir take care take care holding up her hand menacing how you make me desperate if i fall though by my own hand inquisition will be made for my blood and be not out in thy plot lovelace if it should be so make sure work i charge thee dig a hole deep enough to cram in and conceal this unhappy body for depend upon it that some of those who will not stir to protect me living will move heaven and earth to avenge me dead a horrid dear creature by my soul she made me shudder she had need indeed to talk of her unhappiness in falling into the hands of the only man in the world who could have used her as i have used her she is the only woman in the world who could have shocked and disturbed me as she has done so we are upon a foot in that respect and i think i have the worst of it by much since very little has been my joy very much my trouble and her punishment as she calls it is over but when mine will or what it may be who can tell here only recapitulating think then how i must be affected at the time i was forced to leave off and sing a song to myself i aimed at a lively air but i croaked rather than sung and fell into the old dismal thirtieth of january strain i hemmed up for a sprightlier note but it would not do and at last i ended like a malefactor in a dead psalm melody heighho i gape like an unfledged kite in its nest wanting to swallow a chicken bobbed at its mouth by its marauding dam what adevil ails me i can neither think nor write lie down pen for a moment letter xxii mr lovelace to john belford esq there is certainly a good deal in the observation that it costs a man ten times more pains to be wicked than it would cost him to be good what a confounded number of contrivances have i had recourse to in order to carry my point with this charming creature and yet after all how have i puzzled myself by it and yet am near tumbling into the pit which it was the end of all my plots to shun what a happy man had i been with such an excellence could i have brought my mind to marry when i first prevailed upon her to quit her fathers house but then as i have often reflected how had i known that a but blossoming beauty who could carry on a private correspondence and run such risques with a notorious wild fellow was not prompted by inclination which one day might give such a freeliver as myself as much pain to reflect upon as at the time it gave me pleasure thou rememberest the hosts tale in ariosto and thy experience as well as mine can furnish out twenty fiamettas in proof of the imbecility of the sex but to proceed with my narrative the dear creature resumed the topic her heart was so firmly fixed upon and insisted upon quitting the odious house and that in very high terms i urged her to meet me the next day at the altar in either of the two churches mentioned in the license and i besought her whatever was her resolution to let me debate this matter calmly with her if she said i would have her give what i desired the least moments consideration i must not hinder her from being her own mistress to what purpose did i ask her consent if she had not a power over either her own person or actions will you give me your honour madam if i consent to your quitting a house so disagreeable to you my honour sir said the dear creature alas and turned weeping from me with inimitable grace as if she had said alas you have robbed me of my honour i hoped then that her angry passions were subsiding but i was mistaken for urging her warmly for the day and that for the sake of our mutual honour and the honour of both our families in this highflown and highsouled strain she answered me and canst thou lovelace be so mean as to wish to make a wife of the creature thou hast insulted dishonoured and abused as thou hast me was it necessary to humble me down to the low level of thy baseness before i could be a wife meet for thee thou hadst a father who was a man of honour a mother who deserved a better son thou hast an uncle who is no dishonour to the peerage of a kingdom whose peers are more respectable than the nobility of any other country thou hast other relations also who may be thy boast though thou canst not be theirs and canst thou not imagine that thou hearest them calling upon thee the dead from their monuments the living from their laudable pride not to dishonour thy ancient and splendid house by entering into wedlock with a creature whom thou hast levelled with the dirt of the street and classed with the vilest of her sex i extolled her greatness of soul and her virtue i execrated myself for my guilt and told her how grateful to the manes of my ancestors as well as to the wishes of the living the honour i supplicated for would be but still she insisted upon being a free agent of seeing herself in other lodgings before she would give what i urged the least consideration nor would she promise me favour even then or to permit my visits how then as i asked her could i comply without resolving to lose her for ever she put her hand to her forehead often as she talked and at last pleading disorder in her head retired neither of us satisfied with the other but she ten times more dissatisfied with me than i with her dorcas seems to be coming into favour with her what now what now monday night how determined is this lady again had she like to have escaped us what a fixed resentment she only i find assumed a little calm in order to quiet suspicion she was got down and actually had unbolted the streetdoor before i could get to her alarmed as i was by mrs sinclairs cookmaid who was the only one that saw her fly through the passage yet lightning was not quicker than i again i brought her back to the diningroom with infinite reluctance on her part and before her face ordered a servant to be placed constantly at the bottom of the stairs for the future she seemed even choked with grief and disappointment dorcas was exceedingly assiduous about her and confidently gave it as her own opinion that her dear lady should be permitted to go to another lodging since this was so disagreeable to her were she to be killed for saying so she would say it and was good dorcas for this afterwards but for some time the dear creature was all passion and violence i see i see said she when i had brought her up what i am to expect from your new professions o vilest of men have i offered t you my beloved creature any thing that can justify this impatience after a more hopeful calm she wrung her hands she disordered her headdress she tore her ruffles she was in a perfect phrensy i dreaded her returning malady but entreaty rather exasperating i affected an angry air i bid her expect the worst she had to fear and was menacing on in hopes to intimidate her when dropping to my feet twill be a mercy said she the highest act of mercy you can do to kill me outright upon this spot this happy spot as i will in my last moments call it then baring with a still more frantic violence part of her enchanting neck here here said the soulharrowing beauty let thy pointed mercy enter and i will thank thee and forgive thee for all the dreadful past with my latest gasp will i forgive and thank thee or help me to the means and i will myself put out of the way so miserable a wretch and bless thee for those means why all this extravagant passion why all these exclamations have i offered any new injury to you my dearest life what a phrensy is this am i not ready to make you all the reparation that i can make you had i not reason to hope no no no no as before shaking her head with wild impatience as resolved not to attend to what i said my resolutions are so honourable if you will permit them to take effect that i need not be solicitous where you go if you will but permit my visits and receive my vows and god is my witness that i bring you not back from the door with any view to your dishonour but the contrary and this moment i will send for a minister to put an end to all your doubts and fears say this and say a thousand times more and bind every word with a solemn appeal to that god whom thou art accustomed to invoke to the truth of the vilest falsehoods and all will still be short of what thou has vowed and promised to me and were not my heart to abhor thee and to rise against thee for thy perjuries as it does i would not i tell thee once more i would not bind my soul in covenant with such a man for a thousand worlds compose yourself however madam for your own sake compose yourself permit me to raise you up abhorred as i am of your soul nay if i must not touch you for she wildly slapt my hands but with such a sweet passionate air her bosom heaving and throbbing as she looked up to me that although i was most sincerely enraged i could with transport have pressed her to mine if i must not touch you i will not but depend upon it and i assumed the sternest air i could assume to try what it would do depend upon it madam that this is not the way to avoid the evils you dread let me do what i will i cannot be used worse dorcas begone she arose dorcas being about to withdraw and wildly caught hold of her arm o dorcas if thou art of mine own sex leave me not i charge thee then quitting dorcas down she threw herself upon her knees in the furthermost corner of the room clasping a chair with her face laid upon the bottom of it o where can i be safe where where can i be safe from this man of violence this gave dorcas an opportunity to confirm herself in her ladys confidence the wench threw herself at my feet while i seemed in violent wrath and embracing my knees kill me sir kill me sir if you please i must throw myself in your way to save my lady i beg your pardon sir but you must be set on god forgive the mischiefmakers but your own heart if left to itself would not permit these things spare however sir spare my lady i beseech you bustling on her knees about me as if i were intending to approach her lady had i not been restrained by her this humoured by me begone devil officious devil begone startled the dear creature who snatching up hastily her head from the chair and as hastily popping it down again in terror hit her nose i suppose against the edge of the chair and it gushed out with blood running in a stream down her bosom she herself was too much frighted to heed it never was mortal man in such terror and agitation as i for i instantly concluded that she had stabbed herself with some concealed instrument i ran to her in a wild agony for dorcas was frighted out of all her mock interposition what have you done o what have you done look up to me my dearest life sweet injured innocence look up to me what have you done long will i not survive you and i was upon the point of drawing my sword to dispatch myself when i discovered what an unmanly blockhead does this charming creature make me at her pleasure that all i apprehended was but a bloody nose which as far as i know for it could not be stopped in a quarter of an hour may have saved her head and her intellects but i see by this scene that the sweet creature is but a pretty coward at bottom and that i can terrify her out of her virulence against me whenever i put on sternness and anger but then as a qualifier to the advantage this gives me over her i find myself to be a coward too which i had not before suspected since i was capable of being so easily terrified by the apprehensions of her offering violence to herself letter xxiii mr lovelace to john belford esq but with all this dear creatures resentment against me i cannot for my heart think but she will get all over and consent to enter the pale with me were she even to die tomorrow and to know she should would not a woman of her sense of her punctilio and in her situation and of so proud a family rather die married than otherwise no doubt but she would although she were to hate the man ever so heartily if so there is now but one man in the world whom she can have and that is me now i talk familiar writing is but talking jack thus glibly of entering the pale thou wilt be ready to question me i know as to my intentions on this head as much of my heart as i know of it myself will i tell thee when i am from her i cannot still help hesitating about marriage and i even frequently resolve against it and determine to press my favourite scheme for cohabitation but when i am with her i am ready to say to swear and to do whatever i think will be the most acceptable to her and were a parson at hand i should plunge at once no doubt of it into the state i have frequently thought in common cases that it is happy for many giddy fellows there are giddy fellows as well as giddy girls jack and perhaps those are as often drawn in as these that ceremony and parade are necessary to the irrevocable solemnity and that there is generally time for a man to recollect himself in the space between the heated overnight and the cooler next morning or i know not who could escape the sweet gypsies whose fascinating powers are so much aided by our own raised imaginations a wife at any time i used to say i had ever confidence and vanity enough to think that no woman breathing could deny her hand when i held out mine i am confoundedly mortified to find that this lady is able to hold me at bay and to refuse all my honest vows what force allow me a serious reflection jack it will be put down what force have evil habits upon the human mind when we enter upon a devious course we think we shall have it in our power when we will return to the right path but it is not so i plainly see for who can acknowledge with more justice this dear creatures merits and his own errors than i whose regret at times can be deeper than mine for the injuries i have done her whose resolutions to repair those injuries stronger yet how transitory is my penitence how am i hurried away canst thou tell by what o devil of youth and devil of intrigue how do you mislead me how often do we end in occasions for the deepest remorse what we begin in wantonness at the present writing however the turn of the scale is in behalf of matrimony for i despair of carrying with her my favourite point the lady tells dorcas that her heart is broken and that she shall live but a little while i think nothing of that if we marry in the first place she knows not what a mind unapprehensive will do for her in a state to which all the sex look forwards with high satisfaction how often have the whole of the sacred conclave been thus deceived in their choice of a pope not considering that the new dignity is of itself sufficient to give new life a few months hearts ease will give my charmer a quite different notion of things and i dare say as i have heretofore said once married and i am married for life see letter ix of this volume i will allow that her pride in one sense has suffered abasement but her triumph is the greater in every other and while i can think that all her trials are but additions to her honour and that i have laid the foundations of her glory in my own shame can i be called cruel if i am not affected with her grief as some men would be and for what should her heart be broken her will is unviolated at present however her will is unviolated the destroying of good habits and the introducing of bad to the corrupting of the whole heart is the violation that her will is not to be corrupted that her mind is not to be debased she has hitherto unquestionably proved and if she give cause for farther trials and hold fast her integrity what ideas will she have to dwell upon that will be able to corrupt her morals what vestigia what remembrances but such as will inspire abhorrence of the attempter what nonsense then to suppose that such a mere notional violation as she has suffered should be able to cut asunder the strings of life her religion married or not married will set her above making such a trifling accident such an involuntary suffering fatal to her such considerations as these they are that support me against all apprehensions of bugbear consequences and i would have them have weight with thee who are such a doughty advocate for her and yet i allow thee this that she really makes too much of it takes it too much to heart to be sure she ought to have forgot it by this time except the charming charming consequence happen that still i am in hopes will happen were i to proceed no farther and if she apprehended this herself then has the dear overnice soul some reason for taking it so much to heart and yet would not i think refuse to legitimate o jack had i am imperial diadem i swear to thee that i would give it up even to my enemy to have one charming boy by this lady and should she escape me and no such effect follow my revenge on her family and in such a case on herself would be incomplete and i should reproach myself as long as i lived were i to be sure that this foundation is laid and why may i not hope it is i should not doubt to have her still should she withstand her day of grace on my own conditions nor should i if it were so question that revived affection in her which a woman seldom fails to have for the father of her first child whether born in wedlock or out of it and prythee jack see in this my ardent hope a distinction in my favour from other rakes who almost to a man follow their inclinations without troubling themselves about consequences in imitation as one would think of the strutting villain of a bird which from feathered lady to feathered lady pursues his imperial pleasures leaving it to his sleek paramours to hatch the genial product in holes and corners of their own finding out letter xxiv mr lovelace to john belford esq tuesday morn june well jack now are we upon another footing together this dear creature will not let me be good she is now authorizing all my plots by her own example thou must be partial in the highest degree if now thou blamest me for resuming my former schemes since in that case i shall but follow her cue no forced construction of her actions do i make on this occasion in order to justify a bad cause or a worse intention a slight pretence indeed served the wolf when he had a mind to quarrel with the lamb but this is not now my case for here wouldst thou have thought it taking advantage of dorcass compassionate temper and of some warm expressions which the tenderhearted wench let fall against the cruelty of men and wishing to have it in her power to serve her has she given her the following note signed by her maiden name for she has thought fit in positive and plain words to own to the pitying dorcas that she is not married monday june i then underwritten do hereby promise that on my coming into possession of my own estate i will provide for dorcas martindale in a gentlewoman like manner in my own house or if i do not soon obtain that possession or should first die i do hereby bind myself my executors and administrators to pay to her or her order during the term of her natural life the sum of five pounds on each of the four usual quarterly days in the year on condition that she faithfully assist me in my escape from an illegal confinement under which i now labour the first quarterly payment to commence and be payable at the end of three months immediately following the day of my deliverance and i do also promise to give her as a testimony of my honour in the rest a diamond ring which i have showed her witness my hand this nineteenth day of june in the year above written clarissa harlowe now jack what terms wouldst thou have me to keep with such a sweet corruptress seest thou not how she hates me seest thou not that she is resolved never to forgive me seest thou not however that she must disgrace herself in the eye of the world if she actually should escape that she must be subjected to infinite distress and hazard for whom has she to receive and protect her yet to determine to risque all these evils and furthermore to stoop to artifice to be guilty of the reigning vice of the times of bribery and corruption o jack jack say not write not another word in her favour thou hast blamed me for bringing her to this house but had i carried her to any other in england where there would have been one servant or inmate capable either of compassion or corruption what must have been the consequence but seest thou not however that in this flimsy contrivance the dear implacable like a drowning man catches at a straw to save herself a straw shall she find to be the refuge she has resorted to letter xxv mr lovelace to john belford esq tues morn ten oclock very ill exceedingly ill as dorcas tells me in order to avoid seeing me and yet the dear soul may be so in her mind but is not that equivocation some one passion predominating in every human breast breaks through principle and controuls us all mine is love and revenge taking turns hers is hatred but this is my consolation that hatred appeased is love begun or love renewed i may rather say if love ever had footing here but reflectioning apart thou seest jack that her plot is beginning to work tomorrow is to break out i have been abroad to set on foot a plot of circumvention all fair now belford i insisted upon visiting my indisposed fairone dorcas made officious excuses for her i cursed the wench in her hearing for her impertinence and stamped and made a clutter which was improved into an apprehension to the lady that i would have flung her faithful confidante from the top of the stairs to the bottom he is a violent wretch but dorcas dear dorcas now it is thou shalt have a friend in me to the last day of my life and what now jack dost think the name of her good angel is why dorcas martindale christian and super no more wykes as in the promissory note in my former and the dear creature has bound her to her by the most solemn obligations besides the tie of interest whither madam do you design to go when you get out of this house i will throw myself into the first open house i can find and beg protection till i can get a coach or a lodging in some honest family what will you do for clothes madam i doubt youll be able to take any away with you but what youll have on o no matter for clothes if i can but get out of this house what will you do for money madam i have heard his honour express his concern that he could not prevail upon you to be obliged to him though he apprehended that you must be short of money o i have rings and other valuables indeed i have but four guineas and two of them i found lately wrapt up in a bit of lace designed for a charitable use but now alas charity begins at home but i have one dear friend left if she be living as i hope in god she is to whom i can be obliged if i want o dorcas i must ere now have heard from her if i had had fair play well madam yours is a hard lot i pity you at my heart thank you dorcas i am unhappy that i did not think before that i might have confided in thy pity and in thy sex i pitied you madam often and often but you were always as i thought diffident of me and then i doubted not but you were married and i thought his honour was unkindly used by you so that i thought it my duty to wish well to his honour rather than to what i thought to be your humours madam would to heaven that i had known before that you were not married such a lady such a fortune to be so sadly betrayed ah dorcas i was basely drawn in my youth my ignorance of the world and i have some things to reproach myself with when i look back lord madam what deceitful creatures are these men neither oaths nor vows i am sure i am sure and then with her apron she gave her eyes half a dozen hearty rubs i may curse the time that i came into this house here was accounting for her bold eyes and was it not better for dorcas to give up a house which her lady could not think worse of than she did in order to gain the reputation of sincerity than by offering to vindicate it to make her proffered services suspected poor dorcas bless me how little do we who have lived all our time in the country know of this wicked town had i been able to write cried the veteran wench i should certainly have given some other near relations i have in wales a little inkling of matters and they would have saved me fromfromfrom her sobs were enough the apprehensions of women on such subjects are ever aforehand with speech and then sobbing on she lifted her apron to her face again she showed me how poor dorcas again wiping her own charming eyes all love all compassion is this dear creature to every one in affliction but me and would not an aunt protect her kinswoman abominable wretch i cant i cant i cant say my aunt was privy to it she gave me good advice she knew not for a great while that i was that i was that i was ugh ugh ugh no more no more good dorcas what a world do we live in what a house am i in but come dont weep though she herself could not forbear my being betrayed into it though to my own ruin may be a happy event for thee and if i live it shall i thank you my good lady blubbering i am sorry very sorry you have had so hard a lot but it may be the saving of my soul if i can get to your ladyships house had i but known that your ladyship was not married i would have eat my own flesh beforebeforebefore dorcas sobbed and wept the lady sighed and wept also but now jack for a serious reflection upon the premises how will the good folks account for it that satan has such faithful instruments and that the bond of wickedness is a stronger bond than the ties of virtue as if it were the nature of the human mind to be villanous for here had dorcas been good and been tempted as she was tempted to any thing evil i make no doubt but she would have yielded to the temptation and cannot our fraternity in an hundred instances give proof of the like predominance of vice over virtue and that we have risked more to serve and promote the interests of the former than ever a good man did to serve a good man or a good cause for have we not been prodigal of life and fortune have we not defied the civil magistrate upon occasion and have we not attempted rescues and dared all things only to extricate a pounded profligate whence jack can this be o i have it i believe the vicious are as bad as they can be and do the devils work without looking after while he is continually spreading snares for the others and like a skilful angler suiting his baits to the fish he angles for nor let even honest people so called blame poor dorcas for her fidelity in a bad cause for does not the general who implicitly serves an ambitious prince in his unjust designs upon his neighbours or upon his own oppressed subjects and even the lawyer who for the sake of a paltry fee undertakes to whiten a black cause and to defend it against one he knows to be good do the very same thing as dorcas and are they not both every whit as culpable yet the one shall be dubbed a hero the other called an admirable fellow and be contended for by every client and his doubletongued abilities shall carry him through all the high preferments of the law with reputation and applause well but what shall be done since the lady is so much determined on removing is there no way to oblige her and yet to make the very act subservient to my other views i fancy such a way may be found out i will study for it suppose i suffer her to make an escape her heart is in it if she effect it the triumph she will have over me upon it will be a counterbalance for all she has suffered i will oblige her if i can letter xxvi mr lovelace to john belford esq tired with a succession of fatiguing days and sleepless nights and with contemplating the precarious situation i stand in with my beloved i fell into a profound reverie which brought on sleep and that produced a dream a fortunate dream which as i imagine will afford my working mind the means to effect the obliging double purpose my heart is now once more set upon what as i have often contemplated is the enjoyment of the finest woman in the world to the contrivance the bustle the surprises and at last the happy conclusion of a welllaid plot the charming roundabouts to come to the nearest way home the doubts the apprehensions the heartachings the meditated triumphs these are the joys that make the blessing dear for all the rest what is it what but to find an angel in imagination dwindled down to a woman in factbut to my dream methought it was about nine on wednesday morning that a chariot with a dowagers arms upon the doors and in it a grave matronly lady not unlike mother h in the face but in her heart oh how unlike stopped at a grocers shop about ten doors on the other side of the way in order to buy some groceries and methought dorcas having been out to see if the coast were clear for her ladys flight and if a coach were to be got near the place espied the chariot with the dowagers arms and this matronly lady and what methought did dorcas that subtle traitress do but whip up to the old matronly lady and lifting up her voice say good my lady permit me one word with your ladyship what thou hast to say to me say on quoth the old lady the grocer retiring and standing aloof to give dorcas leave to speak who methought in words like these accosted the lady you seem madam to be a very good lady and here in this neighbourhood at a house of no high repute is an innocent lady of rank and fortune beautiful as a may morning and youthful as a rosebud and full as sweet and lovely who has been tricked thither by a wicked gentleman practised in the ways of the town and this very night will she be ruined if she get not out of his hands now o lady if you will extend your compassionate goodness to this fair young lady in whom the moment you behold her you will see cause to believe all i say and let her but have a place in your chariot and remain in your protection for one day only till she can send a man and horse to her rich and powerful friends you may save from ruin a lady who has no equal for virtue as well as beauty methought the old lady moved with dorcass story answered and said hasten o damsel who in a happy moment art come to put it in my power to serve the innocent and virtuous which it has always been my delight to do hasten to this young lady and bid her hie hither to me with all speed and tell her that my chariot shall be her asylum and if i find all that thou sayest true my house shall be her sanctuary and i will protect her from all her oppressors hereupon methought this traitress dorcas hied back to the lady and made report of what she had done and methought the lady highly approved of dorcass proceeding and blessed her for her good thought and i lifted up mine eyes and behold the lady issued out of the house and without looking back ran to the chariot with the dowagers coat upon it and was received by the matronly lady with open arms and welcome welcome welcome fair young lady who so well answer the description of the faithful damsel and i will carry you instantly to my house where you shall meet with all the good usage your heart can wish for till you can apprize your rich and powerful friends of your past dangers and present escape thank you thank you thank you thank you worthy thrice worthy lady who afford so kindly your protection to a most unhappy young creature who has been basely seduced and betrayed and brought to the very brink of destruction methought then the matronly lady who had by the time the young lady came to her bought and paid for the goods she wanted ordered her coachman to drive home with all speed who stopped not till he had arrived in a certain street not far from lincolnsinnfields where the matronly lady lived in a sumptuous dwelling replete with damsels who wrought curiously in muslins cambrics and fine linen and in every good work that industrious damsels love to be employed about except the loom and the spinningwheel and methought all the way the young lady and the old lady rode and after they came in till dinner was ready the young lady filled up the time with the dismal account of her wrongs and her sufferings the like of which was never heard by mortal ear and this in so moving a manner that the good old lady did nothing but weep and sigh and sob and inveigh against the arts of wicked men and against that abominable squire lovelace who was a plotting villain methought she said and more than that an unchained beelzebub methought i was in a dreadful agony when i found the lady had escaped and in my wrath had like to have slain dorcas and our mother and every one i met but by some quick transition and strange metamorphosis which dreams do not usually account for methought all of a sudden this matronly lady turned into the famous mother h herself and being an old acquaintance of mother sinclair was prevailed upon to assist in my plot upon the young lady then methought followed a strange scene for mother h longing to hear more of the young ladys story and night being come besought her to accept of a place in her own bed in order to have all the talk to themselves for methought two young nieces of hers had broken in upon them in the middle of the dismal tale accordingly going early to bed and the sad story being resumed with as great earnestness on one side as attention on the other before the young lady had gone far in it mother h methought was taken with a fit of the colic and her tortures increasing was obliged to rise to get a cordial she used to find specific in this disorder to which she was unhappily subject having thus risen and stept to her closet methought she let fall the wax taper in her return and then o metamorphosis still stranger than the former what unaccountable things are dreams coming to bed again in the dark the young lady to her infinite astonishment grief and surprise found mother h turned into a young person of the other sex and although lovelace was the abhorred of her soul yet fearing it was some other person it was matter of consolation to her when she found it was no other than himself and that she had been still the bedfellow of but one and the same man a strange promiscuous huddle of adventures followed scenes perpetually shifting now nothing heard from the lady but sighs groans exclamations faintings dyings from the gentleman but vows promises protestations disclaimers of purposes pursued and all the gentle and ungentle pressures of the lovers warfare then as quick as thought for dreams thou knowest confine not themselves to the rules of the drama ensued recoveries lyingsin christenings the smiling boy amply even in her own opinion rewarding the suffering mother then the grandfathers estate yielded up possession taken of it living very happily upon it her beloved norton her companion miss howe her visiter and admirable thrice admirable enabled to compare notes with her a charming girl by the same father to her friends charming boy who as they grow up in order to consolidate their mammas friendships for neither have dreams regard to consanguinity intermarry change names by act of parliament to enjoy my estate and i know not what of the like incongruous stuff i awoke as thou mayest believe in great disorder and rejoiced to find my charmer in the next room and dorcas honest now thou wilt say this was a very odd dream and yet for i am a strange dreamer it is not altogether improbable that something like it may happen as the pretty simpleton has the weakness to confide in dorcas whom till now she disliked but i forgot to tell thee one part of my dream and that was that the next morning the lady gave way to such transports of grief and resentment that she was with difficulty diverted from making an attempt upon her own life but however at last was prevailed upon to resolve to live and make the best of the matter a letter methought from captain tomlinson helping to pacify her written to apprize me that her uncle harlowe would certainly be at kentishtown on wednesday night june the following day the th being his birthday and be doubly desirous on that account that our nuptials should be then privately solemnized in his presence but is thursday the th her uncles anniversary methinks thou askest it is or else the day of celebration should have been earlier still three weeks ago i heard her say it was and i have down the birthday of every one in the family and the weddingday of her father and mother the minutest circumstances are often of great service in matters of the last importance and what sayest thou now to my dream who says that sleeping and waking i have not fine helps from somebody some spirit rather as thoult be apt to say but no wonder that a beelzebub has his devilkins to attend his call i can have no manner of doubt of succeeding in mother hs part of the scheme for will the lady who resolves to throw herself into the first house she can enter or to bespeak the protection of the first person she meets and who thinks there can be no danger out of this house equal to what she apprehends from me in it scruple to accept of the chariot of a dowager accidentally offered and the ladys protection engaged by her faithful dorcas so highly bribed to promote her escape and then mrs h has the air and appearance of a venerable matron and is not such a forbidding devil as mrs sinclair the pretty simpleton knows nothing in the world nor that people who have money never want assistants in their views be they what they will how else could the princes of the earth be so implicitly served as they are change they hands every so often and be their purposes ever so wicked if i can but get her to go on with me till wednesday next week we shall be settled together pretty quietly by that time and indeed if she has any gratitude and has in her the least of her sexs foibles she must think i deserve her favour by the pains she has cost me for dearly do they all love that men should take pains about them and for them and here for the present i will lay down my pen and congratulate myself upon my happy invention since her obstinacy puts me once more upon exercising it but with this resolution i think that if the present contrivance fail me i will exert all the faculties of my mind all my talents to procure for myself a regal right to her favour and that in defiance of all my antipathies to the married state and of the suggestions of the great devil out of the house and of his secret agents in it since if now she is not to be prevailed upon or drawn in it will be in vain to attempt her further letter xxvii mr lovelace to john belford esq tuesday night june no admittance yet to my charmer she is very ill in a violent fever dorcas thinks yet will have no advice dorcas tells her how much i am concerned at it but again let me ask does this lady do right to make herself ill when she is not ill for my own part libertine as people think me when i had occasion to be sick i took a dose of ipecacuanha that i might not be guilty of a falsehood and most heartily sick was i as she who then pitied me full well knew but here to pretend to be very ill only to get an opportunity to run away in order to avoid forgiving a man who has offended her how unchristian if good folks allow themselves in these breaches of a known duty and in these presumptuous contrivances to deceive who belford shall blame us i have a strange notion that the matronly lady will be certainly at the grocers shop at the hour of nine tomorrow morning for dorcas heard me tell mrs sinclair that i should go out at eight precisely and then she is to try for a coach and if the dowagers chariot should happen to be there how lucky will it be for my charmer how strangely will my dream be made out i have just received a letter from captain tomlinson is it not wonderful for that was part of my dream i shall always have a prodigious regard to dreams henceforward i know not but i may write a book upon that subject for my own experience will furnish out a great part of it glanville of witches baxters history of spirits and apparitions and the royal pedants demonology will be nothing at all to lovelaces reveries the letter is just what i dreamed it to be i am only concerned that uncle johns anniversary did not happen three or four days sooner for should any new misfortune befal my charmer she may not be able to support her spirits so long as till thursday in the next week yet it will give me the more time for new expedients should my present contrivance fail which i cannot however suppose to robert lovelace esq monday june dear sir i can now return your joy for the joy you have given me as well as my dear friend mr harlowe in the news of his beloved nieces happy recovery for he is determined to comply with her wishes and yours and to give her to you with his own hand as the ceremony has been necessarily delayed by reason of her illness and as mr harlowes birthday is on thursday the th of this instant june when he enters into the seventyfourth year of his age and as time may be wanted to complete the dear ladys recovery he is very desirous that the marriage shall be solemnized upon it that he may afterwards have double joy on that day to the end of his life for this purpose he intends to set out privately so as to be at kentishtown on wednesday sennight in the evening all the family used he says to meet to celebrate it with him but as they are at present in too unhappy a situation for that he will give out that not being able to bear the day at home he has resolved to be absent for two or three days he will set out on horseback attended only with one trusty servant for the greater privacy he will be at the most creditablelooking public house there expecting you both next morning if he hear nothing from me to prevent him and he will go to town with you after the ceremony is performed in the coach he supposes you will come in he is very desirous that i should be present on the occasion but this i have promised him at his request that i will be up before the day in order to see the settlements executed and every thing properly prepared he is very glad you have the license ready he speaks very kindly of you mr lovelace and says that if any of the family stand out after he has seen the ceremony performed he will separate from them and unite himself to his dear niece and her interests i owned to you when in town last that i took slight notice to my dear friend of the misunderstanding between you and his niece and that i did this for fear the lady should have shown any little discontent in his presence had i been able to prevail upon him to go up in person as then was doubtful but i hope nothing of that discontent remains now my absence when your messenger came must excuse me for not writing by him be pleased to make my most respectful compliments acceptable to the admirable lady and believe me to be your most faithful and obedient servant antony tomlinson this letter i sealed and broke open it was brought thou mayest suppose by a particular messenger the seal such a one as the writer need be ashamed of i took care to inquire after the captains health in my beloveds hearing and it is now ready to be produced as a pacifier according as she shall take on or resent if the two metamorphoses happen pursuant to my wonderful dream as having great faith in dreams i dare say they will i think it will not be amiss in changing my clothes to have this letter of the worthy captain lie in my beloveds way letter xxviii mr lovelace to john belford esq wedn noon june what shall i say now i who but a few hours ago had such faith in dreams and had proposed out of hand to begin my treatise of dreams sleeping and dreams waking and was pleasing myself with the dialogues between the old matronal lady and the young lady and with the metamorphoses absolutely assured that every thing would happen as my dream chalked it out shall never more depend upon those flying follies those illusions of a fancy depraved and run mad thus confoundedly have matters happened i went out at eight oclock in high good humour with myself in order to give the soughtfor opportunity to the plotting mistress and corrupted maid only ordering will to keep a good lookout for fear his lady should mistrust my plot or mistake a hackneycoach for the dowagerladys chariot but first i sent to know how she did and receiving for answer very ill had a very bad night which latter was but too probable since this i know that people who have plots in their heads as seldom have as deserve good ones i desired a physician might be called in but was refused i took a walk in st jamess park congratulating myself all the way on my rare inventions then impatient i took coach with one of the windows quite up the other almost up playing at bopeep in every chariot i saw pass in my way to lincolnsinnfields and when arrived there i sent the coachman to desire any one of mother hs family to come to me to the coachside not doubting but i should have intelligence of my fair fugitive there it being then half an hour after ten a servant came who gave me to understand that the matronly lady was just returned by herself in the chariot frighted out of my wits i alighted and heard from the mothers own mouth that dorcas had engaged her to protect the lady but came to tell her afterwards that she had changed her mind and would not quit the house quite astonished not knowing what might have happened i ordered the coachman to lash away to our mothers arriving here in an instant the first word i asked was if the lady was safe mr lovelace here gives a very circumstantial relation of all that passed between the lady and dorcas but as he could only guess at her motives for refusing to go off when dorcas told her that she had engaged for her the protection of the dowagerlady it is thought proper to omit this relation and to supply it by some memoranda of the ladys but it is first necessary to account for the occasion on which those memoranda were made the reader may remember that in the letter written to miss howe on her escape to hampstead she promises to give her the particulars of her flight at leisure she had indeed thoughts of continuing her account of every thing that had passed between her and mr lovelace since her last narrative letter but the uncertainty she was in from that time with the execrable treatment she met with on her being deluded back again followed by a weeks delirium had hitherto hindered her from prosecuting her intention but nevertheless having it still in her view to perform her promise as soon as she had opportunity she made minutes of every thing as it passed in order to help her memory which as she observes in one place she could less trust to since her late disorders than before in these minutes or book of memoranda she observes that having apprehensions that dorcas might be a traitress she would have got away while she was gone out to see for a coach and actually slid down stairs with that intent but that seeing mrs sinclair in the entry whom dorcas had planted there while she went out she speeded up again unseen see vol v letter xxi she then went up to the diningroom and saw the letter of captain tomlinson on which she observes in her memorandumbook as follows how am i puzzled now he might leave this letter on purpose none of the other papers left with it being of any consequence what is the alternative to stay and be the wife of the vilest of men how my heart resists that to attempt to get off and fail ruin inevitable dorcas may betray me i doubt she is still his implement at his going out he whispered her as i saw unobserved in a very familiar manner too never fear sir with a courtesy in her agreeing to connive at my escape she provided not for her own safety if i got away yet had reason in that case to expect his vengeance and wants not forethought to have taken her with me was to be in the power of her intelligence if a faithless creature let me however though i part not with my caution keep my charity can there be any woman so vile to a woman o yes mrs sinclair her aunt the lord deliver me but alas i have put myself out of the course of his protection by the natural means and am already ruined a fathers curse likewise against me having made vain all my friends cautions and solicitudes i must not hope for miracles in my favour if i do escape what may become of me a poor helpless deserted creature helpless from sex from circumstances exposed to every danger lord protect me his vile man not gone with him lurking hereabouts no doubt to watch my steps i will not go away by the chariot however that the chariot should come so opportunely so like his many opportunities that dorcas should have the sudden thought should have the courage with the thought to address a lady in behalf of an absolute stranger to that lady that the lady should so readily consent yet the transaction between them to take up so much time their distance in degree considered for arduous as the case was and precious as the time dorcas was gone above half an hour yet the chariot was said to be ready at a grocers not many doors off indeed some elderly ladies are talkative and there are no doubt some good people in the world but that it should chance to be a widow lady who could do what she pleased that dorcas should know her to be so by the lozenge persons in her station are not usually so knowing i believe in heraldry yet some may for servants are fond of deriving collateral honours and distinctions as i may call them from the quality or people of rank whom they serve but this sly servant not gone with him then this letter of tomlinson although i am resolved never to have this wretch yet may i not throw myself into my uncles protection at kentishtown or highgate if i cannot escape before and so get clear of him may not the evil i know be less than what i may fall into if i can avoid farther villany farther villany he has not yet threatened freely and justly as i have treated him i will not go i think at least unless i can send this fellow away she tried to do this but was prevented by the fellows pretending to put his

concerned for her own safety plays off and on about a coach all my hopes of getting off at present over unhappy creature to what farther evils art thou reserved oh how my heart rises at the necessity i must still be under to see and converse with so very vile a man letter xxix mr lovelace to john belford esq wednesday afternoon disappointed in her meditated escape obliged against her will to meet me in the diningroom and perhaps apprehensive of being upbraided for her art in feigning herself ill i expected that the dear perverse would begin with me with spirit and indignation but i was in hopes from the gentleness of her natural disposition from the consideration which i expected from her on her situation from the contents of the letter of captain tomlinson which dorcas told me she had seen and from the time she had had to cool and reflect since she last admitted me to her presence that she would not have carried it so strongly through as she did as i entered the diningroom i congratulated her and myself upon her sudden recovery and would have taken her hand with an air of respectful tenderness but she was resolved to begin where she left off she turned from me drawing in her hand with a repulsing and indignant aspect i meet you once more said she because i cannot help it what have you to say to me why am i to be thus detained against my will with the utmost solemnity of speech and behaviour i urged the ceremony i saw i had nothing else for it i had a letter in my pocket i said feeling for it although i had not taken it from the table where i left it in the same room the contents of which if attended to would make us both happy i had been loth to show it to her before because i hoped to prevail upon her to be mine sooner than the day mentioned in it i felt for it in all my pockets watching her eye mean time which i saw glance towards the table where it lay i was uneasy that i could not find it at last directed again by her sly eye i spied it on the table at the farther end of the room with joy i fetched it be pleased to read that letter madam with an air of satisfied assurance she took it and cast her eye over it in such a careless way as made it evident that she had read it before and then unthankfully tossed it into the windowseat before her i urged her to bless me tomorrow or friday morning at least that she would not render vain her uncles journey and kind endeavours to bring about a reconciliation among us all among us all repeated she with an air equally disdainful and incredulous o lovelace thou art surely nearly allied to the grand deceiver in thy endeavour to suit temptations to inclinations but what honour what faith what veracity were it possible that i could enter into parley with thee on this subject which it is not may i expect from such a man as thou hast shown thyself to be i was touched to the quick a lady of your perfect character madam who has feigned herself sick on purpose to avoid seeing the man who adored her should not i know what thou wouldst say interrupted she twenty and twenty low things that my soul would have been above being guilty of and which i have despised myself for have i been

over again she interrupted me why once more i ask you am i detained in this house do i not see myself surrounded by wretches who though they wear the habit of my sex may yet as far as i know lie in wait for my perdition she would be very loth i said that mrs sinclair and her nieces should be called up to vindicate themselves and their house would but they kill me let them come and welcome i will

stars she still believes expected o that she would forgive me would she but generously forgive me and receive my vows at the altar at the instant of her forgiving me that i might not have time to relapse into my old prejudices by my soul belford this dear girl gives the lie to all our rakish maxims there must be something more than a name in virtue i now see that there is once subdued always subdued tis an egregious falsehood but o jack she never was subdued what have i obtained but an increase of shame and confusion while her glory has been established by her sufferings this one merit is however left me that i have laid all her sex under obligation to me by putting this noble creature to trials which so gloriously supported have done honour to them all however but no more will i add what a force have evil habits i will take an airing and try to fly from myself do not thou upbraid me on my weak fits on my contradictory purposes on my irresolution and all will be well letter xxx mr lovelace to john belford esq wednesday night a man is just now arrived from m hall who tells me that my lord is in a very dangerous way the gout in his stomach to an extreme degree occasioned by drinking a great quantity of lemonade a man of a year to prefer his appetite to his health he deserves to die but we have all of us our inordinate passions to gratify and they generally bring their punishment along with them so witnesses the nephew as well as the uncle the fellow was sent upon other business but stretched his orders a little to make his court to a successor i am glad i was not at m hall at the time my lord took the grateful dose it was certainly grateful to him at the time there are people in the world who would have had the wickedness to say that i had persuaded him to drink the man says that his lordship was so bad when he came away that the family began to talk of sending for me in post haste as i know the old peer has a good deal of cash by him of which he seldom keeps account it behoves me to go down as soon as i can but what shall i do with this dear creature the while tomorrow over i shall perhaps be able to answer my own question i am afraid she will make me desperate for here have i sent to implore her company and am denied with scorn i have been so happy as to receive this moment a third letter from the dear correspondent miss howe a little severe devil it would have broken the heart of my beloved had it fallen into her hands i will enclose a copy of it read it here tuesday june my dearest miss harlowe again i venture to you almost against inclination and that by your former conveyance little as i like it i know not how it is with you it may be bad and then it would be hard to upbraid you for a silence you may not be able to help but if not what shall i say severe enough that you have not answered either of my last letters the first of which and i think it imported you too much to be silent upon it you owned the receipt of the other which was delivered into your own hands was so pressing for the favour of a line from you that i am amazed i could not be obliged and still more that i have not heard from you since see vol v letter xx see vol vi letter vii the fellow made so strange a story of the condition he saw you in and of your speech to him that i know not what to conclude from it only that he is a simple blundering and yet conceited fellow who aiming at description and the rustic wonderful gives an air of bumkinly romance to all he tells that this is his character you will believe when you are informed that he described you in grief excessive yet so improved in your person and features and so rosy that was his word in your face and so flushcoloured and so plump in your arms that one would conclude you were labouring under the operation of some malignant poison and so much the rather as he was introduced to you when you were upon a couch from which you offered not to rise or sit up see vol vi letter vi upon my word miss harlowe i am greatly distressed upon your account for i must be so free as to say that in your ready return with your deceiver you have not at all answered my expectations nor acted up to your own character for mrs townsend tells me from the women at hampstead how cheerfully you put yourself into his hands again yet at the time it was impossible you should be married lord my dear what pity it is that you took much pains to get from the man but you know best sometimes i think it could not be you to whom the rustic delivered my letter but it must too yet it is strange i could not have one line by him not one and you so soon well enough to go with the wretch back again i am not sure that the letter i am now writing will come to your hands so shall not say half that i have upon my mind to say but if you think it worth your while to write to me pray let me know what fine ladies his relations those were who visited you at hampstead and carried you back again so joyfully to a place that i had so fully warned you but i will say no more at least till i know more for i can do nothing but wonder and stand amazed notwithstanding all the mans baseness tis plain there was more than a lurking love good heaven but i have done yet i know not how to have done neither yet i must i will only account to me my dear for what i cannot at all account for and inform me whether you are really married or not and then i shall know whether there must or must not be a period shorter than that of one of our lives to a friendship which has hitherto been the pride and boast of your anna howe dorcas tells me that she has just now had a searching conversation as she calls it with her lady she is willing she tells the wench still to place her confidence in her dorcas hopes she has reassured her but wishes me not to depend upon it yet captain tomlinsons letter must assuredly weigh with her i sent it in just now by dorcas desiring her to reperuse it and it was not returned me as i feared it would be and thats a good sign i think i say i think and i think for this charming creature entangled as i am in my own inventions puzzles me ten thousand times more than i her letter xxxi mr lovelace to john belford esq thursday noon june let me perish if i know what to make either of myself or of this surprising creature now calm now tempestuous but i know thou lovest not anticipation any more than i at my repeated requests she met me at six this morning she was ready dressed for she had not her clothes off every since she declared that they never more should be off in this house and charmingly she looked with all the disadvantages of a threehours violent stomachache for dorcas told me that she had been really ill no rest and eyes red and swelled with weeping strange to me that those charming fountains have not been so long ago exhausted but she is a woman and i believe anatomists allow that women have more watry heads than men well my dearest creature i hope you have now thoroughly considered of the contents of captain tomlinsons letter but as we are thus early met let me beseech you to make this my happy day she looked not favourably upon me a cloud hung upon her brow at her entrance but as she was going to answer me a still greater solemnity took possession of her charming features your air and your countenance my beloved creature are not propitious to me let me beg of you before you speak to forbear all further recriminations for already i have such a sense of my vileness to you that i know not how to bear the reproaches of my own mind i have been endeavouring said she since i am not permitted to avoid you to obtain a composure which i never more expected to see you in how long i may enjoy it i cannot tell but i hope i shall be enabled to speak to you without that vehemence which i expressed yesterday and could not help it the lady in her minutes says i fear dorcas is a false one may i not be able to prevail upon him to leave me at my liberty better to try than to trust to her if i cannot prevail but must meet him and my uncle i hope i shall have fortitude enough to renounce him then but i would fain avoid qualifying with the wretch or to give him an expectation which i intend not to answer if i am mistress of my own resolutions my uncle himself shall not prevail with me to bind my soul in covenant with so vile a man after a pause for i was all attention thus she proceeded it is easy for me mr lovelace to see that further violences are intended me if i comply not with your purposes whatever they are i will suppose them to be what you solemnly profess they are but i have told you as solemnly my mind that i never will that i never can be yours nor if so any mans upon earth all vengeance nevertheless for the wrongs you have done me i disclaim i want but to slide into some obscure corner to hide myself from you and from every one who once loved me the desire lately so near my heart of a reconciliation with my friends is much abated they shall not receive me now if they would sunk in mine own eyes i now think myself unworthy of their favour in the anguish of my soul therefore i conjure you lovelace tears in her eyes to leave me to my fate in doing so you will give me a pleasure the highest i now can know where my dearest life no matter where i will leave to providence when i am out of this house the direction of my future steps i am sensible enough of my destitute condition i know that i have not now a friend in the world even miss howe has given me up or you are but i would fain keep my temper by your means i have lost them all and you have been a barbarous enemy to me you know you have she paused i could not speak the evils i have suffered proceeded she turning from me however irreparable are but temporarily evils leave me to my hopes of being enabled to obtain the divine forgiveness for the offence i have been drawn in to give to my parents and to virtue that so i may avoid the evils that are more than temporary this is now all i have to wish for and what is it that i demand that i have not a right to and from which it is an illegal violence to withhold me it was impossible for me i told her plainly to comply i besought her to give me her hand as this very day i could not live without her i communicated to her my lords illness as a reason why i wished not to stay for her uncles anniversary i besought her to bless me with her consent and after the ceremony was passed to accompany me down to berks and thus my dearest life said i will you be freed from a house to which you have conceived so great an antipathy this thou wilt own was a princely offer and i was resolved to be as good as my word i thought i had killed my conscience as i told thee belford some time ago but conscience i find though it may be temporarily stifled cannot die and when it dare not speak aloud will whisper and at this instant i thought i felt the revived varletess on but a slight retrograde motion writhing round my pericardium like a serpent and in the action of a dying one collecting all its force into its head fix its plaguy fangs into my heart she hesitated and looked down as if irresolute and this set my heart up at my mouth and believe me i had instantly popt in upon me in imagination an old spectacled parson with a white surplice thrown over a black habit a fit emblem of the halcyon office which under a benign appearance often introduced a life of storms and tempests whining and snuffling through his nose the irrevocable ceremony i hope now my dearest life said i snatching her hand and pressing it to my lips that your silence bodes me good let me my beloved creature have but your tacit consent and this moment i will step out and engage a minister and then i promised how much my whole future life should be devoted to her commands and that i would make her the best and tenderest of husbands at last turning to me i have told you my mind mr lovelace said she think you that i could thus solemnly there she stopt i am too much in your power proceeded she your prisoner rather than a person free to choose for myself or to say what i will do or be but as a testimony that you mean me well let me instantly quit this house and i will then give you such an answer in writing as best befits my unhappy circumstances and imaginest thou fairest thought i that this will go down with a lovelace thou oughtest to have known that freelivers like ministers of state never part with a power put into their hands without an equivalent of twice the value i pleaded that if we joined hands this morning if not tomorrow if not on thursday her uncles birthday and in his presence and afterwards as i had proposed set out for berks we should of course quit this house and on our return to town should have in readiness the house i was in treaty for she answered me not but with tears and sighs fond of believing what i hoped i imputed her silence to the modesty of her sex the dear creature thought i solemnly as she began with me is ruminating in a sweet suspence how to put into fit words the gentle purposes of her condescending heart but looking in her averted face with a soothing gentleness i plainly perceived that it was resentment and not bashfulness that was struggling in her bosom the lady in her minutes owns the difficulty she lay under to keep her temper in this conference but when i found says she that all my entreaties were ineffectual and that he was resolved to detain me i could no longer withhold my impatience at last she broke silence i have no patience said she to find myself a slave a prisoner in a vile house tell me sir in so many words tell me whether it be or be not your intention to permit me to quit it to permit me the freedom which is my birthright as an english subject will not the consequence of your departure hence be that i shall lose you for ever madam and can i bear the thoughts of that she flung from me my soul disdains to hold parley with thee were her violent words but i threw myself at her feet and took hold of her reluctant hand and began to imprecate avow to promise but thus the passionate beauty interrupting me went on i am sick of thee man one continued string of vows oaths and protestations varied only by time and place fills thy mouth why detainest thou me my heart rises against thee o thou cruel implement of my brothers causeless vengeance all i beg of thee is that thou wilt remit me the future part of my fathers dreadful curse the temporary part base and ungrateful as thou art thou hast completed i was speechless well i might her brothers implement james harlowes implement zounds jack what words were these i let go her struggling hand she took two or three turns cross the room her whole haughty soul in her air then approaching me but in silence turning from me and again to me in a milder voice i see thy confusion lovelace or is it thy remorse i have but one request to make thee the request so often repeated that thou wilt this moment permit me to quit this house adieu then let me say for ever adieu and mayest thou enjoy that happiness in this world which thou hast robbed me of as thou hast of every friend i have in it and saying this away she flung leaving me in a confusion so great that i knew not what to think say or do but dorcas soon roused me do you know sir running in hastily that my lady is gone down stairs no sure and down i flew and found her once more at the streetdoor contending with polly horton to get out she rushed by me into the fore parlour and flew to the window and attempted once more to throw up the sash good people good people cried she i caught her in my arms and lifted her from the window but being afraid of hurting the charming creature charming in her very rage she slid through my arms on the floor let me die here let me die here were her words remaining jointless and immovable till sally and mrs sinclair hurried in she was visibly terrified at the sight of the old wretch while i sincerely affected appealed bear witness mrs sinclair bear witness miss martin miss horton every one bear witness that i offer not violence to this beloved creature she then found her feet o house look towards the windows and all round her o house contrived on purpose for my ruin said she but let not that woman come into my presence not that miss horton neither who would not have dared to controul me had she not been a base one hoh sir hoh madam vociferated the old dragon her armed kemboed and flourishing with one foot to the extent of her petticoats whats ado here about nothing i never knew such work in my life between a chicken of a gentleman and a tiger of a lady she was visibly affrighted and up stairs she hastened a bad woman is certainly jack more terrible to her own sex than even a bad man i followed her up she rushed by her own apartment into the diningroom no terror can make her forget her punctilio to recite what passed there of invective exclamations threatenings even of her own life on one side of expostulations supplications and sometimes menaces on the other would be too affecting and after my particularity in like scenes these things may as well be imagined as expressed i will therefore only mention that at length i extorted a concession from her she had reason to think it would have been worse for her on the spot if she had not made it it was that she would endeavour to make herself easy till she saw what next thursday her uncles birthday would produce but oh that it were not a sin she passionately exclaimed on making this poor concession to put and end to her own life rather than yield to give me but that assurance the lady mentions in her memorandumbook that she had no other way as is apprehended to save herself from instant dishonour but by making this concession her only hope now she says if she cannot escape by dorcass connivance whom nevertheless she suspects is to find a way to engage the protection of her uncle and even of the civil magistrate on thursday next if necessary he shall see says she tame and timid as he thought me what i dare to do to avoid so hated a compulsion and a man capable of a baseness so premeditatedly vile and inhuman this however shows me that she is aware that the reluctantlygiven assurance may be fairly construed into a matrimonial expectation on my side and if she will now even now look forward i think from my heart that i will put on her livery and wear it for life what a situation am i in with all my cursed inventions i am puzzled confounded and ashamed of myself upon the whole to take such pains to be a villain but for the fiftieth time let me ask thee who would have thought that there had been such a woman in the world nevertheless she had best take care that she carries not her obstinacy much farther she knows not what revenge for slighted love will make me do the busy scenes i have just passed through have given emotions to my heart which will not be quieted one while my heart i see on reperusing what i have written has communicated its tremors to my fingers and in some places the characters are so indistinct and unformed that thoult hardly be able to make them out but if one half of them is only intelligible that will be enough to expose me to thy contempt for the wretched hand i have made of my plots and contrivances but surely jack i have gained some ground by this promise and now one word to the assurances thou sendest me that thou hast not betrayed my secrets in relation to this charming creature thou mightest have spared them belford my suspicions held no longer than while i wrote about them for well i knew when i allowed myself time to think that thou hadst no principles no virtue to be misled by a great deal of strong envy and a little of weak pity i knew to be thy motives thou couldst not provoke my anger and my compassion thou ever hadst and art now more especially entitled to it because thou art a pityful fellow all thy new expostulations in my beloveds behalf i will answer when i see thee letter xxxii mr lovelace to john belford esq thursday night confoundedly out of humour with this perverse woman nor wilt thou blame me if thou art my friend she regards the concession she made as a concession extorted from her and we are but just where we were before she made it with great difficulty i prevailed upon her to favour me with her company for one half hour this evening the necessity i was under to go down to m hall was the subject i wanted to talk upon i told her that as she had been so good as to promise that she would endeavour to make herself easy till she saw the thursday in next week over i hoped that she would not scruple to oblige me with her word that i should find her here at my return from m hall indeed she would make no such promise nothing of this house was mentioned to me said she you know it was not and do you think that i would have given my consent to my imprisonment in it i was plaguily nettled and disappointed too if i go not down to mr hall madam youll have no scruple to stay here i suppose till thursday is over if i cannot help myself i must but i insist upon being permitted to go out of this house whether you leave it or not well madam then i will comply with your commands and i will go out this very evening in quest of lodgings that you shall have no objections to i will have no lodgings of your providing sir i will go to mrs moores at hampstead mrs moores madam i have no objection to mrs moores but will you give me your promise to admit me there to your presence as i do here when i cannot help it very well madam will you be so good as to let me know what you intend by your promise to make yourself easy to endeavour sir to make myself easy were the words till you saw what next thursday would produce ask me no questions that may ensnare me i am too sincere for the company i am in let me ask you madam what meant you when you said that were it not a sin you would die before you gave me that assurance she was indignantly silent you thought madam you had given me room to hope your pardon by it when i think i ought to answer you with patience i will speak do you think yourself in my power madam if i were not and there she stopt dearest creature speak out i beseech you dearest creature speak out she was silent her charming face all in a glow have you madam any reliance upon my honour still silent you hate me madam you despise me more than you do the most odious of gods creatures you ought to despise me if i did not you say madam you are in a bad house you have no reliance upon my honour you believe you cannot avoid me she arose i beseech you let me withdraw i snatched her hand rising and pressed it first to my lips and then to my heart in wild disorder she might have felt the bounding mischief ready to burst its bars you shall go to your own apartment if you please but by the great god of heaven i will accompany you thither she trembled pray pray mr lovelace dont terrify me so be seated madam i beseech you be seated i will sit down do then all my soul is in my eyes and my hearts blood throbbing at my fingers ends i will i will you hurt me pray mr lovelace dont dont frighten me so and down she sat trembling my hand still grasping hers i hung over her throbbing bosom and putting my other arm round her waist and you say you hate me madam and you say you despise me and you say you promise me nothing yes yes i did promise you let me not be held down thus you see i sat down when you bid me why struggling need you hold me down thus i did promise to endeavour to be easy till thursday was over but you wont let me how can i be easy pray let me not be thus terrified and what madam meant you by your promise did you mean any thing in my favour you designed that i should at that time think you did did you mean any thing in my favour madam did you intend that i should think you did let go my hand sir take away your arm from about me struggling yet trembling why do you gaze upon me so answer me madam did you mean any thing in my favour by your promise let me be not thus constrained to answer then pausing and gaining more spirit let me go said she i am but a woman but a weak woman but my life is in my own power though my person is not i will not be thus constrained you shall not madam quitting her hand bowing but my heart is at my mouth and hoping farther provocation she arose and was hurrying away i pursue you not madam i will try your generosity stop return this moment stop return if madam you would not make me desperate she stopt at the door burst into tears o lovelace how how have i deserved be pleased dearest angel to return she came back but with declared reluctance and imputing her compliance to terror terror jack as i have heretofore found out though i have so little benefited by the discovery must be my resort if she make it necessary nothing else will do with the inflexible charmer she seated herself overagainst me extremely discomposed but indignation had a visible predominance in her features i was going towards her with a countenance intendedly changed to love and softness sweetest dearest angel were my words in the tenderest accent but rising up she insisted upon my being seated at a distance from her i obeyed and begged her hand over the table to my extended hand to see if in any thing she would oblige me but nothing gentle soft or affectionate would do she refused me her hand was she wise jack to confirm to me that nothing but terror would do let me only know madam if your promise to endeavour to wait with patience the event of next thursday meant me favour do you expect any voluntary favour from one to whom you give not a free choice do you intend madam to honour me with your hand in your uncles presence or do you not my heart and my hand shall never be separated why think you did i stand in opposition to the will of my best my natural friends i know what you mean madam am i then as hateful to you as the vile solmes ask me not such a question mr lovelace i must be answered am i as hateful to you as the vile solmes why do you call mr solmes vile dont you think him so madam why should i did mr solmes ever do vilely by me dearest creature dont distract me by hateful comparisons and perhaps by a more hateful preference dont you sir put questions to me that you know i will answer truly though my answer were ever so much to enrage you my heart madam my soul is all yours at present but you must give me hope that your promise in your own construction binds you no new cause to the contrary to be mine on thursday how else can i leave you let me go to hampstead and trust to my favour may i trust to it say only may i trust to it how will you trust to it if you extort an answer to this question say only dearest creature say only may i trust to your favour if you go to hampstead how dare you sir if i must speak out expect a promise of favour from me what a mean creature must you think me after the ungrateful baseness to me were i to give you such a promise then standing up thou hast made me o vilest of men her hands clasped and a face crimsoned with indignation an inmate of the vilest of houses nevertheless while i am in it i shall have a heart incapable of any thing but abhorrence of that and of thee and round her looked the angel and upon me with fear in her sweet aspect of the consequence of her free declaration but what a devil must i have been i who love bravery in a man had i not been more struck with admiration of her fortitude at the instant than stimulated by revenge noblest of creatures and do you think i can leave you and my interest in such an excellence precarious no promise no hope if you make me not desperate may lightning blast me if i do you not all the justice tis in my power to do you if you have any intention to oblige me leave me at my own liberty and let me not be detained in this abominable house to be constrained as i have been constrained to be stopt by your vile agents to be brought up by force and be bruised in my own defence against such illegal violence i dare to die lovelace and she who fears not death is not to be intimidated into a meanness unworthy of her heart and principles wonderful creature but why madam did you lead me to hope for something favourable for next thursday once more make me not desperate with all your magnanimity glorious creature i was more than half frantic belford you may you may but do not do not make me brutally threaten you do not do not make me desperate my aspect i believe threatened still more than my words i was rising she rose mr lovelace be pacified you are even more dreadful than the lovelace i have long dreaded let me retire i ask your leave to retire you really frighten me yet i give you no hope from my heart i ab say not madam you abhor me you must for your own sake conceal your hatred at least not avow it i seized her hand let me retire let me retire said she in a manner out of breath i will only say madam that i refer myself to your generosity my heart is not to be trusted at this instant as a mark of my submission to your will you shall if you please withdraw but i will not go to m hall live or die my lord m i will not go to m hall but will attend the effect of your promise remember madam you have promised to endeavour to make yourself easy till you see the event of next thursday next thursday remember your uncle comes up to see us married thats the event you think ill of your lovelace do not madam suffer your own morals to be degraded by the infection as you called it of his example away flew the charmer with this half permission and no doubt thought that she had an escape nor without reason i knew not for half an hour what to do with myself vexed at the heart nevertheless now she was from me and when i reflected upon her hatred of me and her defiances that i suffered myself to be so overawed checked restrained and now i have written thus far have of course recollected the whole of our conversation i am more and more incensed against myself but i will go down to these women and perhaps suffer myself to be laughed at by them devil fetch them they pretend to know their own sex sally was a woman well educated polly also both have read both have sense of parentage not mean once modest both still they say had been modest but for me not entirely indelicate now though too little nice for my personal intimacy loth as they both are to have me think so the old one too a woman of family though thus from bad inclination as well as at first from low circumstances miserably sunk and hence they all pretend to remember what once they were and vouch for the inclinations and hypocrisy of the whole sex and wish for nothing so ardently as that i will leave the perverse lady to their management while i am gone to berkshire undertaking absolutely for her humility and passiveness on my return and continually boasting of the many perverse creatures whom they have obliged to draw in their traces i am just come from the sorceresses i was forced to take the mother down for she began with her hoh sir with me and to catechize and upbraid me with as much insolence as if i owed her money i made her fly the pit at last strange wishes wished we against each other at her quitting itwhat were they ill tell theeshe wished me married and to be jealous of my wife and my heirapparent the child of another man i was even with her with a vengeance and yet thou wilt think that could not well be as how as how jack why i wished for her conscience come to life and i know by the gripes mine gives me every halfhour that she would then have a cursed time of it sally and polly gave themselves high airs too their first favours were thrown at me women to boast of those favours which they were as willing to impart first forms all the difficulty with them as i to receive i was upbraided with ingratitude dastardice and all my difficulties with my angel charged upon myself for want of following my blows and for leaving the proud lady mistress of her own will and nothing to reproach herself with and all agreed that the arts used against her on a certain occasion had too high an operation for them or me to judge what her will would have been in the arduous trial and then they blamed one another as i cursed them all they concluded that i should certainly marry and be a lost man and sally on this occasion with an affected and malicious laugh snapt her fingers at me and pointing two of each hand forkedly at me bid me remember the lines i once showed her of my favourite jack dryden as she always familiarly calls that celebrated poet we women to new joys unseen may move there are no prints left in the paths of love all goods besides by public marks are known but those men most desire to keep have none this infernal implement had the confidence further to hint that when a wife some other man would not find half the difficulty with my angel that i had found confidence indeed but yet i must say if a man gives himself up to the company of these devils they never let him rest till he either suspects or hate his wife but a word or two of other matters if possible methinks i long to know how causes go at m hall i have another private intimation that the old peer is in the greatest danger i must go down yet what to do with this lady the mean while these cursed women are full of cruelty and enterprise she will never be easy with them in my absence they will have provocation and pretence therefore but woe be to them if yet what will vengeance do after an insult committed the two nymphs will have jealous rage to goad them on and what will withhold a jealous and alreadyruined woman to let her go elsewhere that cannot be done i am still too resolved to be honest if shell give me hope if yet shell let me be honest but ill see how shell be after the contention she will certainly have between her resentment and the terror she has reason for from our last conversation so let this subject rest till the morning and to the old peer once more i shall have a good deal of trouble i reckon though no sordid man to be decent on the expected occasion then how to act i who am no hypocrite in the days of condolement what farces have i to go through and to be the principal actor in them ill try to think of my own latter end a gray beard and a graceless heir in order to make me serious thou belford knowest a good deal of this sort of grimace and canst help a gay heart to a little of the dismal but then every feature of thy face is cut out for it my heart may be touched perhaps sooner than thine for believe me or not i have a very tender one but then no man looking into my face be the occasion for grief ever so great will believe that heart to be deeply distressed all is placid easy serene in my countenance sorrow cannot sit half an hour together upon it nay i believe that lord ms recovery should it happen would not affect me above a quarter of an hour only the new scenery and the pleasure of aping an heraclitus to the family while i am a democritus among my private friends or i want nothing that the old peer can leave me wherefore then should grief sadden and distort such blythe such jocund features as mine but as for thine were there murder committed in the street and thou wert but passing by the murderer even in sight the pursuers would quit him and lay hold of thee and thy very looks would hang as well as apprehend thee but one word to business jack whom dealest thou with for thy blacks wert thou well used i shall want a plaguy parcel of them for i intend to make every soul of the family mourn outside if not in letter xxxiii mr lovelace to john belford esq june friday morning i went out early this morning on a design that i know not yet whether i shall or shall not pursue and on my return found simon parsons my lords berkshire bailiff just before arrived waiting for me with a message in form sent by all the family to press me to go down and that at my lords particular desire who wants to see me before he dies simon has brought my lords chariotandsix perhaps my own by this time to carry me down i have ordered it to be in readiness by four tomorrow morning the cattle shall smoke for the delay and by the rest theyll have in the interim will be better able to bear it i am still resolved upon matrimony if my fair perverse will accept of me but if she will notwhy then i must give an uninterrupted hearing not to my conscience but to these women below dorcas had acquainted her lady with simons arrival and errand my beloved had desired to see him but my coming in prevented his attendance on her just as dorcas was instructing him what questions he should not answer to that might be asked of him i am to be admitted to her presence immediately at my repeated request surely the acquisition in view will help me to make up all with her she is just gone up to the diningroom nothing will do jack i can procure no favour from her though she has obtained from me the point which she had set her heart upon i will give thee a brief account of what passed between us i first proposed instant marriage and this in the most fervent manner but was denied as fervently would she be pleased to assure me that she would stay here only till tuesday morning i would but just go down to see how my lord was to know whether he had any thing particular to say or enjoin me while yet he was sensible as he was very earnest to see me perhaps i might be up on sunday concede in something i beseech you madam show me some little consideration why mr lovelace must i be determined by your motions think you that i will voluntarily give a sanction to the imprisonment of my person of what importance to me ought to be your stay or your return give a sanction to the imprisonment of your person do you think madam that i fear the law i might have spared this foolish question of defiance but my pride would not let me i thought she threatened me jack i dont think you fear the law sir you are too brave to have any regard either to moral or divine sanctions tis well madam but ask me any thing i can do to oblige you and i will oblige you though in nothing will you oblige me then i ask you then i request of you to let me go to hampstead i paused and at last by my soul you shall this very moment i will wait upon you and see you fixed there if youll promise me your hand on thursday in presence of your uncle i want not you to see me fixed i will promise nothing take care madam that you dont let me see that i can have no reliance upon your future favour i have been used to be threatened by you sir but i will accept of your company to hampstead i will be ready to go in a quarter of an hour my clothes may be sent after me you know the condition madam next thursday you dare not trust my infinite demerits tell me that i ought not nevertheless i will confide in your generosity tomorrow morning no new cause arising to give reason to the contrary as early as you please you may go to hampstead this seemed to oblige her but yet she looked with a face of doubt i will go down to the women belford and having no better judges at hand will hear what they say upon my critical situation with this proud beauty who has so insolently rejected a lovelace kneeling at her feet though making an earnest tender of himself for a husband in spite of all his prejudices to the state of shackles letter xxxiv mr lovelace to john belford esq just come from the women have i gone so far and am i afraid to go farther have i not already as it is evident by her behaviour sinned beyond forgiveness a womans tears used to be to me but as water sprinkled on a glowing fire which gives it a fiercer and brighter blaze what defence has this lady but her tears and her eloquence she was before taken at no weak advantage she was insensible in her moments of trial had she been sensible she must have been sensible so they say the methods taken with her have augmented her glory and her pride she has now a tale to tell that she may tell with honour to herself no accompliceinclination she can look me into confusion without being conscious of so much as a thought which she need to be ashamed of this jack is the substance of the womens reasonings with me to which let me add that the dear creature now sees the necessity i am in to leave her detecting me is in her head my contrivances are of such a nature that i must appear to be the most odious of men if i am detected on this side matrimony and yet i have promised as thou seest that she shall set out to hampstead as soon as she pleases in the morning and that without condition on her side dost thou ask what i meant by this promise no new cause arising was the proviso on my side thoult remember but there will be a new cause suppose dorcas should drop the promissory note given her by her lady servants especially those who cannot read or write are the most careless people in the world of written papers suppose i take it up at a time too that i was determined that the dear creature should be her own mistress will not this detection be a new cause a cause that will carry with it against her the appearance of ingratitude that she designed it a secret to me argues a fear of detection and indirectly a sense of guilt i wanted a pretence can i have a better if i am in a violent passion upon the detection is not passion an universallyallowed extenuator of violence is not every man and woman obliged to excuse that fault in another which at times they find attended with such ungovernable effects in themselves the mother and sisterhood suppose brought to sit in judgment upon the vile corrupted the least benefit that must accrue from the accidental discovery if not a pretence for perpetration which however may be the case an excuse for renewing my orders for her detention till my return from m hall the fault her own and for keeping a stricter watch over her than before with direction to send me any letters that may be written by her or to her and when i return the devils in it if i find not a way to make her choose lodgings for herself since these are so hateful to her that shall answer all my purposes and yet i no more appear to direct her choice than i did before in these thou wilt curse me when thou comest to this place i know thou wilt but thinkest thou that after such a series of contrivance i will lose this inimitable woman for want of a little more a rakes a rake jack and what rake is withheld by principle from the perpetration of any evil his heart is set upon and in which he thinks he can succeed besides am i not in earnest as to marriage will not the generality of the world acquit me if i do marry and what is that injury which a churchrite will not at any time repair is not the catastrophe of every story that ends in wedlock accounted happy be the difficulties in the progress of it ever so great but here how am i engrossed by this lady while poor lord m as simon tells me lies groaning in the most dreadful agonies what must he suffer heaven relieve him i have a too compassionate heart and so would the dear creature have found could i have thought that the worst of her sufferings is equal to the lightest of his i mean as to fact for as to that part of hers which arises from extreme sensibility i know nothing of that and cannot therefore be answerable for it letter xxxv mr lovelace to john belford esq just come from my charmer she will not suffer me to say half the obliging the tender things which my honest heart is ready to overflow with a confounded situation that when a man finds himself in humour to be eloquent and pathetic at the same time yet cannot engage the mistress of his fate to lend an ear to his fine speeches i can account now how it comes about that lovers when their mistresses are cruel run into solitude and disburthen their minds to stocks and stones for am i not forced to make my complaints to thee she claimed the performance of my promise the moment she saw me of permitting her haughtily she spoke the word to go to hampstead as soon as i was gone to berks most cheerfully i renewed it she desired me to give orders in her hearing i sent for dorcas and will they came do you both take notice but perhaps sir i may take you with me that your lady is to be obeyed in all her commands she purposes to return to hampstead as soon as i am gone my dear will you not have a servant to attend you i shall want no servant there will you take dorcas if i should want dorcas i can send for her dorcas could not but say she should be very proud well well that may be at my return if your lady permit shall i my dear call up mrs sinclair and give her orders to the same effect in your hearing i desire not to see mrs sinclair nor any that belong to her as you please madam and then the servants being withdrawn i urged her again for the assurance that she would meet me at the altar on thursday next but to no purpose may she not thank herself for all that may follow one favour however i would not be denied to be admitted to pass the evening with her all sweetness and obsequiousness will i be on this occasion my whole soul shall be poured out to move her to forgive me if she will not and if the promissory note should fall in my way my revenge will doubtless take total possession of me all the house in my interest and every one in it not only engaging to intimidate and assist as occasion shall offer but staking all their experience upon my success if it be not my own fault what must be the consequence this jack however shall be her last trial and if she behave as nobly in and after this second attempt all her senses about her as she has done after the first she will come out an angel upon full proof in spite of man woman and devil then shall there be an end of all her sufferings i will then renounce that vanquished devil and reform and if any vile machination start up presuming to mislead me i will sooner stab it in my heart as it rises than give way to it a few hours will now decide all but whatever be the event i shall be too busy to write again till i get to m hall mean time i am in strange agitations i must suppress them if possible before i venture into her presence my heart bounces my bosom from the table i will lay down my pen and wholly resign to its impulses letter xxxvi mr lovelace to john belford esq friday night or rather sat morn one oclock i thought i should not have had either time or inclination to write another line before i got to m hall but having the first must find the last since i can neither sleep nor do any thing but write if i can do that i am most confoundedly out of humour the reason let it follow if it will follow nor preparation for it from me i tried by gentleness and love to soften what marble a heart incapable either of love or gentleness her past injuries for ever in her head ready to receive a favour the permission to go to hampstead but neither to deserve it nor return any so my scheme of the gentle kind was soon given over i then wanted to provoke her like a coward boy who waits for the first blow before he can persuade himself to fight i half challenged her to challenge or defy me she seemed aware of her danger and would not directly brave my resentment but kept such a middle course that i neither could find a pretence to offend nor reason to hope yet she believed my tale that her uncle would come to kentishtown and seemed not to apprehend that tomlinson was an impostor she was very uneasy upon the whole in my company wanted often to break from me yet so held me to my purpose of permitting her to go to hampstead that i knew not how to get off it although it was impossible in my precarious situation with her to think of performing it in this situation the women ready to assist and if i proceeded not as ready to ridicule me what had i left me but to pursue the concerted scheme and to seek a pretence to quarrel with her in order to revoke my promised permission and to convince her that i would not be upbraided as the most brutal of ravishers for nothing i had agreed with the women that if i could not find a pretence in her presence to begin my operations the note should lie in my way and i was to pick it up soon after her retiring from me but i began to doubt at near ten oclock so earnest was she to leave me suspecting my overwarm behaviour to her and eager grasping of her hand two or three times with eyestrings as i felt on the strain while her eyes showed uneasiness and apprehension that if she actually retired for the night it might be a chance whether it would be easy to come at her again loth therefore to run such a risk i stept out a little after ten with intent to alter the preconcerted disposition a little saying i would attend her again instantly but as i returned i met her at the door intending to withdraw for the night i could not persuade her to go back nor had i presence of mind so full of complaisance as i was to her just before to stay her by force so she slid through my hands into her own apartment i had nothing to do therefore but to let my former concert take place i should have promised but care not for order of time connection or any thing else that between eight and nine in the evening another servant of lord m on horseback came to desire me to carry down with me dr s the old peer having been once in extremis as they judge he is now relieved and reprieved by him i sent and engaged the doctor to accompany me down and am to call upon him by four this morning or the devil should have both my lord and the doctor if id stir till i got all made up poke thy damnd nose forward into the event if thou wilt curse me if thou shalt have it till its proper time and place and too soon then she had hardly got into her chamber but i found a little paper as i was going into mine which i took up and opening it for it was carefully pinned in another paper what should it be but a promissory note given as a bribe with a further promise of a diamond ring to induce dorcas to favour her mistresss escape how my temper changed in a moment ring ring ring ring i my bell with a violence enough to break the string and as if the house were on fire every devil frighted into active life the whole house in an uproar up runs will sir sir sir eyes goggling mouth distended bid the damnd toad dorcas come hither as i stood at the stairhead in a horrible rage and out of breath cried i in sight came the trembling devil but standing aloof from the report made her by will of the passion i was in as well as from what she had heard flash came out my sword immediately for i had it ready on cursed confounded villanous bribery and corruption up runs she to her ladys door screaming out for safety and protection good your honour interposed will for gods sake o lord o lord receiving a good cuff take that varlet for saving the ungrateful wretch from my vengeance wretch i intended to say but if it were some other word of like ending passion must be my excuse up ran two or three of the sisterhood whats the matter whats the matter the matter for still my beloved opened not the door on the contrary drew another bolt this abominable dorcas call her aunt up let her see what a traitress she has placed about me and let her bring the toad to answer for herself has taken a bribe a provision for life to betray her trust by that means to perpetuate a quarrel between a man and his wife and frustrate for ever all hopes of reconciliation between us let me perish belford if i have patience to proceed with the farce if i must resume i must up came the aunt puffing and blowing as she hoped for mercy she was not privy to it she never knew such a plotting perverse lady in her life well might servants be at the pass they were when such ladies as mrs lovelace made no conscience of corrupting them for her part she desired no mercy for the wretch no niece of hers if she were not faithful to her trust but what was the proof she was shown the paper but too evident cursed cursed toad devil jade passed from each mouth and the vileness of the corrupted and the unworthiness of the corruptress were inveighed against up we all went passing the ladys door into the diningroom to proceed to trial stamp stamp stamp up each on her heels rave rave rave every tongue bring up the creature before us all this instant and would she have got out of the house say you these the noises and the speeches as we clattered by the door of the fair bribress up was brought dorcas whimpering between two both bawling out you must go you shall go tis fit you should answer for yourself you are a discredit to all worthy servants as they pulled and pushed her up stairs she whining i cannot see his honour i cannot look so good and so generous a gentleman in the face o how shall i bear my aunts ravings come up and be d nd bring her forward her imperial judge what a plague it is the detection not the crime that confounds you you could be quiet enough for days together as i see by the date under the villany tell me ungrateful devil tell me who made the first advances ay disgrace to my family and blood cried the old one tell his honour tell the truth who made the first advances ay cursed creature cried sally who made the first advances i have betrayed one trust already o let me not betray another my lady is a good lady o let not her suffer tell all you know tell the whole truth dorcas cried polly horton his honour loves his lady too well to make her suffer much little as she requites his love every body sees that cried sally too well indeed for his honour i was going to say till now i thought she deserved my love but to bribe a servant thus who she supposed had orders to watch her steps for fear of another elopement and to impute that precaution to me as a crime yet i must love her ladies forgive my weakness curse upon my grimaces if i have patience to repeat them but thou shalt have it all thou canst not despise me more than i despise myself but suppose sir said sally you have my lady and the wench face to face you see she cares not to confess o my carelessness cried dorcas dont let my poor lady suffer indeed if you all knew what i know you would say her ladyship has been cruelly treated see see see see repeatedly every one at once only sorry for the detection as your honour said not for the fault cursed creature and devilish creature from every mouth your lady wont she dare not come out to save you cried sally though it is more his honours mercy than your desert if he does not cut your vile throat this instant say repeated polly was it your lady that made the first advances or was it you you creature if the lady had so much honour bawled the mother excuse me so excuse me sir confound the old wretch she had like to have said son if the lady has so much honour as we have supposed she will appear to vindicate a poor servant misled as she has been by such large promises but i hope sir you will do them both justice i hope you will good lack good lack clapping her hands together to grant her every thing she could ask to indulge her in her unworthy hatred to my poor innocent house to let her go to hampstead though your honour told us you could get no condescension from her no not the least o sir o sir i hope i hope if your lady will not come out i hope you will find a way to hear this cause in her presence i value not my doors on such an occasion as this justice i ever loved i desire you will come to the bottom of it in clearance to me ill be sworn i had no privity in this black corruption just then we heard the ladys door unbar unlock unbolt now sir now mr lovelace now sir from every encouraging mouth but o jack jack jack i can write no more if you must have it all you must now belford see us all sitting in judgment resolved to punish the fair bribress i and the mother the hitherto dreaded mother the nieces sally polly the traitress dorcas and mabell a guard as it were over dorcas that she might not run away and hide herself all predetermined and of necessity predetermined from the journey i was going to take and my precarious situation with her and hear her unbolt unlock unbar the door then as it proved afterwards put the key into the lock on the outside lock the door and put it in her pocket will i knew below who would give me notice if while we were all above she should mistake her way and go down stairs instead of coming into the diningroom the streetdoor also doubly secured and every shutter to the windows round the house fastened that no noise or screaming should be heard such was the brutal preparation and then hear her step towards us and instantly see her enter among us confiding in her own innocence and with a majesty in her person and manner that is natural to her but which then shone out in all its glory every tongue silent every eye awed every heart quaking mine in a particular manner sunk throbless and twice below its usual region to once at my throat a shameful recreant she silent too looking round her first on me then on the mother no longer fearing her then on sally polly and the culprit dorcas such the glorious power of innocence exerted at that awful moment she would have spoken but could not looking down my guilt into confusion a mouse might have been heard passing over the floor her own light feet and rustling silks could not have prevented it for she seemed to tread air and to be all soul she passed backwards and forwards now towards me now towards the door several times before speech could get the better of indignation and at last after twice or thrice hemming to recover her articulate voice o thou contemptible and abandoned lovelace thinkest thou that i see not through this poor villanous plot of thine and of these thy wicked accomplices thou woman looking at the mother once my terror always my dislike but now my detestation shouldst once more for thine perhaps was the preparation have provided for me intoxicating potions to rob me of my senses and then thus wretch turning to me mightest thou more securely have depended upon such a low contrivance as this and ye vile women who perhaps have been the ruin body and soul of hundreds of innocents you show me how in full assembly know that i am not married ruined as i am by your help i bless god i am not married to this miscreant and i have friends that will demand my honour at your hands and to whose authority i will apply for none has this man over me look to it then what farther insults you offer me or incite him to offer me i am a person though thus vilely betrayed of rank and fortune i never will be his and to your utter ruin will find friends to pursue you and now i have this full proof of your detestable wickedness and have heard your base incitements will have no mercy upon you they could not laugh at the poor figure i made lord how every devil conscienceshaken trembled what a dejection must ever fall to the lot of guilt were it given to innocence always thus to exert itself and as for thee thou vile dorcas thou double deceiver whining out thy pretended love for me begone wretch nobody will hurt thee begone i say thou has too well acted thy part to be blamed by any here but myself thou art safe thy guilt is thy security in such a house as this thy shameful thy poor part thou hast as well acted as the low farce could give thee to act as well as they each of them thy superiors though not thy betters thou seest can act theirs steal away into darkness no inquiry after this will be made whose the first advances thine or mine and as i hope to live the wench confoundedly frightened slunk away so did her sentinel mabell though i endeavouring to rally cried out for dorcas to stay but i believe the devil could not have stopt her when an angel bid her begone madam said i let me tell you and was advancing towards her with a fierce aspect most cursedly vexed and ashamed too but she turned to me stop where thou art o vilest and most abandoned of men stop where thou art nor with that determined face offer to touch me if thou wouldst not that i should be a corps at thy feet to my astonishment she held forth a penknife in her hand the point to her own bosom grasping resolutely the whole handle so that there was no offering to take it from her i offer not mischief to any body but myself you sir and ye women are safe from every violence of mine the law shall be all my resource the law and she spoke the word with emphasis the law that to such people carries natural terror with it and now struck a panic into them no wonder since those who will damn themselves to procure ease and plenty in this world will tremble at every thing that seems to threaten their methods of obtaining that ease and plenty the law only shall be my refuge the infamous mother whispered me that it were better to make terms with this strange lady and let her go sally notwithstanding all her impudent bravery at other times said if mr lovelace had told them what was not true of her being his wife and polly horton that she must needs say the lady if she were not my wife had been very much injured that was all that is not now a matter to be disputed cried i you and i know madam we do said she and i thank god i am not thine once more i thank god for it i have no doubt of the farther baseness that thou hast intended me by this vile and low trick but i have my senses lovelace and from my heart i despise thee thou very poor lovelace how canst thou stand in my presence thou that madam madam madam these are insults not to be borne and was approaching her she withdrew to the door and set her back against it holding the pointed knife to her heaving bosom while the women held me beseeching me not to provoke the violent lady for their house sake and be cursd to them they besought me and all three hung upon me while the truly heroic lady braved me at that distance approach me lovelace with resentment if thou wilt i dare die it is in defence of my honour god will be merciful to my poor soul i expect no more mercy from thee i have gained this distance and two steps nearer me and thou shalt see what i dare do leave me women to myself and to my angel they retired at a distance o my beloved creature how you terrify me holding out my arms and kneeling on one knee not a step not a step farther except to receive my death at that injured hand which is thus held up against a life far dearer to me than my own i am a villain the blackest of villains say you will sheath your knife in the injurers not the injureds heart and then will i indeed approach you but not else the mother twanged her d nd nose and sally and polly pulled out their handkerchiefs and turned from us they never in their lives they told me afterwards beheld such a scene innocence so triumphant villany so debased they must mean unawares to myself i had moved onward to my angel and dost thou dost thou still disclaiming still advancing dost thou dost thou still insidiously move towards me and her hand was extended i dare i dare not rashly neither my heart from principle abhors the act which thou makest necessary god in thy mercy lifting up her eyes and hands god in thy mercy i threw myself to the farther end of the room an ejaculation a silent ejaculation employing her thoughts that moment polly says the whites of her lovely eyes were only visible and in the instant that she extended her hand assuredly to strike the fatal blow how the very recital terrifies me she cast her eye towards me and saw me at the utmost distance the room would allow and heard my broken voice my voice was utterly broken nor knew i what i said or whether to the purpose or not and her charming cheeks that were all in a glow before turned pale as if terrified at her own purpose and lifting up her eyes thank god thank god said the angel delivered for the present for the present delivered from myself keep sir that distance looking down towards me who was prostrate on the floor my heart pierced as with an hundred daggers that distance has saved a life to what reserved the almighty only knows to be happy madam and to make happy and o let me hope for your favour for tomorrow i will put off my journey till then and may god swear not sir with an awful and piercing aspect you have too often sworn gods eye is upon us his more immediate eye and looked wildly but the women looked up to the ceiling as if afraid of gods eye and trembled and well they might and i too who so very lately had each of us the devil in our hearts if not tomorrow madam say but next thursday your uncles birthday say but next thursday this i say of this you may assure yourself i never never will be yours and let me hope that i may be entitled to the performance of your promise to be permitted to leave this innocent house as one called it but long have my ears been accustomed to such inversions of words as soon as the day breaks did my perdition depend upon it that you cannot madam but upon terms and i hope you will not terrify me still dreading the accursed knife nothing less than an attempt upon my honour shall make me desperate i have no view but to defend my honour with such a view only i entered into treaty with your infamous agent below the resolution you have seen i trust god will give me again upon the same occasion but for a less i wish not for it only take notice women that i am no wife of this man basely as he has used me i am not his wife he has no authority over me if he go away byandby and you act by his authority to detain me look to it then taking one of the lights she turned from us and away she went unmolested not a soul was able to molest her mabell saw her tremblingly and in a hurry take the key of her chamberdoor out of her pocket and unlock it and as soon as she entered heard her doublelock bar and bolt it by her taking out her key when she came out of her chamber to us she no doubt suspected my design which was to have carried her in my arms thither if she made such force necessary after i had intimidated her and to have been her companion for that night she was to have had several bedchamberwomen to assist to undress her upon occasion but from the moment she entered the diningroom with so much intrepidity it was absolutely impossible to think of prosecuting my villanous designs against her this this belford was the hand i made of a contrivance from which i expected so much and now i am ten times worse off than before thou never sawest people in thy life look so like fools upon one another as the mother her partners and i did for a few minutes and at last the two devilish nymphs broke out into insulting ridicule upon me while the old wretch was concerned for her house the reputation of her house i cursed them all together and retiring to my chamber locked myself in and now it is time to set out all i have gained detection disgrace fresh guilt by repeated perjuries and to be despised by her i doat upon and what is still worse to a proud heart by myself success success in projects is every thing what an admirable contriver did i think myself till now even for this scheme among the rest but how pitifully foolish does it now appear to me scratch out erase never to be read every part of my preceding letters where i have boastingly mentioned it and never presume to rally me upon the cursed subject for i cannot bear it but for the lady by my soul i love her i admire her more than ever i must have her i will have her still with honour or without as i have often vowed my cursed fright at her accidental bloody nose so lately put her upon improving upon me thus had she threatened me i should have soon been master of one arm and in both but for so sincere a virtue to threaten herself and not to offer to intimidate any other and with so much presence of mind as to distinguish in the very passionate intention the necessity of the act defence of her honour and so fairly to disavow lesser occasions showed such a deliberation such a choice such a principle and then keeping me so watchfully at a distance that i could not seize her hand so soon as she could have given the fatal blow how impossible not to be subdued by so true and so discreet a magnanimity but she is not gone she shall not go i will press her with letters for the thursday she shall yet be mine legally mine for as to cohabitation there is no such thing to be thought of the captain shall give her away as proxy for her uncle my lord will die my fortune will help my will and set me above every thing and every body but here is the curse she despises me jack what man as i have heretofore said can bear to be despised especially by his wife o lord o lord what a hand what a cursed hand have i made of this plot and here ends the history of the lady and the penknife the devil take the penknife it goes against me to say god bless the lady near sat morn letter xxxvii mr lovelace to miss clarissa harlowe superscribed to mrs lovelace m hall sat night june my dearest life if you do not impute to live and to terror raised by love the poor figure i made before you last night you will not do me justice i thought i would try to the very last moment if by complying with you in every thing i could prevail upon you to promise to be mine on thursday next since you refused me an earlier day could i have been so happy you had not been hindered going to hampstead or wherever else you pleased but when i could not prevail upon you to give me this assurance what room had i my demerit so great to suppose that your going thither would not be to lose you for ever i will own to you madam that yesterday afternoon i picked up the paper dropt by dorcas who has confessed that she would have assisted you in getting away if she had had opportunity so to do and undoubtedly dropped it by accident and could i have prevailed upon you as to thursday next i would have made no use of it secure as i should have been in your word given to be mine but when i found you inflexible i was resolved to try if by resenting dorcass treachery i could not make your pardon of me the condition of mine to her and if not to make a handle of it to revoke my consent to your going away from mrs sinclairs since the consequence of that must have been so fatal to me so far indeed was my proceeding low and artful and when i was challenged with it as such in so high and noble a manner i could not avoid taking shame to myself upon it but you must permit me madam to hope that you will not punish me too heavily for so poor a contrivance since no dishonour was meant you and since in the moment of its execution you had as great an instance of my incapacity to defend a wrong a low measure and at the same time in your power over me as mortal man could give in a word since you must have seen that i was absolutely under the controul both of conscience and of love i will not offer to defend myself for wishing you to remain where you are till either you give me your word to meet me at the altar on thursday or till i have the honour of attending you preparative to the solemnity which will make that day the happiest of my life i am but too sensible that this kind of treatment may appear to you with the face of an arbitrary and illegal imposition but as the consequences not only to ourselves but to both our families may be fatal if you cannot be moved in my favour let me beseech you to forgive this act of compulsion on the score of the necessity you your dear self have laid me under to be guilty of it and to permit the solemnity of next thursday to include an act of oblivion for all past offences the orders i have given to the people of the house are that you shall be obeyed in every particular that is consistent with my expectations of finding you there on my return on wednesday next that mrs sinclair and her nieces having incurred your just displeasure shall not without your orders come into your presence that neither shall dorcas till she has fully cleared her conduct to your satisfaction be permitted to attend you but mabell in her place of whom you seemed some time ago to express some liking will i have left behind me to attend your commands if he be either negligent or impertinent your dismission shall be a dismission of him from my service for ever but as to letters which may be sent you or any which you may have to send i must humbly entreat that none such pass from or to you for the few days that i shall be absent but i do assure you madam that the seals of both sorts shall be sacred and the letters if such be sent shall be given into your own hands the moment the ceremony is performed or before if you require it mean time i will inquire and send you word how miss howe does and to what if i can be informed her long silence is owing dr perkins i found here attending my lord when i arrived with dr s he acquaints me that your father mother uncles and the still less worthy persons of your family are well and intend to be all at your uncle harlowes next week i presume with intent to keep his anniversary this can make no alteration but a happy one as to persons on thursday because mr tomlinson assured me that if any thing fell out to hinder your uncles coming up in person which however he did not then expect he would be satisfied if his friend the captain were proxy for him i shall send a man and horse tomorrow to the captain to be at greater certainty i send this by a special messenger who will wait your pleasure in relation to the impatientlywishedfor thursday which i humbly hope will be signified by a line my lord though hardly sensible and unmindful of every thing but of your felicity desires his most affectionate compliments to you he has in readiness to present to you a very valuable set of jewels which he hopes will be acceptable whether he lives to see you adorn them or not lady sarah and lady betty have also their tokens of respect ready to court your acceptance but may heaven incline you to give the opportunity of receiving their personal compliments and those of my cousins montague before the next week be out his lordship is exceeding ill dr s has no hopes of him the only consolation i can have for the death of a relation who loves me so well if he do die must arise from the additional power it will put into my hands of showing how much i am my dearest life your everaffectionate faithful lovelace letter xxxviii mr lovelace to miss clarissa harlowe superscribed to mrs lovelace m hall sunday night june my dearest love i cannot find words to express how much i am mortified at the return of my messenger without a line from you thursday is so near that i will send messenger after messenger every four hours till i have a favourable answer the one to meet the other till its eve arrives to know if i may venture to appear in your presence with the hope of having my wishes answered on that day your love madam i neither expect nor ask for nor will till my future behaviour gives you cause to think i deserve it all i at present presume to wish is to have it in my power to do you all the justice i can now do you and to your generosity will i leave it to reward me as i shall merit with your affection at present revolving my poor behaviour of friday night before you i think i should sooner choose to go to my last audit unprepared for it as i am than to appear in your presence unless you give me some hope that i shall be received as your elected husband rather than however deserved as a detested criminal let me therefore propose an expedient in order to spare my own confusion and to spare you the necessity for that soulharrowing recrimination which i cannot stand and which must be disagreeable to yourself to name the church and i will have every thing in readiness so that our next interview will be in a manner at the very altar and then you will have the kind husband to forgive for the faults of the ungrateful lover if your resentment be still too high to write more let it only be in your own dear hand these words st martins church thursday or these st giless church thursday nor will i insist upon any inscription or subscription or so much as the initials of your name this shall be all the favour i will expect till the dear hand itself is given to mine in presence of that being whom i invoke as a witness of the inviolable faith and honour of your adoring lovelace letter xxxix mr lovelace to miss clarissa harlowe superscribed to mrs lovelace m hall monday june once more my dearest love do i conjure you to send me the four requested words there is no time to be lost and i would not have next thursday go over without being entitled to call you mine for the world and that as well for your sake as for my own hitherto all that has passed is between you and me only but after thursday if my wishes are unanswered the whole will be before the world my lord is extremely ill and endures not to have me out of his sight for one half hour but this shall not have the least weight with me if you be pleased to hold out the olivebranch to me in the four requested words i have the following intelligence from captain tomlinson all your family are at your uncle harlowes your uncle finds he cannot go up and names captain tomlinson for his proxy he proposes to keep all your family with him till the captain assures him that the ceremony is over already he has begun with hope of success to try to reconcile your mother to you my lord m but just now has told me how happy he should think himself to have an opportunity before he dies to salute you as his niece i have put him in hopes that he shall see you and have told him that i will go to town on wednesday in order to prevail upon you to accompany me down on thursday or friday i have ordered a set to be in readiness to carry me up and were not my lord so very ill my cousin montague tells me that she would offer her attendance on you if you please therefore we can set out for this place the moment the solemnity is performed do not dearest creature dissipate all those promising appearances and by refusing to save your own and your familys reputation in the eye of the world use yourself worse than the ungratefullest wretch on earth has used you for if we were married all the disgrace you imagine you have suffered while a single lady will be my own and only known to ourselves once more then consider well the situation we are both in and remember my dearest life that thursday will be soon here and that you have no time to lose in a letter sent by the messenger whom i dispatch with this i have desired that my friend mr belford who is your very great admirer and who knows all the secrets of my heart will wait upon you to know what i am to depend upon as to the chosen day surely my dear you never could at any time suffer half so much from cruel suspense as i do if i have not an answer to this either from your own goodness or through mr belfords intercession it will be too late for me to set out and captain tomlinson will be disappointed who goes to town on purpose to attend your pleasure one motive for the gentle resistance i have presumed to lay you under is to prevent the mischiefs that might ensue as probably to the more innocent as to the less were you to write to any body while your passions were so much raised and inflamed against me having apprized you of my direction to the women in town on this head i wonder you should have endeavoured to send a letter to miss howe although in a cover directed to that young ladys servant as you must think it would be likely to fall into my hands the lady had made an attempt to send away a letter the just sense of what i have deserved the contents should be leaves me no room to doubt what they are nevertheless i return it you enclosed with the seal as you will see unbroken relieve i beseech you dearest madam by the four requested words or by mr belford the anxiety of your everaffectionate and obliged lovelace remember there will not there cannot be time for further writing and for coming up by thursday your uncles birthday letter xl mr lovelace to john belford esq monday june thou wilt see the situation i am in with miss harlowe by the enclosed copies of three letters to two of which i am so much scorned as not to have one word given me in answer and of the third now sent by the messenger who brings thee this i am afraid as little notice will be taken and if so her day of grace is absolutely over one would imagine so long used to constraint too as she has been that she might have been satisfied with the triumph she had over us all on friday night a triumph that to this hour has sunk my pride and my vanity so much that i almost hate the words plot contrivance scheme and shall mistrust myself in future for every one that rises to my inventive head but seest thou not that i am under a necessity to continue her at sinclairs and to prohibit all her correspondencies now belford as i really in my present mood think of nothing less than marrying her if she let not thursday slip i would have thee attend her in pursuance of the intimation i have given her in my letter of this date and vow for me swear for me bind thy soul to her for my honour and use what arguments thy friendly heart can suggest in order to procure me an answer from her which as thou wilt see she may give in four words only and then i purpose to leave lord m dangerously ill as he is and meet her at her appointed church in order to solemnize if she will but sign cl h to thy writing the four words that shall do for i would not come up to be made a fool of in the face of all my family and friends if she should let the day go off i shall be desperate i am entangled in my own devices and cannot bear that she should detect me o that i had been honest what a devil are all my plots come to what do they end in but one grand plot upon myself and a title to eternal infamy and disgrace but depending on thy friendly offices i will say no more of this let her send me but one line but one line to treat me as unworthy of her notice yet be altogether in my power i cannot i will not bear that my lord as i said is extremely ill the doctors give him over he gives himself over those who would not have him die are afraid he will die but as to myself i am doubtful for these long and violent struggles between the constitution and the disease though the latter has three physicians and an apothecary to help it forward and all three as to their prescriptions of different opinions too indicate a plaguy habit and savour more of recovery than death and the more so as he has no sharp or acute mental organs to whet out his bodily ones and to raise his fever above the sympathetic helpful one thou wilt see in the enclosed what pains i am at to dispatch messengers who are constantly on the road to meet each other and one of them to link in the chain with the fourth whose station is in london and five miles onwards or till met but in truth i have some other matters for them to perform at the same time with my lords banker and his lawyer which will enable me if his lordship is so good as to die this bout to be an over match for some of my other relations i dont mean charlotte and patty for they are noble girls but others who have been scratching and clawing underground like so many moles in my absence and whose workings i have discovered since i have been down by the little heaps of dirt they have thrown up a speedy account of thy commission dear jack the letter travels all night letter xli mr belford to robert lovelace esq london june tuesday you must excuse me lovelace from engaging in the office you would have me undertake till i can be better assured you really intend honourably at last by this muchinjured lady i believe you know your friend belford too well to think he would be easy with you or with any man alive who should seek to make him promise for him what he never intended to perform and let me tell thee that i have not much confidence in the honour of a man why by imitation of hands i will only call it has shown so little regard to the honour of his own relations only that thou hast such jesuitical qualifyings or i should think thee at last touched with remorse and brought within view of being ashamed of thy cursed inventions by the ill success of thy last which i heartily congratulate thee upon o the divine lady but i will not aggravate nevertheless when thou writest that in thy present mood thou thinkest of marrying and yet canst so easily change thy mood when i know thy heart is against the state that the four words thou courtest from the lady are as much to thy purpose as if she wrote forty since it will show she can forgive the highest injury that can be offered to woman and when i recollect how easily thou canst find excuses to postpone thou must be more explicit a good deal as to thy real intentions and future honour than thou art for i cannot trust to temporary remorse which brought on by disappointment too and not by principle and the like of which thou hast so often got over if thou canst convince me time enough for the day that thou meanest to do honourably by her in her own sense of the word or if not time enough wilt fix some other day which thou oughtest to leave to her option and not bind her down for the thursday and the rather as thy pretence for so doing is founded on an absolute fiction i will then most cheerfully undertake thy cause by person if she will admit me to her presence if she will not by pen but in this case thou must allow me to be guarantee for thy family and if so so much as i value thee and respect thy skill in all the qualifications of a gentleman thou mayest depend upon it that i will act up to the character of a guarantee with more honour than the princes of our day usually doto their shame be it spoken mean time let me tell thee that my heart bleeds for the wrong this angelic lady has received and if thou dost not marry her if she will have thee and when married make her the best and tenderest of husbands i would rather be a dog a monkey a bear a viper or a toad than thee command me with honour and thou shalt find none readier to oblige thee than thy sincere friend john belford letter xlii mr lovelace to john belford esq m hall june tuesday night near yours reached me this moment by an extraordinary push in the messengers what a man of honour thou of a sudden and so in the imaginary shape of a guarantee thou threatenest me had i not been in earnest as to the lady i should not have offered to employ thee in the affair but let me say that hadst thou undertaken the task and i hadst afterwards thought fit to change my mind i should have contented myself to tell thee that that was my mind when thou engagedst for me and to have given thee the reasons for the change and then left thee to thy own discretion for never knew i what fear of man was nor fear of woman neither till i became acquainted with miss clarissa harlowe nay what is most surprising till i came to have her in my power and so thou wilt not wait upon the charmer of my heart but upon terms and conditions let it alone and be cursd i care not but so much credit did i give to the value thou expressedst for her that i thought the office would have been acceptable to thee as serviceable to me for what was it but to endeavour to persuade her to consent to the reparation of her own honour for what have i done but disgraced myself and been a thief to my own joys and if there be a union of hearts and an intention to solemnize what is there wanting but the foolish ceremony and that i still offer but if she will keep back her hand if she will make me hold out mine in vain how can i help it i write her one more letter and if after she has received that she keeps sullen silence she must thank herself for what is to follow but after all my heart is not wholly hers i love her beyond expression and cannot help it i hope therefore she will receive this last tender as i wish i hope she intends not like a true woman to plague and vex and tease me now she has found her power if she will take me to mercy now these remorses are upon me though i scorn to condition with thee for my sincerity all her trials as i have heretofore declared shall be over and she shall be as happy as i can make her for ruminating upon all that has passed between us from the first hour of our acquaintance till the present i must pronounce that she is virtue itself and once more i say has no equal as to what you hint of leaving to her choice another day do you consider that it will be impossible that my contrivances and stratagems should be much longer concealed this makes me press that day though so near and the more as i have made so much ado about her uncles anniversary if she send me the four words i will spare no fatigue to be in time if not for the canonical hour at church for some other hour of the day in her own apartment or any other for money will do every thing and that i have never spared in this affair to show thee that i am not at enmity with thee i enclose the copies of two letters one to her it is the fourth and must be the last on the subjectthe other to captain tomlinson calculated as thou wilt see for him to show her and now jack interfere in this case or not thou knowest the mind of r lovelace letter xliii mr lovelace to miss clarissa harlowe superscribed to mrs lovelace m hall wed morning one oclock june not one line my dearest life not one word in answer to three letters i have written the time is now so short that this must be the last letter that can reach you on this side the important hour that might make us legally one my friend mr belford is apprehensive that he cannot wait upon you in time by reason of some urgent affairs of his own i the less regret the disappointment because i have procured a more acceptable person as i hope to attend you captain tomlinson i mean to whom i had applied for this purpose before i had mr belfords answer i was the more solicitous to obtain his favour form him because of the office he is to take upon him as i humbly presume to hope tomorrow that office obliged him to be in town as this day and i acquainted him with my unhappy situation with you and desired that he would show me on this occasion that i had as much of his favour and friendship as your uncle had since the whole treaty must be broken off if he could not prevail upon you in my behalf he will dispatch the messenger directly whom i propose to meet in person at slough either to proceed onward to london with a joyful heart or to return back to m hall with a broken one i ought not but cannot help it to anticipate the pleasure mr tomlinson proposes to himself in acquainting you with the likelihood there is of your mothers seconding your uncles views for it seems he has privately communicated to her his laudable intentions and her resolution depends as well as his upon what tomorrow will produce disappoint not then i beseech you for an hundred persons sakes as well as for mine that uncle and that mother whose displeasure i have heard you so often deplore you may think it impossible for me to reach london by the canonical hour if it should the ceremony may be performed in your own apartments at any time in the day or at night so that captain tomlinson may have it to aver to your uncle that it was performed on his anniversary tell but the captain that you forbid me not to attend you and that shall be sufficient for bringing to you on the wings of love your evergrateful and affectionate lovelace letter xliv to mr patrick mdonald at his lodgings at mr browns perukemaker in st martins lane westminster m hall wedn morning two oclock dear mdonald the bearer of this has a letter to carry to the lady i have been at the trouble of writing a copy of it which i enclose that you may not mistake your cue see the preceding letter you will judge of my reasons for antedating the enclosed sealed one directed to you by the name of tomlinson which you are to show to the lady as in confidence you will open it of course see the next letter i doubt not your dexterity and management dear mdonald nor your zeal especially as the hope of cohabitation must now be given up impossible to be carried is that scheme i might break her heart but not incline her will am in earnest therefore to marry her if she let not the day slip improve upon the hint of her mother that may touch her but john harlowe remember has privately engaged that lady privately i say else not to mention the reason for her uncle harlowes former expedient you know she might find means to get a letter away to the one or to the other to know the truth or to miss howe to engage her to inquire into it and if she should the word privately will account for the uncles and mothers denying it however fail not as from me to charge our mother and her nymphs to redouble their vigilance both as to her person and letters alls upon a crisis now but she must not be treated ill neither thursday over i shall know what to resolve upon if necessary you must assume authority the devils int if such a girl as this shall awe a man of your years and experience you are not in love with her as i am fly out if she doubt your honour spirits naturally soft may be beat out of their play and borne down though ever so much raised by higher anger all women are cowards at bottom only violent where they may i have often stormed a girl out of her mistrust and made her yield before she knew where she was to the point indignantly mistrusted and that to make up with me though i was the aggressor if this matter succeed as id have it or if not and do not fail by your fault i will take you off the necessity of pursuing your cursed smuggling which otherwise may one day end fatally for you we are none of us perfect mdonald this sweet lady makes me serious sometimes in spite of my heart but as private vices are less blamable than public an as i think smuggling as it is called a national evil i have no doubt to pronounce you a much worse man than myself and as such shall take pleasure in reforming you i send you enclosed ten guineas as a small earnest of further favours hitherto you have been a very clever fellow as to clothes for thursday monmouthstreet will afford a ready supply clothes quite new would make your condition suspected but you may defer that care till you see if she can be prevailed upon your ridingdress will do for the first visit nor let your boots be over clean i have always told you the consequence of attending to the minutiae where art or imposture as the illmannered would call it is designed your linen rumpled and soily when you wait upon her easy terms these just come to town remember as formerly to loll to throw out your legs to stroke and grasp down your ruffles as if of significance enough to be careless what though the presence of a fine lady would require a different behaviour are you not of years to dispense with politeness you can have no design upon her you know you are a father yourself of daughters as old as she evermore is parade and obsequiousness suspectable it must show either a foolish head or a knavish heart assume airs of consequence therefore and you will be treated as a man of consequence i have often more than half ruined myself by my complaisance and being afraid of controul have brought controul upon myself i think i have no more to say at present i intend to be at slough or on the way to it as by mine to the lady adieu honest mdonald rl letter xlv to captain tomlinson enclosed in the preceding to be shown to the lady as in confidence m hall tuesday morn june dear captain tomlinson an unhappy misunderstanding has arisen between the dearest lady in the world and me the particulars of which she perhaps may give you but i will not because i might be thought partial to myself and she refusing to answer my most pressing and respectful letters i am at a most perplexing uncertainty whether she will meet us or not next thursday to solemnize my lord is so extremely ill that if i thought she would not oblige me i would defer going up to town for two or three days he cares not to have me out of his sight yet is impatient to salute my beloved as his neice sic before he dies this i have promised to give him an opportunity to do intending if the dear creature will make me happy to set out with her for this place directly from church with regret i speak it of the charmer of my soul that irreconcilableness is her familyfault the less excusable indeed for her as she herself suffers by it in so high a degree from her own relations now sir as you intended to be in town some time before thursday if it be not too great an inconvenience to you i could be glad you would go up as soon as possible for my sake and this i the more boldly request as i presume that a man who has so many great affairs of his own in hand as you have would be glad to be at a certainty as to the day you sir can so pathetically and justly set before her the unhappy consequences that will follow if the day be postponed as well with regard to her uncles disappointment as to the part you have assured me her mother is willing to take in the wishedfor reconciliation that i have great hopes she will suffer herself to be prevailed upon and a man and horse shall be in waiting to take your dispatches and bring them to me but if you cannot prevail in my favour you will be pleased to satisfy your friend mr john harlowe that it is not my fault that he is not obliged i am dear sir your extremely obliged and faithful servant r lovelace letter xlvi to robert lovelace esq wedn june near twelve oclock honoured sir i received yours as your servant desired me to acquaint you by ten this morning horse and man were in a foam i instantly equipped myself as if come off from a journey and posted away to the lady intending to plead great affairs that i came not before in order to favour your antedate and likewise to be in a hurry to have a pretence to hurry her ladyship and to take no denial for her giving a satisfactory return to your messenger but upon my entering mrs sinclairs house i found all in the greatest consternation you must not sir be surprised it is a trouble to me to be the relater of the bad news but so it is the lady is gone off she was missed but half an hour before i came her waitingmaid is run away or hitherto is not to be found so that they conclude it was by her connivance they had sent before i came to my honoured masters mr belton mr mowbray and mr belford mr tourville is out of town high words are passing between madam sinclair and madam horton and madam martin as also with dorcas and your servant william threatens to hang or drown himself they have sent to know if they can hear of mabell the waitingmaid at her mothers who it seems lives in chicklane westsmithfield and to an uncle of hers also who keeps an alehouse at cowcross had by and with whom she lived last your messenger having just changed his horse is come back so i will not detain him longer than to add that i am with great concern for this misfortune and thanks for your seasonable favour and kind intentions towards me i am sure this was not my fault honoured sir your most obliged humble servant patrick mdonald letter xlvii mr mowbray to robert lovelace esq wednesday twelve oclock dear lovelace i have plaguy news to acquaint thee with miss harlowe is gone off quite gone by soul i have no time for particulars your servant being gone off but if i had we are not yet come to the bottom of the matter the ladies here are all blubbering like devills accusing one another most confoundedly whilst belton and i damn them all together in thy name if thou shouldst hear that thy fellow will is taken dead out of some horsepond and dorcas cut down from her beds teaster from dangling in her own garters be not surprised heres the devil to pay nobody serene but jack belford who is taking minutes of examinations accusations and confessions with the significant air of a middlesex justice and intends to write at large all particulars i suppose i heartily condole with thee so does belton but it may turn out for the best for she is gone away with thy marks i understand a foolish little devill where will she mend herself for nobody will look upon her and they tell me that thou wouldst certainly have married her had she staid but i know thee better dear bobby adieu if lord m will die now to comfort thee for this loss what a seasonable exit would he make lets have a letter from thee prythee do thou canst write devilllike to belford who shews us nothing at all thine heartily rd mowbray letter xlviii mr belford to robert lovelace esq thursday june thou hast heard from mdonald and mowbray the news bad or good i know not which thoult deem it i only wish i could have given thee joy upon the same account before the unhappy lady was seduced from hampstead for then of what an ungrateful villany hadst thou been spared the perpetration which now thou hast to answer for i came to town purely to serve thee with her expecting that thy next would satisfy me that i might endeavour it without dishonour and at first when i found her gone i half pitied thee for now wilt thou be inevitably blown up and in what an execrable light wilt thou appear to all the world poor lovelace caught in thy own snares thy punishment is but beginning but to my narrative for i suppose thou expectest all particulars from me since mowbray has informed thee that i have been collecting them the noble exertion of spirit she has made on friday night had it seems greatly disordered her insomuch that she was not visible till saturday evening when mabell saw her and she seemed to be very ill but on sunday morning having dressed herself as if designing to go to church she ordered mabell to get her a coach to the door the wench told her she was to obey her in every thing but the calling of a coach or chair or in relation to letters she sent for will and gave him the same command he pleaded his masters orders to the contrary and desired to be excused upon this down she went herself and would have gone out without observation but finding the streetdoor doublelocked and the key not in the lock she stept into the streetparlour and would have thrown up the sash to call out to the people passing by as they doubted not but that since her last attempt of the same nature had been fastened down hereupon she resolutely stept into mrs sinclairs parlour in the backhouse where were the old devil and her two partners and demanded the key of the streetdoor or to have it opened for her they were all surprised but desired to be excused and pleaded your orders she asserted that you had no authority over her and never should have any that their present refusal was their own act and deed she saw the intent of their back house and the reason of putting her there she pleaded her condition and fortune and said they had no way to avoid utter ruin but by opening their doors to her or by murdering her and burying her in their garden or cellar too deep for detection that already what had been done to her was punishable by death and bid them at their peril detain her what a noble what a right spirit has this charming creature in cases that will justify an exertion of spirit they answered that mr lovelace could prove his marriage and would indemnify them and they all would have vindicated their behaviour on friday night and the reputation of their house but refusing to hear them on that topic she flung from them threatening she then went up half a dozen stairs in her way to her own apartment but as if she had bethought herself down she stept again and proceeded towards the streetparlour saying as she passed by the infamous dorcas ill make myself protectors though the windows suffer but that wench of her own head on the ladys going out of that parlour to mrs sinclairs had locked the door and taken out the key so that finding herself disappointed she burst into tears and went sobbing and menacing up stairs again she made no other attempt till the effectual one your letters and messages they suppose coming so fast upon one another though she would not answer one of them gave her some amusement and an assurance to them that she would at last forgive you and that then all would end as you wished the women in pursuance of your orders offered not to obtrude themselves upon her and dorcas also kept out of her sight all the rest of sunday also on monday and tuesday but by the ladys condescension even to familiarity to mabell they imagined that she must be working in her mind all that time to get away they therefore redoubled their cautions to the wench who told them so faithfully all that passed between her lady and her that they had no doubt of her fidelity to her wicked trust tis probable she might have been contriving something all this time but saw no room for perfecting any scheme the contrivance by which she effected her escape seems to me not to have been fallen upon till the very day since it depended partly upon the weather as it proved but it is evident she hoped something from mabells simplicity or gratitude or compassion by cultivating all the time her civility to her polly waited on her early on wednesday morning and met with a better reception than she had reason to expect she complained however with warmth of her confinement polly said there would be an happy end to it if it were a confinement next day she presumed she absolutely declared to the contrary in the way polly meant it and said that mr lovelace on his return which looked as if she intended to wait for it should have reason to repent the orders he had given as they all should their observance of them let him send twenty letters she would not answer one be the consequence what it would nor give him hope of the least favour while she was in that house she had given mrs sinclair and themselves fair warning she said no orders of another ought to make them detain a free person but having made an open attempt to go and been detained by them she was the calmer she told polly let them look to the consequence but yet she spoke this with temper and polly gave it as her opinion with apprehension for their own safety that having so good a handle to punish them all she would not go away if she might and what inferred polly is the indemnity of a man who has committed the vilest of rapes on a person of condition and must himself if prosecuted for it either fly or be hanged sinclair so i will still call her upon this representation of polly foresaw she said the ruin of her poor house in the issue of this strange business and the infamous sally and dorcas bore their parts in the apprehension and this put them upon thinking it advisable for the future that the streetdoor should generally in the daytime be only left upon a boltlatch as they called it which any body might open on the inside and that the key should be kept in the door that their numerous comers and goers as they called their guests should be able to give evidence that she might have gone out if she would not forgetting however to renew their orders to will to dorcas to mabell and the rest to redouble their vigilance on this occasion to prevent her escape none of them doubting at the same time that her love of a man so considerable in their eyes and the prospect of what was to happen as she had reason to believe on thursday her uncles birthday would though perhaps not till the last hour for her pride sake was their word engage her to change her temper they believe that she discovered the key to be left in the door for she was down more than once to walk in the little garden and seemed to cast her eye each time to the streetdoor about eight yesterday morning an hour after polly had left her she told mabell she was sure she should not live long and having a good many suits of apparel which after her death would be of no use to any body she valued she would give her a brown lustring gown which with some alterations to make it more suitable to her degree would a great while serve her for a sunday wear for that she mabell was the only person in that house of whom she could think without terror or antipathy mabell expressing her gratitude upon the occasion the lady said she had nothing to employ herself about and if she could get a workwoman directly she would look over her things then and give her what she intended for her her mistresss mantuamaker the maid replied lived but a little way off and she doubted not that she could procure her or one of the journeywomen to alter the gown out of hand i will give you also said she a quilted coat which will require but little alteration if any for you are much about my stature but the gown i will give directions about because the sleeves and the robings and facings must be altered for your wear being i believe above your station and try said she if you can get the workwoman and well advise about it if she cannot come now let her come in the afternoon but i had rather now because it will amuse me to give you a lift then stepping to the window it rains said she and so it had done all the morning slip on the hood and short cloak i have seen you wear and come to me when you are ready to go out because you shall bring me in something that i want mabell equipped herself accordingly and received her commands to buy her some trifles and then left her but in her way out stept into the back parlour where dorcas was with mrs sinclair telling her where she was going and on what account bidding dorcas look out till she came back so faithful as the wench to the trust reposed in her and so little had the ladys generosity wrought upon her mrs sinclair commended her dorcas envied her and took her cue and mabell soon returned with the mantuamakers journeywoman she resolved she said but she would not come without her and then dorcas went off guard the lady looked out the gown and petticoat and before the workwoman caused mabell to try it on and that it might fit the better made the willing wench pull off her upperpetticoat and put on that she gave her then she bid them go into mr lovelaces apartment and contrive about it before the pierglass there and stay till she came to them to give them her opinion mabell would have taken her own clothes and hood and short cloak with her but her lady said no matter you may put them on again here when we have considered about the alterations theres no occasion to litter the other room they went and instantly as it is supposed she slipt on mabells gown and petticoat over her own which was white damask and put on the wenchs hood short cloak and ordinary apron and down she went hearing somebody tripping along the passage both will and dorcas whipt to the innerhall door and saw her but taking her for mabell are you going far mabell cried will without turning her face or answering she held out her hand pointing to the stairs which they construed as a caution for them to look out in her absence and supposing she would not be long gone as she had not in form repeated her caution to them up went will tarrying at the stairshead in expectation of the supposed mabells return mabell and the workwoman waited a good while amusing themselves not disagreeably the one with contriving in the way of her business the other delighting herself with her fine gown and coat but at last wondering the lady did not come in to them mabell tiptoed it to her door and tapping and not being answered stept into the chamber will at that instant from his station at the stairshead seeing mabell in her ladys clothes for he had been told of the present gifts to servants fly from servant to servant in a minute was very much surprised having as he thought just seen her go out in her own and stepping up met her at the door how the devil can this be said he just now you went out in your own dress how came you here in this and how could you pass me unseen but nevertheless kissing her said he would now brag he had kissed his lady or one in her clothes i am glad mr william cried mabell to see you here so diligently but know you where my lady is in my masters apartment answered will is she not was she not talking with you this moment no thats mrs dolinss journeywoman they both stood aghast as they said will again recollecting he had seen mabell as he thought go out in her own clothes and while they were debating and wondering up comes dorcas with your fourth letter just then brought for the lady and seeing mabell dressed out whom she had likewise beheld a little before as she supposed in her common clothes she joined in the wonder till mabell reentering the ladys apartment missed her own clothes and then suspecting what had happened and letting the others into the ground of the suspicion they all agreed that she had certainly escaped and then followed such an uproar of mutual accusation and you should have done this and you have done that as alarmed the whole house every apartment in both houses giving up its devil to the number of fourteen or fifteen including the mother and her partners will told them his story and then ran out as on the like occasion formerly to make inquiry whether the lady was seen by any of the coachmen chairmen or porters plying in that neighbourhood while dorcas cleared herself immediately and that at the poor mabells expense who made a figure as guilty as awkward having on the suspected price of her treachery which dorcas out of envy was ready to tear from her back hereupon all the pack opened at the poor wench while the mother foamed at the mouth bellowed out her orders for seizing the suspected offender who could neither be heard in her own defence nor had she been heard would have been believed that such a perfidious wretch should ever disgrace her house was the mothers cry good people might be corrupted but it was a fine thing if such a house as hers could not be faithfully served by cursed creatures who were hired knowing the business they were to be employed in and who had no pretence to principle d n her the wretch proceeded she had no patience with her call the cook and call the scullion they were at hand see that guilty pyeball devil was her word her ladys gown upon her back but ill punish her for a warning to all betrayers of their trust put on the great gridiron this moment an oath or a curse at every word make up a roaring fire the cleaver bring me this instant ill cut her into quarters with my own hands and carbonade and broil the traitress for a feast to all the dogs and cats in the neighbourhood and eat the first slice of the toad myself without salt or pepper the poor mabell frighted out of her wits expected every moment to be torn in pieces having half a score openclawed paws upon her all at once she promised to confess all but that all when she had obtained a hearing was nothing for nothing had she to confess sally hereupon with a curse of mercy ordered her to retire undertaking that she and polly would examine her themselves that they might be able to write all particulars to his honour and then if she could not clear herself or if guilty give some account of the lady who had been so wicked as to give them all this trouble so as they might get her again then the cleaver and gridiron might go to work with all their heart the wench glad of this reprieve went up stairs and while sally was laying out the law and prating away in her usual dictorial manner whipt on another gown and sliding down the stairs escaped to her relations and this flight which was certainly more owing to terror than guilt was in the true old bailey construction made a confirmation of the latter these are the particulars of miss harlowes flight thoult hardly think me too minute how i long to triumph over thy impatience and fury on the occasion let me beseech thee my dear lovelace in thy next letter to rave most gloriously i shall be grievously disappointed if thou dost not where lovelace can the poor lady be gone and who can describe the distress she must be in by thy former letters it may be supposed that she can have very little money nor by the suddenness of her flight more clothes than those she has on and thou knowest who once said her parents will not receive her her uncles will not entertain her her norton is in their direction and cannot miss howe dare not she has not one friend or intimate in town entirely a stranger to it and let me add has been despoiled of her honour by the man for whom she had made all these sacrifices and who stood bound to her by a thousand oaths and vows to be her husband her protector and friend see vol iv letter xxi how strong must be her resentment of the barbarous treatment she has received how worthy of herself that it has made her hate the man she once loved and rather than marry him choose to expose her disgrace to the whole world to forego the reconciliation with her friends which her heart was so set upon and to hazard a thousand evils to which her youth and her sex may too probably expose an indigent and friendly beauty rememberest thou not that home push upon thee in one of the papers written in her delirium of which however it savours not i will assure thee that i have very often since most seriously reflected upon it and as thy intended second outrage convinces me that it made no impression upon thee then and perhaps thou hast never thought of it since i will transcribe the sentence if as religion teaches us god will judge us in a great measure by our benevolent or evil actions to one another o wretch bethink thee in time bethink thee how great must be thy condemnation see vol vi letter xvi and is this amiable doctrine the sum of religion upon my faith believe it is for to indulge a serious thought since we are not atheists except in practice does god the being of beings want any thing of us for himself and does he not enjoin us works of mercy to one another as the means to obtain his mercy a sublime principle and worthy of the supreme superintendent and father of all things but if we are to be judged by this noble principle what indeed must be thy condemnation on the score of this lady only and what mine and what all our confraternitys on the score of other women though we are none of us half so bad as thou art as well for want of inclination i hope as of opportunity i must add that as well for thy own sake as for the ladys i wish ye were yet to be married to each other it is the only medium that can be hit upon to salve the honour of both all thats past may yet be concealed from the world and from all her sufferings if thou resolvest to be a tender and kind husband to her and if this really be thy intention i will accept with pleasure of a commission from thee that shall tend to promote so good an end whenever she can be found that is to say if she will admit to her presence a man who professes friendship to thee nor can i give a greater demonstration that i am thy sincere friend j belford ps mabells clothes were thrown into the passage this morning nobody knows by whom letter xlix mr lovelace to john belford esq friday june i am ruined undone blown up destroyed and worse than annihilated thats certain but was not the news shocking enough dost thou think without thy throwing into the tooweighty scale reproaches which thou couldst have had no opportunity to make but for my own voluntary communications at a time too when as it falls out i have another very sensible disappointment to struggle with i imagine if there be such a thing as future punishment it must be none of the smallest mortifications that a new devil shall be punished by a worse old one and take that and take that to have the old satyr cry to the screaming sufferer laying on with a catoninetails with a star of burning brass at the end of each and for what for what why if the truth may be fairly told for not being so bad a devil as myself thou art surely casuist good enough to know what i have insisted upon heretofore that the sin of seducing a credulous and easy girl is as great as that of bringing to your lure an incredulous and watchful one see vol iv letter xvii however ungenerous an appearance what i am going to say may have from my pen let me tell thee that if such a woman as miss harlowe chose to enter into the matrimonial state i am resolved to disappoint thee in thy meditated triumph over my rage and despair and according to the old patriarchal system to go on contributing to get sons and daughters with no other view than to bring them up piously and to be good and useful members of the commonwealth what a devil had she to do to let her fancy run a gadding after a rake one whom she knew to be a rake oh but truly she hoped to have the merit of reclaiming him she had formed pretty notions how charming it would look to have a penitent of her own making dangling at her side at church through an applauding neighbourhood and as their family increased marching with her thither at the head of their boys and girls processionally as it were boasting of the fruits of their honest desires as my good lord bishop has it in his license and then what a comely sight all kneeling down together in one pew according to eldership as we have seen in effigy a whole family upon some old monument where the honest chevalier in armour is presented kneeling with uplifted hands and half a dozen jolterheaded cropeared boys behind him ranged gradatim or stepfashion according to age and size all in the same posture facing his pious dame with a ruff about her neck and as many wheyfaced girls all kneeling behind her an altar between them and an open book upon it over their heads semiluminary rays darting from gilded clouds surrounding an achievement motto in coelo salus or quies perhaps if they have happened to live the usual married life of brawl and contradiction it is certainly as much my misfortune to have fallen in with miss clarissa harlowe were i to have valued my reputation or ease as it is that of miss harlowe to have been acquainted with me and after all what have i done more than prosecute the maxim by which thou and i and every rake are governed and which before i knew this lady we have pursued from pretty girl to pretty girl as fast as we have set one down taking another up just as the fellows do with their flying coaches and flying horses at a country fairwith a who rides next who rides next but here in the present case to carry on the volant metaphor for i must either be merry or mad is a pretty little miss just come out of her hangingsleevecoat brought to buy a pretty little fairing for the world jack is but a great fair thou knowest and to give thee serious reflection for serious all its joys but tinselled hobbyhorses gilt gingerbread squeaking trumpets painted drums and so forth now behold this pretty little miss skimming from booth to booth in a very pretty manner one pretty little fellow called wyerley perhaps another jiggeting rascal called biron a third simpering varlet of the name of symmes and a more hideous villain than any of the reset with a long bag under his arm and parchment settlements tagged to his heels yelped solmes pursue her from rareeshow to rareeshow shouldering upon one another at every turn stopping when she stops and set a spinning again when she moves and thus dangled after but still in the eye of her watchful guardians traverses the pretty little miss through the whole fair equally delighted and delighting till at last taken with the invitation of the lacedhat orator and seeing several pretty little bibwearers stuck together in the flyingcoaches cutting safely the yielding air in the onegoup the other godown pictureoftheworld vehicle and all with as little fear as wit is tempted to ride next in then suppose she slily pops when none of her friends are near her and if after two or three ups and downs her pretty head turns giddy and she throws herself out of the coach when at its elevation and so dashes out her pretty little brains who can help it and would you hang the poor fellow whose professed trade it was to set the pretty little creature a flying tis true this pretty little miss being a very pretty little miss being a very muchadmired little miss being a very good little miss who always minded her book and had passed through her samplerdoctrine with high applause had even stitched out in gaudy propriety of colors an abraham offering up isaac a sampson and the philistines and flowers and knots and trees and the sun and the moon and the seven stars all hung up in frames with glasses before them for the admiration of her future grand children who likewise was entitled to a very pretty little estate who was descended from a pretty little family upwards of one hundred years gentility which lived in a very pretty little manner respected a very little on their own accounts a great deal on hers for such a pretty little miss as this to come to so great a misfortune must be a very sad thing but tell me would not the losing of any ordinary child of any other less considerable family or less shining or amiable qualities have been as great and heavy a loss to that family as the losing this pretty little miss could be to hers to descend to a very low instance and that only as to personality hast thou any doubt that thy strongmuscled bonyfaced was as much admired by thy mother as if it had been the face of a lovelace or any other handsome fellow and had thy picture been drawn would she have forgiven the painter had he not expressed so exactly thy lineaments as that every one should have discerned the likeness the handsome likeness is all that is wished for ugliness made familiar to us with the partiality natural to fond parents will be beauty all the world over do thou apply but alas jack all this is but a copy of my countenance drawn to evade thy malice though it answer thy unfriendly purpose to own it i cannot forbear to own it that i am stung to the very soul with this unhappy accident must i call it have i nobody whose throat either for carelessness or treachery i ought to cut in order to pacify my vengeance when i reflect upon my last iniquitous intention the first outrage so nobly resented as well as so far as she was able so nobly resisted i cannot but conclude that i was under the power of fascination from these accursed circes who pretending to know their own sex would have it that there is in every woman a yielding or a weakresisting moment to be met with and that yet and yet and yet i had not tried enough but that if neither love nor terror should enable me to hit that lucky moment when by help of their cursed arts she was once overcome she would be for ever overcome appealing to all my experience to all my knowledge of the sex for justification of their assertion my appeal to experience i own was but too favourable to their argument for dost thou think i could have held my purpose against such an angel as this had i ever before met with a woman so much in earnest to defend her honour against the unwearied artifices and perseverance of the man she loved why then were there not more examples of a virtue so immovable or why was this singular one to fall to my lot except indeed to double my guilt and at the same time to convince all that should hear her story that there are angels as well as devils in the flesh so much for confession and for the sake of humouring my conscience with a view likewise to disarm thy malice by acknowledgement since no one shall say worse of me than i will of myself on this occasion one thing i will nevertheless add to show the sincerity of my contrition tis this that if thou canst by any means find her out within these three days or any time before she has discovered the stories relating to captain tomlinson and her uncle to be what they are and if thou canst prevail upon her to consent i will actually in thy presence and his he to represent her uncle marry her i am still in hopes it may be so she cannot be long concealed i have already set all engines at work to find her out and if i do what indifferent persons and no one of her friends as thou observest will look upon her will care to embroil themselves with a man of my figure fortune and resolution show her this part then or any other part of this letter as thy own discretion if thou canst find her for after all methinks i would be glad that this affair which is bad enough in itself should go off without worse personal consequences to any body else and yet it runs in my mind i know not why that sooner or later it will draw a few drops of blood after it except she and i can make it up between ourselves and this may be another reason why she should not carry her resentment too far not that such an affair would give me much concern neither were i to choose any man of men for i heartily hate all her family but herself and ever shall let me add that the ladys plot to escape appears to me no extraordinary one there was much more luck than probability that it should do since to make it succeed it was necessary that dorcas and will and sinclair and her nymphs should be all deceived or off their guard it belongs to me when i see them to give them my hearty thanks that they were and that their selfish care to provide for their own future security should induce them to leave their outward door upon their boltlatch and be cursd to them mabell deserves a pitch suit and a bonfire rather than the lustring and as her clothes are returned le the ladys be put to her others to be sent to her when it can be told whither but not till i give the word neither for we must get the dear fugitive back again if possible i suppose that my stupid villain who knew not such a goddessshaped lady with a mien so noble from the awkward and bentshouldered mabell has been at hampstead to see after her and yet i hardly think she would go thither he ought to go through every street where bills for lodgings are up to inquire after a newcomer the houses of such as deal in womens matters and tea coffee and suchlike are those to be inquired at for her if some tidings be not quickly heard of her i would not have either dorcas will or mabell appear in my sight whatever their superiors think fit to do this though written in character is a very long letter considering it is not a narrative one or a journal of proceedings like most of my former for such will unavoidably and naturally as i may say run into length but i have so used myself to write a great deal of late that i know not how to help it yet i must add to its length in order to explain myself on a hint i gave at the beginning of it which was that i have another disappointment besides this of miss harlowes escape to bemoan and what dost thou think it is why the old peer pox of his tough constitution for that malady would have helped him on has made shift by fire and brimstone and the devil knows what to force the gout to quit the counterscarp of his stomach just as it had collected all its strength in order to storm the citadel of his heart in short they have by the mere force of stinkpots handgranades and popguns driven the slowworking pioneer quite out of the trunk into the extremities and there it lies nibbling and gnawing upon his great toe when i had a fair end of the distemper and the distempered but i who could write to thee of laudanum and the wet cloth formerly yet let a year slip through my fingers when i had entered upon it more than in imagination for i had begun to ask the stewards questions and to hear them talk of fines and renewals and such sort of stuff deserve to be mortified thou canst not imagine how differently the servants and even my cousins look upon me since yesterday to what they did before neither the one nor the other bow or courtesy half so low nor am i a quarter so often his honour and your honour as i was within these few hours with the former and as to the latter it is cousin bobby again with the usual familiarity instead of sir and sir and if you please mr lovelace and now they have the insolence to congratulate me on the recovery of the best of uncles while i am forced to seem as much delighted as they when would it do me good i could sit down and cry my eyes out i had bespoke my mourning in imagination after the example of a certain foreign minister who before the death or even last illness of charles ii as honest white kennet tells us had half exhausted blackwellhall of its sables an indication as the historian would insinuate that the monarch was to be poisoned and the ambassador in the secret and yet fool that i was i could not take the hint what the devil does a man read history for if he cannot profit by the examples he find in it but thus jack is an observation of the old peers verified that one misfortune seldom comes alone and so concludes thy doubly mortified lovelace letter l miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe wednesday night june o my dearest miss howe once more have i escaped but alas i my best self have not escaped oh your poor clarissa harlowe you also will hate me i fear yet you wont when you know all but no more of my self my lost self you that can rise in a morning to be blest and to bless and go to rest delighted with your own reflections and in your unbroken unstarting slumbers conversing with saints and angels the former only more pure than yourself as they have shaken off the incumbrance of body you shall be my subject as you have long long been my only pleasure and let me at awful distance revere my beloved anna howe and in her reflect upon what her clarissa harlowe once was forgive o forgive my rambling my peace is destroyed my intellects are touched and what flighty nonsense must you read if you now will vouchsafe to correspond with me as formerly o my best my dearest my only friend what a tale have i to unfold but still upon self this vile this hated self i will shake it off if possible and why should i not since i think except one wretch i hate nothing so much self then be banished from self one moment for i doubt it will be for no longer to inquire after a dearer object my beloved anna howe whose mind all robed in spotless white charms and irradiates but what would i say and how my dearest friend after this rhapsody which on reperusal i would not let go but to show you what a distracted mind dictates to my trembling pen how do you you have been very ill it seems that you are recovered my dear let me hear that your mother is well pray let me hear and hear quickly this comfort surely is owing to me for if life is no worse than chequerwork i must now have a little white to come having seen nothing but black all unchequered dismal black for a great great while and what is all this wild incoherence for it is only to beg to know how you have been and how you do now by a line directed for mrs rachel clark at mr smiths a gloveshop in kingstreet coventgarden which although my abode is secret to every body else will reach the hands of your unhappy but thats not enough your miserable clarissa harlowe letter li mrs howe to miss clarissa harlowe superscribed as directed in the preceding friday june miss clarissa harlowe you will wonder to receive a letter from me i am sorry for the great distress you seem to be in such a hopeful young lady as you were but see what comes of disobedience to parents for my part although i pity you yet i much more pity your poor father and mother such education as they gave you such improvement as you made and such delight as they took in you and all come to this but pray miss dont make my nancy guilt of your fault which is that of disobedience i have charged her over and over not to correspond with one who had made such a giddy step it is not to her reputation i am sure you know that i so charged her yet you go on corresponding together to my very great vexation for she has been very perverse upon it more than once evil communication miss you know the rest here people cannot be unhappy by themselves but they must invoke their friends and acquaintance whose discretion has kept them clear of their errors into near as much unhappiness as if they had run into the like of their own heads thus my poor daughter is always in tears and grief and she has postponed her own felicity truly because you are unhappy if people who seek their own ruin could be the only sufferers by their headstrong doings it were something but o miss miss what have you to answer for who have made as many grieved hearts as have known you the whole sex is indeed wounded by you for who but miss clarissa harlowe was proposed by every father and mother for a pattern for their daughters i write a long letter where i proposed to say but a few words and those to forbid your writing to my nancy and this as well because of the false step you have made as because it will grieve her poor heart and do you no good if you love her therefore write not to her your sad letter came into my hands nancy being abroad and i shall not show it her for there would be no comfort for her if she saw it nor for me whose delight she is as you once was to your parents but you seem to be sensible enough of your errors now so are all giddy girls when it is too late and what a crestfallen figure then do the consequences of their selfwilled obstinacy and headstrongness compel them to make i may say too much only as i think it proper to bear that testimony against your rashness which it behoves every careful parent to bear and none more than your compassionating wellwishing annabella howe i send this by a special messenger who has business only so far as barnet because you shall have no need to write again knowing how you love writing and knowing likewise that misfortune makes people plaintive letter lii miss clarissa harlowe to mrs howe saturday july permit me madam to trouble you with a few lines were it only to thank you for your reproofs which have nevertheless drawn fresh streams of blood from a bleeding heart my story is a dismal story it has circumstances in it that would engage pity and possibly a judgment not altogether unfavourable were those circumstances known but it is my business and shall be all my business to repent of my failings and not endeavour to extenuate them nor will i seek to distress your worthy mind if i cannot suffer alone i will make as few parties as i can in my sufferings and indeed i took up my pen with this resolution when i wrote the letter which has fallen into your hands it was only to know and that for a very particular reason as well as for affection unbounded if my dear miss howe from whom i had not heard of a long time were ill as i had been told she was and if so how she now does but my injuries being recent and my distresses having been exceeding great self would crowd into my letter when distressed the human mind is apt to turn itself to every one in whom it imagined or wished an interest for pity and consolation or to express myself better and more concisely in your own words misfortune makes people plaintive and to whom if not to a friend can the afflicted complain miss howe being abroad when my letter came i flatter myself that she is recovered but it would be some satisfaction to me to be informed if she has been ill another line from your hand would be too great a favour but if you will be pleased to direct any servant to answer yes or no to that question i will not be farther troublesome nevertheless i must declare that my miss howes friendship was all the comfort i had or expected to have in this world and a line from her would have been a cordial to my fainting heart judge then dearest madam how reluctantly i must obey your prohibition but yet i will endeavour to obey it although i should have hoped as well from the tenor of all that has passed between miss howe and me as from her established virtue that she could not be tainted by evil communication had one or two letters been permitted this however i ask not for since i think i have nothing to do but to beg of god who i hope has not yet withdrawn his grace from me although he has pleaded to let loose his justice upon my faults to give me a truly broken spirit if it be not already broken enough and then to take to his mercy the unhappy clarissa harlowe two favours good madam i have to beg of you the first that you will not let any of my relations know that you have heard from me the other that no living creature be apprized where i am to be heard of or directed to this is a point that concerns me more than i can express in short my preservation from further evils may depend upon it letter liii miss clarissa harlowe to hannah burton thursday june my good hannah strange things have happened to me since you were dismissed my service so sorely against my will and your pert fellow servant set over me but that must all be forgotten now how do you my hannah are you recovered of your illness if you are do you choose to come and be with me or can you conveniently i am a very unhappy creature and being among all strangers should be very glad to have you with me of whose fidelity and love i have had so many acceptable instances living or dying i will endeavour to make it worth your while my hannah if you are recovered as i hope and if you have a good place it may be they would bear with your absence and suffer somebody in your room for a month or so and by that time i hope to be provided for and you may then return to your place dont let any of my friends know of this my desire whether you can come or not i am at mr smiths a hosiers and glove shop in kingstreet coventgarden you must direct to me by the name of rachel clark do my good hannah come if you can to your poor young mistress who always valued you and always will whether you come or not i send this to your mother at st albans not knowing where to direct to you return me a line that i may know what to depend upon and i shall see you have not forgotten the pretty hand you were taught in happy days by your true friend clarissa harlowe letter liv hannah burton in answer monday july honored maddam i have not forgot to write and never will forget any thing you my dear young lady was so good as to larn me i am very sorrowful for your misfortens my dearest young lady so sorrowfull i do not know what to do gladd at harte would i be to be able to come to you but indeed i have not been able to stir out of my rome here at my mothers ever since i was forsed to leave my plase with a roomatise which has made me quite and clene helpless i will pray for you night and day my dearest my kindest my goodest young lady who have been so badly used and i am very sorry i cannot come to do you love and sarvice which will ever be in the harte of mee to do if it was in my power who am your most dutiful servant to command hannah burton letter lv miss clarissa harlowe to mrs judith norton thursday june my dear mrs norton i address myself to you after a very long silence which however was not owing either to want of love or duty principally to desire you to satisfy me in two or three points which it behoves me to know my father and all the family i am informed are to be at my uncle harlowes this day as usual pray acquaint me if they have been there and if they were cheerful on the anniversary occasion and also if you have heard of any journey or intended journey of my brother in company with captain singleton and mr solmes strange things have happened to me my dear worthy and maternal friend very strange things mr lovelace has proved a very barbarous and ungrateful man to me but god be praised i have escaped from him being among absolute strangers though i think worthy folks i have written to hannah burton to come and be with me if the good creature fall in your way pray encourage her to come to me i always intended to have her she knows but hoped to be in happier circumstances say nothing to any of my friends that you have heard from me pray do you think my father would be prevailed upon if i were to supplicate him by letter to take off the heavy curse he laid upon me at my going from harloweplace i can expect no other favour from him but that being literally fulfilled as to my prospects in this life i hope it will be thought to have operated far enough and my heart is so weak it is very weak but for my fathers own sake what should i say indeed i hardly know how i ought to express myself on this sad subject but it will give ease to my mind to be released from it i am afraid my poor as i used to call the good creatures to whose necessities i was wont to administer by your faithful hands have missed me of late but now alas i am poor myself it is not the least aggravation of my fault nor of my regrets that with such inclinations as god has given me i have put it our of my power to do the good i once pleased myself to think i was born to do it is a sad thing my dearest mrs nortin to render useless to ourselves and the world by our own rashness the talents which providence has intrusted to us for the service of both but these reflections are now too late and perhaps i ought to have kept them to myself let me however hope that you love me still pray let me hope that you do and then notwithstanding my misfortunes which have made me seem ungrateful to the kind and truly maternal pains you have taken with me from my cradle i shall have the happiness to think that there is one worthy person who hates not the unfortunate clarissa harlowe pray remember me to my fosterbrother i hope he continues dutiful and good to you be pleased to direct for rachel clark at mr smiths in kingstreet coventgarden but keep the direction an absolute secret letter lvi mrs norton in answer saturday july your letter my dearest young lady cuts me to the heart why will you not let me know all your distresses yet you have said enough my son is very good to me a few hours ago he was taken with a feverish disorder but i hope it will go off happily if his ardour for business will give him the recess from it which his good master is willing to allow him he presents his duty to you and shed tears at hearing your sad letter read you have been misinformed as to your familys being at your uncle harlowes they did not intend to be there nor was the day kept at all indeed they have not stirred out but to church and that but three times ever since the day you went away unhappy day for them and for all who know you to me i am sure most particularly so my heart now bleeds more and more for you i have not heard a syllable of such a journey as you mentioned of your brother captain singleton and mr solmes there has been some talk indeed of your brothers setting out for his northern estates but i have not heard of it lately i am afraid no letter will be received from you it grieves me to tell you so my dearest young lady no evil can have happened to you which they do not expect to hear of so great is their antipathy to the wicked man and so bad is his character i cannot but think hardly of their unforgiveness but there is no judging for others by ones self nevertheless i will add that if you had had as gentle spirits as mine these evils had never happened either to them or to you i knew your virtue and your love of virtue from your very cradle and i doubted not but that with gods grace would always be your guard but you could never be driven nor was there occasion to drive you so generous so noble so discreet but how does my love of your amiable qualities increase my affliction as these recollections must do yours you are escaped my dearest miss happily i hope that is to say with your honour else how great must be your distress yet from your letter i dread the worst i am very seldom at harloweplace the house is not the house it used to be since you went from it then they are so relentless and as i cannot say harsh things of the beloved child of my heart as well as bosom they do not take it amiss that i stay away your hannah left her place ill some time ago and as she is still at her mothers at st albans i am afraid she continues ill if so as you are among strangers and i cannot encourage you at present to come into these parts i shall think it my duty to attend you let it be taken as it will as soon as my tommys indisposition will permit which i hope will be soon i have a little money by me you say you are poor yourself how grievous are those words from one entitled and accustomed to affluence will you be so good to command it my beloved young lady it is most of it your own bounty to me and i should take a pride to restore it to its original owner your poor bless you and pray for you continually i have so managed your last benevolence and they have been so healthy and have had such constant employ that it has held out and will hold out till the happier times return which i continually pray for let me beg of you my dearest young lady to take to yourself all those aids which good persons like you draw from religion in support of their calamities let your sufferings be what they will i am sure you have been innocent in your intention so do not despond none are made to suffer above what they can and therefore ought to bear we know not the methods of providence nor what wise ends it may have to serve in its seeminglysevere dispensations to its poor creatures few persons have greater reason to say this than myself and since we are apt in calamities to draw more comfort from example than precept you will permit me to remind you of my own lot for who has had a greater share of afflictions than myself to say nothing of the loss of an excellent mother at a time of life when motherly care is most wanted the death of a dear father who was an ornament to his cloth and who had qualified me to be his scribe and amanuensis just as he came within view of a preferment which would have made his family easy threw me friendless into the wide world threw me upon a very careless and which was much worse a very unkind husband poor man but he was spared long enough thank god in a tedious illness to repent of his neglected opportunities and his light principles which i have always thought of with pleasure although i was left the more destitute for his chargeable illness and ready to be brought to bed when he died of my tommy but this very circumstance which i thought the unhappiest that i could have been left in so shortsighted is human prudence became the happy means of recommending me to your mother who in regard to my character and in compassion to my very destitute circumstances permitted me as i made a conscience of not parting with my poor boy to nurse both you and him born within a few days of each other and i have never since wanted any of the humble blessings which god has made me contented with nor have i known what a very great grief was from the day of my poor husbands death till the day that your parents told me how much they were determined that you should have mr solmes when i was apprized not only of your aversion to him but how unworthy he was of you for then i began to dread the consequences of forcing so generous a spirit and till then i never feared mr lovelace attracting as was his person and specious his manners and address for i was sure you would never have him if he gave you not good reason to be convinced of his reformation nor till your friends were as well satisfied in it as yourself but that unhappy misunderstanding between your brother and mr lovelace and their joining so violently to force you upon mr solmes did all that mischief which has cost you and them so dear and poor me all my peace oh what has not this ungrateful this doubleguilty man to answer for nevertheless you know not what god has in store for you yet but if you are to be punished all your days here for example sake in a case of such importance for your one false step be pleased to consider that this life is but a state of probation and if you have your purification in it you will be the more happy nor doubt i that you will have the higher reward hereafter for submitting to the will of providence here with patience and resignation you see my dearest miss clary that i make no scruple to call the step you took a false one in you it was less excusable than it would have been in any other young lady not only because of your superior talents but because of the opposition between your character and his so that if you had been provoked to quit your fathers house it need not to have been with him nor needed i indeed but as an instance of my impartial love to have written this to you mrs norton having only the family representation and invectives to form her judgment upon knew not that clarissa had determined against going off with mr lovelace nor how solicitous she had been to procure for herself any other protection than his when she apprehended that if she staid she had no way to avoid being married to mr solmes after this it will have an unkind and perhaps at this time an unseasonable appearance to express my concern that you have not before favoured me with a line yet if you can account to yourself for your silence i dare say i ought to be satisfied for i am sure you love me as i both love and honour you and ever will and the more for your misfortunes one consolation methinks i have even when i am sorrowing for your calamities and that is that i know not any young person so qualified to shine the brighter for the trials she may be exercised with and yet it is a consolation that ends in adding to my regrets for your afflictions because you are blessed with a mind so well able to bear prosperity and to make every body round you the better for it but i will forbear till i know more ruminating on every thing your melancholy letter suggests and apprehending from the gentleness of your mind the amiableness of your person and your youth the farther misfortunes and inconveniencies to which you may possibly be subjected i cannot conclude without asking for your leave to attend you and that in a very earnest manner and i beg of you not to deny me on any consideration relating to myself or even to the indisposition of my other beloved child if i can be either of use or of comfort to you were it my dearest young lady but for two or three days permit me to attend you although my sons illness should increase and compel me to come down again at the end of those two or three days i repeat my request likewise that you will command from me the little sum remaining in the hands of your bounty to your poor as well as that dispensed to your everaffectionate and faithful servant judith norton letter lvii miss cl harlowe to lady betty lawrance thursday june madam i hope youll excuse the freedom of this address from one who has not the honour to be personally known to you although you must have heard much of clarissa harlowe it is only to beg the favour of a line from your ladyships hand by the next post if convenient in answer to the following questions whether you wrote a letter dated as i have a memorandum wedn june congratulating your nephew lovelace on his supposed nuptials as reported to you by mr spurrier your ladyships steward as from one captain tomlinson and in it reproaching mr lovelace as guilty of slight c in not having acquainted your ladyship and the family with his marriage whether your ladyship wrote to miss montague to meet you at reading in order to attend you to your cousin leesons in albemarlestreet on your being obliged to be in town on your old chancery affair i remember are the words and whether you bespoke your nephews attendance there on sunday night the th whether your ladyship and miss montague did come to town at that time and whether you went to hampstead on monday in a hired coach and four your own being repairing and took from thence to town with the young creature whom you visited there your ladyship will probably guess that the questions are not asked for reasons favourable to your nephew lovelace but be the answer what it will it can do him no hurt nor me any good only that i think i owe it to my former hopes however deceived in them and even to charity that a person of whom i was once willing to think better should not prove so egregiously abandoned as to be wanting in every instance to that veracity which is indispensable in the character of a gentleman be pleased madam to direct to me keeping the direction a secret for the present to be left at the bellesavage on ludgate hill till called for i am your ladyships most humble servant clarissa harlowe letter lviii lady betty lawrance to miss cl harlowe saturday july dear madam i find that all is not as it should be between you and my nephew lovelace it will very much afflict me and all his friends if he has been guilty of any designed baseness to a lady of your character and merit we have been long in expectation of an opportunity to congratulate you and ourselves upon an event most earnestly wished for by us all since our hopes of him are built upon the power you have over him for if ever man adored a woman he is that man and you madam are that woman miss montague in her last letter to me in answer to one of mine inquiring if she knew from him whether he could call you his or was likely soon to have that honour has these words i know not what to make of my cousin lovelace as to the point your ladyship is so earnest about he sometimes says he is actually married to miss cl harlowe at other times that it is her own fault if he be not he speaks of her not only with love but with reverence yet owns that there is a misunderstanding between them but confesses that she is wholly faultless an angel and not a woman he says she is and that no man living can be worthy of her this is what my niece montague writes god grant my dearest young lady that he may not have so heinously offended you that you cannot forgive him if you are not already married and refuse to be his i shall lose all hopes that he ever will marry or be the man i wish him to be so will lord m so will lady sarah sadleir i will now answer your questions but indeed i hardly know what to write for fear of widening still more the unhappy difference between you but yet such a young lady must command every thing from me this then is my answer i wrote not any letter to him on or about the th of june neither i nor my steward know any such man as captain tomlinson i wrote not to my niece to meet me at reading nor to accompany me to my cousin leesons in town my chancery affair though like most chancery affairs it be of long standing is nevertheless now in so good a way that it cannot give me occasion to go to town nor have i been in town these six months nor at hampstead for years neither shall i have any temptation to go to town except to pay my congratulatory compliments to mrs lovelace on which occasion i should go with the greatest pleasure and should hope for the favour of your accompanying me to glenhamhall for a month at least be what will the reason of your inquiry let me entreat you my dear young lady for lord ms sake for my sake for this giddy mans sake soul as well as body and for all our familys sakes not to suffer this answer to widen differences so far as to make you refuse him if he already has not the honour of calling you his as i am apprehensive he has not by your signing by your familyname and here let me offer to you my mediation to compose the difference between you be it what it will your cause my dear young lady cannot be put into the hands of any body living more devoted to your service than into those of your sincere admirer and humble servant eliz lawrance letter lix miss clarissa harlowe to mrs hodges enfield june mrs hodges i am under a kind of necessity to write to you having no one among my relations to whom i dare write or hope a line from if i did it is but to answer a question it is this whether you know any such man as captain tomlinson and if you do whether he be very intimate with my uncle harlowe i will describe his person lest possibly he should go by another name among you although i know not why he should he is a thin tallish man a little pockfretten of a sallowish complexion fifty years of age or more of good aspect when he looks up he seems to be a serious man and one who knows the world he stoops a little in the shoulders is of berkshire his wife of oxfordshire and has several children he removed lately into your parts form northamptonshire i must desire you mrs hodges that you will not let my uncle nor any of my relations know that i write to you you used to say that you would be glad to have it in your power to serve me that indeed was in my prosperity but i dare say you will not refuse me in a particular that will oblige me without hurting yourself i understand that my father mother and sister and i presume my brother and my uncle antony are to be at my uncle harlowes this day god preserve them all and may they rejoice in many happy birthdays you will write six words to me concerning their healths direct for a particular reason to mrs dorothy salcombe to be left till called for at the four swans inn bishopsgatestreet you know my handwriting well enough were not the contents of the letter sufficient to excuse my name or any other subscription than that of your friend letter lx mrs hodges in answer sat july maddam i return you an anser as you wish me to doe master is acquented

sarah hodges letter lxi miss cl harlowe to lady betty lawrance monday july madam i cannot excuse myself from giving your ladyship this one trouble more to thank you as i most heartily do for your kind letter i must own to you madam that the honour of being related to ladies as eminent for their virtue as for their descent was at first no small inducement with me to lend an ear to mr lovelaces address and the rather as i was determined had it come to effect to do every thing in my power to deserve your favourable opinion i had another motive which i knew would of itself give me merit with your whole family a presumptuous one a punishably presumptuous one as it has proved in the hope that i might be an humble mean in the hand of providence to reclaim a man who had as i thought good sense enough to acknowledge the intended obligation whether the generous hope were to succeed or not but i have been most egregiously mistaken in mr lovelace the only man i persuade myself pretending to be a gentleman in whom i could have been so much mistaken for while i was endeavouring to save a drowning wretch i have been not accidentally but premeditatedly and of set purpose drawn in after him and he has had the glory to add to the list of those he has ruined a name that i will be bold to say would not have disparaged his own and this madam by means that would shock humanity to be made acquainted with my whole end is served by your ladyships answer to the questions i took the liberty to put to you in writing nor have i a wish to make the unhappy man more odious to you than is necessary to excuse myself for absolutely declining your offered mediation when your ladyship shall be informed of the following particulars that after he had compulsorily as i may say tricked me into the act of going off with him he could carry me to one of the vilest houses as it proved in london that he could be guilty of a wicked attempt in resentment of which i found means to escape from him to hampstead that after he had found me out there i know not how he could procure two women dressed out richly to personate your ladyship and miss montague who under pretence of engaging me to make a visit in town to your cousin leeson promising to return with me that evening to hampstead betrayed me back again to the vile house where again made a prisoner i was first robbed of my senses and then of my honour why should i seek to conceal that disgrace from others which i cannot hide from myself when your ladyship shall know that in the shocking progress to this ruin wilful falsehoods repeated forgeries particularly of one letter from your ladyship another from miss montague and a third from lord m and numberless perjuries were not the least of his crimes you will judge that i can have no principles that will make me worthy of an alliance with ladies of yours and your noble sisters character if i could not from my soul declare that such an alliance can never now take place i will not offer to clear myself entirely of blame but as to him i have no fault to accuse myself of my crime was the corresponding with him at first when prohibited so to do by those who had a right to my obedience made still more inexcusable by giving him a clandestine meeting which put me into the power of his arts and for this i am content to be punished thankful that at last i have escaped from him and have it in my power to reject so wicked a man for my husband and glad if i may be a warning since i cannot be an example which once very vain and very conceited as i was i proposed to myself to be all the ill i wish him is that he may reform and that i may be the last victim to his baseness perhaps this desirable wish may be obtained when he shall see how his wickedness his unmerited wickedness to a poor creature made friendless by his cruel arts will end i conclude with my humble thanks to your ladyship for your favourable opinion of me and with the assurance that i will be while life is lent me your ladyships grateful and obliged servant clarissa harlowe letter lxii miss clarissa harlowe to mrs norton sunday evening july how kindly my beloved mrs norton do you soothe the anguish of a bleeding heart surely you are mine own mother and by some unaccountable mistake i must have been laid to a family that having newly found out or at least suspected the imposture cast me from their hearts with the indignation that such a discovery will warrant oh that i had been indeed your own child born to partake of your humble fortunes an heiress only to that content in which you are so happy then should i have had a truly gentle spirit to have guided my ductile heart which force and ungenerous usage sit so ill upon and nothing of what has happened would have been but let me take heed that i enlarge not by impatience the breach already made in my duty by my rashness since had i not erred my mother at least could never have been thought hardhearted and unforgiving am i not then answerable not only for my own faults but for the consequences of them which tend to depreciate and bring disgrace upon a maternal character never before called in question it is kind however in you to endeavour to extenuate the faults of one so greatly sensible of it and could it be wiped off entirely it would render me more worthy of the pains you have taken in my education for it must add to your grief as it does to my confusion that after such promising beginnings i should have so behaved as to be a disgrace instead of a credit to you and my other friends but that i may not make you think me more guilty than i am give me leave briefly to assure you that when my story is known i shall be to more compassion than blame even on the score of going away with mr lovelace as to all that happened afterwards let me only say that although i must call myself a lost creature as to this world yet have i this consolation left me that i have not suffered either for want of circumspection or through careful credulity or weakness not one moment was i off my guard or unmindful of your early precepts but having been enabled to baffle many base contrivances i was at last ruined by arts the most inhuman but had i not been rejected by every friend this lowhearted man had not dared nor would have had opportunity to treat me as he has treated me more i cannot at this time nor need i say and this i desire you to keep to yourself lest resentments should be taken up when i am gone that may spread the evil which i hope will end with me i have been misinformed you say as to my principal relations being at my uncle harlowes the day you say was not kept nor have my brother and mr solmes astonishing what complicated wickedness has this wretched man to answer for were i to tell you you would hardly believe that there could have been such a heart in man but one day you may know the whole story at present i have neither inclination nor words o my bursting heart yet a happy a wished relief were you present my tears would supply the rest i resume my pen and so you fear no letter will be received from me but dont grieve to tell me so i expect every thing bad and such is my distress that had you not bid me hope for mercy from the throne of mercy i should have been afraid that my fathers dreadful curse would be completed with regard to both worlds for here an additional misfortune in a fit of phrensical heedlessness i sent a letter to my beloved miss howe without recollecting her private address and it has fallen into her angry mothers hands and so that dear friend perhaps has anew incurred displeasure on my account and here too your worthy son is ill and my poor hannah you think cannot come to me o my dear mrs norton will you can you censure those whose resentments against me heaven seems to approve of and will you acquit her whom that condemns yet you bid me not despond i will not if i can help it and indeed most seasonable consolation has your kind letter afforded me yet to god almighty do i appeal to avenge my wrongs and vindicate my inno but hushed be my stormy passions have i not but this moment said that your letter gave me consolation may those be forgiven who hinder my father from forgiving me and this as to them shall be the harshest thing that shall drop from my pen but although your son should recover i charge you my dear mrs norton that you do not think of coming to me i dont know still but your mediation with my mother although at present your interposition would be so little attended to may be of use to procure me the revocation of that most dreadful part of my fathers curse which only remains to be fulfilled the voice of nature must at last be heard in my favour surely it will only plead at first to my friends in the still conscious plaintiveness of a young and unhardened beggar but it will grow more clamorous when i have the courage to be so and shall demand perhaps the paternal protection from farther ruin and that forgiveness which those will be little entitled to expect for their own faults who shall interpose to have it refused to me for an accidental not a premeditated error and which but for them i had never fallen into but again impatiency founded perhaps on selfpartiality that strange misleader prevails let me briefly say that it is necessary to my present and future hopes that you keep well with my family and moreover should you come i may be traced out by that means by the most abandoned of men say not then that you think you ought to come up to me let it be taken as it will for my sake let me repeat were my fosterbrother recovered as i hope he is you must not come nor can i want your advice while i can write and you can answer me and write i will as often as i stand in need of your counsel then the people i am now with seem to be both honest and humane and there is in the same house a widowlodger of low fortunes but of great merit almost such another serious and good woman as the dear one to whom i am now writing who has as she says given over all other thoughts of the world but such as should assist her to leave it happily how suitable to my own views there seems to be a comfortable providence in this at least so that at present there is nothing of exigence nothing that can require or even excuse your coming when so many better ends may be answered by your staying where you are a time may come when i shall want your last and best assistance and then my dear mrs norton and then i will speak it and embrace it with all my whole heart and then will it not be denied me by any body you are very obliging in your offer of money but although i was forced to leave my clothes behind me yet i took several things of value with me which will keep me from present want youll say i have made a miserable hand of it so indeed i have and to look backwards in a very little while too but what shall i do if my father cannot be prevailed upon to recall his malediction o my dear mrs norton what a weight must a fathers curse have upon a heart so appreciative as mine did i think i should ever have a fathers curse to deprecate and yet only that the temporary part of it is so terribly fulfilled or i should be as earnest for its recall for my fathers sake as for my own you must not be angry with me that i wrote not to you before you are very right and very kind to say you are sure i love you indeed i do and what a generosity so like yourself is there in your praise to attribute to me more than i merit in order to raise an emulation to me to deserve your praises you tell me what you expect from me in the calamities i am called upon to bear may i behave answerably i can a little account to myself for my silence to you my kind my dear maternal friend how equally sweetly and politely do you express yourself on this occasion i was very desirous for your sake as well as for my own that you should have it to say that we did not correspond had they thought we did every word you could have dropt in my favour would have been rejected and my mother would have been forbid to see you or pay any regard to what you should say then i had sometimes better and sometimes worse prospects before me my worst would only have troubled you to know my better made me frequently hope that by the next post or the next and so on for weeks i should have the best news to impart to you that then could happen cold as the wretch had made my heart to that best for how could i think to write to you with a confession that i was not married yet lived in the house for i could not help it with such a man who likewise had given it out to several that we were actually married although with restrictions that depended on the reconciliation with my friends and to disguise the truth or be guilty of a falsehood either direct or equivocal that was what you had never taught me but i might have written to you for advice in my precarious situation perhaps you will think but indeed my dear mrs norton i was not lost for want of advice and this will appear clear to you from what i have already hinted were i to explain myself no further for what need had the cruel spoiler to have recourse to unprecedented arts i will speak out plainer still but you must not at present report it to stupifying potions and to the most brutal and outrageous force had i been wanting in my duty a few words more upon this grievous subject when i reflect upon all that has happened to me it is apparent that this generallysupposed thoughtless seducer has acted by me upon a regular and preconcerted plan of villany in order to set all his vile plots in motion nothing was wanting from the first but to prevail upon me either by force or fraud to throw myself into his power and when this was effected nothing less than the intervention of the paternal authority which i had not deserved to be exerted in my behalf could have saved me from the effect of his deep machinations opposition from any other quarter would but too probably have precipitated his barbarous and ungrateful violence and had you yourself been with me i have reason now to think that somehow or other you would have suffered in endeavouring to save me for never was there as now i see a plan of wickedness more steadily and uniformly pursued than his has been against an unhappy creature who merited better of him but the almighty has thought fit according to the general course of his providence to make the fault bring on its own punishment but surely not in consequence of my fathers dreadful imprecation that i might be punished here o my mamma norton pray with me if so that here it stop by the very wretch in whom i had placed my wicked confidence i am sorry for your sake to leave off so heavily yet the rest must be brief let me desire you to be secret in what i have communicated to you at least till you have my consent to divulge it god preserve to you your more faultless child i will hope for his mercy although i should not obtain that of any earthly person and i repeat my prohibition you must not think of coming up to your ever dutiful cl harlowe the obliging person who left yours for me this day promised to call tomorrow to see if i should have any thing to return i would not lose so good an opportunity letter lxiii mrs norton to miss clarissa harlowe monday night july o the barbarous villany of this detestable man and is there a man in the world who could offer violence to so sweet a creature and are you sure you are now out of his reach you command me to keep secret the particulars of the vile treatment you have met with or else upon an unexpected visit which miss harlowe favoured me with soon after i had received your melancholy letter i should have been tempted to own i had heard from you and to have communicated to her such parts of your two letters as would have demonstrated your penitence and your earnestness to obtain the revocation of your fathers malediction as well as his protection from outrages that may still be offered to you but then your sister would probably have expected a sight of the letters and even to have been permitted to take them with her to the family yet they must one day be acquainted with the sad story and it is impossible but they must pity you and forgive you when they know your early penitence and your unprecedented sufferings and that you have fallen by the brutal force of a barbarous ravisher and not by the vile arts of a seducing lover the wicked man gives it out at lord ms as miss harlowe tells me that he is actually married to you yet she believes it not nor had i the heart to let her know the truth she put it close to me whether i had not corresponded with you from the time of your going away i could safely tell her as i did that i had not but i said that i was well informed that you took extremely to heart your fathers imprecation and that if she would excuse me i would say it would be a kind and sisterly part if she would use her interest to get you discharged from it among other severe things she told me that my partial fondness for you made me very little consider the honour of the rest of the family but if i had not heard this from you she supposed i was set on by miss howe she expressed herself with a good deal of bitterness against that young lady who it seems every where and to every body for you must think that your story is the subject of all conversations rails against your family treating them as your sister says with contempt and even with ridicule i am sorry such angry freedoms are taken for two reasons first because such liberties never do any good i have heard you own that miss howe has a satirical vein but i should hope that a young lady of her sense and right cast of mind must know that the end of satire is not to exasperate but amend and should never be personal if it be as my good father used to say it may make an impartial person suspect that the satirist has a natural spleen to gratify which may be as great a fault in him as any of those which he pretends to censure and expose in others perhaps a hint of this from you will not be thrown away my second reason is that these freedoms from so warm a friend to you as miss howe is known to be are most likely to be charged to your account my resentments are so strong against this vilest of men that i dare not touch upon the shocking particulars which you mention of his baseness what defence indeed could there be against so determined a wretch after you was in his power i will only repeat my earnest supplication to you that black as appearances are you will not despair your calamities are exceeding great but then you have talents proportioned to your trials this every body allows suppose the worst and that your family will not be moved in your favour your cousin morden will soon arrive as miss harlowe told me if he should even be got over to their side he will however see justice done you and then may you live an exemplary life making hundreds happy and teaching young ladies to shun the snares in which you have been so dreadfully entangled as to the man you have lost is an union with such a perjured heart as his with such an admirable one as yours to be wished for a base lowhearted wretch as you justly call him with all his pride of ancestry and more an enemy to himself with regard to his present and future happiness than to you in the barbarous and ungrateful wrongs he has done you i need not i am sure exhort you to despise such a man as this since not to be able to do so would be a reflection upon a sex to which you have always been an honour your moral character is untainted the very nature of your sufferings as you will observe demonstrates that cheer up therefore your dear heart and do not despair for is it not god who governs the world and permits some things and directs others as he pleases and will he not reward temporary sufferings innocently incurred and piously supported with eternal felicity and what my dear is this poor needles point of now to a boundless eternity my heart however labours under a double affliction for my poor boy is very very bad a violent fever nor can it be brought to intermit pray for him my dearest miss for his recovery if god see fit i hope god will see fit if not how can i bear to suppose that pray for me that he will give me that patience and resignation which i have been wishing to you i am my dearest young lady your ever affectionate judith norton letter lxiv miss clarissa harlowe to mrs judith norton thursday july i ought not especially at this time to add to your afflictions but yet i cannot help communicating to you who now are my only soothing friend a new trouble that has befallen me i had but one friend in the world beside you and she is utterly displeased with me it is grievous but for one moment to lie under a beloved persons censure and this through imputations that affect ones honour and prudence there are points so delicate you know my dear mrs norton that it is a degree of dishonour to have a vindication of ones self from them appear to be necessary in the present case my misfortune is that i know not how to account but by guess so subtle have been the workings of the dark spirit i have been unhappily entangled by for some of the facts that i am called upon to explain miss howe in short supposes she has found a flaw in my character i have just now received her severe letter but i shall answer it perhaps in better temper if i first consider yours for indeed my patience is almost at an end and yet i ought to consider that faithful are the wounds of a friend but so many things at once o my dear mrs norton how shall so young a scholar in the school of affliction be able to bear such heavy and such various evils but to leave this subject for a while and turn to your letter i am very sorry miss howe is so lively in her resentments on my account i have always blamed her very freely for her liberties of this sort with my friends i once had a good deal of influence over her kind heart and she made all i said a law to her but people in calamity have little weight in any thing or with any body prosperity and independence are charming things on this account that they give force to the counsels of a friendly heart while it is thought insolence in the miserable to advise or so much as to remonstrate yet is miss howe an invaluable person and is it to be expected that she should preserve the same regard for my judgment that she had before i forfeited all title to discretion with what face can i take upon me to reproach a want of prudence in her but if i can be so happy as to reestablish myself in her evervalued opinion i shall endeavour to enforce upon her your just observation on this head you need not you say exhort me to despise such a man as him by whom i have suffered indeed you need not for i would choose the cruellest death rather than to be his and yet my dear mrs norton i will own to you that once i could have loved him ungrateful man had he permitted me to love him i once could have loved him yet he never deserved love and was not this a fault but now if i can but keep out of his hands and obtain a last forgiveness and that as well for the sake of my dear friends future reflections as for my own present comfort it is all i wish for reconciliation with my friends i do not expect nor pardon from them at least till in extremity and as a viaticum o my beloved mrs norton you cannot imagine what i have suffered but indeed my heart is broken i am sure i shall not live to take possession of that independence which you think would enable me to atone in some measure for my past conduct while this is my opinion you may believe i shall not be easy till i can obtain a last forgiveness i wish to be left to take my own course in endeavouring to procure this grace yet know i not at present what that course shall be i will write but to whom is my doubt calamity has not yet given me the assurance to address myself to my father my uncles well as they once loved me are hard hearted they never had their masculine passions humanized by the tender name of father of my brother i have no hope i have then but my mother and my sister to whom i can apply and may i not my dearest mamma be permitted to lift up my trembling eye to your allcheering and your once more than indulgent your fond eye in hopes of seasonable mercy to the poor sick heart that yet beats with life drawn from your own dearer heart especially when pardon only and not restoration is implored yet were i able to engage my mothers pity would it not be a mean to make her still more unhappy than i have already made her by the opposition she would meet with were she to try to give force to that pity to my sister then i think i will apply yet how hardhearted has my sister been but i will not ask for protection and yet i am in hourly dread that i shall want protection all i will ask for at present preparative to the last forgiveness i will implore shall be only to be freed from the heavy curse that seems to have operated as far is it can operate as to this life and surely it was passion and not intention that carried it so far as to the other but why do i thus add to your distresses it is not my dear mrs norton that i have so much feeling for my own calamity that i have none for yours since yours is indeed an addition to my own but you have one consolation a very great one which i have not that your afflictions whether respecting your more or your less deserving child rise not from any fault of your own but what can i do for you more than pray assure yourself that in every supplication i put up for myself i will with equal fervour remember both you and your son for i am and ever will be your truly sympathising and dutiful clarissa harlowe letter lxv miss howe to miss clarissa harlowe superscribed for mrs rachel clark c wednesday july my dear clarissa i have at last heard from you from a quarter i little expected from my mother she had for some time seen me uneasy and grieving and justly supposed it was about you and this morning dropt a hint which made me conjecture that she must have heard something of you more than i knew and when she found that this added to my uneasiness she owned she had a letter in her hands of yours dated the th of june directed for me you may guess that this occasioned a little warmth that could not be wished for by either it is surprising my dear mighty surprising that knowing the prohibition i lay under of corresponding with you you could send a letter for me to our own house since it must be fifty to one that it would fall into my mothers hands as you find it did in short she resented that i should disobey her i was as much concerned that she should open and withhold from me my letters and at last she was pleased to compromise the matter with me by giving up the letter and permitting me to write to you once or twice she to see the contents of what i wrote for besides the value she has for you she could not but have greater curiosity to know the occasion of so sad a situation as your melancholy letter shows you to be in but i shall get her to be satisfied with hearing me read what i write putting in between hooks thus what i intend not to read to her need i to remind you miss clarissa harlowe of three letters i wrote to you to none of which i had any answer except to the first and that of a few lines only promising a letter at large though you were well enough the day after you received my second to go joyfully back again with him to the vile house but more of these byandby i must hasten to take notice of your letter of wednesday last week which you could contrive should fall into my mothers hands let me tell you that that letter has almost broken my heart good god what have you brought yourself to miss clarissa harlowe could i have believed that after you had escaped from the miscreant with such mighty pains and earnestness escaped and after such an attempt as he had made you would have been prevailed upon not only to forgive him but without being married too to return with him to that horrid house a house i had given you such an account of surprisingwhat an intoxicating thing is this love i always feared that you even you were not proof against its inconsistent effects you your best self have not escaped indeed i see not how you could expect to escape what a tale have you to unfold you need not unfold it my dear i would have engaged to prognosticate all that has happened had you but told me that you would once more have put yourself in his power after you had taken such pains to get out of it your peace is destroyed i wonder not at it since now you must reproach yourself for a credulity so illplaced your intellect is touched i am sure my heart bleeds for you but excuse me my dear i doubt your intellect was touched before you left hampstead or you would never have let him find you out there or when he did suffer him to prevail upon you to return to the horrid brothel i tell you i sent you three letters the first of which dated the th and th of june for it was written at twice came safely to your hands as you sent me word by a few lines dated the th had it not i should have doubted my own safety since in it i give you such an account of the abominable house and threw such cautions in your way in relation to that tomlinson as the more surprised me that you could think of going back to it again after you had escaped from it and from lovelace o my dear but nothing now will i ever wonder at see vol v letter xx the second dated june was given into your own hand at hampstead on sunday the th as you was lying upon a couch in a strange way according to my messengers account of you bloated and flushcoloured i dont know how see letter vii of this volume the third was dated the th of june having not heard one word from you since the promising billet of the th i own i did not spare you in it i ventured it by the usual conveyance by that wilsons having no other so cannot be sure you received it indeed i rather think you might not because in yours which fell into my mothers hands you make no mention of it and if you had had it i believe it would have touched you too much to have been passed by unnoticed see letter xxx of this volume you have heard that i have been ill you say i had a cold indeed but it was so slight a one that it confined me not an hour but i doubt not that strange things you have heard and been told to induce you to take the step you took and till you did take that step the going back with this villain i mean i knew not a more pitiable case than yours since every body must have excused you before who knew how you were used at home and was acquainted with your prudence and vigilance but alas my dear we see that the wisest people are not to be depended upon when love like an ignis fatuus holds up its misleading lights before their eyes my mother tells me she sent you an answer desiring you not to write to me because it would grieve me to be sure i am grieved exceedingly grieved and disappointed too you must permit me to say for i had always thought that there never was such a woman at your years in the world but i remember once an argument you held on occasion of a censure passed in company upon an excellent preacher who was not a very excellent liver preaching and practising you said required very different talents which when united in the same person made the man a saint as wit and judgment going together constituted a genius see vol ii letter iv you made it out i remember very prettily but you never made it out excuse me my dear more convincingly than by that part of your late conduct which i complain of my love for you and my concern for your honour may possibly have made me a little of the severest if you think so place it to its proper account to that love and to that concern which will but do justice to your afflicted and faithful ah ps my mother would not be satisfied without reading my letter herself and that before i had fixed all the proposed hooks she knows by this means and has excused our former correspondence she indeed suspected it before and so she very well might knowing my love of you she has so much real concern for your misfortunes that thinking it will be a consolation to you and that it will oblige me she consents that you shall write to me the particulars at large of your say story but it is on condition that i show her all that has passed between us relating to yourself and the vilest of men i have the more cheerfully complied as the communication cannot be to your disadvantage you may therefore write freely and direct to our own house my mother promises to show me the copy of her letter to you and your reply to it which latter she has but just told me of she already apologizes for the severity of hers and thinks the sight of your reply will affect me too much but having her promise i will not dispense with it i doubt hers is severe enough so i fear you will think mine but you have taught me never to spare the fault for the friends sake and that a great error ought rather to be the more inexcusable in the person we value than in one we are indifferent to because it is a reflection upon our choice of that person and tends to a breach of the love of mind and to expose us to the world for our partiality to the love of mind i repeat since it is impossible but the errors of the dearest friend must weaken our inward opinion of that friend and thereby lay a foundation for future distance and perhaps disgust god grant that you may be able to clear your conduct after you had escaped from hampstead as all before that time was noble generous and prudent the man a devil and you a saintyet i hope you can and therefore expect it from you i send by a particular hand he will call for your answer at your own appointment i am afraid this horrid wretch will trace out by the postoffices where you are if not careful to have money and will and head to be a villain is too much for the rest of the world when they meet in one man letter lxvi miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe thursday july few young persons have been able to give more convincing proofs than myself how little true happiness lies in the enjoyment of our own wishes to produce one instance only of the truth of this observation what would i have given for weeks past for the favour of a letter from my dear miss howe in whose friendship i placed all my remaining comfort little did i think that the next letter she would honour me with should be in such a style as should make me look more than once at the subscription that i might be sure the name not being written at length that it was not signed by another ah for surely thought i this is my sister arabellas style surely miss howe blame me as she pleases in other points could never repeat so sharply upon her friend words written in the bitterness of spirit and in the disorder of head nor remind her with asperity and with mingled strokes of wit of an argument held in the gaiety of a heart elated with prosperous fortunes as mine then was and very little apprehensive of the severe turn that argument would one day take against herself but what have i sink in my fortunes my character forfeited my honour lost while i know it i care not who knows it destitute of friends and even of hope what have i to do to show a spirit of repining and expostulation to a dear friend because she is not more kind than a sister you have till now my dear treated me with great indulgence if it was with greater than i had deserved i may be to blame to have built upon it on the consciousness that i deserve it now as much as ever but i find by the rising bitterness which will mingle with the gall in my ink that i am not yet subdued enough to my condition i lay down my pen for one moment pardon me my miss howe i have recollected myself and will endeavour to give a particular answer to your letter although it will take me up too much time to think of sending it by your messenger tomorrow he can put off his journey he says till saturday i will endeavour to have the whole narrative ready for you by saturday but how to defend myself in every thing that has happened i cannot tell since in some part of the time in which my conduct appears to have been censurable i was not myself and to this hour know not all the methods taken to deceive and ruin me you tell me that in your first letter you gave me such an account of the vile house i was in and such cautions about that tomlinson as made you wonder how i could think of going back alas my dear i was tricked most vilely tricked back as you shall hear in its place without knowing the house was so very vile a house from your intended information i disliked the people too much ever voluntarily to have returned to it but had you really written such cautions about tomlinson and the house as you seem to have purposed to do they must had they come in time have been of infinite service to me but not one word of either whatever was your intention did you mention to me in that first of the three letters you so warmly tell me you did send me i will enclose it to convince you the letter she encloses was mr lovelaces forged one see vol v letter xxx but your account of your messengers delivering to me your second letter and the description he gives of me as lying upon a couch in a strange way bloated and flushcoloured you dont know how absolutely puzzles and confounds me lord have mercy upon the poor clarissa harlowe what can this mean who was the messenger you sent was he one of lovelaces creatures too could nobody come near me but that mans confederates either setting out so or made so i know not what to make of any one syllable of this indeed i dont let me see you say this was before i went from hampstead my intellects had not then been touched nor had i ever been surprised by wine strange if i had how then could i be found in such a strange way bloated and flushcoloured you dont know how yet what a vile what a hateful figure has your messenger represented me to have made but indeed i know nothing of any messenger from you believing myself secure at hampstead i staid longer there than i would have done in hopes of the letter promised me in your short one of the th brought me by my own messenger in which you undertake to send for and engage mrs townsend in my favour see vol v letter xxix i wondered i had not heard from you and was told you were sick and at another time that your mother and you had had words on my account and that you had refused to admit mr hickmans visits upon it so that i supposed at one time that you were not able to write at another that your mothers prohibition had its due force with you but now i have no doubt that the wicked man must have intercepted your letter and i wish he found not means to corrupt your messenger to tell you so strange a story it was on sunday june you say that the man gave it me i was at church twice that day with mrs moore mr lovelace was at her house the while where he boarded and wanted to have lodged but i would not permit that though i could not help the other in one of these spaces it must be that he had time to work upon the man youll easily my dear find that out by inquiring the time of his arrival at mrs moores and other circumstances of the strange way he pretended to see me in on a couch and the rest had any body seen me afterwards when i was betrayed back to the vile house struggling under the operation of wicked potions and robbed indeed of my intellects for this as you shall hear was my dreadful case i might then perhaps have appeared bloated and flushcoloured and i know not how myself but were you to see your poor clarissa now or even to have seen her at hampstead before she suffered the vilest of all outrages you would not think her bloated or flushcoloured indeed you would not in a word it could not be me your messenger saw nor if any body who it was can i divine i will now as briefly as the subject will permit enter into the darker part of my sad story and yet i must be somewhat circumstantial that you may not think me capable of reserve or palliation the latter i am not conscious that i need i should be utterly inexcusable were i guilty of the former to you and yet if you know how my heart sinks under the thoughts of a recollection so painful you would pity me as i shall not be able perhaps to conclude what i have to write in even two or three letters i will begin a new one with my story and send the whole of it together although written at different periods as i am able allow me a little pause my dear at this place and to subscribe myself your ever affectionate and obliged clarissa harlowe letter lxvii miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe referred to in letter xii thursday night he had found me out at hampstead strangely found me out for i am still at a loss to know by what means i was loth in my billet of the th to tell you so for fear of giving you apprehensions for me and besides i hoped then to have a shorter and happier issue to account to you for through your assistance than i met with see vol v letter xxxi she then gives a narrative of all that passed at hampstead between herself mr lovelace capt tomlinson and the women there to the same effect with that so amply given by mr lovelace mr lovelace finding all he could say and all captain tomlinson could urge ineffectual to prevail upon me to forgive an outrage so flagrantly premeditated rested all his hopes on a visit which was to be paid me by lady betty lawrance and miss montague in my uncertain situation my prospects all so dark i knew not to whom i might be obliged to have recourse in the last resort and as those ladies had the best of characters insomuch that i had reason to regret that i had not from the first thrown myself upon their protection when i had forfeited that of my own friends i thought i would not shun an interview with them though i was too indifferent to their kinsman to seek it as i doubted not that one end of their visit would be to reconcile me to him on monday the th of june these pretended ladies came to hampstead and i was presented to them and they to me by their kinsman they were richly dressed and stuck out with jewels the pretended lady bettys were particularly very fine they came in a coachandfour hired as was confessed while their own was repairing in town a pretence made i now perceive that i should not guess at the imposture by the want of the real ladys arms upon it lady betty was attended by her woman who she called morrison a modest countrylooking person i had heard that lady betty was a fine woman and that miss montague was a beautiful young lady genteel and graceful and full of vivacity such were these impostors and having never seen either of them i had not the least suspicion that they were not the ladies they personated and being put a little out of countenance by the richness of their dresses i could not help fool that i was to apologize for my own the pretended lady betty then told me that her nephew had acquainted them with the situation of affairs between us and although she could not but say that she was very glad that she had not put such a slight upon his lordship and them as report had given them cause to apprehend the reasons for which report however she must have approved of yet it had been matter of great concern to her and to her niece montague and would to the whole family to find so great a misunderstanding subsisting between us as if not made up might distance all their hopes she could easily tell who was in fault she said and gave him a look both of anger and disdain asking him how it was possible for him to give an offence of such a nature to so charming a lady so she called me as should occasion a resentment so strong he pretended to be awed into shame and silence my dearest niece said she and took my hand i must call you niece as well from love as to humour your uncles laudable expedient permit me to be not an advocate but a mediatrix for him and not for his sake so much as for my own my charlottes and all our familys the indignity he has offered to you may be of too tender a nature to be inquired into but as he declares that it was not a premeditated offence whether my dear for i was going to rise upon it in my temper it were or not and as he declares his sorrows for it and never did creature express a deeper sorrow for any offence than he and as it is a repairable one let us for this one time forgive him and thereby lay an obligation upon this man of errors let us i say my dear for sir turning to him an offence against such a peerless lady as this must be an offence against me against your cousin here and against all the virtuous of our sex see my dear what a creature he had picked out could you have thought there was a woman in the world who could thus express herself and yet be vile but she had her principal instructions from him and those written down too as i have reason to think for i have recollected since that i once saw this lady betty who often rose from her seat and took a turn to the other end of the room with such an emotion as if the joy of her heart would not let her sit still take out a paper from her stays and look into it and put it there again she might oftener and i not observe it for i little thought that there could be such impostors in the world i could not forbear paying great attention to what she said i found my tears ready to start i drew out my handkerchief and was silent i had not been so indulgently treated a great while by a person of character and distinction such i thought her and durst not trust to the accent of my voice the pretended miss montague joined in on this occasion and drawing her chair close to me took my other hand and besought me to forgive her cousin and consent to rank myself as one of the principals of a family that had long very long coveted the honour of my alliance i am ashamed to repeat to you my dear now i know what wretches they are the tender the obliging and the respectful things i said to them the wretch himself then came forward he threw himself at my feet how was i beset the women grasping one my right hand the other my left the pretended miss montague pressing to her lips more than once the hand she held the wicked man on his knees imploring my forgiveness and setting before me my happy and my unhappy prospects as i should forgive and not forgive him all that he thought would affect me in former pleas and those of capt tomlinson he repeated he vowed he promised he bespoke the pretended ladies to answer for him and they engaged their honours in his behalf indeed my dear i was distressed perfectly distressed i was sorry that i had given way to this visit for i knew not how in tenderness to relations as i thought them so worthy to treat so freely as he deserved a man nearly allied to them so that my arguments and my resolutions were deprived of their greatest force i pleaded however my application to you i expected every hour i told them an answer from you to a letter i had written which would decide my future destiny they offered to apply to you themselves in person in their own behalf as they politely termed it they besought me to write to you to hasten your answer i said i was sure that you would write the moment that the event of an application to be made to a third person enabled you to write but as to the success of their request in behalf of their kinsman that depended not upon the expected answer for that i begged their pardon was out of the question i wished him well i wished him happy but i was convinced that i neither could make him so nor he me then how the wretch promised how he vowed how he entreated and how the women pleaded and they engaged themselves and the honour of their whole family for his just his kind his tender behaviour to me in short my dear i was so hard set that i was obliged to come to a more favourable compromise with them than i had intended i would wait for your answer to my letter i said and if that made doubtful or difficult the change of measures i had resolved upon and the scheme of life i had formed i would then consider of the matter and if they would permit me lay all before them and take their advice upon it in conjunction with yours as if the one were my own aunt and the other were my own cousin they shed tears upon this of joy they called them but since i believe to their credit bad as they are that they were tears of temporary remorse for the pretended miss montague turned about and as i remember said there was no standing it but mr lovelace was not so easily satisfied he was fixed upon his villanous measures perhaps and so might not be sorry to have a pretence against me he bit his lip he had been but too much used he said to such indifference such coldness in the very midst of his happiest prospects i had on twenty occasions shown him to his infinite regret that any favour i was to confer upon him was to be the result of there he stopt and not of my choice this had like to have set all back again i was exceedingly offended but the pretended ladies interposed the elder severely took him to task he ought she told him to be satisfied with what i had said she desired no other condition and what sir said she with an air of authority would you commit errors and expect to be rewarded for them they then engaged me in a more agreeable conversation the pretended lady declared that she lord m and lady sarah would directly and personally interest themselves to bring about a general reconciliation between the two families and this either in open or private concert with my uncle harlowe as should be thought fit animosities on one side had been carried a great way she said and too little care had been shown on the other to mollify or heal my father should see that they could treat him as a brother and a friend and my brother and sister should be convinced that there was no room either for the jealously sic or envy they had conceived from motives too unworthy to be avowed could i help my dear being pleased with them permit me here to break off the task grows too heavy at present for the heart of your clarissa harlowe letter lxviii miss clarissa harlowe in continuation i was very ill and obliged to lay down my pen i thought i should have fainted but am better now so will proceed the pretended ladies the more we talked the fonder they seemed to be of me and the lady betty had mrs moore called up and asked her if she had accommodations for her niece and self her woman and two men servants for three or four days mr lovelace answered for her that she had she would not ask her dear niece lovelace permit me my dear whispered she this charming style before strangers i will keep your uncles secret whether she should be welcome or not to be so near her but for the time she should stay in these parts she would come up every night what say you niece charlotte the pretended charlotte answered she should like to do so of all things the lady betty called her an obliging girl she liked the place she said her cousin leeson would excuse her the air and my company would do her good she never chose to lie in the smoky town if she could help it in short my dear said she to me i will stay with you till you hear from miss howe and till i have your consent to go with me to glenhamhall not one moment will i be out of your company when i can have it stedman my solicitor as the distance from town is so small may attend me here for instructions niece charlotte one word with you child they retired to the further end of the room and talked about their nightdresses the miss charlotte said morrison might be dispatched for them true said the other but i have some letters in my private box which i must have up and you know charlotte that i trust nobody with the keys of that could not morrison bring up the box no she thought it safest where it was she had heard of a robbery committed but two days ago at the food of hampsteadhill and she should be ruined in she lost her box well then it was but going to town to undress and she would leave her jewels behind her and return and should be easier a great deal on all accounts for my part i wondered they came up with them but that was to be taken as a respect paid to me and then they hinted at another visit of ceremony which they had thought to make had they not found me so inexpressibly engaging they talked loud enough for me to hear them on purpose no doubt though in affected whispers and concluded with high praises of me i was not fool enough to believe or to be puffed up with their encomiums yet not suspecting them i was not displeased at so favourable a beginning of acquaintance with ladies whether i were to be related to them or not of whom i had always heard honourable mention and yet at the time i thought highly as they exalted me that in some respects though i hardly know in what they fell short of what i expected them to be the grand deluder was at the farther end of the room another way probably to give me an opportunity to hear these preconcerted praises looking into a book which had there not been a preconcert would not have taken his attention for one moment it was taylors holy living and dying when the pretended ladies joined me he approached me with it in his hand a smart book this my dear this old divine affects i see a mighty flowery style of an ordinary country funeral where the young women in honour of a defunct companion especially if she were a virgin or passed for such make a flowerbed of her coffin and then laying down the book turning upon his heel with one of his usual airs of gaiety and are you determined ladies to take up your lodgings with my charming creature indeed they were never were there more cunning more artful impostors than these women practised creatures to be sure yet genteel and they must have been welleducated once perhaps as much the delight of their parents as i was of mine and who knows by what arts ruined body and mind o my dear how pregnant is this reflection but the man never was there a man so deep never so consummate a deceiver except that detested tomlinson whose years and seriousness joined with a solidity of sense and judgment that seemed uncommon gave him one would have thought advantages in villany the other had not time for hard very hard that i should fall into the knowledge of two such wretches when two more such i hope are not to be met with in the world both so determined to carry on the most barbarous and perfidious projects against a poor young creature who never did or wished harm to either take the following slight account of these womens and of this mans behaviour to each other before me mr lovelace carried himself to his pretended aunt with high respect and paid a great deference to all she said he permitted her to have all the advantage over him in the repartees and retorts that passed between them i could indeed easily see that it was permitted and that he forbore that vivacity that quickness which he never spared showing to his pretended miss montague and which a man of wit seldom knows how to spare showing when an opportunity offers to display his wit the pretended miss montague was still more respectful in her behaviour to her pretended aunt while the aunt kept up the dignity of the character she had assumed rallying both of them with the air of a person who depends upon the superiority which years and fortune give over younger persons who might have a view to be obliged to her either in her life or at her death the severity of her raillery however was turned upon mr lovelace on occasion of the character of the people who kept the lodgings which she said i had thought myself so well warranted to leave privately this startled me for having then no suspicion of the vile tomlinson i concluded and your letter of the th favoured my conclusion that if the house were notorious either he or mr mennell would have given me or him some hints of it nor although i liked not the people did i observe any thing in them very culpable till the wednesday night before that they offered not to come to my assistance although within hearing of my distress as i am sure they were and having as much reason as i to be frighted at the fire had it been real his forged letter see vol v letter xxx i looked with indignation upon mr lovelace at this hint he seemed abashed i have not patience but to recollect the specious looks of this vile deceiver but how was it possible that even that florid countenance of his should enable him to command a blush at his pleasure for blush he did more than once and the blush on this occasion was a deepdyed crimson unstrained for and natural as i thought but he is so much of the actor that he seems able to enter into any character and his muscles and features appear entirely under obedience to his wicked will it is proper to observe that there was a more natural reason than this that the lady gives for mr lovelaces blushing it was a blush of indignation as he owned afterwards to his friend belford in conversation for the pretended lady betty had mistaken her cue in condemning the house and he had much ado to recover the blunder being obliged to follow her lead and vary from his first design which was to have the people of the house spoken well of in order to induce her to return to it were it but on pretence to direct her clothes to be carried to hampstead the pretended lady went on saying she had taken upon herself to inquire after the people on hearing that i had left the house in disgust and though she heard not any thing much amiss yet she heard enough to make her wonder that he could carry his spouse a person of so much delicacy to a house that if it had not a bad fame had not a good one you must think my dear that i liked the pretended lady betty the better for this i suppose it was designed that i should he was surprised he said that her ladyship should hear a bad character of the people it was what he had never before heard that they deserved it was easy indeed to see that they had not very great delicacy though they were not indelicate the nature of their livelihood letting lodgings and taking people to board and yet he had understood that they were nice in these particulars led them to aim at being free and obliging and it was difficult he said for persons of cheerful dispositions so to behave as to avoid censure openness of heart and countenance in the sex more was the pity too often subjected good people whose fortunes did not set them above the world to uncharitable censure he wished however that her ladyship would tell what she had heard although now it signified but little because he would never ask me to set foot within their doors again and he begged she would not mince the matter nay no great matter she said but she had been informed that there were more womenlodgers in the house than men yet that their visiters were more men than women and this had been hinted to her perhaps by illwishers she could not answer for that in such a way as if somewhat further were meant by it than was spoken this he said was the true innuendoway of characterizing used by detractors every body and every thing had a black and a white side of which well wishers and ill wishers may make their advantage he had observed that the front house was well let and he believed more to the one sex than to the other for he had seen occasionally passing to or fro several genteel modest looking women and who it was very probable were not so illbeloved but they might have visiters and relations of both sexes but they were none of them any thing to us or we to them we were not once in any of their companies but in the genteelest and most retired house of the two which we had in a manner to ourselves with the use of a parlour to the street to serve us for a servants hall or to receive common visiters or our traders only whom we admitted not up stairs he always loved to speak as he found no man in the world had suffered more from calumny than he himself had done women he owned ought to be more scrupulous than men needed to be where they lodged nevertheless he wished that fact rather than surmise were to be the foundation of their judgments especially when they spoke of one another he meant no reflection upon her ladyships informants or rather surmisants as he might call them be they who they would nor did he think himself obliged to defend characters impeached or not thought well of by women of virtue and honour neither were these people of importance enough to have so much said about them the pretended lady betty said all who knew her would clear her of censoriousness that it gave her some opinion she must needs say of the people that he had continued there so long with me that i had rather negative than positive reasons of dislike to them and that so shrewd a man as she heard captain tomlinson was had not objected to them i think niece charlotte proceeded she as my nephew had not parted with these lodgings you and i for as my dear miss harlowe dislikes the people i would not ask her for her company will take a dish of tea with my nephew there before we go out of town and then we shall see what sort of people they are i have heard that mrs sinclair is a mighty forbidding creature with all my heart madam in your ladyships company i shall make no scruple of going any where it was ladyship at every word and as she seemed proud of her title and of her dress too i might have guessed that she was not used to either what say you cousin lovelace lady sarah though a melancholy woman is very inquisitive about all your affairs i must acquaint her with every particular circumstance when i go down with all his heart he would attend her whenever she pleased she would see very handsome apartments and very civil people the deuce is in them said the miss montague if they appear other to us she then fell into family talk family happiness on my hopedfor accession into it they mentioned lord ms and lady sarahs great desire to see me how many friends and admirers with uplift hands i should have oh my dear what a triumph must these creatures and he have over the poor devoted all the time what a happy man he would be they would not the lady betty said give themselves the mortification but to suppose that i should not be one of them presents were hinted at she resolved that i should go with her to glenhamhall she would not be refused although she were to stay a week beyond her time for me she longed for the expected letter from you i must write to hasten it and to let miss howe know how every thing stood since i wrote last that might dispose me absolutely in her favour and in her nephews and then she hoped there would be no occasion for me to think of entering upon any new measures indeed my dear i did at the time intend if i heard not from you by morning to dispatch a man and horse to you with the particulars of all that you might if you thought proper at least put off mrs townsends coming up to another day but i was miserably prevented she made me promise that i would write to you upon this subject whether i heard from you or not one of her servants should ride post with my letter and wait for miss howes answer she then launched out in deserved praises of you my dear how fond she should be of the honour of your acquaintance the pretended miss montague joined in with her as well for herself as for her sister abominably well instructed were they both o my dear what risks may poor giddy girls run when they throw themselves out of the protection of their natural friends and into the wide world the then talked again of reconciliation and intimacy with every one of my friends with my mother particularly and gave the dear good lady the praises that every one gives her who has the happiness to know her ah my dear miss howe i had almost forgot my resentments against the pretended nephew so many agreeable things said made me think that if you should advise it and if i could bring my mind to forgive the wretch for an outrage so premeditatedly vile and could forbear despising him for that and his other ungrateful and wicked ways i might not be unhappy in an alliance with such a family yet thought i at the time with what intermixture does every thing come to me that had the appearance of good however as my lucid hopes made me see fewer faults in the behaviour of these pretended ladies than recollection and abhorrence have helped me since to see i began to reproach myself that i had not at first thrown myself into their protection but amidst all these delightful prospects i must not said the lady betty forget that i am to go to town she then ordered her coach to be got to the door we will all go to town together said she and return together morrison shall stay here and see every thing as i am used to have it in relation to my apartment and my bed for i am very particular in some respects my cousin leesons servants can do all i want to be done with regard to my nightdresses and the like and it will be a little airing for you my dear and a want of your apparel to be sent from your former lodgings to mrs leesons and we can bring it up with us from thence i had no intention to comply but as i did not imagine that she would insist upon my going to town with them i made no answer to that part of her speech i must here lay down my tired pen recollection heartaffecting recollection how it pains me letter lxix miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe in the midst of this agreeableness the coach came to the door the pretended lady betty besought me to give them my company to their cousin leesons i desired to be excused yet suspected nothing she would not be denied how happy would a visit so condescending make her cousin leesonher cousin leeson was not unworthy of my acquaintance and would take it for the greatest favour in the world i objected my dress but the objection was not admitted she bespoke a supper of mrs moore to be ready at nine mr lovelace vile hypocrite and wicked deceiver seeing as he said my dislike to go desired his ladyship not to insist upon it fondness for my company was pleaded she begged me to oblige her made a motion to help me to my fan herself and in short was so very urgent that my feet complied against my speech and my mind and being in a manner led to the coach by her and made to step in first she followed me and her pretended niece and the wretch followed her and away it drove nothing but the height of affectionate complaisance passed all the way over and over what a joy would this unexpected visit give her cousin leeson what a pleasure must it be to such a mind as mine to be able to give so much joy to every body i came near the cruel the savage seducer as i have since recollected was in a rapture all the way but yet such a sort of rapture as he took visible pains to check hateful villain how i abhor him what mischief must be then in his plotting heart what a devoted victim must i be in all their eyes though not pleased i was nevertheless just then thoughtless of danger they endeavouring thus to lift me up above all apprehensions of that and above myself too but think my dear what a dreadful turn all had upon me when through several streets and ways i knew nothing of the coach slackening its pace came within sight of the dreadful house of the dreadfullest woman in the world as she proved to me lord be good unto me cried the poor fool looking out of the coach mr lovelace madam turning to the pretended lady betty madam turning to the niece my hands and eyes lifted up lord be good unto me what what what my dear he pulled the string what need to have come this way said he but since we are i will but ask a question my dearest life why this apprehension the coachman stopped his servant who with one of hers was behind alighted ask said he if i have any letters who knows my dearest creature turning to me but we may already have one from the captain we will not go out of the coach fear nothing why so apprehensive oh these fine spirits cried the execrable insulter dreadfully did my heart then misgive me i was ready to faint why this terror my life you shall not stir out of the coach but one question now the fellow has drove us this way your lady will faint cried the execrable lady betty turning to him my dearest niece niece i will call you taking my hand we must alight if you are so ill let us alight only for a glass of water and hartshorn indeed we must alight no no no i am well quite well wont the man drive on i am well quite well indeed i am man drive on putting my head out of the coach man drive on though my voice was too low to be heard the coach stopt at the door how i trembled dorcas came to the door on its stopping my dearest creature said the vile man gasping as it were for breath you shall not alight any letters for me dorcas there are two sir and here is a gentleman mr belton sir waits for your honour and has done so above an hour ill just speak to him open the door you shant step out my dear a letter perhaps from captain already you shant step out my dear i sighed as if my heart would burst but we must step out nephew your lady will faint maid a glass of hartshorn and water my dear you must step out you will faint child we must cut your laces i believe my complexion was all manner of colours by turns indeed you must step out my dear he knew said i i should be well the moment the coach drove from the door i should not alight by his soul i should not lord lord nephew lord lord cousin both women in a breath what ado you make about nothing you persuade your lady to be afraid of alighting see you not that she is just fainting indeed madam said the vile seducer my dearest love must not be moved in this point against her will i beg it may not be insisted upon fiddlefaddle foolish man what a pother is here i guess how it is you are ashamed to let us see what sort of people you carried your lady among but do you go out and speak to your friend and take your letters he stept out but shut the coachdoor after him to oblige me the coach may go on madam said i the coach shall go on my dear life said he but he gave not nor intended to give orders that it should let the coach go on said i mr lovelace may come after us indeed my dear you are ill indeed you must alight alight but for one quarter of an hour alight but to give orders yourself about your things whom can you be afraid of in my company and my nieces these people must have behaved shockingly to you please the lord ill inquire into it ill see what sort of people they are immediately came the old creature to the door a thousand pardons dear madam stepping to the coachside if we have any way offended you be pleased ladies to the other two to alight well my dear whispered the lady betty i now find that an hideous description of a person we never saw is an advantage to them i thought the woman was a monster but really she seems tolerable i was afraid i should have fallen into fits but still refused to go out man man man cried i gaspingly my head out of the coach and in by turns half a dozen times running drive on let us go my heart misgave me beyond the power of my own accounting for it for still i did not suspect these women but the antipathy i had taken to the vile house and to find myself so near it when i expected no such matter with the sight of the old creature all together made me behave like a distracted person the hartshorn and water was brought the pretended lady betty made me drink it heaven knows if there was any thing else in it besides said she whisperingly i must see what sort of creatures the nieces are want of delicacy cannot be hid from me you could not surely my dear have this aversion to reenter a house for a few minutes in our company in which you lodged and boarded several weeks unless these women could be so presumptuously vile as my nephew ought not to know out stept the pretended lady the servant at her command having opened the door dearest madam said the other to me let me follow you for i was next the door fear nothing i will not stir from your presence come my dear said the pretended lady give me your hand holding out hers oblige me this once i will bless your footsteps said the old creature if once more you honour my house with your presence a crowd by this time was gathered about us but i was too much affected to mind that again the pretended miss montague urged me standing up as ready to go out if i would give her room lord my dear said she who can bear this crowd what will people think the pretended lady again pressed me with both her hands held out only my dear to give orders about your things and thus pressed and gazed at for then i looked about me the women so richly dressed people whispering in an evil moment out stepped i trembling forced to lean with both my hands frighted too much for ceremony on the pretended lady bettys arm oh that i had dropped down dead upon the guilty threshold we shall stay but a few minutes my dear but a few minutes said the same specious jilt out of breath with her joy as i have since thought that they had thus triumphed over the unhappy victim come mrs sinclair i think your name is show us the wayfollowing her and leading me i am very thirsty you have frighted me my dear with your strange fears i must have tea made if it can be done in a moment we have farther to go mrs sinclair and must return to hampstead this night it shall be ready in a moment cried the wretch we have water boiling hasten then come my dear to me as she led me through the passage to the fatal inner house lean upon me how you tremble how you falter in your steps dearest niece lovelace the old wretch being in hearing why these hurries upon your spirits well be gone in a minute and thus she led the poor sacrifice into the old wretchs toowellknown parlour never was any body so gentle so meek so low voiced as the odious woman drawling out in a puling accent all the obliging things she could say awed i then thought by the conscious dignity of a woman of quality glittering with jewels the calledfor tea was ready presently there was no mr belton i believe for the wretch went not to any body unless it were while we were parlying in the coach no such person however appeared at the teatable i was made to drink two dishes with milk complaisantly urged by the pretended ladies helping me each to one i was stupid to their hands and when i took the tea almost choked with vapours and could hardly swallow i thought transiently thought that the tea the last dish particularly had an odd taste they on my palating it observed that the milk was londonmilk far short in goodness of what they were accustomed to from their own dairies i have no doubt that my two dishes and perhaps my hartshorn were prepared for me in which case it was more proper for their purpose that they should help me than that i should help myself ill before i found myself still more and more disordered in my head a heavy torpid pain increasing fast upon me but i imputed it to my terror nevertheless at the pretended ladys motion i went up stairs attended by dorcas who affected to weep for joy that she once more saw my blessed face that was the vile creatures word and immediately i set about taking out some of my clothes ordering what should be put up and what sent after me while i was thus employed up came the pretended lady betty in a hurrying waymy dear you wont be long before you are ready my nephew is very busy in writing answers to his letters so ill just whip away and change my dress and call upon you in an instant o madam i am ready i am now ready you must not leave me here and down i sunk affrighted into a chair this instant this instant i will return before you can be ready before you can have packed up your things we would not be late the robbers we have heard of may be out dont let us be late and away she hurried before i could say another word her pretended niece went with her without taking notice to me of her going i had no suspicion yet that these women were not indeed the ladies they personated and i blamed myself for my weak fears it cannot be thought i that such ladies will abet treachery against a poor creature they are so fond of they must undoubtedly be the persons they appear to be what folly to doubt it the air the dress the dignity of women of quality how unworthy of them and of my charity concluded i is this ungenerous shadow of suspicion so recovering my stupefied spirits as well as they could be recovered for i was heavier and heavier and wondered to dorcas what ailed me rubbing my eyes and taking some of her snuff pinch after pinch to very little purpose i pursued my employment but when that was over all packed up that i designed to be packed up and i had nothing to do but to think and found them tarry so long i thought i should have gone distracted i shut myself into the chamber that had been mine i kneeled i prayed yet knew not what i prayed for then ran out again it was almost dark night i said where where where was mr lovelace he came to me taking no notice at first of my consternation and wildness what they had given me made me incoherent and wild all goes well said he my dear a line from capt tomlinson all indeed did go well for the villanous project of the most cruel and most villanous of men i demanded his aunt i demanded his cousin the evening i said was closing my head was very very bad i remember i said and it grew worse and worse terror however as yet kept up my spirits and i insisted upon his going himself to hasten them he called his servant he raved at the sex for their delay twas well that business of consequence seldom depended upon such parading unpunctual triflers his servant came he ordered him to fly to his cousin leesons and to let lady betty and his cousin know how uneasy we both were at their delay adding of his own accord desire them if they dont come instantly to send their coach and we will go without them tell them i wonder theyll serve me so i thought this was considerately and fairly put but now indifferent as my head was i had a little time to consider the man and his behaviour he terrified me with his looks and with his violent emotions as he gazed upon me evident joysuppressed emotions as i have since recollected his sentences short and pronounced as if his breath were touched never saw i his abominable eyes look as then they looked triumph in them fierce and wild and more disagreeable than the womens at the vile house appeared to me when i first saw them and at times such a leering mischiefboding cast i would have given the world to have been an hundred miles from him yet his behaviour was decent a decency however that i might have seen to be struggled for for he snatched my hand two or three times with a vehemence in his grasp that hurt me speaking words of tenderness through his shut teeth as it seemed and let it go with a beggarvoiced humbled accent like the vile womans just before halfinward yet his words and manner carrying the appearance of strong and almost convulsed passion o my dear what mischief was he not then meditating i complained once or twice of thirst my mouth seemed parched at the time i supposed that it was my terror gasping often as i did for breath that parched up the roof of my mouth i called for water some tablebeer was brought me beer i suppose was a better vehicle for their potions i told the maid that she knew i seldom tasted malt liquor yet suspecting nothing of this nature being extremely thirsty i drank it as what came next and instantly as it were found myself much worse than before as if inebriated i should fancy i know not how his servant was gone twice as long as he needed and just before his return came one of the pretended lady bettys with a letter for mr lovelace he sent it up to me i read it and then it was that i thought myself a lost creature it being to put off her going to hampstead that night on account of violent fits which miss montague was pretended to be seized with for then immediately came into my head his vile attempt upon me in this house the revenge that my flight might too probably inspire him with on that occasion and because of the difficulty i made to forgive him and to be reconciled to him his very looks wild and dreadful to me and the women of the house such as i had more reason than ever even from the pretended lady bettys hint to be afraid of all these crowding together in my apprehensive mind i fell into a kind of phrensy i have no remembrance how i was for this time it lasted but i know that in my first agitations i pulled off my headdress and tore my ruffles in twenty tatters and ran to find him out when a little recovered i insisted upon the hint he had given me of their coach but the messenger he said had told him that it was sent to fetch a physician lest his chariot should be put up or not ready i then insisted upon going directly to lady bettys lodgings mrs leesons was now a crowded house he said and as my earnestness could be owing to nothing but groundless apprehensions and oh what vows what protestations of his honour did he then make he hoped i would not add to their present concern charlotte indeed was used to fits he said upon any great surprises whether of joy or grief and they would hold her for one week together if not got off in a few hours you are an observer of eyes my dear said the villain perhaps in secret insult saw you not in miss montagues nowandthen at hampstead something wildish i was afraid for her then silence and quiet only do her good your concern for her and her love for you will but augment the poor girls disorder if you should go all impatient with grief and apprehension i still declared myself resolved not to stay in that house till morning all i had in the world my rings my watch my little money for a coach or if one were not to be got i would go on foot to hampstead that night though i walked it by myself a coach was hereupon sent for or pretended to be sent for any price he said he would give to oblige me late as it was and he would attend me with all his soul but no coach was to be got let me cut short the rest i grew worse and worse in my head now stupid now raving now senseless the vilest of vile women was brought to frighten me never was there so horrible a creature as she appreared to me at this time i remember i pleaded for mercy i remember that i said i would be his indeed i would be his to obtain his mercy but no mercy found i my strength my intellects failed me and then such scenes followed o my dear such dreadful scenes fits upon fits faintly indeed and imperfectly remembered procuring me no compassion but death was withheld from me that would have been too great a mercy thus was i tricked and deluded back by blacker hearts of my own sex than i thought there were in the world who appeared to me to be persons of honour and when in his power thus barbarously was i treated by this villanous man i was so senseless that i dare not aver that the horrid creatures of the house were personally aiding and abetting but some visionary remembrances i have of female figures flitting as i may say before my sight the wretched womans particularly but as these confused ideas might be owing to the terror i had conceived of the worse than masculine violence she had been permitted to assume to me for expressing my abhorrence of her house and as what i suffered from his barbarity wants not that aggravation i will say no more on a subject so shocking as this must ever be to my remembrance i never saw the personating wretches afterwards he persisted to the last dreadfully invoking heaven as a witness to the truth of his assertion that they were really and truly the ladies they pretended to be declaring that they could not take leave of me when they left town because of the state of senselessness and phrensy i was in for their intoxicating or rather stupefying potions had almost deleterious effects upon my intellects as i have hinted insomuch that for several days together i was under a strange delirium now moping now dozing now weeping now raving now scribbling tearing what i scribbled as fast as i wrote it most miserable when nowandthen a ray of reason brought confusedly to my remembrance what i had suffered letter lxx miss clarissa harlowe in continuation the lady next gives an account of her recovery from her delirium and sleepy disorder of her attempt to get away in his absence of the conversations that followed at his return between them of the guilty figure he made of her resolution not to have him of her several efforts to escape of her treaty with dorcas to assist her in it of dorcass dropping the promissory note undoubtedly as she says on purpose to betray her of her triumph over all the creatures of the house assembled to terrify her and perhaps to commit fresh outrages upon her of his setting out for m hall of his repeated letters to induce her to meet him at the altar on her uncles anniversary of her determined silence to them all of her second escape effected as she says contrary to her own expectation the attempt being at first but the intended prelude to a more promising one which she had formed in her mind and of other particulars which being to be found in mr lovelaces letters preceding and the letter of his friend belford are omitted she then proceeds the very hour that i found myself in a place of safety i took pen to write to you when i began i designed only to write six or eight lines to inquire after your health for having heard nothing from you i feared indeed that you had been and still were too ill to write but no sooner did my pen begin to blot the paper but my sad heart hurried it into length the apprehensions i had lain under that i should not be able to get away the fatigue i had in effecting my escape the difficulty of procuring a lodging for myself having disliked the people of two houses and those of a third disliking me for you must think i made a frighted appearance these together with the recollection of what i had suffered from him and my farther apprehensions of my insecurity and my desolate circumstances had so disordered me that i remember i rambled strangely in that letter in short i thought it on reperusal a halfdistracted one but i then despaired were i to begin again of writing better so i let it go and can have no excuse for directing it as i did if the cause of the incoherence in it will not furnish me with a very pitiable one the letter i received from your mother was a dreadful blow to me but nevertheless it had the good effect upon me labouring as i did just then under a violent fit of vapourish despondency and almost yielding to it which profuse bleeding and blisterings have in paralytic or apoplectical strokes reviving my attention and restoring me to spirits to combat the evils i was surrounded by sluicing off and diverting into a new channel if i may be allowed another metaphor the overcharging woes which threatened once more to overwhelm my intellects but yet i most sincerely lamented and still lament in your mothers words that i cannot be unhappy by myself and was grieved not only for the trouble i had given you before but for the new one i had brought upon you by my inattention she then gives the substance of the letters she wrote to mrs norton to lady betty lawrance and to mrs hodges as also of their answers whereby she detected all mr lovelaces impostures she proceeds as follows i cannot however forbear to wonder how the vile tomlinson could come at the knowledge of several of the things he told me of and which contributed to give me confidence in him the attentive reader need not be referred back for what the lady nevertheless could not account for as she knew not that mr lovelace had come at miss howes letters particularly that in vol iv letter xxix which he comments upon in letter xliv of the same volume i doubt not that the stories of mrs fretchville and her house would be found as vile as any of the rest were i to inquire and had i not enough and too much already against the perjured man how have i been led on what will be the end of such a false and perjured creature heaven not less profaned and defied by him than myself deceived and abused this however against myself i must say that if what i have suffered be the natural consequence of my first error i never can forgive myself although you are so partial in my favour as to say that i was not censurable for what passed before my first escape and now honoured madam and my dearest miss howe who are to sit in judgment upon my case permit me to lay down my pen with one request which with the greatest earnestness i make to you both and that is that you will neither of you open your lips in relation to the potions and the violences i have hinted at not that i am solicitous that my disgrace should be hidden from the world or that it should not be generally known that the man has proved a villain to me for this it seems every body but myself expected from his character but suppose as his actions by me are really of a capital nature it were insisted upon that i should appear to prosecute him and his accomplices in a court of justice how do you think i could bear that but since my character before the capital enormity was lost in the eye of the world and that from the very hour i left my fathers house and since all my own hopes of worldly happiness are entirely over let me slide quietly into my grave and let it be not remembered except by one friendly tear and no more dropt from your gentle eye mine own dear anna howe on the happy day that shall shut up all my sorrows that there was such a creature as clarissa harlowe saturday july letter lxxi miss howe to miss clarissa harlowe sunday july may heaven signalize its vengeance in the face of all the world upon the most abandoned and profligate of men and in its own time i doubt not but it will and we must look to a world beyond this for the reward of your sufferings another shocking detection my dear how have you been deluded very watchful i have thought you very sagacious but alas not watchful not sagacious enough for the horrid villain you have had to deal with the letter you sent me enclosed as mine of the th of june is a villanous forgery see vol v letter xxx the hand indeed is astonishingly like mine and the cover i see is actually my cover but yet the letter is not so exactly imitated but that had you had any suspicions about his vileness at the time you who so well know my hand might have detected it in short this vile forged letter though a long one contains but a few extracts from mine mine was a very long one he has omitted every thing i see in it that could have shown you what a detestable house the house is and given you suspicions of the vile tomlinson you will see this and how he has turned miss lardners information and my advices to you execrable villain to his own horrid ends by the rough draught of the genuine letter which i shall enclose see vol v letter xx apprehensive for both our safeties from the villany of such a daring and profligate contriver i must call upon you my dear to resolve upon taking legal vengeance of the infernal wretch and this not only for our own sakes but for the sakes of innocents who otherwise may yet be deluded and outraged by him she then gives the particulars of the report made by the young fellow whom she sent to hampstead with her letter and who supposed he had delivered it into her own hand and then proceeds see vol vi letter vi i am astonished that the vile wretch who could know nothing of the time my messenger whose honesty i can vouch for would come could have a creature ready to personate you strange that the man should happen to arrive just as you were gone to church as i find was the fact on comparing what he says with your hint that you were at church twice that day when he might have got to mrs moores two hours before but had you told me my dear that the villain had found you out and was about you you should have done that yet i blame you upon a judgment founded on the event only i never had any faith in the stories that go current among country girls of specters familiars and demons yet i see not any other way to account for this wretchs successful villany and for his means of working up his specious delusions but by supposing if he be not the devil himself that he has a familiar constantly at his elbow sometimes it seems to me that this familiar assumes the shape of that solemn villain tomlinson sometimes that of the execrable sinclair as he calls her sometimes it is permitted to take that of lady betty lawrance but when it would assume the angelic shape and mien of my beloved friend see what a bloated figure it made tis my opinion my dear that you will be no longer safe where you are than while the v is in the country words are poor or how could i execrate him i have hardly any doubt that he has sold himself for a time oh may the time be short or may his infernal prompter no more keep covenant with him than he does with others i enclose not only the rough draught of my long letter mentioned above but the heads of that which the young fellow thought he delivered into your own hands at hampstead and when you have perused them i will leave to you to judge how much reason i had to be surprised that you wrote me not an answer to either of those letters one of which you owned you had received though it proved to be his forged one the other delivered into your own hands as i was assured and both of them of so much concern to your honour and still now much more surprised i must be when i received a letter from mrs townsend dated june from hampstead importing that mr lovelace who had been with you several days had on the monday before brought lady betty and his cousin richly dressed and in a coachandfour to visit you who with your own consent had carried you to town with them to your former lodgings where you still were that the hampstead women believed you to be married and reflected upon me as a fomenter of differences between man and wife that he himself was at hampstead the day before viz wednesday the th and boasted of his happiness with you inviting mrs moore mrs bevis and miss rawlins to go to town to visit his spouse which they promised to do that he declared that you were entirely reconciled to your former lodgings and that finally the women at hampstead told mrs townsend that he had very handsomely discharged theirs i own to you my dear that i was so much surprised and disgusted at these appearances against a conduct till then unexceptionable that i was resolved to make myself as easy as i could and wait till you should think fit to write to me but i could reinin my impatience but for a few days and on the th of june i wrote a sharp letter to you which i find you did not receive what a fatality my dear has appeared in your case from the very beginning till this hour had my mother permitted but can i blame her when you have a father and mother living who have so much to answer for so much as no father and mother considering the child they have driven persecuted exposed renounced ever had to answer for but again i must execrate the abandoned villain yet as i said before all words are poor and beneath the occasion but see we not in the horrid perjuries and treachery of this man what rakes and libertines will do when they get a young creature into their power it is probable that he might have the intolerable presumption to hope an easier conquest but when your unexampled vigilance and exalted virtue made potions and rapes and the utmost violences necessary to the attainment of his detestable end we see that he never boggled at them i have no doubt that the same or equal wickedness would be oftener committed by men of his villanous cast if the folly and credulity of the poor inconsiderates who throw themselves into their hands did not give them an easier triumph with what comfort must those parents reflect upon these things who have happily disposed of their daughters in marriage to a virtuous man and how happy the young women who find themselves safe in a worthy protection if such a person as miss clarissa harlowe could not escape who can be secure since though every rake is not a lovelace neither is every woman a clarissa and his attempts were but proportioned to your resistance and vigilance my mother has commanded me to let you know her thoughts upon the whole of your sad story i will do it in another letter and send it to you with this by a special messenger but for the future if you approve of it i will send my letters by the usual hand collinss to be left at the saracens head on snowhill whither you may send yours as we both used to do to wilsons except such as we shall think fit to transmit by the post which i am afraid after my next must be directed to mr hickman as before since my mother is fixing a condition to our correspondence which i doubt you will not comply with though i wish you would this condition i shall acquaint you with byandby mean time begging excuse for all the harsh things in my last of which your sweet meekness and superior greatness of soul have now made me most heartily ashamed i beseech you my dearest creature to believe me to be your truly sympathising and unalterable friend anna howe letter lxxii miss howe to miss clarissa harlowe monday july i now my dearest friend resume my pen to obey my mother in giving you her opinion upon your unhappy story she still harps upon the old string and will have it that all your calamities are owing to your first fatal step for she believes what i cannot that your relations had intended after one general trial more to comply with your aversion if they had found it to be as riveted a one as let me say it was a folly to suppose it would not be found to be after so many ridiculouslyrepeated experiments as to your latter sufferings from that vilest of miscreants she is unalterably of opinion that if all be as you have related which she doubts not with regard to the potions and to the violences you have sustained you ought by all means to set on foot a prosecution against him and against his devilish accomplices she asks what murderers what ravishers would be brought to justice if modesty were to be a general plea and allowable against appearing in a court to prosecute she says that the good of society requires that such a beast of prey should be hunted out of it and if you do not prosecute him she thinks you will be answerable for all the mischiefs he may do in the course of his future villanous life will it be thought nancy said she that miss clarissa harlowe can be in earnest when she says she is not solicitous to have her disgraces concealed from the world if she be afraid or ashamed to appear in court to do justice to herself and her sex against him will it not be rather surmised that she may be apprehensive that some weakness or lurking love will appear upon the trial of the strange cause if inferred she such complicated villany as this where perjury potions forgery subornation are all combined to effect the ruin of an innocent creature and to dishonour a family of eminence and where the very crimes as may be supposed are proofs of her innocence is to go off with impunity what case will deserve to be brought into judgment or what malefactor ought to be hanged then she thinks and so do i that the vile creatures his accomplices ought by all means to be brought to condign punishment as they must and will be upon bringing him to trial and this may be a mean to blow up and root out a whole nest of vipers and save many innocent creatures she added that if miss clarissa harlowe could be so indifferent about having this public justice done upon such a wretch for her own sake she ought to overcome her scruples out of regard to her family her acquaintance and her sex which are all highly injured and scandalized by his villany to her for her own part she declares that were she your mother she would forgive you upon no other terms and upon your compliance with these she herself will undertake to reconcile all your family to you these my dear are my mothers sentiments upon your sad story i cannot say but there are reason and justice in them and it is my opinion that it would be very right for the law to oblige an injured woman to prosecute and to make seduction on the mans part capital where his studied baseness and no fault in her will appeared to this purpose the custom in the isle of man is a very good one if a single woman there prosecutes a single man for a rape the ecclesiastical judges impannel a jury and if this jury find him guilty he is returned guilty to the temporal courts where if he be convicted the deemster or judge delivers to the woman a rope a sword and a ring and she has it in her choice to have him hanged beheaded or to marry him one of the two former i think should always be her option i long for the particulars of your story you must have too much time upon your hands for a mind so active as yours if tolerable health and spirits be afforded you the villany of the worst of men and the virtue of the most excellent of women i expect will be exemplified in it were it to be written in the same connected and particular manner in which you used to write to me try for it my dearest friend and since you cannot give the example without the warning give both for the sakes of all those who shall hear of your unhappy fate beginning from yours of june your prospects then not disagreeable i pity you for the task though i cannot willingly exempt you from it my mother will have me add that she must insist upon your prosecuting the villain she repeats that she makes that a condition on which she permits our future correspondence let me therefore know your thoughts upon it i asked her if she would be willing that i should appear to support you in court if you complied by all means she said if that would induce you to begin with him and with the horrid women i think i could probably attend you i am sure i could were there but a probability of bringing the monster to his deserved end once more your thoughts of it supposing it were to meet with the approbation of your relations but whatever be your determination on this head it shall be my constant prayer that god will give you patience to bear your heavy afflictions as a person ought to do who has not brought them upon herself by a faulty will that he will speak peace and comfort to your wounded mind and give you many happy years i am and ever will be your affectionate and faithful anna howe the two preceding letters were sent by a special messenger in the cover were written the following lines monday july i cannot my dearest friend suffer the enclosed to go unaccompanied by a few lines to signify to you that they are both less tender in some places than i would have written had they not been to pass my mothers inspection the principal reason however of my writing thus separately is to beg of you to permit me to send you money and necessaries which you must needs want and that you will let me know if either i or any body i can influence can be of service to you i am excessively apprehensive that you are not enough out of the villains reach where you are yet london i am persuaded is the place of all others to be private in i could tear my hair for vexation that i have it not in my power to afford you personal protection i am your ever devoted anna howe once more forgive me my dearest creature for my barbarous taunting in mine of the th yet i can hardly forgive myself i to be so cruel yet to know you so well whence whence had i this vile impatiency of spirit letter lxxiii miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe tuesday july forgive you my dear most cordially do i forgive you will you forgive me for some sharp things i wrote in return to yours of the th you could not have loved me as you do nor had the concern you have always shown for my honour if you had not been utterly displeased with me on the appearance which my conduct wore to you when you wrote that letter i most heartily thank you my best and only love for the opportunity you gave me of clearing it up and for being generously ready to acquit me of intentional blame the moment you had read my melancholy narrative as you are so earnest to have all the particulars of my sad story before you i will if life and spirits be lent me give you an ample account of all that has befallen me from the time you mention but this it is very probable you will not see till after the close of my last scene and as i shall write with a view to that i hope no other voucher will be wanted for the veracity of the writer be who will the reader i am far from thinking myself out of the reach of this mans further violence but what can i do whither can i fly perhaps my bad state of health which must grow worse as recollection of the past evils and reflections upon them grow heavier and heavier upon me may be my protection once indeed i thought of going abroad and had i the prospect of many years before me i would go but my dear the blow is given nor have you reason now circumstanced as i am to be concerned that it is what a heart must i have if it be not broken and indeed my dear friend i do so earnestly wish for the last closing scene and with so much comfort find myself in a declining way that i even sometimes ungratefully regret that naturallyhealthy constitution which used to double upon me all my enjoyments as to the earnestlyrecommended prosecution i may possibly touch upon it more largely hereafter if ever i shall have better spirits for they are at present extremely sunk and low but just now i will only say that i would sooner suffer every evil the repetition of the capital one excepted than appear publicly in a court to do myself justice and i am heartily grieved that your mother prescribes such a measure as the condition of our future correspondence for the continuance of your friendship my dear and the desire i had to correspond with you to my lifes end were all my remaining hopes and consolation nevertheless as that friendship is in the power of the heart not of the hand only i hope i shall not forfeit that dr lewen in letter xxiv of vol viii presses her to this public prosecution by arguments worthy of his character which she answers in a manner worthy of hers see letter xxv of that volume o my dear what would i give to obtain a revocation of my fathers malediction a reconciliation is not to be hoped for you who never loved my father may think my solicitude on this head a weakness but the motive for it sunk as my spirits at times are is not always weak i approve of the method you prescribe for the conveyance of our letters and have already caused the porter of the inn to be engaged to bring to me yours the moment that collins arrives with them and the servant of the house where i am will be permitted to carry mine to collins for you i have written a letter to miss rawlins of hampstead the answer to which just now received has helped me to the knowledge of the vile contrivance by which the wicked man got your letter of june the th i will give you the contents of both in mine to her i briefly acquainted her with what had befallen me through the vileness of the women who had passed upon me as the aunt and cousin of the wickedest of men and own that i never was married to him i desire her to make particular inquiry and to let me know who it was at mrs moores that on sunday afternoon june while i was at church received a letter from miss howe pretending to be me and lying on a couch which letter had it come to my hands would have saved me from ruin i excuse myself on the score of the delirium which the horrid usage i had received threw me into and from a confinement as barbarous as illegal that i had not before applied to mrs moore for an account of what i was indebted to her which account i now desired and for fear of being traced by mr lovelace i directed her to superscribe her answer to mrs mary atkins to be left till called for at the belle savage inn on ludgatehill in her answer she tells me that the vile wretch prevailed upon mrs bevis to personate me a sudden motion of his it seems on the appearance of your messenger and persuaded her to lie along a couch a handkerchief over her neck and face pretending to be ill the credulous woman drawn in by false notions of your ill offices to keep up a variance between a man and his wife and so taking the letter from your messenger as me miss rawlins takes pains to excuse mrs beviss intention she expresses their astonishment and concern at what i communicate but is glad however and so they are all that they know in time the vileness of the base man the two widows and herself having at his earnest invitation designed me a visit at mrs sinclairs supposing all to be happy between him and me as he assured them was the case mr lovelace she informs me had handsomely satisfied mrs moore and miss rawlins concludes with wishing to be favoured with the particulars of so extraordinary a story as these particulars may be of use to let her see what wicked creatures women as well as men there are in the world i thank you my dear for the draughts of your two letters which were intercepted by this horrid man i see the great advantage they were of to him in the prosecution of his villanous designs against the poor wretch whom he had so long made the sport of his abhorred inventions let me repeat that i am quite sick of life and of an earth in which innocent and benevolent spirits are sure to be considered as aliens and to be made sufferers by the genuine sons and daughters of that earth how unhappy that those letters only which could have acquainted me with his horrid views and armed me against them and against the vileness of the base women should fall into his hands unhappier still in that my very escape to hampstead gave him the opportunity of receiving them nevertheless i cannot but still wonder how it was possible for that tomlinson to know what passed between mr hickman and my uncle harlowe a circumstance which gave the vile impostor most of his credit with me see the note in letter lxx of this volume how the wicked wretch himself could find me out at hampstead must also remain wholly a mystery to me he may glory in his contrivances he who has more wickedness than wit may glory in his contrivances but after all i shall i humbly presume to hope be happy when he poor wretch will be alas who can say what adieu my dearest friend may you be happy and then your clarissa cannot be wholly miserable end of vol
