 chapter one ireland is a land of poets and legends of dreamers and rebels all of these have music woven through and around them tunes for dancing or for weeping for battle or for love in ancient times the harpists would travel from place to place playing their tunes for a meal and a bed and the loose coins that might come with them the harpists and the seanachaisthe storytellerswere welcome where they wandered be it cottage or inn or campfire their gift was carried inside them and was valued even in the faerie rafts beneath the green hills and so it is still once not so long ago a storyteller came to a quiet village by the sea and was made welcome there she found her heart and her home a harpist lived among them and had his home where he was content but he had yet to find his heart there was music playing in his head sometimes it came to him soft and dreamy like a lovers whisper other times it was with a shout and a laugh an old friend calling you into the pub to stand you for a pint it could be sweet or fierce or full of desperate tears but it was music that ran through his mind and it was his pleasure to hear it shawn gallagher was a man comfortable with his life now there were some who would say he was comfortable because he rarely came out of his dreaming to see what was happening in the world he didnt mind agreeing with them his world was his music and his family his home and the friends who counted why should he be bothered overmuch beyond that his family had lived in the village of ardmore in the county of waterford in the country of ireland for generations and there the gallaghers had run their pub offering pints and glasses a decent meal and a fine place for conversation as long as most cared to remember since his parents had settled in boston some time before it was up to shawns older brother aidan to head the business that was more than fine with shawn gallagher as he didnt quibble to admit he had no head for business whatsoever or the desire to get one he was happy enough to man the kitchen for cooking relaxed him the music would play for him out in the pub or inside his head as he filled orders or tweaked the menu of the day of course there were times when his sister darcywho had more than her share of the family energy and ambitionwould come in where he was working up a stew or building some sandwiches and start a row but that only livened things up he had no problem lending a hand with the serving especially if there was a bit of music or dancing going on and he cleaned up without complaint after closing for the gallaghers ran a tidy place life in ardmore suited himthe slow pace of it the sweep of sea and cliff the roll of green hills that went shimmering toward shadowed mountains the wanderlust that the gallaghers were famed for had skipped over him and shawn was well rooted in ardmores sandy soil he had no desire to travel as his brother aidan had done or as darcy spoke of doing all that he needed was right at his fingertips he saw no point in changing his view though he supposed he had in a way all of his life hed looked out his bedroom window toward the sea it had been there just there foaming against the sand dotted with boats rough or calm and every mood in between the scent of it was the first thing hed breathe in as he leaned out his window in the morning but when his brother had married the pretty yank jude frances murray the previous fall it seemed right to make a few adjustments in the gallagher way the first to marry took over the family home and so jude and aidan had moved into the rambling house at the edge of the village when they returned from honeymooning in venice given the choice between the rooms above the pub and the little cottage that belonged to the fitzgerald side of judes family darcy had decided in favor of the rooms shed browbeaten shawn and whoever else she could twist around her beautiful finger into painting and hauling until shed turned aidans once sparse rooms into her own little palace that was fine with shawn he preferred the little cottage on the faerie hill with its view of the cliffs and the gardens and its blessed quiet nor did he mind the ghost who walked there hed yet to see her but he knew she was there lady gwen who wept for the faerie lover she had cast away and waited for the spell to run its course and free them both shawn knew the story of the young maid whod lived three hundred years before in that very same cottage on that very same hill carrick prince of the faeries had fallen in love with her but instead of giving her the words offering his heart he had shown her the grandeur of the life he would give her three times he brought her a silver bag of jewels first diamonds cast from the fire of the sun then pearls formed from tears dripped from the moon and finally sapphires wrung from the heart of the sea but doubting his heart and her own destiny she refused him and the jewels he poured at her feet so legend had it became the very flowers that thrived in the dooryard of the cottage most of the flowers slept now shawn thought bedded down as winter blew over the coast the cliffs where it was said the lady often walked were stark and barren under a brooding sky a storm was biding its time waiting to happen the morning was a raw one with the wind knocking at the windows and sneaking in to chill the cottage he had a fire going in the kitchen hearth and his tea was hot so he didnt mind the wind he liked the arrogant music it made while he sat at the kitchen table nibbling on biscuits and toying with the lyrics for a tune hed written he didnt have to be at the pub for an hour yet but to make sure he got there at all hed set the timer on the stove and as a backup the alarm clock in his bedroom with no one there to shake him out of his dreams and tell him to get his ass moving he tended to forget the time altogether since it irritated aidan when he was late and gave darcy an excuse to hammer at him he did his best to stay on schedule the trouble was when he was deep enough in his music the buzzing and beeping of the timers didnt register and he was late in any case he was swimming in it now in a song of love that was young and sure of itself the sort to shawns thinking that was as fickle as the wind but fun while it lasted a dancing tune he decided that would require fast feet and flirting he would try it out at the pub sometime once it was polished a bit and if he could convince darcy to sing it her voice was just right for the mood of it too comfortable to bother going into the parlor where hed jammed the old piano he bought when he moved in he tapped his foot for rhythm and refined the lyrics he didnt hear the banging at the front door the clomp of bootsteps down the hallway or the muttered curse typical brenna thought lost in some dream world again while life went on around him she didnt know why shed bothered to knock in the first placehe rarely heard it and theyd been running tame in each others houses since childhood well they werent children anymore and shed as soon knock as walk in on something she shouldnt he could have had a woman in here for all she knew the man attracted them like sugar water attracted bees not that he was sweet necessarily though he could be god he was pretty the errant thought popped into her head and she immediately hated herself for it but it was hard not to notice after all all that fine black hair looking just a bit shabby as he never remembered when it was time for a trim eyes of a quiet and dreamy blueunless he was roused by something and then she recalled they could fire hot and cold in equal measure he had long dark lashes that her four sisters would have sold their soul for and a full firm mouth that was meant she supposed for long kisses and soft words not that she knew of either firsthand but shed heard tell his nose was long and just slightly crooked from a line drive shed hit herself smartly when theyd been playing american baseball more than ten years before all in all he had the face of some fairytale prince come to life some gallant knight on a quest or a slightly tattered angel add that to a long lanky body wonderfully widepalmed hands with the fingers of an artist a voice like whiskey warmed by a turf fire and he made quite the package not that she was interested particularly it was just that she appreciated things that were made well and what a liar she was even to herself shed had a yen for him even before shed beaned him with that baseballand shed been fourteen to his nineteen at the time and a yen tended to grow into something hotter something nervier by the time a woman was twentyfour not that he ever looked at her like she was a woman just as well she assured herself and shifted her stance she didnt have time to hang around mooning over the likes of shawn gallagher some people had work to do fixing a thin sneer on her face she deliberately lowered her toolbox and let it fall with a terrible clatter that he jumped like a rabbit under the gun pleased her christ jesus he scraped his chair around thumped a hand to his heart as if to get it pumping again whats the matter nothing she continued to sneer butterfingers she said sweetly and picked up her dented toolbox again give you a start did i you damn near killed me well i knocked but you didnt bother to come to the door i didnt hear you he blew out a breath scooped his hair back and frowned at her well heres the otoole come to call is something broken then youve a mind like a rusty bucket she shrugged out of her jacket tossed it over the back of a chair your oven there hasnt worked for a week she reminded him with a nod toward the stove the part i ordered for it just came in do you want me to fix it or not he made a sound of assent and waved his hand toward it biscuits she said as she walked by the table what kind of breakfast is that for a man grown they were here he smiled at her in a way that made her want to cuddle him its a bother to cook just for myself most mornings but if youre hungry ill fix something up for the both of us no ive eaten she set her toolbox down opened it started to rummage through you know ma always fixes more than enough shed be happy to have you wander down any morning you like and have a decent meal you could send up a flare when she makes her griddle cakes will you have some tea in any case the pots still warm i wouldnt mind it as she chose her tools got out the new part she watched his feet moving around the kitchen what were you doing writing music fiddling with words for a tune he said absently his eye had caught the flight of a single bird black and glossy against the dull pewter sky looks bitter out today tis and damp with it winters barely started and im wishing it over warm your bones a bit he crouched down with a thick mug of tea fixed as he knew she liked it strong and heavy on the sugar thanks the heat from the mug seeped into her hands as she cupped them around it he stayed where he was sipping his own tea their knees bumped companionably so what will you do about this heap what do you care as long as it works again he lifted a brow if i know what you did i might fix it myself next time this made her laugh so hard she had to sit her butt down on the floor to keep from tipping over you shawn you cant even fix your own broken fingernail sure i can grinning he mimed just biting one off and made her laugh again dont you concern yourself with what i do with the innards of the thing and i wont concern myself with the next cake you bake in it we each have our strengths after all its not as if ive never used a screwdriver he said and plucked one out of her kit and ive used a stirring spoon but i know which fits my hand better she took the tool from him then shifting her position stuck her head in the oven to get to work she had little hands shawn thought a man might think of them as delicate if he didnt know what they were capable of doing hed watched her swing a hammer grip a drill haul lumber cinch pipes more often than not those little fairy hands of hers were nicked and scratched or bruised around the knuckles she was such a small woman for the work shed chosen or the work that had chosen her he thought as he straightened he knew how that was brennas father was a man of all work and his eldest daughter took straight after him just as it was said shawn took after his mothers mother who had often forgotten the wash or the dinner while she played her music as he started to step back she moved her butt wriggling as she loosened a bolt his eyebrows lifted again in what he considered merely the reflexive interest of a male in an attractive portion of the female form she did after all have a trim and tidy little body the sort a man could scoop up onehanded if he had a mind to and if a man tried shawn imagined brenna otoole would lay him out flat the idea made him grin still hed rather look at her face any day it was such a study her eyes were lively and of a sharp glass green under elegant brows just slightly darker than her bright red hair her mouth was mobile and quick to smile or sneer or scowl she rarely painted itor the rest of her face come to thatthough she was thick as thieves with darcy who wouldnt step a foot out of the house until she was polished to a gleam she had a sharp little nose like a pixies that tended to wrinkle in disapproval or disdain most times she bundled her hair under a cap where she pinned the little fairy hed given her years before for some occasion or other but when she took the cap off there seemed miles of hair a rich bright red that sprang out in little curls as it pleased it suited her that way because he wanted to see her face again before he took himself off to the pub shawn leaned back casually on the counter then tucked his tongue in his cheek so youre walking out with jack brennan these days im hearing when her head came up swiftly and connected with the top of the oven with a resounding crack shawn winced and wisely swallowed the chuckle i am not as hed hoped she popped out of the oven there was a bit of soot on her nose and as she rubbed her sore head she knocked her cap askew who said i am oh innocent as three lambs shawn merely shrugged and finished his tea i thought i heard it somewhere round and about as such things go youve a head full of cider and never hear a bloody thing im not walking out with anyone ive no time for that nonsense annoyed she stuck her head back in the oven well then im mistaken easy enough to be these days when the village is so full of romance engagements and weddings and babies on the way thats the proper order anyway he chuckled and came back to crouch beside her again in a friendly way he laid a hand on her bottom but he didnt notice when she went very still aidan and jude are already picking out names and shes barely two months along yet theyre lovely together arent they aye her mouth had gone dry with that yen that was perilously close to need i like seeing them happy jude likes to think the cottage is magic she fell in love with aidan here and started her new life wrote her book all the things she says she was afraid even to dream of once happened right here thats lovely too theres something about this place he said half to himself you feel it at odd moments when youre drifting off to sleep or just waking its a a waiting with the new part in place she eased out of the oven his hand slid up her back lazily then fell away have you seen her lady gwen no sometimes theres a kind of movement on the air just at the edge of your vision but then nothing he pulled himself back smiled carelessly and got to his feet maybe shes not for me id think you the perfect candidate for a heartbroken ghost brenna said and turned away from his surprised glance she should work fine now she added giving the dial a turn well just see if she heats up youll see to that for me wont you darling the oven timer buzzed startling them both ive got to be going shawn said reaching over to shut it off is that your warning system then one of them he lifted a finger and on cue there came the cheerful bell from the clock by his bed thats the second round but itll go off on its own in a minute as its a windup otherwise i found id be having to run in and slap it off every bloody time clever enough when it suits you arent you i have my moments the cats out he continued as he took his own jacket from the hook take no pity on him should he come scratching at the door bub knew what he was after when he insisted on moving out here with me did you remember to feed him im not a complete moron unoffended he wrapped a scarf around his neck he has food enough and if he didnt hed go begging at your kitchen door hed do that anyway just to shame me he found his cap dragged it on see you at the pub then more than likely she didnt sigh until shed heard the front door close behind him yearnings in the direction of shawn gallagher were foolishness she told herself for he would never have the same aimed her way he thought of her as a sisteror worse she realized as a kind of honorary brother and that was her fault as well she admitted glancing down at her scruffy work pants and scarred boots shawn liked the girlie type and she was anything but she could flounce herself up she supposed between darcy and her own sisters and jude for that matter she would have no limit of consultants on beautifying brenna otoole but beyond the fact that she hated all that fuss and bother what would be the point in it if she polished and painted and cinched and laced to attract a man he wouldnt be attracted to what she was in any case besides if she put on lipstick and baubles and some slinky little dress shawn would likely laugh his lungs out then say something stupid that would leave her no choice but to punch him there was hardly a point in that shed leave the fancy work to darcy who was the champion of being female and to her sisters brenna thought who enjoyed such things as for herselfshed stick with her tools she went back to the oven running it at different temperatures and checking the broiler for good measure when she was satisfied it was in good working order she turned it off then packed up her tools she meant to go straight out there was no reason to linger after all but the cottage was so cozy shed always felt at home there when old maude fitzgerald had lived in faerie hill cottage for more years than brenna could count brenna had often stopped in for a visit then maude had died and jude had come to stay for a while theyd become friends so it had been easy to fall back into the routine of stopping in now and then on her way home or into the village she ignored the urge to stop in more often than not now that shawn was living there but it was hard to resist she liked the quiet of the place and all the pretty little things maude had collected and left sitting about jude had left them there and shawn seemed content to do the same so the little parlor was cheery with bits of glass and charming statues of faeries and wizards homey with books and a faded old rug of course now that shawn had stuffed the secondhand spinet piano into the dollhouse space there was barely room to turn around but brenna thought it only added to the charm and old maude had enjoyed music shed be pleased brenna thought as she skimmed her finger over the scarred black wood that someone was making music in her house again idly she scanned the sheet music that shawn forever left scattered over the top of the piano he was always writing a new tune or taking out an old one to change something she frowned in concentration as she studied the squiggles and dots she wasnt particularly musical oh she could sing out a rebel song without making the dog howl in response but playing was a different kettle of fish altogether since she was alone she decided to satisfy her curiosity she set her toolbox down again chose one of the sheets and sat down gnawing her lip she found middle c on the keyboard and slowly painstakingly picked out the written notes one finger at a time it was lovely of course everything he wrote was lovely and even her pitiful playing couldnt kill the beauty of it completely hed added words to this one as he often did brenna cleared her throat and attempted to match her voice to the proper note when im alone in the night and the moon sheds its tears i know my world would come right if only you were here without you my heart is empty of all but the memories it keeps you only you stay inside me in the night while the moon weeps she stopped sighed a little as there was no one to hear it touched her as his songs always did but a little deeper this time a little truer moon tears she thought pearls for lady gwen a love that asked but couldnt be answered its so sad shawn whats inside you that makes such lonely music as well as she knew him she didnt know the answer to that and she wanted to had always wanted to know the key to him but he wasnt a motor or machine that she could take apart to find the workings men were more complicated and frustrating puzzles it was his secret and his talent she supposed all so internal and mysterious while her skills were she looked down at her small capable hands hers were as simple as they came at least she put hers to good use and made a proper living from them what did shawn gallagher do with his great gift but sit and dream if he had a lick of ambition or true pride in his work hed sell his tunes instead of just writing them and piling them up in boxes the man needed a good kick in the ass for wasting something god had given him but that she thought was an annoyance for another day she had work of her own to do she started to get up to reach for her toolbox again when a movement caught the corner of her eye she straightened like a spike mortified at the thought of shawn coming backhe was always forgetting somethingand catching her playing with his music but it wasnt shawn who stood in the doorway the woman had pale gold hair that tumbled around the shoulders of a plain gray dress that swept down to the floor her eyes were a soft green her smile so sad it broke the heart at first glance recognition shock and a giddy excitement raced through brenna all at once she opened her mouth but whatever she intended to say came out in a wheeze as her pulse pounded she tried again faintly embarrassed that her knees were shaking lady gwen she managed she thought it was admirable to be able to get out that much when faced with a threehundredyearold ghost as she watched a single tear shiny as silver trailed down the ladys cheek his hearts in his song her voice was soft as rose petals and still had brenna trembling listen what do you but before brenna could get the question out she was alone with only the faintest scent of wild roses drifting in the air well then well she had to sit there was no help for it so she let herself drop back down to the piano bench well she said again and blew out several strong breaths until her heart stopped thundering against her rib cage when she thought her legs would hold her again she decided it was best to tell the tale to someone wise and sensible and understanding she knew no one who fit those requirements so well as her own mother she calmed considerably on the short drive home the otoole house stood back off the road a rambling jigsaw puzzle of a place she herself had helped make so when her father got an idea for a room into his head she was more than pleased to dive into the ripping out and nailing up some of her happiest memories were of working side by side with michael otoole and listening to him whistle the chore away she pulled in behind her mothers ancient car they really did need to paint the old heap brenna thought absently as she always did smoke was pumping from the chimneys inside was all welcome and warmth and the smells of the mornings baking she found her mother mollie in the kitchen pulling fresh loaves of brown bread out of the oven ma oh sweet mary girl you gave me a start with a laugh mollie put the pans on the stovetop and turned with a smile she had a pretty face still young and smooth and the red hair shed passed on to her daughter was bundled on top of her head for convenience sorry youve got the music up again its company but mollie reached over to turn the radio down beneath the table betty their yellow dog rolled over and groaned what are you doing back here so soon i thought you had work i did i do ive got to go into the village yet to help dad but i stopped by faerie hill to fix the oven for shawn mmmhmm mollie turned back to pop the loaves out of the pan and set them on the rack to cool he left before i was done so i was there by myself for a bit when mollie made the same absent sound brenna shifted her feet then ah when i was leaving well there was lady gwen mmmhmm what finally tuning in mollie looked over her shoulder at brenna i saw her i was just fiddling for a minute at the piano and i looked up and there she was in the parlor doorway well then that mustve given you a start brennas breath whooshed out sensible that was mollie otoole bless her i all but swallowed me tongue then and there shes lovely just as old maude used to say and sad it just breaks your heart how sad i always hoped to see her myself a practical woman mollie poured two cups of tea and carried them to the table but i never did i know aidans talked of seeing her for years and then jude when she moved into the cottage relaxed again brenna settled at the table but i was just talking to shawn of her and he says hes not seen hersensed her but never seen and then there she was for me why do you think that is i cant say darling what did you feel other than a hard knock of surprise sympathy i guess then puzzlement because i dont know what she meant by what she said to me she spoke to you mollies eyes widened why ive never heard of her speaking to anyone not even maude shed have told me what did she say to you she said his hearts in his song then she just told me to listen and when i got back my wits enough to ask her what she meant she was gone since its shawn who lives there now and his piano you were playing with id say the message was clear enough but i listen to his music all the time you cant be around him five minutes without it mollie started to speak then thought better of it and only covered her daughters hand with her own her darling mary brenna she thought had such a hard time recognizing anything she couldnt pick apart and put together again id say when its time for you to understand you will she makes you want to help her brenna murmured youre a good lass mary brenna perhaps before its done help her is just what youll do chapter two as the air was raw and the wind carried a sting shawn set out the makings for mulligan stew the morning quiet of the pubs kitchen was one of his favorite things so as he chopped his vegetables and browned hunks of lamb he enjoyed his last bit of solitude before the pub doors opened aidan would be in soon enough asking if this had been done or that had been seen to then darcy would begin to move about upstairs feet padding back and forth across the floor and the ghost echo of whatever music her mood called for that day drifting down the back stairs but for now gallaghers was his he didnt want the responsibility of running it that was for aidan shawn was grateful hed been born second but the pub mattered to him the tradition of it that had been passed down generation to generation from the first shamus gallagher who with his wife beside him had built the public house by ardmore bay and opened its thick doors to offer hospitality shelter and a good glass of whiskey hed been born the son of a publican and understood that the job was to provide comfort of all sorts to those who passed through over the years gallaghers had come to mean comfort and it became known for its musicthe seisiun an informal pub gathering of traditional musicas well as the more structured sets provided by hired musicians from all over the country shawns love of music had come down to him through the pub and so through the blood it was as much a part of him as the blue of his eyes or the shape of his smile there was little he liked better than working away in his kitchen and hearing a tune break out through the doors it was true enough that he was often compelled to leave what he was doing and swing out to join in but everyone got what theyd come for sooner or later so where was the harm it was rarenot unheard of but rarefor him to burn a pot or let a dish go cold for he took a great measure of pride in his kitchen and what came out of it now the steam began to rise and scent the air and the broth thickened he added bits of fresh basil and rosemary from plants he was babying it was a new idea of his these selfgrown herbs one hed taken from mollie otoole he considered her the best cook in the parish he added marjoram as well but that was from a jar he intended to start his own plant of that too and get himself what jude had told him was called a grow light when the herbs were added to his satisfaction he checked his other makings then began to grate cabbage for the slaw he made by the gallons he heard the first footsteps overhead then the music british music today shawn thought recognizing the clever and sophisticated tangle of notes pleased with darcys choice he sang along with annie lennox until aidan swung through the door aidan wore a thick fishermans sweater against the cold he was broader of shoulder than his brother tougher of build his hair was the same dark aged chestnut as their bar and showed hints of red in the sunlight though shawns face was leaner his eyes a quieter blue the gallagher genes ran strong and true no one taking a good look would doubt that they were brothers aidan cocked a brow and what are you grinning at you shawn said easily youve the look of a contented and satisfied man and why wouldnt i why indeed shawn poured a mug from the pot of tea hed already made and how is our jude this morning still a bit queasy for the first little while but she doesnt seem to mind it aidan sipped and sighed im not ashamed to say it makes my own stomach roll seeing how she pales the minute she gets out of bed after an hour or so shes back to herself but its a long hour for me shawn settled back against the counter with his own mug you couldnt pay me to be a woman do you want me to take her a bowl of stew later on or ive some chicken broth if shed do better with something more bland i think shed handle the stew shed appreciate that and so do i its not a problem its mulligan stew if you want to fix the daily and ive a mind to make breadandbutter pudding so you can add that as well the phone began to ring out in the pub and aidan rolled his eyes that had best not be the distributor saying theres a problem again were lower on porter than i like to be and that shawn thought as aidan went out to answer was just one of the many reasons he was glad to have the business end of things in his brothers keeping all that figuring and planning shawn mused as he calculated how many pounds of fish he needed to get through the day then the dealing with people the arguing and demanding and insisting it wasnt all standing behind the bar pulling pints and listening to old mr riley tell a story then there were things like ledgers and overhead and maintenance and taxes it was enough to give you a headache just thinking of it he checked his stew gave the enormous pot of it a quick stir then went to the bottom of the steps to shout up for darcy to move her lazy ass it was said out of habit rather than heat and the curse she shouted back down at him was an answer in kind satisfied altogether with the start of his day shawn wandered out to the pub to help aidan take the chairs off the tables in preparation for the first shift but aidan was standing behind the bar frowning off into space a problem with the distributor then no not at all aidan shifted his frown to shawn that was a call from new york city a man named magee new york city why it cant be five in the morning there as yet i know it but the man sounded awake and sober aidan scratched his head then shook it and lifted his tea he has a mind to put a theater up in ardmore a theater shawn set the first chair down then just leaned on it for films no for music live music and perhaps plays as well he said he was calling me as hed heard that gallaghers was in the way of being the center of music here he wanted my thoughts on the matter considering shawn took down another chair and what were they well i didnt have any to speak of being taken by surprise that way i said if he wanted he could give me a day or two to think on it hell ring me back end of week now why would a man from new york city be thinking of building a musical theater here wouldnt you set your sights on dublin or out in clare or galway that was part of his point aidan answered he wasnt a fount of information but he indicated he wanted this area in particular so i said to him perhaps he wasnt aware were a fishing village and little more sure the tourists come for the beaches and some to climb up to see saint declans and take photographs and the like but were not what youd call teeming with people with a shrug aidan came around to help shawn set up he just laughed at that and said he knew that well enough and he was thinking of something fairly smallscale and intimate i can tell you what i think when aidan nodded shawn continued i think its a grand notion whether it would work is a different matter but its a fine notion i have to weigh the this and that of it first aidan murmured likely as not the man will reconsider and head for somewhere more lively in any case and if he doesnt id talk him round to building it back of the pub as it was part of the routine shawn gathered up ashtrays and began to set them out on the tables weve that little bit of land there and if his theater was in the way of being attached to gallaghers wed be the ones to benefit most aidan set down the last chair and smiled slowly thats a good notion altogether youre a surprise to me shawn working your mind around to the business of it oh ive a thought in my head every once in a while still he didnt give it much of another thought once the doors were open and the customers rolling in he had time for a quick and entertaining spat with darcy giving him the pleasure of seeing her flounce out of his kitchen vowing never to speak to him again until he was six years in his grave he doubted hed have luck enough for that he scooped up stew fried fish and chips built sandwiches thick with grilled ham and cheese the constant hum of voices through the door was company enough and for the first hour of lunch shift darcy kept her word glaring silently as she swung in and out for orders and giving new ones by staring at the wall it amused him so much that when she came in to dump empties he grabbed her and kissed her noisily on the mouth speak to me darling youre breaking my heart she shoved at him slapped his hands then gave up and laughed ill speak to you right enough you bonehead turn me loose only after you promise not to brain me with something aidanll take the breakage out of my pay and im saving for a new dress she tossed back her cloud of silky black hair and sniffed at him then im safe enough he set her down and turned to flip over a hunk of sizzling whitefish weve a couple of german tourists who want to try your stew with brown bread and slaw theyre staying at the b and b she went on as shawn got thick bowls heading toward kerry tomorrow then into clare so they say if it were me and i had holiday in january id be spending it in sunny spain or some tropical island where you didnt need anything but a bikini and a coating of sun oil she wandered the kitchen as she spoke a woman with a stunning face clear creamy skin and brilliant blue eyes her mouth was full unapologetically sexual whether it was sulking or smiling shed painted it hot red that morning to keep herself cheerful on a chill and dreary day she had a figure that left no doubt she was female and her love affair with fashion had her outfit it in bold colors and soft fabrics she had the gallagher yen to travel and the determination to do so in the style to which she longed to become accustomed lavish since today wasnt the day for that she picked up the order and started out just as brenna came in what have you been into this time then darcy demanded youve black all over your face soot brenna sniffed and scrubbed the back of her hand over her nose dad and ive been cleaning out a chimney and a right mess it is i got most of it off me if you think so you didnt look in a mirror giving her friend a wide berth darcy went out shed spend all her days looking in one if she had her choice shawn commented are you wanting lunch then dad and i will have some of that stew smells fine she moved over intending to ladle it up herself but shawn stepped between her and his precious stove id just as soon do that for you as you didnt get off as much of that chimney as you might think all right well have some tea as well and ah i need a word with you later he glanced over his shoulder whats wrong with now were both of us here id rather do it when youre not so busy ill come back after the lunch shift if that suits you you know where to find me dont you he set the stew and the tea on a tray i do yes she took the tray from him and carried it out to the back booth where her father waited here we are dad stew hot from the pot and smelling like heaven mick otoole was a bantam of a man small and spare of build with a thick thatch of wiry hair the color of sand and lively eyes that drifted like the sea between green and blue he had a laugh like a braying donkey hands like a surgeons and a soft spot for romantic tales he was the love of brennas life its good to be warm and snug now isnt it mary brenna that it is she spooned up stew and blew on it carefully though the scent of it made her want to risk a scalded tongue and now that we are and about to have our bellies filled as well why dont you tell me whats worrying your mind he saw everything brenna thought that was sometimes a comfort and other times a bit of a nuisance its not a worry so much do you know how you told us what happened when you were a young man and your grandmother died i do yes i was right here in gallaghers pub of course that was when aidans father manned the bar before he and his wife took off for america you werent more than a wish in my heart and a smile in your mothers eye there i was back where young shawn is right now in the kitchen i was fixing the sink in there as it had a slow and steady leak that finally made gallagher give me a whistle he paused to sample the stew dabbing his mouth with his napkin as his wife was fierce on table manners and had trained him accordingly and as i was on the floor i looked over and there was my grandma wearing a flowered dress and a white apron she smiled at me but when i tried to speak to her she shook her head then lifting a hand in a kind of farewell she vanished so i knew at that moment shed passed over and that what id seen had been the spirit of her come to say goodbye for i had been her favorite i dont mean to make you sad brenna murmured well mick let out a breath she was a fine woman and lived a good and long life but its left to us still living to miss those who arent brenna remembered the rest of the story how her father had left his work and run down to the little house where his grandmother two years a widow lived and he found her in her kitchen sitting at the table in her flowered dress and white apron shed died quiet and peaceful and sometimes brenna said carefully those who pass on miss others this morning in faerie hill cottage i saw lady gwen mick nodded and shifted closer to listen as brenna told him poor lass he said when she was finished its a long time to wait for things to come round for you some of us do a lot of waiting brenna glanced over as shawn came out with a tray piled with food i want to speak to shawn about this when the pub quiets down a bit darcy says theres an outlet up in her rooms that isnt working proper i think ill go see to that after weve had our meal here then take some time to talk to shawn unless theres something else you have for me to do today today tomorrow mick lifted his shoulders what we dont get to at one time well get to another ill just take myself up to the cliff hotel and see if theyve decided on which room they want renovated next he winked at his daughter we could have ourselves a nice piece of work there for the whole of the winter where its warm and its dry and where you can sneak down and check on mary kate in the offices where shes fiddling with a computer all day mick grinned sheepishly i wouldnt call it checking so much but im grateful she decided to take a job close to home since shes done with university i expect shell find work that suits her better in dublin or waterford city before much longer my chicks are all flying the coop im still roosting and youll have alice mae for years yet ah but i miss the days when my five girls went tripping over me every time i turned around heres maureen a married woman and patty going for a bride come spring dont know what ill do darling when you hitch yourself to a man and leave me youre well stuck with me dad she crossed her booted feet as she finished off her stew men dont lose their heads or their hearts over women like me the right one will it took all her effort not to let her gaze wander toward the kitchen i wont be holding my breath besides were partners arent we now she looked up and grinned at him so man or no man its always otoole and otoole which brenna thought as she used darcys bathroom to wash away the rest of the soot was just the way she wanted it she had work that pleased her and the freedom to come and go that no woman could manage with a man attached to her she had her room at home as long as she wanted it the companionship of family and friends shed leave the fussing with keeping a house and pleasing a husband to her sisters maureen and patty just as shed leave office work and marking her time by a clock to mary kate all she needed to get by were her tools and her lorry and her wanting shawn gallagher brought her little but frustration and annoyance she imagined that one day eventually it would pass knowing darcy well brenna made certain she cleaned up every spot of dirt she left the little white sink gleaming and used her own rags to dry her hands and face rather than the frilly fingertip towels darcy had on the rod which to brennas mind were a complete waste of fabric since no one who really needed to use them would dare life would be simpler if everyone bought black towels then no one would shriek and curse when their fluffy white ones ended up grubby she spent a quiet few minutes replacing the broken outlet in the living area with the new box shed brought along she was just screwing on the cover when darcy came in i was hoping youd get to that it was irritating darcy dumped her tip money in what she called her wish jar oh aidan said to tell you that he and jude want to have some work done in what will be the babys room im going over to see jude now if you want to come along and see what she has in mind ive something to do first but you can tell her ill come round in a bit damn it brenna youve left dirty boot prints all over the floor here brenna winced and hurried up with the screws well im sorry about that darcy but i cleaned the sink well now you can clean the floor as well im not scrubbing up behind you why the devil didnt you use the loo in the pub its shawns week to clean up there i didnt think of it stop bitching about it ill see to it before i go and youre very welcome for the electrical work ive just done for you thanks for that darcy came back out pulling on a leather jacket shed splurged on as a christmas gift for herself ill see you at judes then i suppose brenna muttered annoyed with the idea of washing the bathroom floor she muttered her way through the chore too then cursed viciously when she noted shed left little clumps of dirt and dried mud across the living room as well rather than risk darcys wrath she dragged out the vacuum and sucked it all up as a result the pub was quiet when she came back down and shawn was nearly finished with the washing up so did darcy hire you to clean her house as well i tracked mud in at home she poured herself a cup of tea i didnt mean to be so long i dont mean to keep you if youve something to do before youre needed here again ive nothing in particular but i want a pint you sticking with tea he asked with a nod of his head for the moment ill just draw me one theres a bit of pudding left if you want she didnt really but having a weakness for such things she dug out a few spoonfuls for a bowl she was sitting and settled when he came back in with a pint of harp tim riley says the weather will be turning milder by tomorrow he always seems to know but were in for wet before much longer shawn added and sat across from her so whats on your mind then well ill tell you shed tried out a dozen different ways in her mind and settled on the one that seemed best after youd gone off this morning i stopped off in your parlor to check your flue it was a lie of course and she was prepared to confess it to her priest but shed be damned if shed tell him shed been playing with his music her pride was worth the penance its drawing well aye she agreed and added a shrug but such things bear checking now and then in any case when i turned round there she was right in the parlor doorway there who was lady gwen you saw her shawn set the pint down with a click of glass on wood as clear as im seeing you now she was standing there sort of smiling at me in a sad way and she didnt want to tell him what had been said but felt obliged it was one thing to tell a little lie and another to deceive and what the rare show of impatience from him had brenna bristling im getting to it and then she spoke to me she spoke to you he pushed back from the table paced around the kitchen so uncharacteristically agitated that brenna found herself gawking at him whats crawled up your arse here shawn im the one whos living there arent i does she show herself to me speak to me no she doesnt she waits until you come along to fix the oven and fiddle with the flue then there she is well its sorry i am to have been the one preferred by your ghost but i didnt ask for it did i brenna heaped her spoon with pudding and filled her mouth with it all right all right dont get testy on me scowling he dropped back into his chair what did she say to you keeping her face bland brenna stared through him while she ate her pudding when shawn rolled his eyes at her she picked up her tea and took a dainty sip im sorry were you speaking to me or is there someone else about that youve decided to snap at through no fault of her own im sorry he flashed her a smile because it almost always worked will you tell me what she said i will since youve decided to ask politely she said to me his hearts in his song i thought perhaps she meant the faerie prince but when i was telling ma of it she said it meant you if she did i dont know what she meant by it i dont know any more than you but i was wondering if you wouldnt mind me coming by now and then you already do he pointed out and made her squirm a little if you dont want me there youve only to say so thats not what i said or what i meant im just saying you do come round i thought i could come round when you werent there as well like today just to see if shed come back i could do a few chores for you while i was there you dont need to find work to come by youre always welcome it softened her not only that he said it but that he meant it i know but i like keeping busy so ill slip in from time to time since you dont mind and youll tell me if you see her again youll be the first she rose to carry her bowl and mug to the sink do you think she trailed off shook her head what no its nothing foolish he came up behind her gave her neck a quick squeeze with his clever fingers she wanted to arch and purr like a cat but knew better if you cant be foolish with a friend who else is there well i was wondering if love really lasts like that through death and time its the only thing that really lasts have you ever been in love not so it took root and if it doesnt i suppose its not love at all she let out a sigh that surprised them both if it takes root in one and not the other it has to be the worst thing in the world he felt a quiver in his heart that he took for sympathy there brenna darling have you gone and fallen in love on me she jerked whirled gaped at him he was watching her with suchsuch bloody affection such patience and sympathy she could have beaten him black and blue instead she just shoved clear of him and snatched up her toolbox shawn gallagher you are truly a great idiot of a man with her nose in the air and her tools clanking she stalked out he only shook his head then went back to his cleaning up with that little quiver around his heart again he wondered who it was that otoole had set her sights on whoever shawn thought slamming a cupboard door just a little too forcefully the man had better be worthy of her chapter three brenna wasnt in the best of moods when she clomped into the gallagher house she didnt knockdidnt think to shed been breezing in and out of the old house just as darcy breezed in and out of the otooles for as long as either could remember the house had changed here and there over the years hadnt she and her father laid the new floor in the kitchenas pretty a blue as a summer skynot five winters back and she herself had papered darcys room with that lovely pattern of baby rosebuds the june before last but though thered been a bit of fussing here and fussing there the heart of the house remained the same it was a welcoming place and the walls seemed to ring with music even when no one was playing now that aidan and jude lived there fresh flowers were always tucked into vases and bowls and bottles as jude had a fondness for them and brenna knew jude had plans to do more planting in the spring and had talked of having brenna build her an arbor something oldfashioned was needed to brennas mind to suit the look of the house with its old stone and sturdy wood and carelessly sprawling lines she had something in her head she thought would suit and would get to it by and by even as she entered the house with a scowl the sound of darcys laugh tripping down the steps had her lips twitching females she thought as she headed upstairs were so much more comfortable than men most men most of the time she found them in what had been shawns room though there was little left of him there save the bed and his old dresser hed taken the shelves that hed had crammed with music with him to faerie hill and his fiddle and bodhran drum as well the rug was still there a faded old maroon shed sat on it countless times pretending to be bored while hed played some tune the first time shed fallen in love it had been with shawn gallaghers music so long ago she thought now she couldnt remember the song or the time it was more an always sort of thing not that shed ever let him know that to her way of thinking you got a body moving quicker with pokes than with strokes though god knew so far neither had inspired the man to move off his butt and do a blessed thing with his tunes she wanted it for him the mule of a man wanted him to do what hed been destined to do and take his music to the world but she reminded herself it wasnt her problem and gnawing over it again in her mind wasnt why shed come here today this she thought pursing her lips was judes problem the walls were a mess brenna decided with a quick scan outlines where shawn had hung pictures and whatnot stood out against the sunfaded paint dozens of nail holes pocked the walls as well proving the man didnt have a way with a hammer but she could recall that whenever his mother had a whim to deal with his room hed just smiled and told her not to bother he liked it just as it was brenna leaned against the doorjamb already visualizing how to turn the neglected male space into a cheery nursery and thinking she let her gaze rest on her friends who stood by the window looking out darcy with her gorgeous hair falling wild and free jude with her deep rich brown hair bound neatly back they were a contrast in styles she supposed with darcy bright as the sun and jude subtle as a moonbeam they were about the same height about average for a woman brenna mused which put them both a good three inches over her their builds were similar as well though darcy had more in the curve department and didnt trouble to hide it they were both easily unmistakably female it wasnt something brenna enviedof course it wasnt but she did wish just now and again that she didnt feel like such a fool whenever she put on a skirt and girl shoes since it wasnt something she cared to dwell on she stuck her hands in the pockets of her baggy pants and cocked her head how are you going to figure out what you want done in here if you stare out the window all day jude turned grinned so that her pretty serious face lit up were watching aidan on the beach with finn the man ran out like a rabbit darcy put in as brenna strolled over the minute we started talking paper and paint and fabrics said he had to exercise the dog well now brenna peeked out the window herself spotted aidan and the young dog finn sitting on the beach and watching the water thats a fine sight anyway a broadshouldered man and a handsome dog on a winters beach hes thinking deep thoughts ill wager on impending fatherhood darcy shot her brother a last look of affection then turned hands on hips and its up to us to deal with the practicalities of the matter while he sits and philosophizes brenna gave judes flat belly a friendly pat hows it all going then fine the doctor says were both healthy i heard youre still queasy of a morning jude rolled her seagreen eyes aidan fusses youd think i was the first woman to conceive a child since eve its just a little morning sickness itll pass if it were me darcy announced and flopped onto her brothers old bed id play it up for all it was worth pampering jude frances you should rake in all the fussing and pampering you can manage for when the baby comes youll be too busy to remember your name remember when betsy duffy had her first brenna she fell asleep every sunday at mass for two months running with the second shed just sit there wildeyed and dazed and by the time she had the third all right jude laughed and swatted at darcys feet i get the picture right now im just dealing with pre paring for one brenna she lifted her hands these walls aye theyre a sight arent they we can fix them up for you clean them up patch the holes she flicked a finger over one as big as a penny paint them proper id thought of papering but i decided paints better something sunny and simple then we can hang prints fairytale prints you ought to hang your own drawings brenna told her oh i dont draw that well well enough to sell a book with your stories and your drawings in it brenna reminded her i think your pictures are lovely and it would mean more wouldnt it to the baby as it grew to have something its mother had done hanging here really jude tapped a finger on her lips the pleasure of the idea obvious in her eyes i suppose i could have some framed see how they looked candycolored frames brenna told her babes like bright colors or so ma always says all right jude took a deep breath now these floors i dont want to cover them but theyll need to be sanded and revarnished thats not a problem some of this trim needs to be replaced too i can make some up to match the rest of it perfect now heres this idea ive been mulling over its a large room so i thought what if we made this corner here a kind of play area gesturing jude crossed the room shelves up this wall for toys a little table and chair that would fit right under the window we can do that but if you were to come round the corner with the shelves youd make better use of your space and have it more like a separate spot if you know what i mean and i can make them adjustable so you can change the look of them as needs be around the corner jude narrowed her eyes and tried to picture it yes i like that what do you think darcy i think the two of you know just whats needed here but its up to me to get you into dublin for some smartlooking maternity clothes instinctively jude laid a hand on her stomach im not showing yet why wait youll need them long before the baby needs shelves and youre already thinking of those arent you well go thursday next when ive the day off and the portion of her pay she allotted herself for fun in her pocket that suit you brenna brenna was already taking her measuring tape out of her toolbox suits me for the pair of you ive too much work just now to take a day being dragged around dublin shops and waiting while you gasp over the next pair of shoes you cant live without you could do with a new pair of boots yourself darcy skimmed her gaze down those look like you wore them to march over to the west counties and back again they do fine for me jude tell shawn to find a place for his junk here and ill start on this room first of next week tisnt junk shawn said from the doorway i spent many a happy night in that bed where darcys making herself at home just now well junks what it is now brenna shot back with a little sniff and in the way and how many times id like to know do you have to hit a nail to put holes this size in a wall you put pictures over them and it doesnt matter how big the holes are since thats your thinking on it if youve a mind to put up anything in the cottage call someone who knows one end of a hammer from the other youll want to make him swear to that jude brenna warned else the cottagell be rubble by spring ill fix the damn holes meself if itll shut you up his tone was pleasant dangerously so and that was just enough to give brennas heart a little jerk and make her cover the reaction with sarcasm oh to be sure youll fix them like you fixed the sink at the pub the last time it plugged up so i had to wade through an inch of water on the floor to repair the damage when darcy snickered shawn sent her a cool and silent look ill have whats left of mine out by tomorrow jude if thats all right with you recognizing scraped male pride she started to step forward quickly theres no hurry shawn we were just she trailed off as the room took a sick slow spin before she could stagger shawn darted across the room at a speed that had brennas mouth falling open and scooped his sisterinlaw into his arms its nothing her head already clearing jude patted his shoulder i was just dizzy for a minute thats all it happens now and then youre for bed he said already striding out get aidan he tossed the order to darcy over his shoulder no no im fine shawn dont get aidan he repeated but darcy was already up and running brenna stood where she was for a moment her measuring tape in her hand as the oldest of five shed seen her mother stretch right out on the floor during a dizzy spell while pregnant so she wasnt particularly alarmed by judes behavior what she was was stunned by the fluid strength shed just witnessed why the man had plucked jude up as if shed been weightless where had that been hiding shaking herself clear she hurried into the master bedroom in time to see shawn lay jude gently on the bed and pull a throw over her shawn this is ridiculous i lie down he jabbed a finger at her in a way that made jude obey and brenna goggle im calling the doctor she doesnt need the doctor brenna nearly flinched from the furious glare he aimed at her when he whirled around but she also saw sheer male fear behind his eyes and was touched by it its just a part of carrying thats all she moved to the bed to sit and pat judes hand my mother used to lie right down on the kitchen floor when she had a spell especially with alice mae i feel fine of course you do but a little rest doesnt hurt why dont you fetch our jude some water shawn i think she should have the doctor aidans likely to make her because jude looked so unhappy at the thought brenna gave her a look of quiet sympathy oh dont take on now ma says that dad did the same with her when she carried me by the time the others came along he was used to it a mans got a right to panic after all he doesnt know whats going on inside you the way you do does he shawn lets have that water now all right ill fetch it but dont let her get up im fine really of course you are your colors back your eyes are clear brenna gave judes hand another squeeze do you want me to go out and head aidan off try to calm him down if you think she broke off as she heard the front door slam like a gunshot and then footsteps rushing up the stairs too late brenna got up and made it halfway across the room before aidan came flying in shes fine just a little expectantmother spell shes then she only sighed as aidan dashed right past her are you all right did you faint did someone call the doctor well leave it to her to calm him down giving darcy a little wave brenna nudged her out of the room and shut the door are you sure shes all right she looked so pale for a minute shes fine i promise you and aidanll likely keep her in bed the rest of the day no matter how she argues bad enough a woman has to get fat as a cow with a baby but add to that the hanging over the toilet every morning and fainting without a moments notice darcy blew out a breath and ordered herself to calm down its a sorry state of affairs what a woman goes through and you she stabbed a finger at shawn as he walked down the hallway with a glass of water all the lot of you have to do is have your pleasure whistle away nine months then pass out smelly cigars it just goes to proving gods a man he said with a weak smile darcys lips quirked at that but she shook her head im going to make jude some tea and toast she sauntered away leaving shawn staring at the bedroom door lets give them a bit of privacy brenna took his arm and tugged him toward the stairs shouldnt i take her the water you drink it feeling kindly toward him brenna reached up and touched his cheek youre white as a sheet scared ten years off my life she did i can see that but you acted fast and did just the right thing she slipped into the next room picked up her measuring tape again shes got all those changes going on inside her and likely isnt resting as much as she might shes all caught up in her plans she added taking a measurement writing it down in her little book so much new in her life in so short a time i guess its easier for women to take such matters in stride i suppose brenna continued to measure and take notes you must remember when your mother was carrying darcy some he sipped at the water as his throat was still dry with nerves brenna was calm enough he noted moving gracefully around the room in those thick old boots taking measurements writing things down making little pencil marks and noting numbers right on the wall some of her hair was falling out of her cap just a few long spiraling red curls loosened he supposed by her dash into the bedroom what do you remember best hmm hed lost the thread somewhere and now shifted his gaze from the red curl that teased her shoulder back to her face about when your mother was pregnant with darcy what do you remember best laying my head against her belly feeling all those kicks and movements it was like darcy was fretting to get outside and get on with things thats a nice one brenna put her tape and notebook away lifted her toolbox im sorry i snapped and snarled at you before i was in a bit of a mood today youre in a bit of a mood most days but he smiled and tapped the bill of her cap down over her eyes im too used to your nips to mind much the problem was she wanted to take a real nipright there just along his jaw to see how it tasted and if she tried it she imagined hed be the one to faint i wont be able to get started in here until monday or tuesday so theres no real rush getting your things out but she lifted a finger tapped it against his chest i meant what i said about hanging pictures at the cottage he only laughed if i get the urge to pick up a hammer he began then threw her off balance by bending down to place a quick friendly kiss on her cheek ill be sure to call the otoole aye do that irritated all over again she started to stride out aidan looking frazzled came to the doorway shes fine she says shes fine i called the doctor and he says shes fine just to rest a bit and keep her feet up darcys making her some tea thats good thats fine then judes fretting some because shed planned to take flowers to old maude this afternoon id run them up myself but ill do it shawn told him youll feel better if you can stay with her a bit longer i can drive up have a bit of a visit with old maude then be back in time for the pub id be gratefulam grateful he corrected his face clearing a little now she told me how you picked her up and carted her off to bed made her stay there just ask her not to go into a swoon around me again my heart wont take it shawn took flowers to maude the cheerful purple and yellow pansies that jude had already gathered he didnt often come to the old cemetery hed lost no one truly close to him whod been laid to rest there but he thought since the cottage was close he could take over the task from jude until she was more up to the climb the dead were buried near the saint declans well where those who had made the pilgrimage to honor the ancient irish saint had washed the travel from their hands and feet three stone crosses stood nearby guarding the holy place and perhaps he thought giving comfort to the living who came high on this hill to honor the dead the view was spectacularardmore bay stretched out like a gray swath under stormready skies and the beat of the celtic sea the heart that pulsed day and night spread to the horizon between that drumming and the wind there was music and birds undaunted by winter sang to it the sunlight was weak and white the air damp and going raw the wild grass that fought its way among the stones and cobbles was pale with winter but he knew winter never had much of a march here and soon enough fresh green shoots would brave their way among the old the cycle that such places stood for never ended and that was another comfort he sat beside maude fitzgeralds grave folding his legs companionably and laying the pansies under her stone where the words wise woman were carved his mother had been a fitzgerald before her marriage so old maude had been a cousin of sorts shawn remembered her well a small thin woman with gray hair and eyes of a misty farseeing green and he remembered the way shed sometimes looked at him deep and quiet in a manner that hadnt made him uneasy so much as unsettled despite it hed always been drawn to her and as a child had often sat at her feet when shed come into the pub hed never tired of listening to her tell stories and later years later had made songs out of some of them for himself its jude who sends you the flowers he began shes resting now as she had a bit of a spell with the baby shes fine so theres nothing to worry about but as we wanted her to lie down for a while i said id bring her flowers to you so i hope you dont mind he fell silent a moment letting his gaze wander im living in your cottage now that aidan and jude have moved into the house thats the gallagher way as im sure you know and now with the baby coming the cottage would be a wee bit small judes granny that would be your cousin agnes murray signed the cottage over to her as a wedding gift he shifted to find more comfort on the ground and his fingers began to tap on his knee in an unconscious match to the rhythm of the sea i like living there in the quiet but i wonder that i havent seen lady gwen do you know she showed herself to brenna otoole youll remember brenna shes the oldest of the otoole girls who live down from your cottage shes the redheadwell most of the otoole girls are redheaded but brennas got like sunfire at the edges of it youd think it would burn your fingers to touch it and instead its just warm and soft he caught himself frowned a little cleared his throat in any case ive been living there near to five months now and she hasnt shown herself to me not clearly and theres brenna come by to fix the stove and the lady not only shows herself but speaks to her as well women are perverse creatures shawns heart gave one quick thud as he hadnt expected anyone to speak back to him in such a place he looked up and saw a man with long black hair eyes of piercing blue and a smile wicked at the corners so ive often thought myself shawn said calmly enough but his heart had decided one quick thud wasnt enough and began to gallop in his chest but we cant seem to do without them can we the man unfolded himself from the stone chair that crouched near the trio of crosses his movements were graceful as he walked over grass and stone on soft leather boots then sat on the opposite side of the grave the wind the chilly snap of it played through his hair fluttered the short red cape tossed regally over his shoulders the light brightened cleared so that everythingstones grass flowersstood out in sharp relief in the distance entwined with the sound of sea and wind came the dance of pipes and flutes not for any real length of time shawn answered kept his gaze level and hoped his heart rate would soon do the same the man laid his hand on his knees he wore hose and a doublet of silver both shot through with threads of gold and on one hand was a silver ring with a brilliant blue stone you know who i am dont you shawn gallagher ive seen pictures judes drawn of you for her book shes clever with a sketch and well and happy now is she wedded and bedded aye shes all of that prince carrick carricks eyes gleamed both power and amusement alive in them does it worry you to converse with the prince of the faeries gallagher well ive no desire to be taken off to a faerie raft for the next century or so as ive things i prefer to do here with his hands still resting on his knees carrick threw back his head and laughed it was a full rich sound seductive engaging some of the ladies in court would enjoy you im certain for your looks and your musical gifts but ive a use for you here on your side and here youll stay so dont trouble yourself he sobered abruptly leaned forward you said gwen spoke to brenna otoole what did she say to her dont you know he was on his feet without seeming to move at all im not permitted in the cottage nor past the borders of its gardens though my home is beneath it what did she say sympathy stirred in shawns heart the question had been more plea than command his heart is in his song thats what she said to brenna i never gave her music carrick said softly he lifted an arm and with a flick of his wrist had the light blazing jewels plucked from the fire of the sun these i gave her these i poured at her feet when i asked her to come with me but she turned away from them from me from her own heart do you know what it is gallagher to have the one you want the only one youll ever want turn from you no ive never wanted like that theres a pity for you for youre not alive until you do he lifted his other hand and darkness fell with silver beams and sparkles fog thin and damp crawled over the ground even so even when she took another at her fathers bidding i gathered the teardrops from the moon and these i spilled into pearls at her feet and still she wouldnt have me and the jewels of the sun the tears of the moon became flowers shawn continued and these she tended year after year what is time to me impatience shimmering now carrick glared at shawn a year a century a year is a century when youre waiting for love emotion swam into carricks eyes before he closed them youre clever with words as well as tunes and youre right once more he snapped his wrist and the sun was back winter pale still i waited and too long i waited to go to her that last time and from the sea through the deep blue depths of it i took its heart and from this hundreds of sapphires i gathered for her and these too i poured at her feet for my gwen all that i had and more for gwen but she told me she was old and it was too late for the first time i saw her weep about it weep as she told me if id once given her the words that were in my heart instead of jewels instead of promises of eternities and riches she might have been swayed to give up her world for mine her duty for love i didnt believe her you were angry shawn had heard the story too many times to count when hed been a boy hed often dreamed of it the dashing faerie prince astride a white winged horse flying to the sun to the moon to the sea because you had loved her and didnt know how else to show it how else to tell her what more can a man do carrick demanded and this time shawn smiled that i cant tell you but casting a spell that has you both waiting over the centuries was probably not the wisest action ive my pride dont i carrick said tossing his head and my temper three times i asked and three times she refused now we wait until love meets love three times and accepts all flaws and virtues sorrows and joys youre clever with words gallagher carrick said and the edgy smile was back ill be displeased if you take so long to make use of them as your brother did my brother three times carrick was on his feet now his eyes dark and brilliantly blue and one is met it was shawns turn to rise and his fists were bunched are you speaking of aidan and jude are you telling me you bastard that you put a spell on them carricks eyes flashed and thunder rumbled in answer you great fool of a man love spells are nothing but wives tales you cant play magic inside the heart for its more powerful than any spell lust you can order up with a wink desire with a smile but love is love and there is nothing can touch it what your brother has with his jude frances is as real as the sun and the moon and the sea youve my word on it slowly shawn relaxed ill beg your pardon then ill take no offense at a brother standing for a brother if i did carrick added with a thin sneer youd be braying like a jackass youve my word on that as well i appreciate your restraint shawn began then tensed up again are you after thinking that ill be the second stage in the breaking of your spell for if you are youre looking in the wrong direction i know where im looking well enough young gallagher its you who doesnt but you will soon enough you will carrick bowed gallantly and vanished just as the skies opened and rain fell in a fury well thats perfect isnt it shawn stood in the driving rain angry and puzzled and very late for work chapter four he was a man who liked to take his time with things to mull and consider to weigh and to measure so thats what he did telling no one for the moment of his meeting with carrick at the side of old maudes grave it concerned him a bit oh not the meeting with a faerie prince so much it was in his blood to accept the existence of magic and in his heart to appreciate it the manner of the discussion was what worried him and the direction it had taken hed be damned if hed find himself picking out or being picked out by a woman and stumbling into love just to fall in line with carricks plans and wishes he just wasnt the marrying and settlingin sort as aidan was he liked women that he did the smell of them the shape of them the heat of them and there were well so many of them out there all fragrant and rounded and warm as much as he tended to write about love in all its delightful and painful varieties on the personal level he preferred to skirt around its edges love the sort that grabbed the heart with both hands and took it over was such a bloody responsibility and life was so pleasant just as it was he had his music and the pub his friends and his family and now the little cottage on the hill that was all his well except for the ghost who didnt appear to want his company in any case so he took his time thinking it all through and going about his business he had fish to fry and potatoes to slice and a great whopping shepherds pie cooking in the oven the sounds of saturday night were beginning to heat up in the pub beyond his kitchen door the musicians from galway that aidan had booked were slipping into a ballad and the tenor was doing a fine job singing about ballystrand since darcy had gotten in her shopping fix with jude in dublin she was in a rare mood all smiles and cooperation orders she called out to him like a song then danced back out with them when hed finished his part why they hadnt had a hard word between them for the whole of the day he thought it might be a record when he heard the kitchen door swing open letting in a flood of music he slid a long slice of golden fish onto a plate ive all but got this last order done here darling and the pie needs only five minutes more id love some of it when its done he glanced over his shoulder and beamed mary kate i thought you were darcy and how are you then sweetheart im fine and well she let the door swing shut behind her and you the same he drained chips and arranged the orders even as he studied her brennas younger sister had blossomed during her university years he thought shed be about one and twenty now and pretty as a picture her hair was a sunnier more golden red than brennas and she wore it in soft waves that fell just past her chin her eyes had a touch of gray over the green and she smudged them up prettily she wasnt much taller than her oldest sister but fuller at the bust and hip and she wore a dark green saturdaynight dress to show off a very attractive figure you look more than fine and well to me he tucked the orders under the wanner then leaned back on the counter so they could have a little chat when did you manage to grow up on me you must be flaying the lads off with sticks on a daily basis she laughed struggling to make the sound mature and female rather than the giggle that wanted to bubble out of her throat the crush shed developed on shawn gallagher was very recent and very strong oh ive been too busy to do much flaying what with working at the hotel and all you like your work there very much you should come round she stepped closer trying to keep her movements both casual and seductive have yourself a busmans holiday and let me treat you to a meal there thats a thought isnt it he gave her a wink that set her pulse skipping then turned to open the oven and check his pie she moved closer that smells wonderful youve such a hand with cooking so many men are bumblers in the kitchen it seems when a man or a woman for that matter bumbles about in the kitchen its usually because they know someone will come along and chase them out and deal with the matter to save the time and annoyance thats wise she all but whispered it with reverence but though youre so good at it ill bet youd like to have someone fix you a meal now and then instead of always fussing with it yourself sure and i cant say as id mind it when brenna walked in the back door the first and only thing she saw was shawn gallagher smiling into her sisters dazzled eyes mary kate her voice was sharp as the tip of a whip and at the sound of it her sister flushed and jerked back what are you doing imjust talking with shawn youve no business being back here in the kitchen wearing your good dress and getting in shawns way shes not in the way used to being scolded by his elders shawn gave mary kate a comforting pat on the cheek and being a man he didnt see the dream clouds come into her eyes but brenna saw them teeth gritted she strode forward took mary kates arm in an iron grip and pulled her toward the door the humiliation of it whisked away the mature sophistication mary kate had worked so hard to display let go of me you gnatassed bully her voice spiked upward as she struggled they very nearly plowed darcy over when she came in while they were going out whats the matter with you youve no right hauling me about im telling ma oh fine you go ahead without breaking stride or loosening her grip brenna yanked her sister into the snug at the end of the bar then shut the door of the little private room you go right ahead you lamebrain and ill be sure to tell her how you were throwing yourself at shawn gallagher i was not freed mary kate sniffed lifted her chin and very meticulously smoothed down the sleeves of her best dress you were all but biting his neck when i walked in whats got into you the mans nearly thirty and you barely twenty do you know what youre asking for when you rub your breasts up against a man that way mary kate merely lowered her gaze to her sisters baggy sweater at least i have breasts it was a sore point a very tender area as brenna had resented the fact that every one of her sisters including young alice mae had more bosom than she did that being the case you ought to have more respect for them than to go shoving them into a mans face i was not and im not a child who needs to be lectured by the likes of you mary brenna otoole she stiffened her spine rolled back her shoulders im a grown woman now ive been to university i have a career oh thats fine then i suppose its past time you jump the first man who catches your fancy and take a wild ride hes not the first whos caught it with a slow smile that made brennas eyes go cold and narrow mary kate tossed her hair but caught it he has and theres no reason not to let him know it its my business brenna and not yours oh youre my business all right are you still a virgin the utter shock in mary kates eyes was enough to reassure brenna that her sister hadnt been throwing her self naked around the corridors of the university in dublin but before she could so much as sigh mary kates temper lashed out who the hell are you thinking you are my romantic dealings are my business youre not my mother or my priest so mind your own you are my own just stay out of it brenna ive a right to talk to shawn or go out with him or anything else i choose and if you think youll go running to ma with tales on my behavior well well just see what she thinks about how i came on you and darcy playing poker with your holy cards that was years ago but brenna felt a little panic at the thought her mother wouldnt consider the years between harmless girls foolishness what i came in on in the kitchen isnt harmless mary kate but it is foolish i dont want to see you hurt i can take care of myself mary kate gave one last toss of her head if you want to be jealous because i know how to attract a man instead of going about trying to be one thats your problem not mine the slice came so fast and true brenna stood frozen hardly realizing that she bled until mary kate stormed out and slammed the door behind her tears stung at her eyes and made her want to slide into one of the old sugan chairs and just let them come she wasnt trying to be a man she was just trying to be herself and shed only wanted to protect her sister to stop her before she did something that would hurt or embarrass her or worse it was all shawns fault she decided the little voice inside her head that whispered differently was ignored it was shawns fault for luring her young and innocent sister into infatuation and she was just going to deal with that right this minute she strode out shaking her head as aidan shifted to lay a hand on her arm and ask her what was the matter when she stalked into the kitchen now her eyes were bright but not with tears it was something closer to murder now why did you go dragging mary kate out like that for brenna we were just he broke off because shed marched up to him the toes of her boots ramming hard against the toes of his and her finger was drilling a hole in his chest you just keep your hands off my sister what on gods green earth are you talking about you know damn well what im talking about you bloody lecher shes barely twenty hardly more than a girl what he shoved her hand away before she could stab straight into his heart what if you think im going to stand by idle while you add her to your string of ladies then youd best keep thinking my mary kate sheer shock came first then he remembered how the young girlno no young woman he correctedhad looked when shed smiled and fluttered her pretty lashes mary kate he said more thoughtfully and with just a hint of a smile a hot red haze filled brennas head you get that gleam out of your eye shawn gallagher or i swear ill blacken both of them because her fists were raised he took a cautious step back and lifted his hands palms out they were well beyond the stage where he could in all conscience wrestle with her brenna calm yourself down i never touched her never thought to never thought of her in the way youre meaning until you mentioned it yourself for christs sake ive known her since she was in nappies well shes not in nappies now no indeed shes not he said with perhaps an unwise hint of approval so he supposed the fist that landed in his gut was his own fault jesus brenna a man cant be faulted for appreciating you do that appreciating from a distance if you make a move in that direction i promise you ill break both your legs it was rare for him to lose his temper so he recognized that he was coming dangerously close to solve the matter he simply cupped his hands under her elbows and lifted her off her feet until their eyes were level both shock and fury fired in hers dont you threaten me if i had thoughts of that nature regarding mary kate then id act on them and that would be between the two of us and not you do you understand that shes my sister brenna began then subsided when he gave her one hard shake and that gives you the right to embarrass her and take punches at me when weve done no more than stand in my kitchen and talk well im standing here talking to you too and have countless times before have i ripped your clothes off and had my way with you he dropped her down on her feet again and stung her beyond belief by merely turning his back you should be ashamed where youve let your mind run he said quietly i the tears were going to come after all she struggled with them swallowed viciously then could only stare through them as darcy came in i have to go was the best she could manage then she fled through the back door shawn darcy dumped empties in the sink and turned to glare at him what the devil did you do to make brenna cry guilt anger and emotions he didnt care to explore waged an ugly war inside him oh just bugger it he snapped ive had enough of females for one night she was mortified and full of misery shed upset insulted and embarrassed two people she cared about deeply shed butted in where it wasnt her business no she didnt believe that it was her business mary kate had been flirting outrageously and shawn had been oblivious typical but he wouldnt have stayed oblivious her sister was beautiful she was sweet she was smart and she was most definitely a young woman in full bloom protecting her hadnt been the mistake but the method had been clumsy and more than a little selfish becauseand she had to face itshed also been a woman defending her territory of which shawn was also oblivious all she could do now was mend her fences shed taken a long walk on the beach to cry it out to think it through to settle herself and to ensure that when she did return home her parents would most likely be tucked into their bed so that she could talk with mary kate alone there was a light on outside shining over the porch and another left burning in the front window she left them both on as she doubted her sister patty would be back yet from her saturday date another wedding she thought as she took off her jacket more fussing and planning and cranky tears over flowers and fabric swatches she couldnt for the life of her understand why a sensible person would want to go through all of that nonsense maureen had been a nervous wreckand had set the entire family on its earbefore shed finally walked down the aisle the previous autumn not that she hadnt looked lovely brenna thought as she hung her cap on the closet hook all glowing and fresh in her billowy white dress and the lace veil their own mother had worn on her wedding day happiness had been like sunbeams all but shining from her fingertips and seeing that wash of love over her sister had made brenna stop for a short while feeling like ten times a fool in her own fussy blue maid of honor gown now if she herself ever took the plungeand since she wanted children what else could she do but marry eventuallysimplicity would be the order of the day a church wedding would be fine as she imagined her mothers heart and her fathers as well would be set on that for all their daughters but shed be damned if she would spend months looking at dresses and searching through catalogs and discussing the pros and cons of roses over tulips or some such shed wear her mothers dress and veil and maybe carry yellow daisies as she had a fondness for them and shed walk down the aisle on her fathers arm to the sound of pipes rather than a fusty old organ and after theyd have a party right here at the house a big noisy ceili where everyone could loosen their ties and relax and what she thought shaking her head outside the door of the room that her youngest sisters mary kate and alice mae shared was she doing dreaming of such things now she slipped into the room stood in the candycoated female scent of it while her eyes adjusted then picked her way over to the lump on the bed nearest the back window mary kate are you awake she is alice maes silhouette of a head and shoulders surrounded by a mass of wild curls popped up and im to tell you that she hates you like poison always will until the day she departs this earth and shes not speaking to you go back to sleep how can i manage that with herself there coming in and burning my ears off with abuse of you did you really shove her out the kitchen at gallaghers then curse at her i did not she did mary kate corrected in a stiff and formal voice and youll kindly tell her alice mae to remove her skinny ass from my bedroom she says youre to remove i heard her for christs sake and im not going well then if shes not going i am mary kate started to get up but found herself pinned at the sound of muffled curses and struggle alice mae eagerly switched on her bedside lamp to watch the show ah youll never best her katie for you fight like a girl did you never listen to anything she taught us just hold still you goose brain how the hell can i apologize when youre trying to bite me hand off i dont want your flaming apology well youre getting it if i have to ram it down your throat annoyed and at her wits end brenna did the simple thing she sat on her sister brennas been crying alice mae with the softest heart in ireland climbed out of bed to pad over to her sister there now gently she kissed both brennas cheeks it cant be as bad as all that darling little mother brenna murmured and nearly started crying again her baby sister wasnt a baby any longer but a slim and pretty girl on the verge of womanhood and that brenna thought with a sigh was a worry for another day go back to bed sweetheart your feetll get cold ill sit here she slid onto the bed and plopped on mary kates legs and help you hold her down if it was enough to make you cry she should at least have the courtesy to listen to you well she made me cry mary kate protested yours were temper tears alice mae said primly using one of their mothers expressions part of mine were too i suppose with a sigh brenna snugged an arm around alice maes shoulders she had a right to be angry with me i behaved badly im so sorry katie for the way i acted and the things i said you are truly tears swam up again into her throat into her eyes i just love you i love you too mary kate sobbed it out im sorry too i said awful things to you i didnt mean them doesnt matter she shifted so that mary kate could scramble up to be held i cant help but worry about you she murmured against her sisters hair i know youre grown up but its not easy to think of you that way with maureen and patty its not so hard maureens barely ten months younger than me and patty came just a year after that but with you two she opened her arms so alice mae could slip in as well i remember when each of you came along so its different somehow but i wasnt doing anything wrong i know brenna closed her eyes youre so pretty katie and i suppose you have to test your skills i just wish youd test them on boys your own age i have with a watery laugh mary kate lifted her head from brennas shoulder and grinned im thinking im ready to move up a level oh mother mary brenna closed her eyes just answer me this do you fancy yourself in love with shawn i dont know she moved her shoulders restlessly i might be its just that hes so handsome like a knight on a white charger and hes like a poet so romantic and deep somehow he looks at you right in the eye a lot of boys aim their eyes a bit lower so you know theyre not thinking about you but about the possibility of getting you out of your blouse have you ever noticed his hands brenna his hands long narrow clever gorgeous theyre an artists hands and you just know looking at them how they might feel if he touched you aye she said on a long breath then caught herself what i mean to say is i can understand how hed stir certain well juices being as hes pretty i just want you to have a care thats all i will there now youre all made up alice mae got up kissed both of them now will you go away brenna so we can all get some sleep brenna didnt sleep much and when she did there were dreams odd and jumbled dreams with moments of clarity that almost hurt the brain a whitewinged horse carrying a rider dressed in silver with his long black hair flying away from a finely sculpted handsome face he flew through the night with stars burning around him higher and higher toward the glowing white ball of a full moon a moon that dripped light like tears tears he gathered like pearls in his bag of shining silver pearls that he poured onto the ground at the feet of lady gwen as they stood outside the cottage on the faerie hill these are the tears of the moon they are my longing for you take them and me but she shed her own tears as she turned away from him denied him refused him and the pearls glowed in the grass and the glowing became moonflowers and it was brenna who picked them by night when their delicate white petals were open she laid them on the little stoop by the cottage door leaving them there for shawn because she lacked the courage to take them inside and to offer the lack of sleep and surplus of dreams left her holloweyed and broody the next day after mass she piddled around taking apart the engine of the old lawn mower changing the points and plugs on her truck tuning it though it didnt need tuning she was under her mothers old car changing the oil when she saw her fathers boots your ma said i should come out here and see whats weighing on your brain before you take it into your head to strip the engine out of this old tank im just seeing to some things need seeing to i see that he crouched down then with a wheezy sigh scooted under the car with her so youve nothing on your mind maybe i do she worked a few moments in silence knowing he would let her gather her thoughts could i ask you something you know you can what is it a man wants mick pursed his lips pleased to see how quick and competent his daughters hands were with a wrench well a good woman steady work a hot meal and a pint at the end of day satisfies most its the first part im trying to figure here what is it a man wants from a woman oh well now flustered and not a little panicked he started to scoot out again ill get your mother youre a man shes not brenna caught his leg before he could escape he was wiry but she had a good grip i want from a mans own mind what it is hes looking for in a woman ah well common sense he said a bit too cheerily thats a fine trait and patience a man needs patience from a woman truth be known time was he wanted her to make him a nice comfortable home but in todays worldand as i have five daughters i have to live in todays worldthats more a giveandtake sort of arrangement a helpmate he grabbed the word like a rope tossed over the edge of a very high cliff with a very narrow ledge that was rapidly crumbling under his feet a man wants a helpmate a lifes companion brenna gave herself a little push so she could sit out beside the car she kept her hand on his ankle for she sensed hed bolt if she gave him the chance i think we both know im not talking about common sense and patience and companionship his face went pink then white im not talking to you about sex mary brenna so get that idea right out of your head im not having a conversation with my daughter about such a matter why i know youve had it or i wouldnt be here would i be that as it may he said and closed his lips if i were a son instead of a daughter we could discuss it youre not so we arent and thats the end of it now he folded his arms as well sitting as he was he made brenna think of an annoyed leprechaun and she wondered if jude had used him as a model for one of her sketches and how am i to get my mind around something if it cant be discussed since mick didnt give a hang about the logic of that at the moment he simply scowled off into the distance if you must talk of such things speak with your mother all right all right never mind then shed go at this from a different angle hadnt he been the very one to teach her there was always more than one way to approach a job of work tell me something else on another topic entirely you could say that she smiled at him patting his leg im wondering if there was something you wanted had wanted for some time what would you do about it if ive wanted it why dont i have it because you havent made any real effort to get it as yet and why havent i he arched his sandy brows am i slow or just stupid brenna thought it over decided he couldnt know hed just insulted his firstborn then she nodded slowly maybe a bit of both in this particular case relieved to have the conversation turn to a safe area he gave her a fierce grin then id stop being slow and id stop being stupid and id take good aim at what i wanted and not dawdle about because when an otoole takes aim by jesus he hits his mark that she knew was true enough and was certainly expected but maybe youre a bit nervous and not quite sure of your skill in this area girl if you dont go after what you want youll never have it if you dont ask the answers always no if you dont step forward youre always in the same place youre right she took his shoulders transferring a little grease from her hands to his shirt as she kissed him soundly youre always right dad and thats just what i needed to hear well thats what a fathers for after all would you mind finishing up this business here she jerked a thumb under the car i dont like to leave it half done but theres something i have to see to thats not a problem he wiggled under the car and delighted hed put his daughters mind at ease whistled while he worked chapter five shawn steeped his tea until he could have danced the hornpipe on its surface then unearthed the dayold scones left over from the pub he had an hour before he had to be at work and he intended to enjoy his little breakfast and read the paper that hed picked up in the village after mass the radio on the counter was playing traditional gaelic tunes and the kitchen hearth was crackling with a fine turf fire for him it was a small slice of heaven before long hed be cooking for the sunday crowds and darcy would be in and out of the kitchen at gallaghers needling him about something or other and this one or that would have something to say to him he imagined jude would slip in for an hour or two and hed make sure she had a good healthy supper he didnt mind any of that not a bit but if he didnt grab a handful of alone time now and again it felt as if his brain would explode he could imagine himself living in the cottage for the rest of his life with the badtempered black cat stretched out by the fire wallowing in quiet morning after quiet morning his mind drifted along with the pipes and flutes flowing from the radio his foot began to tap and then the loud thud at his back door sent his heart shooting straight to his throat the big yellow hound grinned at him her tongue hanging out and her massive paws pressed against the glass shawn shook his head but he got up to go to the door he never minded the otooles betty she was fine company and after a bit of a scratch and stroke she would curl up and settle into her own dreams bub arched his back and hissed but that was routine rather than true annoyance when the patient betty didnt react the cat merely turned his tail up and began to wash out and about are you now shawn said as he let betty in out of a brisk wind that hinted of rain well youre welcome to share a scone and the fire no matter what that devil there says about it but as he started to close the door again he spotted brenna his first reaction was a vague irritation for here was someone who wouldnt settle for a scratch and a stroke but would demand conversation he kept the door open and stood between the wind and the warmth as he watched her a few coils of hair had come loose from her cap and were flying around red as rubies her mouth was set making him wonder if he or someone had done something to annoy her which now that he thought of it was such a simple matter still it was a fine mouth if you took the time to look at it for such a small woman she had a long stride he noted and a purposeful one she was moving as if she had something to do and wanted it over and dealt with quickly knowing the otoole as he did he had no doubt shed let him know just what that was in the shortest of orders she skirted around the little patch of herbs he was thinking of expanding into a full kitchen garden the wind had whipped color into her face so when she lifted her head and caught his eye her cheeks were rosy good day to you mary brenna if youre out for a walk with your dog it seems shes had enough of it shes already sitting under my table here and bubs ignoring her as if she isnt worth his time shes the one who wanted to walk with me sure and if you walked now and then instead of marching as you do she might stay along with you longer come in out of the wind he started to move back as she stepped on the back stoop then paused sniffed smiled you smell of flowers and axle grease or some such thing its motor oil and whats left of the perfume alice mae caught me with this morning its quite the combination and very brenna otoole he thought as she strode past him will you have some tea i will she peeled off her jacket tossed it on a peg then belatedly remembered her cap and removed that as well it always gave him a little jerk in the belly to watch all that hair spill out and down foolish he thought as he moved to the pot he knew it was up there under that ugly cap but each time she let it fall it was a new surprise ive scones no but thanks she wanted to clear her throat as it seemed coated with something thick and hot instead she sat at the table casually kicked back shed decided as shed walked over to ease her way into things so to speak i wondered if you might want me to take a look at your car sometime this week the last i heard it it sounded sad i wouldnt mind if youve time he watched as bub sidled over to rub against brennas legs then leap into her lap the otoole was the only human person the cat had ever fancied shawn decided it was because they were both prickly creatures arent you busy at the house doing the babys room for jude she stroked bubs head so he purred like a freight train ive time enough he sat across from brenna and when betty came begging gave her half a scone hows it coming then and decided it was comfortable after all sitting with her in the warm kitchen with the animals milling about oh its fine its mostly just fiddling jude wants prettying up and the like but in the way of women now shes thinking that when the one rooms fixed and polished the others will look shabby against it shes thinking to spruce up the main bedroom now whats wrong with it brenna lifted her shoulders nothing i can see but between jude and darcy theyve come up with a dozen things new paper for the walls fresh paint for the trim sanding the floors then i just mentioned how nice the view was from the front windows there and judes saying that she longs for a window seat i said if she wanted one it was just a matter of this and a matter of that and before you can blink shes wanting me to do it absently brenna took the second half of the scone and nibbled on it i wager dad and i will be going from room to room in that house and top to bottom shes got the bit between her teeth now must be a nesting sort of thing well if it pleases her and aidan doesnt mind it shawn trailed off imagining how it would be to live in the midst of all that hammering and sawing hed rather be roasted over a slow fire mind it brenna let out a quick snorting laugh he comes in during one of our discussions and just grins like a fool the mans besotted with her i believe she could say well lets just have brenna turn this house around to face the other way and hed never bat an eye she sighed and sipped her tea its lovely to see really the way they are together she was what he was waiting for at brennas puzzled look shawn shook his head sure he was waiting youd only to study on him to see it when she walked into the pub that first night that was it a life change from that instant though neither of them knew it but you did i cant say i knew precisely just that i knew things would change intrigued she leaned forward and what are you waiting for me his eyebrow quirked oh things are fine as they are for me thats a problem with you shawn she jabbed a finger at him you walk the same line until it becomes a rut and never notice for your heads in the clouds in any case if its a rut its mine and im comfortable in it what you need to do is take charge she remembered her fathers words to move forward if you dont move forward youre always in the same place eyes mild and amused he lifted his tea but i like this place im ready for a change for moving forward her eyes narrowed as she studied him and i dont mind being the one who takes charge if thats the way it has to be and what do you have a mind to take charge of this time around you she sat back ignoring his smirk as he sipped tea i think we should have sex he choked spilling hot tea over his hand and onto his paper as he coughed violently she made a quick sound of annoyance and dislodged an irritated bub to get up and thump shawn briskly on the back it cant be that horrible a thought jesus was the best he could manage sweet jesus christ when she plopped into her chair again he simply goggled at her with eyes that continued to water finally he sucked in a breath and blew it out again what kind of thing is that to say its plain speaking determined to hold back both nerves and temper she hooked an arm over the back of her chair the fact is ive a yen for you ive had it for some time this time his mouth fell open and the shock on his face teased her temper closer to the surface what do you think only men can scratch an itch when they have one he didnt of course he didnt but neither did he believe that one just plopped down in someones kitchen and announced it what would your mother think hearing you talk this way brenna inclined her head shes not here is she he pushed the chair back abruptly enough to have betty leap to her feet since none of the thoughts whirling around in his head would settle he just marched to the door i need air for a moment brenna sat where she was she ordered herself to take long slow breaths to wait until she could be calm to be reasonable and mature and clearheaded reason fought against temper for nearly ten seconds before it turned tail and deserted the field the nerve of the man the bloody nerve of him what was she some kind of gargoyle a man couldnt think of cozying up to did she have to strut around in short skirts with her face painted before shawn gallagher took notice the hell with that she was up and out the door and striding into the wind youre not interested thats fine you just say so she caught up with him planted herself in front of him he solved that problem by turning around and walking the other way and was a lucky man she didnt have a weapon in her hands dont you walk away from me you yellow coward dog he shot a look over his shoulder his eyes a ripe glittering blue you ought to be ashamed of yourself he looked away and kept walking he was mortified right down to the bone and god help him he was stirred as well he refused to think of her that way and always had well if a time or two his thoughts had veered off in that direction hadnt he cut them off sharp and fast and thats just what he was going to do now ashamed her voice punched like a fist who the hell are you to decide what should shame me im the man you just offered yourself to as easy as if you were offering me a pint and some crisps shed caught up with him again but his words struck her drained the color from her face is that what you think that its nothing more than that then its you who should be ashamed he could see the hurt in her eyes and it only added to the mass of confusion he found himself tangled in brenna you dont just go around saying lets have sex to a man its just not right but its fine for a man to go around saying it to a woman no i dont think that either its a it should mother of god i cant have a conversation like this with you youre all but family why is it the men i know cant speak of sex as a normal human function and im not family it might have been cowardice he thought but it was also discretion he stepped back from her stay away from me if you dont want to go to bed with me youve only to say that i dont appeal to you in that fashion im not thinking about you in that fashion he took another step back right through the little herb bed youre practically my sister she bared her teeth a sure sign of temper about to snap but im not your bloody sister am i the wind caught her hair sent it streaming so that he wanted to take it in his handssomething he might have done a hundred other times when it would have been a harmless gesture now he was afraid nothing between them would ever be harmless again no youre not but ive thought of youtried to think of youthat way most of my life how do you expect me to just flip that about and i cant do it he said quickly when his blood began to stir again its just not right you dont want to have sex with me thats your business she nodded coolly others do with this she turned on her heel and started to march toward home wait a damn minute he could move fast when he needed to and he had her arm before shed taken three full strides he whirled her around and took as firm a hold on her other arm if you think im going to let you walk off with that in your head youre badly mistaken im not about to have you go off and throw yourself at some man because youre mad at me the flash in her eyes should have been a warning but her voice was so calm so cool he missed it you think far too much of yourself shawn gallagher if i want to be with a man with him ill be youve nothing to say about it it may come as a shock to you but ive had sex before and i like it ill have it again when i please she might as well have plowed the business end of a sledgehammer into his gut youwho thats a matter of my concern she interrupted with a smug look in her eye and none of yours now let go of me ive nothing more to say to you well ive plenty more to say to you but he couldnt think of a thing not with images of brenna wrapped around some faceless man burning into his brain she tossed back her head and her eyes burned once more into his do you want to have sex with me or not truth or lie he was suddenly certain that either answer would send him straight to hell but he thought the lie safer no then thats the end of it humiliated furious she shoved away thenperhaps it was pride or perhaps it was just need but she acted before she thought in one easy leap she was in his arms her legs locked around his waist her mouth fused to his she thought she heard betty barkonce twice three times in rapid succession almost like a laugh she clung like a bur when shawn staggered then bit not so lightly his bottom lip someone moaned she didnt know or care who and she poured everything she had into that fierce and hot mating of lips shed caught him by surprise that was why he didnt shake her loose of course it was it was simply an instinctive reaction to grip that wonderfully tight bottom in his hands then to let them slide up her back and get lost in her hair and that quick intake of breath had been shock it wasnt his fault that the scent and flavor of her assaulted him and because of it made his head spin he had to stop for her sake he had to stop this now in just a moment sooner or later the wind spun around them in chilly ribbons the sun buried itself behind clouds shimmering out fragile light as a soft soft rain began to fall he all but felt the blood draining downward out of his head leaving it empty but for the image of carrying her back inside and up the stairs so he could tumble her into bed and have more then she was shoving him again jumping down through the lust clouding his vision he saw her sharp sneer i thought you should have a sample of what youve turned away while he stood there aroused beyond speech she brushed off the sleeve of her shirt ill have a look at your car when i have a bit of time to spare youd best get down to the village youre running late for work he didnt speak when she strolled away and was still standing in the quiet rain when she and the yellow dog disappeared over the rise youre late aidan said the minute shawn came in the kitchen door of the pub then fire me or get out of my way at the unusually surly response aidan lifted his eyebrows watching as shawn wrenched open the refrigerator and started pulling out eggs and milk and meat its hard to fire a man who owns as much of the business as i do myself shawn banged a pot onto the stove then buy me out why dont you when darcy pushed into the kitchen aidan held up a hand shook his head and motioned her back she didnt look pleased about it but she stepped back out again whats the matter nothings the matter ive things on my mind and work to do ive never known you not to be able to work and run your mouth at the same time ive nothing to say and meat pies to make what the hells with women anyway he demanded spinning away from the stove to scowl at his brother first its one thing then its another and you never know which way theyll be coming at you next oh well then aidans concern melted into amusement he helped himself to tea and leaned back on the counter while shawn muttered and worked we could talk all day and half the night and not come close to solving that particular puzzle tis a thorny one but its more pleasant to have a female causing you problems than to have no female at all dont you think no not at the moment aidan only laughed well which one is it thats causing you grief its no one its nothing its ridiculous hmm not saying aidan sipped and considered must be in the way of a serious matter then easy for you to smile and look smug shawn tossed back with bitter annoyance all cozied up as you are with your jude frances i reckon it is aidan nodded but it wasnt always and you gave me good advice when i was at my own wits end maybe you should take some time and give yourself some on this if you dont want to hear from me i dont want a woman in my life just at the moment shawn muttered and this particular one wont do at all just wont he tried not to think of that wild and wicked kiss or the way brennas compact body had plastered itself to his no it wont he said again then adjusted the fire under the pot of meat filling with a sharp turn of his wrist youd know best what suits and what doesnt ill just say there comes a time when your heads telling you one thing and the rest of you just wont listen a man can be a child when it comes to a woman wanting what he shouldnt have and taking more than he can handle knowing somethings not good for you doesnt stop you from wanting it i wouldnt be good for her calmer now shawn took put a bowl to make the pastry for the pies even if there werent other factors involved i wouldnt be good for her so thats the end of it with the flour and water mixed to a firm dough he covered the bowl and stuck it into the refrigerator ill be making poundies he told aidan while he creamed butter and suet for the next stage of the pastry and ive some samphire that young brian duffy picked for me that ive pickled into jars so well have that tonight as well as it goes nicely with the salmon you bought this morning you tell jude to come over so i can fix her a plate i will thanks shawn he broke off as darcy shoved through the door again looking aggrieved you ask me to come down early then you push me back out the door if the pair of you are going to stand in here and tell your little mens secrets im going back upstairs and do my nails since we dont open for nearly an hour as yet let me pour you a cup darling for ive abused you something terrible aidan gave her a little pat on the cheek then pulled a chair out at the table with a flourish well ill have a cup but i want some biscuits with it she folded her hands on the table after she sat and gave her brother a challenging smile biscuits then aidan got down a tin and set it in front of her i need to talk to both of you as it concerns the pub then youll have to talk while i work shawn retrieved the bowl from the refrigerator and began to roll out the pastry well you were late werent you aidan said easily the man from new york the magee it seems hes interested in the idea of linking the theater hes planning with gallaghers it was my thought to lease him the land long term but hes holding out to buy it outright if we do that we forfeit the land and some of the control we might have how much will he pay darcy asked and bit into a biscuit weve only danced about the terms for the moment but hell meet the price we set im thinking ill need to call ma and dad on this but as the pub is in our hands now the three of us need to decide what we want to do if he pays enough i say sell it to him we dont use it for anything its land shawn said sending darcy a glance as he covered the rectangle of rolledout pastry with the mixture of suet and butter our land its always been ours and itll be money our money ive thought on both ends of that aidan pursed his lips while he turned his cup of tea aroundand around if we dont agree to sell magee could find himself another plot for his project and the theater could be a benefit to the pub if we keep some sort of handle on it he strikes me as a sharp one and one id rather deal with facetoface than over the phone but he says he cant come here now as hes into some other business and cant leave it until its done so send me to new york darcy fluttered her inky lashes and ill charm him into opening his wallet wide aidan let out a quick hoot i dont think charm is what works with this one its a poundsandpence matter to him to my thinking ive a mind to ask dad to take a trip into new york to meet with this magee as dads as sharp as any yank wheelerdealer but before we do that what do we we three here want from this profit darcy said immediately and finished off a biscuit that yes but what in the long term reputation shawn said and aidan looked up at him weve been working around to making gallaghers a center for music over the last few years have our name in the guidebooks dont we as a place for good food and drink and for the music we have or bring in havent you had bands calling you now or the managers of them inquiring about bookings sure and we do well there aidan agreed if this man magee has a mind to expand the entertainment the music in ardmore and bring in more tourists more customers itll add to our reputation shawn folded the pastry into three then sealed the ends before putting it back in the refrigerator to chill but it has to be done the gallagher way doesnt it aidan leaned back in his chair as shawn took potatoes from bin to sink and began to scrub them youre a constant surprise to me shawn aye the gallagher way or no way at all which means traditional understated and irish well have nothing flashy and foolish attached to our pub which means you have to convince him we need to work together shawn added as we know ardmore and old parish and he doesnt and for our input aidan decided well have a percentage of the theater that was my thinkingand what i wanted to pass to dad and have him work the magee toward darcy drummed her fingers on the table so well sell him the land at our price or lease it long term on the condition that we have a part in the building the planning and the profits of the theater simply said aidan gave her a wink she had a cool and sharp brain for business did darcy its the gallagher way aidan rose from the table were agreed then agreed darcy chose another biscuit lets see if this magee can make us rich shawn slipped potatoes into boiling water agreed now the pair of you get out of my kitchen happy to darcy blew shawn a saucy kiss and sailed out already dreaming how shed spend the yanks money because he considered that aidan had it under control shawn didnt give another thought to land deals and building and profits from either he prepared the dishes hed planned and had the kitchen warm and full of scent by the time the pub doors opened he kept up with the orders fell into the easy routine but the music that usually filled his head kept stalling on him hed start to play with a tune while he worked let the notes and the rhythm go their own way then hed be back in the soft rain with brenna wrapped around him and the only music he heard was the hum in his own blood and that he didnt care for she was his friend and a man had no business thinking about a friend in that manner even if shed started it herself hed grown up teasing her as he had his own sister whenever hed kissed her and of course he had it had always been a brotherly peck how the hell was he supposed to go back to that when he knew what she tasted like now when he knew just how her mouth fit to his and how much heat there was inside that small package and just how was he supposed to get rid of this hard hot ball of awareness in his gut an awareness hed never asked for she wasnt his typeno not a bit he liked soft women with female ways who liked to flirt and cuddle and by god women who let him make the moves he was a man wasnt he a man was supposed to romance a woman toward bed not be told to jump into one because she had awhat had she called it a yen an itch hed be damned if hed be anyones itch he told himself he was going to steer well clear of brenna otoole for the next bit of time and that he wasnt going to be looking around to see that ugly cap of hers or to hear her voice every time he walked from the kitchen into the pub still his eyes scanned the crowd and his ears were pricked but she didnt come to gallaghers that sunday evening he did his work and those who sampled it walked home at closing with full bellies and satisfaction when hed put his kitchen to rights and headed home himself his own belly felt empty despite the meal hed had and satisfaction seemed a long way off he tried to lose himself in his music again and spent nearly two hours at the piano but the notes seemed sour somehow and the tunes jarring once as he ran his fingers over the keys shaking his head when the chords gave him no pleasure he felt the change in the air the faintest shimmer of movement and sound but when he looked up there was nothing but his little parlor and the empty doorway leading to the hall i know youre here he said it softly waited but nothing spoke to him what is it you want me to know as the silence dragged on he rose to bank the fire to listen to the whisper of the wind though he was sure he was too edgy to sleep he went upstairs and prepared for bed almost as soon as his head settled on the pillow he drifted into dreams of a lovely woman standing in the garden while the moonlight silvered her pale gold hair the wings of the white horse beat the air then settled as hooves touched ground the man astride it had eyes only for the woman as he dismounted the silver bag he carried sparkled shot light like little sparks of flame at her feet he poured pearls as white and pure as the moonlight but she turned away from him never looked at the beauty of the gems behind the sweep of her nightrobe the pearls bloomed into flowers that glimmered like ghosts in the night and in the night surrounded by those moonwashed flowers shawn reached for the woman the pale hair had turned to fire and the soft eyes became sharp and green as emerald it was brenna he drew into his arms brenna he surrounded with them in sleep where reason and logic have no place it was brenna he tasted chapter six hand me my crooked stick will you darling brenna picked up her fathers levelhe had affectionate names for most of his toolsand walked across the paintsplattered drop cloth to pass it to him the nursery was taking shape and already in brennas mind it was the babys room rather than shawns old one some might not be able to see the potential of the finished project beyond the clutter of tools and sawhorses the missing trim and the snowy shower of sawdust the fact was she loved the messy middle of a project every bit as much as she did the polished end of it she enjoyed the smells and the noises the good healthy sweat brought on by swinging a hammer or hefting lumber now as she stood back to watch her father snug the level onto the vertical length of the shelves they were building she thought how much she liked the little pieces of work measuring cutting checking rechecking until what you had built was the perfect mirror of what had been inside your head right on the money mick said cheerfully then propped his level in the corner without realizing it they stood as a pair hands on hips legs comfortably spread feet planted and as its built by otoole its built to last aye thats the way of it he slapped her companionably on the shoulder now theres a good mornings work here how about we go down to the pub for a bit of lunch then well finish the unit this afternoon oh im not feeling hungry avoiding his eyes brenna walked over to examine the trim theyd already made to frame the shelves you go ahead i think ill just go on and trim this out mick scratched the back of his neck youve not been into gallaghers all the week havent i she knew damn well shed not set foot in the door since saturday last and she calculated shed need another day or two before her humiliation level bottomed out enough for her to stroll in and see shawn no you havent monday it was well i brought something from home and tuesday it was ill eat later then yesterday it was how you wanted to finish something up and would come down when you hadwhich you didnt he angled his head reminding himself she was a woman and women had their ways have you and darcy had a fight no she was grateful hed assumed that and that she didnt have to lie about it i just saw her yesterday when she dropped over here youd gone on to see about the clooneys drainpipe keeping her voice and movements casual she held up the trim i suppose im just anxious to see how this will all look when were done and i had a big breakfast you go on and get your lunch dad if i feel peckish after a while ill go downstairs and raid judes kitchen as you like then his daughters bless them all were often a puzzle to him but for the life of him he couldnt think of a thing that could be wrong with his mary brenna so he winked at her as he pulled on his jacket we get this done the least we can do is lift a pint at the end of the day sure and i imagine ill be thirsty and she would find some excuse to head straight home when he was gone she set the trim in place with the glue gun then pulled nail and hammer from the tool belt slung around her waist she wouldnt brood that shed promised herself and by going about her daily business shed be over whatever these feelings were for shawn soon enough there were plenty of things she wanted she couldnt have a kind and generous heart like alice mae a tidy nature like maureen the patience of their mother another bloody few inches in height she added as she dragged the stepladder over so she could secure the top of the trim she lived without all that didnt she and managed very well she could live without shawn gallagher she could live without men altogether if it came to that and one day shed build her own home with her own hands and would live her own life her own way shed have a herd of nieces and nephews to spoil and no one cluttering up the place with demands and complaints a body couldnt ask for more than that could she she wouldnt be lonely brenna fit the next piece of trim in place precisely matching the edges why she didnt think shed been lonely a single day of her life so why should she start now she had her work and her friends and her family damn it she missed the bastard something fierce thered been hardly a day in her twentyfour years when she hadnt seen him in the pub around the village in his house or her own she missed the conversations the sniping the look and the sound of him somehow she had to quash this wanting of him so they could go back to being friends it was her own fault her own weakness she could fix it with a sigh she rested her cheek on the smooth trim she was good at fixing things the minute she heard footsteps in the hall she jerked herself back and began to hammer busily again oh brenna jude stepped into the doorway and glowed i cant believe how much youve gotten done in just a few days its wonderful will be brenna agreed she climbed down from the ladder to get the next piece of trim dads just gone off to have some lunch but well have the shelves done today i think its coming along fine sos the baby i felt him move last night oh well now brenna turned away from her work thats lovely isnt it judes eyes misted over i cant describe it i never thought id have all these feelings or be so happy have someone like aidan love me why shouldnt you have all that and more i never felt good enough or smart enough or clever enough resting a hand on her belly she wandered over to run a finger down the new trim looking back now i cant see why i felt so well inadequate no one made me feel that way but myself but you know i think i was meant to be that way feel that way so that step by step my life would lead me right here now thats a fine and irish way to look at things destiny jude said with a half laugh you know sometimes i wake up at night in the dark in the quiet with aidan sleeping beside me and i think here i am jude frances murray jude frances gallagher she corrected with a smile that brought out the dimples in her cheeks living in ireland by the sea a married woman with a life growing inside me a writer with a book about to be published and another being written and i barely recognize the woman i was in chicago im so glad shes not me anymore shes still part of you or you wouldnt appreciate who you are now and what you have jude lifted her brows youre absolutely right maybe you should have been the psychologist no thanks all the same id much sooner hammer at wood than at someones head brenna set her teeth and whacked a nail with a few minor exceptions ah jude thought just the opening shed been hoping for and would my brotherinlaw be at the top of that list of exceptions at the question brennas hand jerked missing the mark and bashing her thumb with the hammer bloody buggering hell oh let me see is it bad brenna hissed air through her teeth as pain radiated and jude fluttered around her no its nothing clumsy flaming idiot my own fault you come down to the kitchen put some ice on it its not much of a thing brenna insisted shaking her hand down jude took her arm and pulled her toward the door its my fault i distracted you the least i can do is nurse it a little its just a bump but brenna let herself be towed down the stairs and back to the kitchen sit down ill get some ice well it wont hurt to sit a minute shed always been easy in the gallagher kitchen little had changed in it since shed been a girl though jude was adding her mark here and there the walls were creamcolored and looked almost delicate against the dark wood that trimmed them the windowsills were thick and wide and jude had set little pots of herbs along them to catch the sun the old cabinet with its glass front and many drawers that ran along the side wall had always been white and comfortably shabby now jude had painted it a pale pale green so it looked fresh and pretty and somehow female the good dishes were displayed behind the glassdishes the gallaghers had used for holidays and special occasions they were white with little violets edging the plates and cups the small hearth was of cobbled stone and the carved fairy that brenna had given jude for her thirtieth birthday guarded the fire that simmered there it had always been a home brenna thought and a fine warm one now it was judes this room suits you brenna said as jude carefully wrapped an icefilled cloth around brennas injured thumb it does yes jude beamed not noticing that she was already picking up the rhythm of irish speech i only wish i could cook you do fine its never going to be one of my strengths thank god for shawn she walked to the refrigerator hoping to keep it casual he sent some soup home with aidan last night potato and lovage since you didnt go to the pub for lunch with your father ill heat some up for both of us she started to refuse but her stomach was threatening to rumble so she gave in thanks for that i made the bread jude poured soup into a pan and set it on to warm so i wont guarantee it brenna eyed the loaf with approval when jude took it out of the bread drawer brown soda bread is it i favor that it looks lovely ù i think im getting the hang of it why do you bother when youve only to have shawn send some over for you i like it the process of it mixing and kneading and rising jude set the slices shed cut on a plate its good thinking time too my mother always says so but for me id rather take a nice liemedown to do my thinking you go to all that trouble to cook something and brenna snatched a slice from the plate bit in gone she said with a grin watching it go is one of the cooks pleasures jude went to the stove gave her heating soup a stir youve had a fight with shawn and not one of your usual squabbles i dont know that it was really a fight but i cant say it was usual itll pass jude dont worry yourself over it i love you both of you i know you do its a bit of nothing i promise saying no more jude got out bowls and spoons how much she wondered did one friend interfere in the business of another where was the line then sighing she decided there simply wasnt one you have feelings for him brennas nerves jittered at the quiet tone well sure and i have feelings for the man weve been in and out of each others pockets all our lives which is only one of the many reasons he irritates me so i want to bash him with a hammer more often than not she smiled when she said it but judes face remained sober you have feelings for him jude repeated that have nothing to do with childhood or friendship and everything to do with being a woman attracted to a man i brenna felt the color rush hot to her cheeksthe curse of a redhead well thats not lies trembled on her tongue and simply refused to fall oh hell she rubbed her uninjured hand over her face then stopped abruptly fingers spread around eyes that went suddenly wide and appalled jesus mary and joseph it shows before jude could answer brenna was up pacing knocking the heels of her hands against the sides of her head moaning out curses ill have to move away leave my family i can go to the west counties i have some people on my mothers side in galway no no thats not far enough ill have to leave the country entirely ill go to chicago and stay with your granny until i get on me feet shell take me in wont she she spun back teeth gritted once again as jude ladled soup into bowls and chuckled oh well now maybe you find this a laughing matter jude frances but to me its dire business im humiliated in front of everyone who knows me and all because ive an itch for some prettyfaced softbrained man youre not humiliated and im sorry to laugh but your face well choking back another chuckle jude set the soup bowls on the table then patted brennas shoulder sit down take a deep breath you dont have to leave the country when brenna stood her ground jude took the deep breath herself i dont think it shows not obviously but im used to watching people analyzing and on top of it i think really that when youre in love youre more tuned to emotions something i dont know ripples in the air when the two of you are in the same room after a while i realized it wasnt the usual affectionate animosity that friends and family sometimes have but something more well elemental brenna waved a hand in dismissal shed hooked on to only one point it doesnt show no not unless you look really close now sit down all right then she blew out a breath now as she sat but she didnt feel completely relieved if darcyd noticed shed have said something she wouldnt be able to resist needling at me about it so if its just you and shawn that know i can manage that youve told him it seemed time i did without much interest brenna spooned up soup ive been having these urges so to speak for a long time where hes concerned thinking on it just recently it seemed to me that if we just went to bed together a time or two id get it out of my system jude set down her own spoon with a clatter you asked him to go to bed with you i did and youd think id smashed him in the balls with my wrench so thats the end of that jude folded her hands leaned forward im going to pry brennas lips twitched oh you havent started that yet not nearly what exactly did you say to him i said plain enough that i thought we should have sex and whats wrong with that she demanded gesturing with her spoon youd think a man would appreciate clear honest speaking hmmm was all jude could think of i take it shawn didnt appreciate it hah im like a sister to him he says and how i should be ashamed ashamed she repeated firing up then he tells me right out he doesnt want me in that way so i jumped him you jude coughed and picked up her spoon again she needed something to soothe the tickle in her throat you jumped him aye planted a kiss on him that he wont forget anytime soon and the man didnt exactly fight me off like his life depended on it she tore a slice of bread in two shoved half in her mouth after i was done with that i left him standing there looking shellshocked i imagine he kissed you back sure he kissed me back she tossed that off with a shrug men are predictable that way even if a woman isnt to their taste theyre likely to take a sample arent they um yes i suppose unsure of her ground jude went back to hmmm now im steering clear of him for a while brenna continued as i cant decide if im more angry or embarrassed about the matter hes been very distracted the last few days has he now and shorttempered brenna found her appetite coming back im delighted to hear it i hope he suffers the donkeys ass if i wanted a man to suffer i think id want to watch him while he did it jude swallowed more soup but thats just me i suppose theres no harm in stopping by the pub after work today brenna sent jude a quick and wicked grin thanks oh anytime brenna went through the rest of her workday whistling her mood bright and her hands nimble she supposed it wasnt very charitable of her to take such pleasure in the idea of anothers unhappiness but she was human after all when she walked into gallaghers she was more cheerful than shed been in days it was early enough to be quiet with only a scattering of the tables occupied far from being worked off her feet darcy was standing at the bar talking to big jack brennan you go on and sit with your friends she told mick when she spotted a couple of his cronies already planted by the fire with pints ill just sit at the bar and catch up with darcy ill do that and youll have her bring me a pint wont you darling i will brenna angled left and slid onto a stool beside jack well now heres a stranger aidan automatically put a pint and a glass under the taps as he knew the preferences of his regulars where is it youve been hiding yourself mary brenna in your own home you have a look at your babys room when you get there and let me know what you think that ill do we left your bride sighing and sniffling over the shelves weve just finished even as she spoke brenna had one eye on the kitchen door and how are you jack im fine and well brenna and you the same youre not falling in love with our darcy here now are you he blushed like a ripe beet jack had a face as big as the moon and shoulders wide as county waterford and he never failed to color like a schoolboy when teased about women ive more sense than that shed squash my heart like a bug ah but youd die a happy man darcy told him dont listen to her jack aidan worked the taps as he spoke expertly building the guinness for shes as fickle and flighty as they come all true darcy agreed with a careless and beautiful laugh im holding out for a rich man one wholl set me on a pedestal and strew jewels at my feet but in the meantime she played her fingertips over jacks flushed face i enjoy the attention of big and handsome men ah go on and take my father his pint before our jack here loses all power of speech brenna cocked her boot on her knee and lifted the glass aidan passed her youre safe with me jack darling youre as pretty as she is dont be saying such things loud enough for herself to hear you or shell skin us both touched and amused she kissed his cheek and shawn came through the door it would have been comical she decided and was a pity that no one noticed but herself the way he stopped dead in his tracks stared then jolted when the door swung back and slapped him in the ass secretly delighted she merely lifted her eyebrows and left her hand cozily on jacks broad shoulder good evening to you shawn brenna so much was going on inside him he couldnt separate one sensation from the other he knew one was irritation another was discomfort and damn it another altogether was straight lust that had no business being there but the rest of it was just a mess she sipped her beer watched him over the foam i had some of your soup at lunch today with jude it had a fine flavor weve ciste on the menu tonight mrs laury butchered some pigs this week well thatll stick to your ribs wont it jack that it will are you staying to eat then brenna no im for home after my guinness if you change your mind you can have a meal with me ive a fondness for ciste and shawn makes it well hes a hand in the kitchen isnt he she smiled when she said it but the expression in her eyes was sharp and derisive do you cook at all jack sausage and eggs i can manage and i can boil a potato being jack he took her question seriously and furrowed his brow as he thought through his culinary repertoire i can make a sandwich well enough when i have the fixings about though thats not the same as cooking when it comes to it thatll get you by she gave jacks shoulder a friendly pat you and me well leave the cooking for the likes of shawn here aidan will you be needing me at all this weekend for working the pub i could use your hands on saturday night if you can fit it in the band weve booked is a popular one and your mary kate let us know theres a tour group coming into the cliff hotel for saturday as well im thinking some of them will wander into gallaghers ill come at six then she drained her glass slid off the stool will you be stopping in the pub here on saturday jack i will yes i like the band ill see you then she glanced back noted her father was deep into talk with his friends an hour more she calculated then called to him im for home dad ill tell ma youll be along by and by darcy you see that the mans up and out within the hour now wont you ill show him the door darcy carted a tray full of empties to the bar ive a date tuesday next with a dubliner who passed through here hes taking me into waterford city for dinner why dont you get yourself a man and come along i might do that better ill ask the dubliner to bring a friend all right brenna didnt have any interest in having dinner in waterford with strangers but it was so satisfying to plan it with shawn listening ill just stay with you after as i expect well get in late hes picking me up at six prompt darcy called out as brenna started to the door so be here on time and looking like a female jack sighed into his beer when brenna strode out she smells of sawdust he said more to himself than otherwise its very pleasant what are you doing sniffing at her shawn demanded jack just blinked at him what ill be back in a minute he shoved up the passthrough on the bar let it fall with a bang that had aidan cursing him then rushed through the door after brenna wait a minute mary brenna just a damn minute she paused by the door of her truck and for one of the first times in her life felt the warm glow of pure female satisfaction stream through her a fine feeling she decided a fine feeling altogether schooling her face to show mild interest she turned is there a problem then yes theres a problem what are you doing flirting with jack brennan that way she let her eyebrows rise up under the bill of her cap and what business might that be of yours id like to know a matter of days ago youre asking me to make love with you and i turn around and youre cozying up to jack and making plans to have dinner with some dubliner she waited one beat then two and and flustered and furious he glared at her and its not right she only lifted a shoulder in dismissal then turned to open the truck door its not right he repeated grabbing her again and turning her to face him im not having it so you said in clear terms i dont mean that oh well if youve decided youd like to have sex with me after all ive changed my mind i havent decided he broke off staggered changed your mind i have kissing you wasnt altogether what i thought it would be so you were right and i was wrong she gave him a deliberately insulting pat on the cheek and thats the end of it the hell it is he trapped her against the truck quickly and firmly enough to have both excitement and annoyance rising inside her if i want you ill have you and thats the end of it meanwhile i want you to behave yourself she couldnt speak she was certain that if she tried she would strangle on the words so she did the only thing she could think of she plowed her bunched fist into his gut it cost him some breath and the color that temper had brought to his face drained completely but he held his ground the fact that he did that he could when she knew she had a solid punch sent another trickle of excitement sliding through her well talk about this brenna in private thats fine ive plenty to say satisfied that hed made his point he stepped back you can come by the cottage in the morning seething she climbed into the truck slammed the door i could she told him as she started the engine but i wont i came to you once and you spurned me i wont be back he stepped back again to save his toes from being run over if she wouldnt come to him he thought as she drove away hed find another way to get her alone so they could come to terms he supposed it was in private chapter seven a body would think the woman had never jumped into his arms and kissed him senseless a man could start believing himself delusional and that shed never sat across from him at his own kitchen table and suggested they have a romp in bed but she had done both of those things he knew it because every time he came within a foot of her the muscles in his belly knotted shawn didnt care for it not a bit no more than he cared for how easy and bloody normal she was acting as they fell into the saturday night routine at the pub every time he came out of the kitchen for one reason or another shed shoot him that look of hers that was caught somewhere between a sneer and a smile it made him wonder why hed ever enjoyed seeing that selfsame expression on her face in the past brenna worked the set of taps at one end of the long chestnut bar while aidan manned those at the other end she talked with the customers laughed with old mr riley who was in the habit of asking every pretty young thing to be his bride if the musicians played a tune she was fond of she joined in the chorus she did everything shawn noted that shed done on a hundred other saturday nights when the pub was crowded and the music was fine it should have been a reliefhe told himself it wasthat the two of them appeared to be back on even and familiar ground again it irritated the living hell out of him she wore jeans and a baggy sweater hed probably seen that same sweater on her twenty times or more so why was it that it had never made him think of the trim little body under it until now the kind of body that was quick and agile and strong with breasts small and firm as peaches just before they ripen distracted he burned his fingers on the hot oil as he scooped out chips and cursed himself for thinking even for a minute of sliding his hands up and over that body those breasts that had been her plan he decided the devious witch shed planted the seed in his brain stirred up his loins as he was only a man after all and now she could torment him just by being in the same vicinity well two could play this game rather than waiting for darcy to pick up the orders he carried them out himself just to show brenna otoole that she didnt trouble him in the least the perverse creature didnt even glance his way as he swung into the pub and wound his way through the crowd to the tables no just to annoy him he was sure she pulled taps and continued a conversation with a couple of tourists as if they were all the best of mates and this was their saturday night reunion she wore her hair down tied back with a bit of black ribbon in the muted light it burned like fire he wished he could keep his mind off her hair he wished he had his hands in it hello shawn mary kate caught up with him just as he was serving the clooney family their basket of chips she angled as close as she dared hoping he would like the new scent she was trying out busy tonight the musics lively i think weve the whole of your tour group here theyre having a wonderful time of it she pitched her voice over the music struggling to keep it sexy as the band kicked into a rousing rendition of maloney wants a drink but id rather hear you play he flashed her a grin as he tucked the empty tray under his arm you can hear that for free anytime you like these galway lads have a spark to them he glanced toward the front booth admired the way the fiddler handled his bow are you here with your family then mary kates ego took a nosedive why did he always think of her as one of the otoole girls she was a grown woman now no im not with anyone it wasnt a lie she assured herself she may have come in with her parents and alice mae but she wasnt with them thats fine playing he murmured forgetting her in his pleasure with the music quick and clever and bright its no wonder theyve made a name for themselves the tenors the strongest voice but he knows how to blend in without overpowering his bandmates he wondered what they would do with one of his own ballads and was brought back to the moment only when mary kate touched his arm you could make a name for yourself too her eyes were full of dreams when they met his a bigger one a brighter one he avoided answering or thinking too deeply on the possibilities by giving her a light kiss on the cheek youre a darling girl mary kate id best be back to the kitchen hed no more than let the door swing shut behind him when it burst open again and brenna charged through i told you to stay away from my sister what she planted herself in the stance he knew very well signaled a fight didnt i stand here a week ago and tell you what the situation was as regards my mary kate she had of course and shawn admitted as he shoved a hand through his hair he hadnt given it another thought i just had a conversation with her brenna nothing more than that it was as harmless as tickling a baby shes not a baby and you kissed her oh jesus christ on the cross id kiss my own mother in the same fashion the germans are hungry darcy said brightly as she carted in a tray loaded with empty plates and bowls theyre after three servings of your stew and two of the fish youd think the lot of them hadnt eaten since they left their homeland dumping the dishes she measured the weight in the pocket of her apron with a drum of her fingers but bless them they tip often and they tip well and only once did one of them give my bum a pat when she started to deal with the dishes brenna took a steadying breath darcy would you mind seeing to those later i need a word with shawn in private darcy glanced around lifted an eyebrow she could see it now the tension running in waves from one to the other as far as she was concerned the two of them werent happy unless they were spatting but this seemed different is something the matter the otoole thinks ive designs on mary kate and is warning me off he wrenched open the refrigerator to take out the fish he needed but not before he saw brenna flinch i dont because she spoke without heat without her usual bite shawn looked back at her but shes designs on you well shes a crush on him to be sure darcy confirmed not that hed ever notice all i did was talk to her uncomfortable with two pairs of female eyes staring at him with both pity and disgust shawn turned on the fire to heat the oil next time ill just give her a shove out of my way and keep going will that do for you darcy sighed youre such a knucklehead arent you shawn she gave brennas arm a quick supportive squeeze then left them alone im sorry i came barreling in and snapped at you apologies came rarely off brennas tongue and had that much more impact because of it everythings so new for mary kate just now with university behind her and her just getting her feet wet in her career she looks at maureen all flushed with being newly married and our patty so excited about her own wedding coming this spring and she helpless she fluttered her hands she was so bad at words when they mattered most she thinks shes all grown up you see and ready for everything in her life to begin inside her hearts still a girls and romantic with it and its tender shawn you could bruise it i wont youd never mean to she smiled now but it didnt reach up into her eyes as it usually did you dont have it in you id rather you were mad at me than sad i dont like seeing you unhappy brenna but when he reached out to touch her hair she shook her head and backed away no now youll say something kind and sweet and im too much in the mood for it weve both work to do i think about you in a way i didnt he said his voice soft and quiet as she turned to go and i think about you often she felt her heart shiver and took a breath to steady herself well its a fine time you pick to bring up the subject but then youve never had the gift of timing except for your music i think about you often he repeated he walked toward her pleased when her eyes went wary what are you about she was flustered and she was never flustered by a man certainly not by shawn she could handle him of course she always had always would but she couldnt seem to make her legs move now wasnt this interesting he mused as he closed in she looked nervous and color was rising in her cheeks i never used to think about doing this he slid a longfingered hand around to cup the back of her neck eased her a step closer all the while watching her eyes now im thinking about it all the time he played his mouth over hers a teasing whispering devastating slide of lips she should have known he would kiss like this if he set his mind to it slow soft sexy so a woman could barely keep a thought in her head the hand at her neck squeezed and released squeezed and released and sent pulses dancing warmth washed into her filling her throat her breasts her belly loosening her knees until she felt herself begin to sway into him into the seductive rhythm of her own pulse that he set with no more than his mouth she trembled he absorbed the first glorious sensation of having brenna otoole tremble against him then immediately wanted to feel it again but he gave way when she braced a hand on his shoulder to stop him you took me by surprise when you kissed me last week he told her while her eyes gradually cleared i seem to have done the same to you now pull yourself together girl she ordered herself this wasnt the way to handle the man then were in the way of being even his eyes narrowed in speculation so is it a contest then brenna more at ease with the faint irritation in his voice than shed been with the smooth seductive tone she nodded ive always thought of it so but in the fortunate way of sexual matters we can both win ive customers to serve her lips still tingled from his as she walked out of the kitchen maybe well both win he murmured but i dont think ill be playing this your way brenna my darling pleased with himself he went back to his stove to make the german tourists happy the sun decided to shine on sunday and the sky was clear and blue the smudge of gray far away to the east told him the storm hovering over england would likely put in an appearance by nightfall but for now it was a fine fresh day for walking the hills he thought if he happened to wander over to the otooles hed get himself invited in for some tea and biscuits and hed enjoy seeing how brenna would react to having him sitting in her kitchen after what had passed between them the night before he thought he understood what was in her head she was a woman who liked to get things doneher way step by step and at a smart pace for some reason shed set her sights on him and he was starting to like the idea quite a little bit if it came to that but he had his own way of getting things done one step might not follow the other in such a straight line and he preferred a meandering pace after all marching headon you missed the little things that happened all around you he was one for treasuring the little things like the clear call of the magpie or the shine of the sun on a particular blade of grass and there the way the cliffs stood strong against the incessant beat of the sea he could wander for hours and did when he forgot himself he was well aware that most people thought he got nothing done during his dreaming time and they smiled indulgently but in truth he got everything done the thinking the restoring the watching and because he was watching he didnt see mary kate until she hailed him and ran in his direction its a fine day for walking to be on the safe side he tucked his hands into his pockets warmer than its been in days she smoothed her hair in case her little dash had mussed it i was just thinking i might walk down to your cottage then here you are my cottage shed changed out of her sunday dress he noted but she wore what looked to be a new sweater and she had on earrings scent fresh lipstick all the little lures women use he was suddenly sure that brenna had been right about the situation and it terrified him i was hoping to take you up on what you said last night last night about how i could listen to your music anytime i love hearing you play your tunes ah i was just coming over to your own house to speak with brenna about a matter shes not home deciding he needed a little encouragement mary kate slid her arm through his something needed to be fixed at maureens so off she went and ma and patty with her a word with your father then hes not at home either he took alice mae down to the beach to look for shells but youre welcome to come knowing it was bold she let her hand run up and down his arm as they walked the feel of musclea mans arm not a boyshad her pulse dancing ill be happy to fix you some tea and a bite to eat thats kind of you he was a dead man he caught sight of the otoole house as they topped the hill though thin smoke plumed from the chimney it had the general air of being empty brennas lorry wasnt parked in the street the dog was nowhere to be seen apparently even betty had deserted him in his hour of need the only choice left was a quick and cowardly retreat what was i thinking he stopped short and clapped a hand to his forehead im supposed to be helping aidan at the house slipped my mind as quickly as he could manage he untangled his arm gently nudging her hand away as he might a puppy who was inclined to nip down girl things are always slipping my mind so i dont suppose hell be surprised that im late well but if youre already late she leaned toward him nearly into him in a gesture that even a distracted coward such as himself recognized as an invitation hell be looking for me this time he patted her on the head as he might a child and saw from the pout beginning to form that shed taken it as hed meant it ill stop in for tea sometime soon give my best to your family now wont you he was twenty strides away before he let out a relieved breath and what he wondered was this with the otoole girls all of a sudden now instead of a quiet walk perhaps a cup of tea in a friendly kitchen and a little time alone in the cottage working on his music he was honorbound to go into the village and find something to do at aidans what are you doing here aidan asked him its a long and complicated story shawn glanced around cautiously as he stepped inside is jude at home shes upstairs with darcy our sisters having some trouble deciding what to wear to drive this dubliner shes seeing crazy that should be keeping them busy for a while good ive had enough of women lately he explained when aidan looked at him questioningly now theres the handsome dog he bent down to give finns head a scratch growing into his feet this one is and fast he is that and goodnatured with it arent you lad finn turned adoring eyes on aidan and his tail swished with such enthusiasm that it drummed from shawns knees to the table by the door he grows much more hell be knocking lamps off the table with that whip of his can you spare a beer i can spare two one for each of us women aidan continued as they made their way into the kitchen as we were on the subject are always going to be giving you grief of one sort or another its that pretty face of yours amused shawn sat at the table while aidan got two bottles of harp and opened them he laid a hand absentmindedly on finns head when the dog bumped under it you did fair in the lady department yourself as i recall and youre not nearly so pretty as i am but im smarter with a grin aidan passed his brother the bottle i held out for the best of them i cant argue with that after tapping his bottle to aidans shawn took a long appreciative swallow well then it wasnt to talk about women that i came by but to get away from them for a time if youve a mind to discuss business ive some of that he got down a tin of crisps set it between them before he sat i had a call from dad this morning he and ma send their love he was going to ring you as well i was out walking i suppose i missed them well the immediate news is hes off to new york next week to meet with the magee since his dog was looking at him hopefully and jude wasnt around to disapprove he tossed finn a crisp he wants a feel for the man before we go any further on this deal no one sizes a man up quicker and more true than dad aye and in the meantime magee is sending his man here to do some sizing up of his own his name is finkle and hell be staying at the cliff hotel dad and i agree we wont discuss hard monetary terms with finkle until weve got a better handle on this magee you and dad would know best about such matters but but it seems to me that one of the handles were looking to grip would be what well make out of the deal in pounds yes but also in how this project of magees will enhance the pub thats a fact so the trick would be shawn said after a contemplative sip of beer how to gain information without giving so much of it in return dadll be working on that in new york which doesnt stop us from working on it here as easy a mark as aidan shawn fed finn another crisp what we have in our happy little family aidan is the businessmanshawn tipped his beer toward his brotherthat would be you so it would and shawn aimed a finger at the ceiling upstairs we have two lovely women one gracious and charming has a shyness of manner that masks to those who dont look close enough a clever brain the other flirtatious and beautiful has a habit of wrapping men around her finger before they realize she has a steel spine aidan nodded slowly go on then theres me the brother who doesnt have a brain cell working in his head for business the affable one who pays no attention to money matters well youre an affable enough sort shawn but youve as good a head for business as i do no that i dont but ive enough of one to get by enough of one to know itll be you finkle concentrates on he gestured absently toward aidan with his beer as he thought it through and while hes doing that the rest of us can surround him and poke in so to speak in our own fashions i think by the time the deed is done well know what we need to know then you make your deal aidan and gallaghers will be the finest public house in the country the place they speak of when they speak of irish hospitality and music aidan sat back his eyes dark and sober is that what you want shawn its what you want thats not what im asking you before shawn could lift the bottle again aidan gripped his wrist held it firm enough that shawn cocked his head in question is it what you want gallaghers is ours shawn said simply it should be the best after a moment aidan released him then restless rose i never figured you for staying where would i go why would i i always thought thered come a day when youd figure out what you wanted from your music then youd go to get it i have what i want from my music as the crisps were no longer coming his way finn settled under the table at shawns feet it pleasures me why have you never tried to sell it why have you never taken yourself off to dublin or london or new york to play in the pubs there so it can be heard its not ready to sell it was an excuse but all he had the rest at least could be plain truth and ive no yearning to go to dublin or london or new york aidan or anywhere to sing for supper this is my place its where my heart is he settled back absently rubbing finns side with his foot ive no wanderers thirst inside me like you had or like darcy and ma and dad i want to see what i know when i wake in the morning and hear sounds im familiar with it centers me you see he went on while aidan studied him to know the names of the faces around me and to be home no matter where i look youre the best of us aidan said quietly and made shawn laugh with both surprise and embarrassment well now theres a statement for the ages you are youve the heart that draws in the land here and the sea and the air and holds it with respect and with love i couldnt do that until id gone off to see all i could see and when i left shawn im telling you i didnt think id be back not to stay but thats what you did what youve done because i came to realize what youve always known this is our place in the world by rights if we went by heart instead of birth order youd head the pub and run it into the ground within a year thanks but no you wouldnt though i havent always given you the credit you deserve shawn turned the harp over in his hand eyed it thoughtfully and sent the dog at his feet a wink just how many of these bottles did the man drink down before i got here finn my lad i havent been drinking i want you to understand my feelings and thoughts before things change on us again and they will change if we make this deal theyll change but well be the ones guiding the direction of it itll take more of your time hed thought of that and what use he would make of the time it took ive time to spare and darcysshe wont be pleased with that no shawn let out a breath but shell be pleased enough with the baubles and trinkets she can buy with the profits and shell stand for gallaghers aidan shawn met his brothers eyes you can give her credit for that at least till she bags that rich husband after she does and she deigns to visit with those of us who remain peasants you could still ask her to put on an apron and pick up a tray and have her bash me head in with it but aidan nodded understanding aye shed lend her hand if the need was there i know it dont take this weight all on yourselfthe deal and the worry and the work of it shawn told him theres three of uswell four now that weve our jude frances gallaghers is family well do well with this business aidan ive a good feeling about it its good you came by im clearer in my head than i was well then that should be worth one more beer before i shawn broke off as he heard voices light and female oh blessed mary theres the women im off ill use the back door next time ill get you drunk and pry out whats got you so spooked over women if i dont figure out what to do about it in the next little while ill tell you with this shawn escaped out the back door chapter eight the tune waltzing its way through shawns head put him in the best of moods while the smoke from his pots and pans drifted up and the oil he was heating began to sizzle he let it play through bar to bar then a key change for a bit of drama the words werent clear to him yet but they would come it seemed to him a summer song full of light and the thinking of it the listening to it inside his head chased the winter gloom away the shared beer and conversation in aidans kitchen the day before had settled him down which was just where shawn preferred to be at the moment he couldnt understand why hed gotten so nervy about matters little mary kate was just going through one of those phases girls went through and it would pass as quickly as it had reared up hed gone through phases himself hadnt he he could remember clearly mooning and sighing over pretty colleen brennan when hed been about eighteen fortunately hed never worked up the courage to do anything but moon and sigh as pretty colleen brennan had been two and twenty at the time and engaged to marry tim riley hed gotten over it in a matter of weeks then had sighed over another pretty face that was the way of things after all eventually of course hed done more than sigh and had discovered the rare wonder of having a woman naked under him and that was a fine thing still he took care whom he touched and how he touched so that when the time was over each could walk away happy with the experience he wasnt a man to take the act of love as a casual matter which he supposed was why he hadnt participated in that rare wonder for some months now and that he imagined was most likely why the otoole had set his glands to stirring not that he was at all certain as yet if he intended to do anything about it no brenna was a puzzle and one he thought it might be best to leave unsolved a little time he decided a little care and the two of them would be back on their old familiar ground if they could just let things be his mind would be quiet again and life would slide along the way it was meant to all he had to do was forget how stimulating it was to have his mouth on hers he checked on the crubeens he was boiling with cabbage and jacketed potatoes he added a bit more marjoram to the broth to flavor it up a trick hed learned by experimentation he particularly liked to present the dish when there were yanks in the pub their varying reactions to being served pigs trotters was always an amusement to him jude was doing the waitressing tonight and he didnt think shed disappoint him meanwhile he had fish to fry for the two hikers from wexford he slid the haddock into the oil then glanced up as the back door opened instantly his spine stiffened his eyes narrowed and a prickly ball bounced around in his gut smells good brenna said easily and sniffed the air would that be crubeens youre doing there i doubt well have such fare in waterford city she was wearing paint and sparkly things at her ears and for gods sake a dressone that didnt leave the matter of curves to a mans imagination and showed a great deal of slim well muscled leg what are you doing done up like that having dinner with darcy and her dubliners shed rather much rather pull up a chair at the table snag a portion and tuck into the crubeens but shed given her word and that was that youre going out with a man youve never laid eyes on darcy has and id best go up and drag her away from her mirror or shell primp another hour and ill never get my dinner just a damn minute his tone alone would have stopped her it was very sharp and unshawnlike but even before she could turn back he had her arm well whats lit into you then perfume too he said in disgust as he got a good heady whiff of her scent i shouldve known it well you can just turn straight around and go back home im not having you go off dressed like this temper would have snapped out would have bitten him on the neck but it couldnt get through the thick wall of shock youre not having it dressed like what im not no and you know very well dressed like what its surprised i am that your mother let you out of the house this way im twentyfour if youve forgotten my mother stopped approving my choice of attire some years ago and its surely no business of yours what im wearing im making it my business now go home and wash that stuff off your face ill do nothing of the sort the fact was shed used the lipstick and so forth only because she knew darcy would have slathered twice as much on her if shed shown up without it but there was no reason to mention that especially since that temper was busily gnawing through the shock fine then ill do for you here and now he hauled her up under one arm ignoring her shrieked curse and the fist that swiped at his temple and carted her toward the sink he had a vision through the black haze of his fury of dumping her in headfirst and turning the water on full and ice cold he had his hand on the tap when jude rushed in shawn the stunned and somehow maternal tone stopped him but barely what in the world are you doing put brenna down this minute im doing what needs to be done look how shes flaunted herself up jude and all to go out with some strange man tisnt right between curses brenna managed to turn her head and try for a good chomp out of his torso but she only got a mouthful of flannel she threatened to do something so particularly vile and vicious to his manhood that shawn cautiously tightened his grip well well jude thought and struggled not to be amused put her down she said quietly you should be ashamed of yourself i should she might as well be naked as wearing this dress and i should be ashamed brenna looks lovely seeing no other choice jude walked up to him carefully avoiding brennas kicking feet and snagged him by the ear put her down ouch bloody hell the last woman to pinch his ear in such a manner had been his own motherand hed been every bit as unable to defend himself im only looking out for her all right leave off he said when jude ruthlessly twisted he dumped brenna back on her feet then took the deep breath of the aggrieved you dont understand the situation he began then staggered when brenna snatched up a pan and rapped it smartly over his head bastard im not your dog in the manger and dont you forget it he gripped the edge of the sink and watched triple brennas march to the back stairs she coshed me you deserved it but jude took him gently by the hand you should sit down its lucky for you she didnt grab the cast iron or youd be flat on your back i dont want her going out with some dubliner dizzy he let jude nudge him into a chair i dont want her going round looking that way why because i dont patient and more sympathetic than she let him know jude ran her fingers delicately through his hair you dont always get what you want it didnt break the skin but youre going to have a bump a good one jude tipped his face up to hers and touched by the stubborn and miserable look in his eyes kissed him lightly i never realized you had such a hard head if you dont want brenna going out with someone else why havent you asked her to go out with you he shifted in his chair its not that way this time she cupped his cheek isnt it leaving him stewing over that she walked over to turn off the fish that was already burned beyond redemption i dont want it to be that way her mouth tipped up at the corners keeping her back to him for now jude got out fresh portions of fish ill have to repeat you dont always get what you want i do he got to his feet gave himself a moment for the room to settle im careful about what i want so was i once wanting mores what got me here well im already where i want to be so i can afford to be careful still holding the fish she gave him a bland stare hard head indeed and thats the way i like it as well no dont trouble yourself there ill do it he shoved the entire pan aside and got out another to heat fresh oil ask aidan to serve the hikers another pint on me with apologies for the delay in the meal would you darling all right she started out then turned back this family business was still so new shawn maybe you do like where you are maybe its the right spot for you but there are times when you have to make certain take a step forward or take one back youre not being fair to brenna or to yourself by running in place is that the psychologist talking he glanced back in time to see her wince then lower her eyes i didnt mean that in a hard way jude and youre right i just havent figured which direction to take brooding over it he coated the fish the fact is she gave me a push i dont care to be pushed it makes me want to dig in my heels i can understand that just as i can understand brennas the type who needs to move things along one way or the other aye scowling he touched fingers cautiously to the bump on his head one way or the other if you can stand one more piece of advice make yourself busy in the storeroom when you hear brenna coming back down the steps youre a wise woman its going well isnt it darcy powdered her nose in the ladies room of the restaurant and slid her gaze to brennas in the mirror the foods very good well that yes but i mean the whole of it its so nice to be out with a man of some sophistication for a change matthew lived in paris for an entire year darcy went on speaking of her date he speaks the language like a native i think ill have him come up with the idea of taking me there for a weekend before much longer despite herself brenna had to laugh oh youll let him think he thought of it naturally men prefer it that way and daniels very taken with you hes pleasant enough knowing darcy would be ages yet before she deemed herself freshened up enough to go back to the table brenna took out her lipstick well mary kates lipstick copped from the bathroom if the truth be known hes marvelouslooking and wealthy as sin why dont we let them take us both to paris i dont have the time to go off to france nor the inclination to pay for the journey in the way a man would expect weve nothing but time darcy fluffed at her hair and a clever woman doesnt pay in any form unless she wants to im not after sleeping with matthew i thought you liked him i do yes he just doesnt give me a tug that way but that could change she added cheerfully lips pursed brenna studied the lipstick as she wound the tube up and down have you ever wanted to sleep with a man who didnt want to sleep with you ive never known a man who wouldnt pull down his zipper at the least provocation its the way theyre made so you cant blame them but there would be some under certain circumstances who just wouldnt find a particular woman attractive in that way i suppose there are exceptions to every rule but youve not to worry she gave brenna a supportive pat on the shoulder daniel finds you very attractive im sure hed be glad to sleep with you if you wanted heaving a breath brenna dropped the lipstick back in her bag well then what a relief she had a wonderful time the best time shed ever had in her life a civilized meal in a civilized place with civilized people shed been bored half to death but wasnt ready to admit it with that block in place shed given daniel her number and promised herself shed go out with him again should he ring her to ask hed been polite and amusing she reminded herself as she drove home from the pub where shed been let off after the date hed pretended to be interested in her work and had actually made the effort to find something they had in common which had turned out to be old american films the noir type he had an extensive collection of them on video and had made casual mention of her coming up to dublin where they could have their own little film festival it might be something shed enjoy just as shed enjoyed the goodnight kiss he hadnt been overly familiar with it he hadnt let his hands roam where they shouldnt so early in an acquaintance a perfectly nice individual and damn shawn gallagher for ruining her palate for the taste of another man she slowed then stopped as she came to his cottage letting her lorry idle on the road while the fragile fog swam around it oh he was in there all right the snake in the grass see there the parlor light was on he was likely playing at his music if hed had a window open it would have drifted out into the night so she could hear it she wished she could because knowing that made her feel soft she deepened her scowl she was tempted sorely to whip the truck into his street march right in the door to give him a piece of her mind and the back of her hand but that would put too much importance on his earlier behavior shed rather shun him the bastard what kind of man was it who could kiss you one night as if hed happily spend eternity with his lips on yours then behave like a furious father the next wash her face indeed she sniffed started to turn back in the seat to take the wheel when the movement in the upper window stopped her for a moment she was terrified mortified that shawn was there looking out while she stared at his cottage but the embarrassed flush never had the chance to heat her cheeks as she saw the figure of a woman and the shine of pale hair in the delicate moonlight so now brenna sighed and rolling down her window crossed her arms there and rested her chin on them how many nights she wondered had poor lady gwen stood there in that window alone and lonely and heartbroken all because of a man why do we bother with them gwen why do we let them get into our heads this way when you push all the rest aside theyre so bloody irritating his hearts in his song brenna heard the words as if they were whispered directly into her ear and so are you listen she squeezed her eyes tight as something frightening was trying to swell and shift in her head no no im done with that and with him im not giving more of my thoughts and more of my time to shawn hes had enough of them and for too long already almost violently she shoved the truck back into gear and drove home he knew she was working alone because hed checked mick otoole was seeing to some business up at the cliff hotel and jude was running some errands he could hear her banging away at something as he climbed the steps which meant he realized the woman was armed it was a risk hed have to take hed spent most of the night thinking the situation overwhich was becoming too much of a habit and costing him a great deal of sleep hed come to the conclusion that jude was right it was time to move one way or the other he imagined the conversation to come would determine which direction he headed the banging he noted was from inside the babys closet following impulse a rare thing for him he closed the door locked it and pocketed the key that at least would keep her from walking out on him until hed finished braced for the explosion he was sure he was inviting he walked toward the closet jude back so soon well have a look at these shelves here and see if theyre to your liking from the third step on her ladder she looked over her shoulder and saw shawn in the doorway he waited but rather than blistering him with her tongue she just looked through him then turned back to work that he thought was a very dire sign indeed i want to talk to you he began im working ive no time for chatting i need to talk to you he stepped in laid a hand on her hip it took a great deal of courage not to spring back when she stared down on him and took a fresh grip on her hammer would you put that down no he might have had courage but he also had brains in a quick move he yanked the hammer out of her hand ive a knot the size of a fucking golf ball on my head im not after a second one i just want a few words with you brenna ive nothing to say to you shawn and as i value the friendship weve had all our lives ill ask you to leave me be for now dire indeed he thought as a tongue of panic licked the inside of his throat i want to apologize to you she shifted on the ladder again gave him her back and pulled out her measuring tape the woman brought out the worst in him was all shawn could think as he gripped her by the hips and lifted her down from the ladder she came around swinging and though hed expected no less he didnt dodge the blow not after hed caught the sheen of tears in her eyes im sorry panic was more than a sly lick now it simply coated his throat dont cry i cant stand it im not crying shed let the tears burn her eyes out of her head before she let a single one fall in his presence i asked you to leave me be since you wont ill leave you she strode to the door wrenched at the knob then simply gaped in shock you locked the door she whirled back have you lost your mind i know youso i knew you wouldnt listen now you have to he saw her slide a look toward her toolbox imagined she was thinking of the nice weapon supply inside however sincere his apology he wasnt prepared to have holes hacked out of him so he stepped over to put himself between brenna and temptation you say our friendship matters to you it matters to me as well it matters a great deal to me you matter to me brenna is that why you treated me like some tramp last night her voice broke alarming him so he bore down i suppose it was yes its not a regular thing after all for me to see you looking that way frustration had her throwing up her hands what way lovely he saw her eyes go round in shock and took advantage of the moment to step a little closer you looked so polished up and female i am female for gods sake i know it but you dont usually trouble to make it an issue why should it be she demanded it was a sore point and one she hated probing just because i know how to hammer a nail or fix a pipe im not allowed to be a woman as well wearing a dress and some lipstick makes me a tramp no it makes me a fool for letting you think i meant that clumsy foolish and spiteful and im sorry for it when she said nothing he stuck his hands in his pockets pulled them out again best he told himself to get it all out and over the truth of it is i was thinking of you thinking about things when you walked in looking the way you did and about to go off with another man i was jealous i didnt realize it at the time didnt want to admit it later after my mind had cleared a bit ive never been jealous before i cant say i cared for it shed calmed down enough to begin to speculate and consider i didnt like it much myself i told myself youd done itput on that dress and left your hair all falling down and made your mouth slick and wet to stir me up yes she considered and she nodded sure i mightve if id thought of it my mind just doesnt work in those clever ways no youre a straightforward woman i know it he stopped angled his head for every step he took she took one in evasion why is it brenna that when i come toward you now you back away arent you the one who started it all aye i did but ive had time to reconsider just keep your distance will you while im mulling it over she demanded when she caught the dark male amusement in his eyes not an expression to settle a womans nerves weve been friends a long time and i dont want to lose that part of my life if wed acted when i first mentioned sex if youd just grinned and said well brenna what a fine idea lets go up to bed it wouldve been fine all around wed have enjoyed ourselves kept it simple and parted friends as always but now its stopped being an impulsive sort of thing and its complicated he solved the problem of keeping her still by reaching out planting his palm on the wall just above her head before she could shift he planted the other and caged her in youve a habit of acting on impulse and im one for pondering over things you move fast and i move slow her blood was beginning to hum but pride kept her in place now as sure as his arms jesus shawn a glacier moves with more speed than you but i get where im going just the same dont i im thinking brenna that weighing impulse and consideration speed and caution we can still meet somewhere in the middle of things its too sticky now your hearts pounding he murmured as he eased closer i can almost hear it watching her he laid his hand between her breasts awareness snapped into her eyes breath trembled between her lips then drew in soft and sharp when he let his fingers spread now i can feel it ive wanted to touch you her knees wanted to buckle youd never have thought of it if i hadnt mentioned it sure and i cant say i mind it being your idea as im thinking of it now he lowered his head to nip lightly at her bottom lip and im finding it hard to think of much else when i came up here today he shifted his head so his lips skimmed up along her jaw i thought id apologize make things as right as i could between us then i was nearly sure very nearly sure that id take a step back and leave it that way but now i want to touch you he toyed delicately with the nipple that strained against her shirt i want to taste you and finally finally covered her mouth with his she gripped his hips fingers digging in as she let her tongue dance with his let her lips heat with his she wanted faster hotter harder she thought she might die from the gentle and glorious warmth wait something was breaking loose inside her a vital something that needed to stay firmly in place wait you think i need all the fancy work she turned her head but that only meant his teeth found her ear oh jesus the man had the most magical of mouths i dont need it her breath was coming hard and fast and making her dizzy or seductions i do he tilted his head so he could nibble down her throat if youve decidedand it appears to me you havethat we should have sex after all well take an hour now and go to your cottage his chuckle was muffled against her skin skin that was soft as sunwarmed silk somewhere in the middle brenna i want you he felt her shiver as his mouth found hers again but ive a mind to drive us both a bit crazy before i have you naked and under me why because its more enjoyable that way do you like it when i do this she drew in her breath in three short gasps when he feathered his fingers just under her shirt so the backs of them rubbed the curve of her breast i see you do your eyes are blurry im half blind the hell with the cottage well just finish this right here but when she locked her arms around his neck he laughed and swung her in a circle oh no we wont i wont short myself or you of the pleasure it doesnt seem like middle ground from where im standing its leaning heavily toward your way of things maybe but youll thank me for it when were done so like a man she said when he set her on her feet always thinking you know whats best and how it all should be done his teeth flashed brenna darling if i wasnt a man we wouldnt be having this conversation she blew out a breath settled her cap more firmly on her head well youre right about that arent you you told me you had an itch well ill scratch it for you in my own time and my own way thats fair she looked at him nodded frustrating but fair and wherever we stand now or after we walk away friends at the end of it as much as i want you i wont touch you if we dont take a vow here to walk away friends how could she help but care for him brenna wondered when he was the kind of man who would think of that and would mean it friends now during and after she offered her hand on it ill promise that to you and i to you he took her hand held it then just to see her reaction brought it to his lips to nuzzle her mouth fell open delighting him into a rolling laugh mary brenna i believe youre in for a few surprises along the way maybe she tugged her hand free put it behind her back where it continued to tingle but im not without a few tricks of my own ill count on that plucking the key from his pocket he turned toward the door why dont you come down tonight and ill fix you supper and i can show you some surprises in the storeroom in the storeroom before she could laugh a thought took root just how many women might i ask have you surprised in the storeroom mauverneen he winked at her before he strolled out im not a man who counts chapter nine magees man finkles here darcy hissed it as she scurried into the kitchen shawn glanced up from the trio of bookmakers sandwiches he was making is he now big as life out of habit she checked her face and hair in the little mirror shed hung beside the door aidans pulling him a pint of lager and chatting him up at the bar though the finkle looks to be all business knowing his sisters skills shawn gestured with his knife give me him in a hundred words or less darcy narrowed her eyes tapped a finger to her lips middle fifties and balding sensitive about it as he does a combover a prosperous belly that tells me he likes his food married but not above casting an eye an indoor man a company man used to taking orders and giving them on down the line frugal as mary kate tells me he bargained fierce on the room rate even though its on his expense account urban through and through and a bit of a dandy i could pluck my eyebrows in the shine off his shoes well done shawns eyes glittered with anticipation you wont have any trouble charming him will you with the smuggest of smiles darcy examined her nails shooting fish in a barrel im not talking about leading him into temptation darcy just making him stumble around the far edges of it give me some credit i said he was married im not a homewrecker sorry it was the look in your eye its a terror you are to mankind she took a tube out of her tip pocket and freshened her lipstick with her eye on shawns in the mirror mankind loves terrors like me i cant argue with you there as ive seen too many of the fallen ill help you serve the sandwiches here so the finkle can get a look at the harmless brother in harmony with him darcy helped shawn load the tray hes impatient id say to get a look at things eye the land talk his deal hes in ireland now shawn said easily rushing isnt the gallagher way he put the orders together and got some bowls of crisps for the bar i wasnt daydreaming he said to darcys back lifting his voice slightly as they passed through the kitchen door into the pub i was thinking following his lead darcy sighed you cant put orders together in good time if your heads in the clouds try staying on the ground with the rest of us now and again adopting a sulky expression shawn began to set bowls out on the bar shawn come meet mr finkle from new york city shawn let his face clear and moved down the bar in aidans direction leaned on it to offer a friendly smile at the man with thinning hair and vaguely irritated black eyes its nice to meet you mr finkle weve cousins in new york city and friends as well they say its a fast and busy place with something doing every minute of every day aidan youve been to new york city is that how you remember it as well because he had to swallow a chuckle aidan merely nodded shawn had thickened his accent just enough to add atmosphere and a touch of country bumpkin aidans one for traveling sure and it runs in the family it does but as for me im one for staying where hes planted yes well finkle began obviously prepared to dismiss shawn and get back to important matters so have you come on holiday to ardmore mr finkle sure and its a fine spot for it quiet now so youre lucky shawn went on by end of may theyll come swarming to the beaches since weve such fine ones and then they pack into the pub so i can barely keep up with the orders a body can get a bit of a rest in the winter at least im here on business finkle spoke precisely and the hard edge to his consonants shawn recognized as native new yorker for magee enterprise at shawns convincingly blank look aidan shook his head shawn i told you about the possibility of doing a deal with mr magee his theater well now i never thought you were serious shawn scratched his head a cinema in ardmore not a movie theater finkle said with obvious impatience one for live entertainment i think its a wonderful idea darcy sidled up to the bar beamed approval at finkle just brilliant you must come to the pub tonight mr finkle so you can have a sample of the kind of local talent we could offer your theater what about the man from london shawn sent baffled looks to darcy then aidan the restaurant man well talk about that later aidan gave shawn a small and very obvious nudge thats not important finkles shoulders straightened his eyebrows lowered are you speaking with another investor mr gallagher its not a serious matter not at all why dont i show you the land well be discussing sure youll want a look at it wont you youre not after buying a pig in a poke shawn you man the bar here theres a lad hastily aidan flipped up the passthrough well have a walk about the place mr finkle and see whats what please do come back wont you darcy called out and had the satisfaction of seeing finkle flush a little as he glanced back her way id love to sing for you she waited until they were safely out and away the man from london she said snickering that was inspired just came to me and ill wager a pound to a pence that the minute he gets back to a phone hes ringing magee in new york to tell him were playing two lines it could backfire you know shawn and have this magee looking elsewhere or it could pay off he reached over to tug her hair surprised at how much fun hed had playing the game lifes a gamble isnt it he looked up as brenna and her father came in for their lunch hour and thats half the fun of living a good day to you mr otoole he said when mick strolled to the bar mary brenna and what can we do for you ive a thirst shawn mick sent darcy a wink we can help you there knowing his mans preferences shawn slid a pint glass under the tap and began the process of building a guinness and for you brenna im more interested in that soup i see on your menu she nodded toward the daily board but theres no hurry none at all mick confirmed as he slid onto a stool were all but finished at your brothers house this morning my brenna here will tidy it up by days end then well be back to renovating rooms at the hotel sure and ill miss coming in here for your cooking shawn not that the hotel doesnt serve a good meal but no one has your touch will you have some soup today and a sandwich as well mr otoole darcy slipped behind the bar to pour the tea she assumed brenna wanted a man works as hard as you he needs his fuel well i will at that darcy darling youll make some fortunate man the best of wives one day as youll know how to tend to him with a quick and wicked laugh darcy slid the tea across to brenna im looking for one wholl tend to meand lavishly speaking of it has daniel rung you up brenna daniel she caught shawns raised brow and fought not to squirm he did yes thats fine that matthew said he would thats a finelooking and wellsetup young man has his eye on your daughter mr otoole and why shouldnt he shes a pretty thing all right dad well you are and whats wrong with saying so the slap on the shoulder he gave her was one most men would have given a son a mand be fortunate indeed to snap up a lass like my brenna as shes fair of face and a good worker too a bit of a temper maybe but that only adds the spice a man doesnt go looking for a bland sort of woman does he shawn shawn laid the next level of guinness in the glass that would depend on the man well a smart one doesnt for hed be bored brainless within a year not that im in a rush to see my brenna here off and married my chicks are leaving the nest quick enough now with maureen already wed and patty looking to be a bride in a few months he sighed i dont know what ill do without my brenna when the time comes you wont have to do without me time or not were partners ill just go back and get the soup since youre shorthanded here it was as good an excuse as any to get out of the spotlight and away from uncomfortable topics she was behind the bar and through the kitchen door as quickly as she could manage without letting on she was in a hurry when the door was behind her she rolled her eyes heavenward and blew out a breath her father was getting powerfully sentimental lately and while she found it touching most times this wasnt one of them she got down bowls and tried not to wince when she heard the door open again she didnt have to turn to know it was shawn i can get this youre busy and darcy can man the bar as well as meor anyone besides your father wants a sandwich you dont build as well with bread and meat as you do with wood and nails because he wanted to and because he knew it would fluster her he came up behind took her hips in his hands and bent down to nip at the back of her neck heat flashed straight down to her toes what are you about youre to be working youre work enough he turned her then slid his hands up her sides ive only time to get a bite to eat i have to get back to the house and finish up ill feed you soon enough with his hands hooked under her arms he boosted her onto the counter you feed me first ive an appetite for you she started to protest though her heart wouldnt have been in it but then his mouth was nibbling on hers someone could come in she managed but her hands were already in his hair and why would that bother you just put your mind to this for a minute he framed her face tilted his head and took her under hed promised to drive her crazy and she was forced to admit he was a man of his word for days hed kept her on a shaky sexual edge that was both frustrating and wonderful it was never more than a kiss long and slow and deep or fast and hard and hot the bare teasing brush of hand or fingertips the quiet look that could send her pulse scrambling without a word spoken an appetite for her hed said it must have been true as he was sampling and savoring and consuming her in lazy lingering bites when she began to tremble he only made a sound of satisfied approval shawn the man made her light in the head and wild in the belly i cant go on like this much longer i can he was dreaming in her i could go on like this for years thats what im afraid of he chuckled then drew back pleased by the clouds of desire in her eyes what did you say to this daniel daniel who his grin flashed and her mind cleared swearing she gave him a shove and jumped off the counter damn you shawn thats what this was about just softening me up and fogging up my brain so id boost your ego a notch that was just a side benefit he got out the makings for a sandwich but the fact is brenna ive an interest in knowing if youre going out with the dubliner again just now i ought to just to slap at you she jammed her hands in her pockets thats what darcy would do ah but youre not darcy are you darling no im not and i havent the talent or the energy to juggle men like apples i told the dubliner i was seeing someone shawn glanced over met her eyes thanks for that what id like to know is when im going to be sleeping with someone he added the spiced mustard he knew mick otoole favored and kept his brows lifted in all the years ive known you never did i realize you had such an obsession with sex i wouldnt be obsessed with sex if i was having sex well now how can you be sure of that as youve never had it with me she wanted to pull her hair decided to laugh instead christ jesus shawn youre enough to drive a woman to drink go out and have darcy pull you a pint on me he began then his head came up again as he heard the sound of voices through the back door no wait follow along here follow what ladle the soup he gave a wag of his hand toward the bowls and just follow along the back door opened and aidan stepped back to let finkle go through the kitchens shawns territory as you can see weve added this and that as hes felt a need for it oh hello brenna this is our friend and occasional employee brenna otoole brenna mr finkle from new york pleased to meet you clueless brenna put on a company smile and ladled the soup mr finkles here about adding a restaurant to the pub shawn began a theater aidan said in a tone so sharp that brenna nearly bobbled the bowl in surprise the theater shawn youre confused again oh aye the theater sure and i cant keep business dealings straight in my mind for five minutes at a run but you make a lovely soup brenna gave him an encouraging look one she might have sent to a slightly slow twelveyearold and hoped that was what hed had in mind would you care for a bowl of it now mr finkle or have you eaten already no i havent the kitchen smelled like someones devoted grandmothers kitchen and it had his mouth watering its very aromatic and tastes better i can promise you what kind of theater are you thinking of a small tasteful entertainment arena my employer wants something traditional people like to eat and lift a glass or two before or after the theater dont they shawn dressed the sandwich with a bit of parsley and radish as a rule finkle scanned the room the shining pots the scrubbed counters the tidy workstation the stove was enormous and looked older than zeus but it appeared to be in good working order it might do he thought he would make a note of it in his report well then they couldnt do better than gallaghers for that brenna assured him would you like to sit here in the kitchen sir or would you prefer a table a table if you dont mind he told brenna the better to observe the business flow ill get you settled smoothly aidan gestured toward the door you just tell our darcy what youd enjoy for your lunch on the house of course aidan shot one triumphant look over his shoulder as he led finkle out whats this about a theater and why were you acting as though youd misplaced a few brain cells since you woke up this morning well ill tell you go on and get your father his lunch then come back and have your soup here and ill give you the full story when he had brenna sat back gnawing her bottom lip as she did when thinking hard business i know this magee do you well not personal like but i know of him them actually father and son they are but the son is more in the way of doing the running of things now a family business shawn mused well thats something i can appreciate a wellestablished one at that he builds beautiful things does magee mostly theaters and arenas and such hes very big in america and in england too im thinking my mothers cousins nephew brian cagney went to work for one of his construction teams in new york he wrote me a year or two ago and said if i were to come over id have a job in a wink as magee doesnt look at how a carpenters skin is stretched when he hires on are you thinking of going to new york it was such a shock even the possibility of it that he had to work to keep his tone level and casual no her mind already elsewhere brenna answered absently i work with dad and we work here but brian writes me now and again he says magee treats his people well pays top of the scale and has been known to swing a hammer himself when the mood strikes but doesnt suffer fools and if you fuck up youre out and gone ill write to brian see what he knows of this or can find out then her eyes sharpened latched on to shawns is he bringing in his own crews or hiring local for this i wouldnt know about it well he should hire local thats how it should be you want to build in ireland then you use irish hands you build in ardmore you hire from the village and old parish dad and i could use a piece of this where are you going shawn demanded when she got up to talk to mr finkle wait wait god woman you never let a fly land on your nose do you nows not the time why isnt it if i want to get in on the ground floor of it let aidan set the deal first he caught her hand its still in delicate stages once we have it as we want it then you can move on into who should have the building of it she hated to wait hated that she saw the sense of what shawn was saying i need to know the minute the deals done then that i can promise ill show you how it should be she pulled a pencil out of her pocket and would have sketched right on the wall if he hadnt grabbed her and shoved a pad of paper under her nose this is your north wall you open that up an oversized doorway she drew quickly all lines and angles and you put a breezeway sort of thing here for people to move from the pub to the theater and back again you keep it as much the same as the pub as you can the same wood the same flooring so you have awhat is ita symmetry that leads to the lobby part better if the breezeway fans out spreads as it goes so that the lobby becomes part of the pub as on the other way the pub would become part of the lobby she nodded glanced up and narrowed her eyes and what might you be grinning at its just such an education watching you work if i have my way youll be watching me work for months down the line and dad can slip into the pub daily for his lunch and pint ive got to get on can you take an hour later he caught her hand before she could turn to go i suppose i could it shouldnt take longer than that for me to get your clothes off and finish with you i had something else in mind as for the other i dont want timetables and deadlines he brought her hand to his lips rubbed them over her knuckles have a walk with me on the beach it was so like him she thought an hour on a winters beach with the sea and the wind come and fetch me at judes if you manage the time so will i then come on and kiss me goodbye willing to oblige she rose to her toes leaned in and had just touched her lips to his when the door swung open the finkle believes he can fit in a bit of that soup and some darcy stopped short gaping at the sight of her dearest friend kissing her brother well for the sake of jesus whats all this it was just what it appeared to be before you interrupted you havent finished shawn said to brenna and started to pull her back from the full foot shed jumped in retreat yes i have ive work to do considering it the best line of escape she dashed out the back door soup you say casually shawn pivoted to the stove shawn you were kissing brenna so i was though i had hardly gotten a taste before you came barging in and scared her off what are you thinking of kissing brenna he glanced back his face bland i was sure our mother explained such matters to you but if youre needing a refresher course on the subject ill do what i can to educate you dont smart your mouth off at me but she was too baffled to work up the kind of temper that entertained them both shes the next thing to a sister to me and i wont have you teasing her that way he ladled soup into a thick generous bowl maybe you should have a word with her before you flay into me dont think i wont she snatched up the bowl i know how you are with women shawn gallagher he inclined his head do you now that i do she said it in her darkest most forbidding tone added a toss of her head and stalked out the minute shed served finkle his bowl and fussed over him enough to bring a rise of color to his cheeks darcy informed aidan she was taking a fifteenminute break and was out the door before he could tell her different in her hurry she forgot to take off her apron or grab her jacket so her tip money jingled cheerfully in her pocket as she raced down to her family home as a result she was out of breath and pink of cheek when she dashed through the door she headed straight upstairs to the door of the nursery where brenna was rolling varnish onto the freshly sanded floor i want to know whats going on well im putting on this first coat of sealer it takes a day or two to dry good and hard then ill put on another and that will be that with you and shawn damn it brenna you cant go around letting him kiss you that way peoplell get the wrong impression brenna kept rolling she hadnt worked up the nerve to look at her mend actually i imagine theyd get the right one i shouldve told you darcy i just didnt know how darcy braced herself with a hand on the doorjamb as the blood drained out of her face therestheres something to tell me well not so much really but not for lack of trying on my part time to face the music brenna told herself and she turned around i want to sleep with him thats all you want to because her throat had snapped shut darcy broke off and rubbed a hand over it you want to sleep with shawn well why the usual reasons darcy started to speak then raised a hand to hold brenna off while she gathered her own thoughts all right im thinking youve been in somewhat of a sexual drought just recently so i can see youd no no im not quite seeing its shawn were speaking of here shawn whos been a thorn in both our sides since we were babies sure and its an oddity i admit but the thing here is darcy ive had a bit of a of a yen for him for well forever i just thought it was time to act on it or id always have one and where would that get me im sitting down she did so right in the doorway you acted on it i did and he was as surprised as you are by the idea at least initially and he wasnt very flattering about it either but hes in the way of interested now its just that ive discovered this is yet one more thing you cant rush shawn over and its fair to killing me meticulously she coated her roller with varnish and spread it thin and smooth im sorry youre upset about it id hoped that we could just get it done so to speak with no one the wiser dont you have any feelings for him then of course i do brennas head came up again of course i do darcy were all like family this is just its just different its different thats the truth struggling to adjust darcy sighed out a breath i was going to protect you from himknowing that he has a way with women that can make them softheaded over him and him barely noticing half the time but now that ive heard what youve said brenna i have to turn that coin over genuinely surprised brenna set her roller on the end of the pan you think he needs protecting from me darcy im not exactly your femme fatale sort of woman she spread her arms knowing very well how she looked in her grubby work clothes and battered boots i think shawns safe from the likes of me then you dont understand him not in his heart theres romance in him the kind of dreaminess that builds castles in the air he has a delicacy of feeling hed cut off his arm before hed cause hurt to another cut them both off because he caused a moments pain to someone he cared for and he cares for you its not so far a step from caring for to loving what will you do if he falls in love with you he wont she nearly took a step back from the question and the idea of course he wont dont hurt him darcy got to her feet please dont hurt him i but as darcy had already turned away brenna had to hurry after her darcy you mustnt worry so brenna gripped the banister when darcy turned halfway down the stairs we both know what were about i promise you weve already taken a vow to stay friends through it make sure its a vow you dont break you both mean a great deal to me she worked up a smile because her friend seemed to need it sleeping with shawn darcy said with her usual bite what is the world coming to chapter ten after closing when the village was so quiet that only the heartbeat of the sea could be heard the gallaghers gathered around the kitchen table of their family home with tea and with whiskey heres where we stand aidan laid a hand over judes as he spoke and hers turned under his so their fingers linked he had a sudden vivid picture of his parents joining hands in exactly the same manner when theyd sat at tables head for a family meeting the gallagher way he thought one link leading to another in a chain of tradition well where do we stand darcy demanded sorry aidan shook his head my mind went wandering so at the start finkle may be a yank but hes no green one when it comes to horse trading i wouldnt believe as successful a man of business as magee is reputed to be would send any but a sharp individual to look after his interests be that as it may shawn considered he fell for the man from london aidan grinned in appreciation and nodded well now were not green either come to that and the irish were horse traders before those looking for america ever found her but thats neither here nor there he started to toss the patiently waiting finn a biscuit then remembered the presence of his wife and cleared his throat finkle he liked the look of the land the setup the location and so forth im sure of that though he made little noises and grunts and pulled on his lip rather than commit he said again how the magee is set on buying and i said again how that was easy to understand and a man likes his own and so on and so forth but how were set on leasing wed have more money sooner and could put it to work for us making more if we just sold darcy piped up thats true enough aidan nodded toward her and wed have more control shawn put in part of the profit and a hand in whats done with whats ours if we hold the lease look ahead darcy to ten years down the road and twenty and the legacy to your children who says im having any she shrugged her shoulders but i see your point its a hard thing for me to resist grabbing the money held out at the moment a hundred years lease is our offer a hundred darcys eyes popped wide and aidan merely looked at his wife a hundreds the number of magic this is business not fairy spells you use the fairies where you find them shawn added a drop of whiskey to his tea it seemed to go with these dealings if magee is forwardthinking a lease of a hundred years will appeal to him brenna knows something of his company he caught darcys jerk to attention out of the corner of his eye at his mention of brenna from what she told me hes a fair man but far from green himself so im thinking hell look even beyond the century as should we a pound a year for a hundred years a pound darcy threw up her hands why not just give him the bloody land then for that price we ask for fifty percent of his theater darcy settled again her eyes sharpening and settle for twenty and at the end of the term the land and the theater are owned equal shares gallagher and magee its a sweet deal if the theater takes hold darcy agreed and leaning heavily in our direction itll take hold aidan said with a gleam in his eye with gallagher luck and magee money im willing to trust that now why should he agree to those terms i jude started to speak then closed her mouth no have your say aidan gave her hand a squeeze youre part of this well i think he will agree after some negotiations and posturing and perhaps a few more adjustments you may have to give a bit more but in the end youll have fairly close to what youre afterbecause in the end all parties want the same thing magee wants his theater darcy put in more than that in an automatic gesture jude slapped shawns hand before he could sneak finn a biscuit he has a reason for choosing this place and the kind of man who helms that successful a business can indulge himself from time to time his people came from here she went on his greatuncle was engaged to my greataunt of course shawn tapped a finger against the whiskey bottle as it came to him john magee who was lost in the first great war his youngest brotherdennis was itwent off to america to make his fortune i didnt put it together before now i dont know how much sentiment is in the motive for this magee selecting ardmore jude went on but its bound to be part of the motivation if this magee had anything like my background he grew up on stories of ireland and of this area in particular now he wants a more tangible tie with the place his family came from i understand that that yank sentiment over ancestors amused darcy helped herself to the whiskey ill never understand it ancestors sure and theyve been dead for long years havent they but if sentiment helps glue the deal thats fine with me thatll be part of it butsorry its the psychologist in me againhell also have his eye on profit if he didnt he wouldnt have one of the largest companies in the states and for the same reasons hell have his eye on his reputation and ours will be on our own shawn lifted his glass youve quite the reputation dont you darcy sent shawn a sour smile not as well rounded as yours darling at least i dont go around seducing childhood friends slowly and with a dangerous gleam in his eye he set his glass down again before feathers could fly aidan stretched an arm between them now what whats all this ah shes got her nose out of joint because i kissed brenna well theres nothing to squabble about aidans hand dropped onto the table brenna otoole of course brenna otoole what were you doing kissing our brenna aidan jude tugged on his sleeve this is shawns business its ours as its brenna mother of god its not as if i grabbed her by the hair and dragged her to the kitchen floor to force myself on her in a carnal fashion while she tried to fight me off you were on the kitchen floor we were not at his wits end shawn pressed his fingers to his eyes a man cant have a simple life in this family i kissed brenna and not for the first time neither do i plan on it being the last and i fail to see why thats such a puzzlement to everyone who knows us and an outrage as well darcy folded her hands shed learned something shed hoped to by the poking at him he hadnt mentioned that it was brenna whod initiated the shift in relationship with another man shed chalk it up to ego but with shawn she knew it was instinctive protection of the woman involved the fact both pleased and worried her its just surprising aidan said im not outraged darcy sent shawn a sweet sisterly look but puzzled i am after all brennas seen you naked alreadysome years ago to be sure but still such things linger in the mind and having had a good look at your equipment i cant think why shed be the least bit interested thats a question youll have to put to her he wanted to leave it at that dignified dismissive but it rankled i wasnt more than fifteen and the water was cold a mans not at his best just out of frigid water you know thats your story son and you stick with it and you shouldnt have been looking in that direction but you always were a perverted sort why shouldnt i have looked everyone else was he lost his trunks in the sea she explained to jude and didnt realize it till he was standing clear of the surf jay naked ive always regretted the lack of a camera jude glanced at shawn with sympathy i used to regret being an only child but there are some circumstances whenoh what is it aidan was on his feet like a shot prepared to haul his wife into his arms when she pressed her finger to her belly there youve upset her with your bickering no no the babys moving thrilled she grabbed aidans hand and laid it over her middle do you feel it its like a rippling inside me panic shifted to awe filling his eyes his heart hes lively its a family meeting after all why shouldnt he be part of it shawn raised his glass again slainte he went to visit maude since hed been used to seeing her once or twice a week most of his life shawn saw no reason that should change after death and her resting place was a good spot for thinking it had nothing much to do with the fact that he would stroll near the cliff hotel on his way it wasnt likely hed see brenna but well if he didnt walk in that direction there was no chance at all of seeing her as he recalled maude fitzgerald had been the romantic sort and he thought shed appreciate the logic of it the hotel sat dramatically on the cliffs with the sea spread before it and though the air was brisk with morning a scattering of guests were out and about enjoying the view shawn gave himself the pleasure of it as well and as he watched the boats bob and sail over the water he thanked his ancestors for going into the business of a public house rather than fishing there was tim riley and his crew hauling in nets while the waves kicked and danced there was a rhythm to it that had shawn tapping his foot and set pipe against cello in a musical duel in his head shawn imagined the tourists thought the boats looked picturesque they probably viewed the idea of making a living from the sea as a kind of romantic venture steeped in history and tradition but as he stood wind flowing through his dark hair and doing its best to sneak under his sweater he could only think it a cold and lonely and capricious life hed take a warm pub and a busy kitchen any day of the week but it was romance that whirled through mary kates mind when she rushed out after spotting him she had to press a hand to her heart as it filled with images she looked at shawn standing on the cliffs legs spread eyes on the horizon and she saw heathcliff rhett butler lancelot and every other heroic fantasy that might fill an infatuated young womans dreams she was glad shed borrowed her sister pattys new blue blouse that morning though patty wasnt going to be pleased about it making a valiant attempt to smooth her hair mary kate hurried forward shawn when he turned and saw her coming toward him shawn cursed himself he hadnt thought of the possibility of running into brennas sister not when hed been so busy thinking of brenna mind your step gallagher he warned himself good morning mary kate i was forgetting the hotel is full of otooles just now she had to untangle her tongue his eyes were so clear in this light if she looked into them deeply enough she could see herself reflected back it was so alluring you should come in out of the wind ive a break now ill buy you some tea thats a kind offer but im on my way to see old maude i was just watching tim riley pull in his nets and they looked heavy with fish ill have to go about bargaining with him later for some of his catch why dont you stop by on your way back she tilted her head running a hand through her hair and looking up at him under her lashes in a look shed practiced endlessly i can take my lunch most anytime ah she had more skill in flirtation than hed given her credit for it was just a little frightening im due at the pub before long id love to be able to sit and talk with you she laid a hand on his arm when theres not so much going on well thats a thought isnt it ive got to be going you should go inside you shouldnt be standing out here in that thin blouse youll catch a chill my best to your family as he made his escape mary kate sighed hed noticed the blouse hed handled that well shawn congratulated himself friendly a sort of older brother to younger sister kind of thing he was sure the little crisis had passed and it was really rather sweet that shed thought of him the way she had a man had to be flattered especially since hed slipped through those sticky loops with no harm done but deciding a bit of backup wouldnt be out of order he dipped into saint declans well and sprinkled the water on the ground superstitious a modernthinking man shawns head came up and his eyes met the clever blue ones of carrick prince of the faeries a modernthinking man knows theres a reason for superstitions especially when he stands and finds himself having a conversation with the likes of you since hed come for a purpose shawn walked away from the well and over to maudes grave so tell me are you always here and about ive come to this spot all my life and its only recently ive seen you there was no particular reason for you to see me before recently ive a question for you shawn gallagher and im hoping youll be answering it well you have to ask it first so i will carrick sat by the grave across from shawn so their eyes were level what the bleeding blistering hell are you waiting for shawn raised his eyebrows rested his hands on his knees all manner of things oh thats typical of you disgust edged carricks voice im speaking of mary brenna otoole and why you havent taken her to your bed that would be between brenna and myself shawn said evenly and no concern of yours of course its a concern of mine carrick was on his feet now the movement too fast for the human eye to catch the ring on his finger glowed a deep deep blue and the silver pouch hanging from his belt glittered i judged you to have the kind of nature that would understand but youre more boneheaded than even your brother sure and you arent the first to say so its in place gallagher the younger because carrick was now standing beside shawn rather than across from him shawn got to his feet and what would that be your part your destiny your choices how is it you can look into your heart for making your music and not for living your life my life is as i like it boneheaded carrick said again finn protect me from the foolishness of mortals he threw up his hands and thunder rumbled across the clear bowl of the sky if you think to impress me with parlor tricks you wont succeed at it thats just your temper talking and ive one of my own would you dare match it to mine as a demonstration carrick waved a finger and a bolt of blinding white light lanced into the ground in front of shawns feet bully tactics though shawn had to fight the instinct to leap back and unworthy of you fury turned carricks eyes nearly black trembled from his fingertips in little licks of red flame then sub sided as he threw back his head and laughed well now youve more courage than i gave you credit for or its just stupid you are wise enough to know you can cause mischief if you like but no real harm you dont worry me carrick i could have you on your knees croaking like a bullfrog which would hurt my pride but little else not shawn thought that he wanted to put the matter to the test whats the point of this threats dont endear you to me ive waited six of your lifetimes for something you could have in an instant just by holding out your hand but this time he sighed tears from the moon i gathered for her the second time as he spoke he took the pouch from his belt and at her feet i poured the pearls they formed and all she saw was the pearls turning the pouch over he poured a white waterfall of glowing white gems onto maudes grave they glowed in the grass in the moonlight then white and smooth as gwens skin but she didnt see that it wasnt pearls id poured at her feet but my heartthe longing in it and aye the purity of that love as well i didnt know she needed to be told or that it was already too late as i hadnt given her the part of me she wanted carricks voice was full of despair now and so ripe with unhappiness that shawn touched his arm what did she want love just the word a single word but i gave her diamondsjewels plucked from the sun and these pearls then the final time the stones you call sapphires that i harvested from the heart of the sea i know your story well aye you would and your new sister jude has put it in her book of tales and legends the ending is still an unhappy one as i cast the spell over my gwen in anger and in painrashly gallagher three times love would find love heart accept heart with all the failings and the foibles and then my gwen and i will be free to be together a hundred years times three ive waited and my patience is sore tested youre a man who has words considering carrick circled shawn and the grave you use them well with your musicmusic others should hear but thats another matter a man who has such a gift of words is one who understands whats inside a person sometimes before that person knows its a gift you have im only asking you to use it in a long flourish he waved his hand over the grave and the pearls blossomed into flowers the jewels i gave gwen grew into flowers your jude will tell you it was the flowers she kept some women want the simple things gallagher so ive come to understand he lifted his finger resting on the tip was a single perfect pearl with a thin smile he flicked it toward shawn then nodded pleased when shawn snatched it from the air take it keep it until you realize who it is youre to give it to when you do give the words theyre more of magic than what you have in hand the air trembled wavered and carrick disappeared into it the man wears you out shawn murmured then sat beside maudes grave again its very unusual companions you have then because he needed it shawn let himself fall into the quiet he watched the moonflowers blooms open despite the steam of sunlight dance across the grave he studied the pearl rubbing it through his fingers he put it in his pocket before reaching down to pick a single blossom i dont think youll mind as its for jude he said to maude he sat and kept her company another twenty minutes before going back home he didnt knock it had been his home too long for him to think of it but shawn did think the minute hed closed the door behind him that he was very likely interrupting judes work when she came to the top of the steps before he could decide if he should go back out again he glanced up in apology youll be working ill come back round later no thats all right i dont mind a break would you like some tea she asked as she started down i would yes but ill fix it for both of us i wont argue with that she smiled uncertainly when he held out the moonflower thanks isnt it the wrong time for this to be blooming in most places its one of the things id like to speak with you about he started back toward the kitchen with her how are you feeling today good really good actually i think the morning sickness is passing and im not sorry to see it go and your works going well it would be shawns way she thought to wind his way around to the genuine purpose of the visit in his own time so she found a little bottle for the blossom while he put on the kettle yes it is i still have moments when i cant believe im doing it this time last year i was still teaching and hating my work now i have a book on its way to being published and another one coming to life every day im a little nervous be cause this ones a story out of my head instead of a compilation of others ive been told but i really love the process of it being a little nervous youll probably write a better story dont you think at home he got out the biscuit tin and filled a plate meaning youll have more care with it i hope youre right are you nervous when youre writing your music not the tunes he said after a moments thought the words sometimes trying to find the right way of saying what the musics telling me it can be frustrating how do you handle it oh i bang my head against it for a while after the pot was warmed he measured out the tea then if all i get from that is a headache ill take a walk to clear it or think of something else entirely most times after i do the words are just there as if theyd been waiting for me to pluck them im afraid to walk away when its not working i always think if i do i wont be able to write at all when i come back your ways healthier ah but youre the published author then arent you while the tea steeped he got out cups do you want your music published shawn maybe one day theres no rush about it which he knew hed been saying for years already i write it to please myself and thats enough for now my agent might know someone in the music business id be happy to ask his stomach jumped like a rabbit under the gun oh theres no need for that actually jude ive come by to speak with you about another matter altogether she waited letting him bring the pot to the table pour the tea when hed settled and the fragrant steam rose between them he still didnt speak shawn tell me whats on your mind well im trying to figure out exactly how to say it ill just start this way he reached in his pocket and after drawing out the pearl set it beside her cup a pearl puzzled she started to reach for it then her gaze whipped up to his and her fingers stopped a whisper away from the round white gem oh carrick he speaks fondly of you how odd its so odd now she did pick up the pearl and cupped it in her palm and the moonflower the rest of the pearls turned to moonflowers on maudes grave what do you think of it all what does a modern educated fairly intelligent woman think of the existence of faeries she let the pearl roll in her palm then shook her head i think its marvelous literally this ones arrogant and impatient and a bit of a showoff but coming into contact with him is one of the things that changed my life i think hes of a mind to change mine or he wouldnt have given me that yes im sure youre right jude gave the pearl back to shawn and how do you feel about that that hes got a long wait in store as i like my life just as it is are you trailing off jude picked up her tea i never had siblings so i dont know whats out of line but i wonder if youre thinking of brenna ive given the otoole considerable thought and ive given more than a passing one to the notion that carrick sees my linking with her as the next step for him and well now shawn picked up a biscuit bit into it id say again he has a long wait in store his lips twitched as jude looked down into her tea was that a bit of a matchmakers gleam i caught there in your pretty eyes jude frances she sniffed i dont know what youre talking about im talking about a happily married woman taking a look at her bachelor brotherinlaw and thinking to herself well now wouldnt it be fine if our darling shawn found himself the right woman and settled downand what might it be that i can do to help that along i wouldnt presume to interfere however prim her tone the laugh showed in her eyes hardly at all i appreciate it he slipped the pearl back into his pocket and just so youre aware of my thoughts and feelings on this ill tell you that if there comes to be anything between me and the otoole itll be because its something we both decide upon not because some bullying member of the gentrys decided for us or even because my new sister whom i love dearly wishes it so i only wish you to be happy ive plans to stay that way and as i do id best get into the pub so aidans not dutybound to break my head for being late chapter eleven brenna didnt consider it spying and shed have challenged the one who accused her it just so happened that she had a bit of work to do in finkles room hed complained the shower was slow to drain and since she was there in any case the hotel had asked that she deal with it was it her fault he was on the phone with his employer when she came round certainly not and could the blame be laid on her that he wasnt the sort of man who paid any mind to service people unless she imagined they looked like darcy and then a man would have to be deaf and blind and likely dead a year or so not to give her a long second look but that was beside the point altogether hed let her in himself with a fussy and impatient wave of his hand then had simply gestured toward the bath and gone back to the phone such treatment didnt hurt her feelings she was there to do some plumbing after all but she had ears and was there any reason not to use them i apologize for the interruption mr magee the young mans here to fix the plumbing young man brenna bit her tongue and rolled her eyes ill fax the report as soon as ive put it all in a cohesive form that may be after business hours in new york sir so ill send copies to your private line as well in the bath brenna rattled her tools from her angle she could see only finkles polished shoes and a thin strip of dovegray sock no i havent been able to get the name of the london firm thats interested in the property the elder brother aidan brushes it off claims the other one is confused id have to say its more than possible for the younger to confuse things hes amiable enough but doesnt appear terribly bright brenna snorted then began the business of snaking the drain as quietly as manageable however judging from the reaction the body language and the speed with which this lapse was covered id have to say there has been some negotiation in that corner finkle was silent for a moment brenna strained her ears and heard the light taptap of his fingers on wood yes it is a lovely place picturesque unspoiled simple would be my word its also remote having seen it and having spent this short time here i would have to go back to my original opinion sir i hardly see this theater project being a financial success dublin would be a more logical choice or failing that silence again then the faintest of sighs yes of course i understand you have your reasons i can assure you that the land the gallaghers have is the best location in ardmore the pub appears to be just what you expected its offseason of course but it does a steady business and its well run under the elder gallaghers hand the food is firstrate which i admit surprised me not at all your average pub grub the sister yes shes shes the bumbling had brenna biting the inside of her cheek to hold back a bark of laughter men were so predictable she appears to be efficient actually i went back for a short time last evening at their request darcy the sister miss gallagher has an exceptional singing voice all three of them for that matter are quite musical and that could be an advantage if youre determined to place this theater here in ardmore connecting it with gallaghers pub is in my opinion the most logical decision still on her hands and knees brenna wiggled her butt since her hands were full and she couldnt punch a fist in the air oh you can trust me to negotiate them down from the percentage theyre asking i know youd prefer to buy the land outright but this sentiment of theirs has thus far proven unassailable in actual terms the lease they offer is a less risky venture for you and would in the long term give you a tighter connection to the established business i feel its to your advantage to use gallaghers and the reputation its earned to launch your theater the finger tapping sounded again and the shoes un crossed then recrossed at the ankle yes thats understood no higher than twentyfive percent you can trust me there i hope to have the deal settled within twentyfour hours im sure i can convince the elder gallagher that hed get no better offer from a london firm or any other as she sensed the conversation was winding down brenna scrambled up and turned the taps on full and loud she hummed to herself as she watched the water run after shed turned it off again she did a bit more rattling then hefted her toolbox and strolled into the adjoining room draining like a champ now it is sorry for your inconvenience he never so much as glanced up but waved her away as hed waved her in and hunched over the laptop on the little desk and a good day to you sir she called cheerfully and heard the keyboard clatter as she slipped out once she was clear she sprinted finkle wasnt the only one who knew how to do a report well now the london bit seems to have been inspired aidan gave his brother a slap on the shoulder and shot brenna a look of approval its got them shagging their asses doesnt it some people cant resist the competition since they were in the kitchen shawn turned to get four bottles of beer from the refrigerator i think we should drink to the otoole here and her busy ears i just happened to be where i was when i was but she took the offered bottle youre a fine field soldier sergeant otoole aidan clicked his bottle to hers then to shawns and darcys in turn twentyfive percent and no more pity for him he didnt know wed have settled for twenty without a whimper the manthe magee brenna explained hes determined to have what he wants here though finkle doesnt approve but approve he does of shawns cooking darcys face and your managing hand aidan oh and he thinks youre none too bright shawn but an amiable sort and when he speaks of darcy he stutters delighted darcy laughed give me another day or so and when he speaks of me hell babble and we can get thirty percent aidan slung an arm around darcys shoulders well take the twentyfive and wrap the deal ill let finkle think hes turned the thumbscrews to get it for why shouldnt he feel accomplished after all i can tell you dad likes what hes seen of magee so far he called only this morning to tell me that and that hell leave the details of the matter to us then well let finkle wrangle over the terms shawn raised his bottle until he gives us what were after thats exactly so well its back to work for now brenna my darling do you think you could make yourself scarce round the pub until weve got it hammered i can of course but im invisible to the likes of him he doesnt see past my toolbox fact is he thought i was a man then he needs glasses aidan tipped up her chin and kissed her im grateful to you i tell you i could get us thirty without much more effort darcy claimed but she followed aidan out into the pub she likely could brenna commented no need to be greedy im grateful to you as well she cocked her head and the faintest of sneers twisted her lips it was one of shawns favorite expressions are you going to kiss me then as aidan did im thinking about it sure and you think a long time about things no longer than it takes so he cupped her face in his hands still enjoying the sneer then tilting her head to please himself laid his mouth on hers slow comfortably lazy like a warm breeze on a summer morning she relaxed against him her lips just starting to curve at the easy sweetness then deeper so gradually so skillfully he took her deeper she was over her head before she realized shed been going under she made a sound caught somewhere between a sigh and a moan as her heart battered against her ribs she slid her hands up his back to grip his shoulders even as her body went on alert braced for more he was easing away i can only be so grateful at the moment the man had made her dizzy damn it and had left her system screaming you did that on purpose of course i did bastard im going back to work she reached down for her toolbox and still off balance rapped hard into the table when she turned for the door her head whipped around quickly and her narrowed eyes warned him but he was wise enough to keep his expression bland she sniffed then strode around to wrench open the back door there she paused shot him one last look you know when you stop thinking you do a fine job of the rest of it he didnt grin until she was gone thats a fortunate thing as ive about finished thinking altogether shawn stayed out of the way when finkle came in that evening but he fixed the man a kings meal of baked plaice done with an herbed butter served with cally potatoes to which hed added a dash or so of thyme and some curly kale since word from darcy when she popped in was that the man would have licked his plate if thered been no one about to notice shawn felt hed done his part so it was mischief as much as business sense that had him going out to take finkle a portion of lemon cheesecake relaxed from the meal and darcys attentions finkle offered shawn what might have passed for a smile i dont know when ive had better fish you run a creative kitchen mr gallagher thats kind of you to say sir i hope youll enjoy this tis me own recipe fiddled about somewhat from that of my dear old granny i dont believe youll find better when you return to london finkle just about to take the first bite paused with his fork in the air new york he said very precisely shawn let himself blink new york oh sure and its new york i meant the man from london was thin as a skate and wore little round glasses youd think id be able to keep it all straight wouldnt you now keeping his expression pleasant finkle casually took a sample of the cake so youve spoken to someone from london about a restaurant was it oh aidan he does the talking ive no head for business at all is the cake to your liking its excellent the man had a slow brain finkle mused but no one could fault his cooking skills the man from london he pressed would you happen to know his name i have a number of acquaintances there shawn stared up at the ceiling rubbed his chin was it finkle oh no that would be you with a sweet and harmless expression covering his face he lifted empty hands ive a bad habit of forgetting names but he was a very pleasant individual as you are yourself sir if you find youve room for another portion of cake just let darcy know he strolled back to the kitchen catching aidans eye with a wink ten minutes later darcy poked her head into the kitchen and hissed finkle asked for a moment of aidans time theyve gone into the snug thats fine then let me know if you need help at the bar consider ive let you know frank malloys come in with his brothers he had words with his wife again thats the face hes wearing ill not be able to keep up with them and the rest of the customers im coming then he was pulling the second pint for the malloysall of whom were burlybuilt men with strawcolored hair who made their living from the seawhen aidan and finkle stepped out of the snug he nodded good night to aidan then to shawn and for a moment as he glanced toward darcy his stern face fell into lines as soft as a hopeful puppys are you turning in for the evening so early then mr finkle darcy set her tray on the bar then sent the poor man a smile that could have melted slab chocolate at twenty paces i he had no choice but to tug at the meticulously knotted tie as his throat was suddenly thick im afraid i must i have a plane to catch in the morning oh youre leaving us altogether she held out a hand for his im sorry you cant stay longer and hope youll come back again when youre able im quite sure ill be back unable to help himself finkle did something hed never so much as considered doing before in his life even with his wife he kissed darcys hand its been a great pleasure a faint flush of pink riding on his cheeks he left the pub well darcy demanded spinning around to aidan lets give this a minute just to be sure finkle doesnt turn about rush back in and throw himself to his knees to beg you to run off with him to tahiti darcy chuckled and shook her head no the man loves his wife now he might allow himself a misty dream about what the two of us might do in such a place but thats as far as it goes then ill tell you he laid a hand on hers on the bar placed the other on shawns shoulder weve done the deal as the three of us and jude discussed and weve shaken hands on it hes going back to new york and the papers will be drawn up as soon as lawyers can manage it twentyfive percent shawn asked twentyfive and a say in approving the design for the theater there are details yet but between us magee and the lawyers well iron them out so weve done it shawn laid down the cloth hed been using to wipe the bar it appears we have as ive given my word well then shawn put his hand over the one aidan held over darcys ill tend the bar go on and tell jude itll keep were busy good news is more fun when its fresh ill handle it here and close up as well and as a return you can give me the evening off tomorrow if kathy duffy will take the kitchen i havent had a free evening in some time fair enough ill call dad as well he added as he flipped up the passthrough unless youd both rather i wait until morning when we can all speak to him go on and call darcy waved him out hell want to know straight off he was distracted she said to shawn when the door closed im not do you have something with brenna in mind for tomorrow shawn merely took the empty glasses off her tray set them in the bar sink youve customers darling and so have i and he leaned over a bit youve your business and so have i miffed darcy jerked a shoulder its not your business i care a damn about but brenna shes a friend youre nothing but a brother and an irritant at that and knowing her irritant she let it alone shed get nothing out of shawn gallagher if hed decided otherwise with dynamite he had a plan he was good at planning that didnt mean it always worked but he was good at the figuring out of how it should work there was cooking involved and so he was in his element he wanted something simple a dish he could put together then leave to itself until it was needed so he made a tomato sauce with a bit of bite and left it to simmer it required a setting of the stage that was something he preferred and something he believed would give him an advantage he thought a man could use every advantage when it came to brenna otoole it required a phone call which he made from the pub at the end of the lunch shift when he was certain brenna would be up to her neck in whatever job she was doing just as he knew that being brenna shed come by after her workday to take a look at the broken washing machine hed reported so when he got home the sauce hed left warming added an appetizing scent to the air he picked some of the petunias and pansies that were happy to winter over in the garden and put these in the bedroom along with the candles hed bought at the market hed already changed the sheets for fresh which had given him the idea about the washing machine next there was music it was too much a part of his life not to include it in any venture he selected the cds he liked best slipped them into the canny little player hed bought himself months before then left them going while he went down to the kitchen to see to the rest he put out the cat who it seemed sensed something important was going on and so put himself in the way at every opportunity he didnt expect to see her till near to six which gave him enough time to put together a platter of finger food he hunted up wineglasses polished them out then opened the bottle of red hed taken from the pub setting it on the counter to breathe after giving his sauce a last taste and stir he glanced around and nodded in satisfaction it was all fine and done the clock showed ten minutes before six when he heard her lorry pull into his street shes a timely sort he murmured and was taken by surprise when nerves set to dancing in his belly its only brenna for christs sake he told himself youve known her all your life not in the way he was about to he thought nor she him he had a sudden wild urge to dash into the little mudroom and rip something off the washing machine and forget the rest and since when had a gallagher been a coward especially with a woman with this lecture playing in his head he started toward the front door she was already coming in carrying her toolbox her jeans had a fresh rip in them just below the right knee there was a faint smear of dirt across her cheek she closed the front door took two steps then saw him and nearly jumped out of her work boots jesus shawn why not just cosh me over the head as scare the life out of me what are you doing here this time of day ive the evening off you parked behind my car didnt you i did yes but i figured youd walked down or gotten a lift while she waited for her heart rate to return to normal she sniffed the air doesnt smell as though youve taken advantage of a free evening what are you cooking a sauce for spaghetti i thought id try it out before we gave it a go at the pub have you eaten he asked though he already knew i havent no mas expecting me shortly she wasnt as shawn had called down to tell mollie hed give brenna a meal while she was there have your dinner here instead he took her hand leading her back to the kitchen you can judge the sauce for me i might do that but lets have a look at your machine first to see what the matter is theres nothing the matter with it he took her toolbox set it out of the way on the floor what do you mean theres nothing the matter didnt you call up the hotel and say it wouldnt run for you at all i lied try this he plucked up a stuffed olive and popped it into her mouth lied i did yes and im counting on the sin being worth the penance but why would you realization dawned slowly and left her feeling awkward and edgy i see so this is the time and the place that suits you aye i told your mother youd be staying awhile so youve no need to worry about that hmm she looked around the kitchen paying more attention fragrant sauce simmering a pretty plate of fancy appetizers a bottle of wine you might have given me a bit of notice a little time to settle in to the notion youve time now he poured wine into the glasses i know wine tends to give you a head the next morning but a glass or two shouldnt hurt shed risk the hangover if the wine managed to cool her throat you know you didnt have to bother with all this fuss for me i told you from the start i didnt need it well i do and youll just have to tolerate it he was more at ease again because she wasnt he took a step toward her take off your he nearly laughed when her eyes widened your hat he finished then did so himself setting it and his wine aside so he could run his hands through her hair until it tumbled in a way that most pleased him have a seat he nudged her into a chair sat across from her why dont you take off your boots she leaned down tugged on the laces then sat up again do you have to watch me you make me feel foolish if you feel foolish with me watching you take off your boots youre going to feel like a real horses ass before much longer take off your boots brenna he said in a quiet voice that sent a ripple running up her spine unless youve changed your mind about the matter i havent annoyed she bent down again to work on the boots i started this and i finish what i start but it wasnt at all the way shed imagined it shed simply pictured the two of them already naked in bed getting on with business she hadnt given a great deal of thought to the mechanics of arriving there she kicked her boots under the table and made herself look back at him steadily back at him are you hungry no she couldnt conceive of eating under the circumstances dad and i had a late lunch all the better well eat later lets take the wine upstairs upstairs all right theyd go upstairs it had been her idea after all but when he took her hand this time she had to force herself not to bolt this isnt a fair way shawn ive just come from working all day and havent had a chance to clean up would you like a shower then as they walked up the back stairs he rubbed the smudge from her cheek im happy to wash your back im just saying thats all she couldnt shower with him for gods sake not just like that the music drifted toward her a whisper of harpsong her nerves were screaming she stepped into the bedroom saw the flowers the candles the bed and gulped her wine like water easy now he nipped the glass from her hand i dont want you drunk i can handle my drink she began then rubbed her damp palms on her thighs as he wandered around lighting candles theres no need for that its not full dark yet it will be ive seen you in candlelight before he said easily as he touched the flame of the match to the candles hed set on the narrow mantel over the fire hed already set to glowing but i didnt take time to appreciate it i will tonight i dont see why you have to make the situation romantic instead of what it is not afraid of a little romance are you mary brenna no but he turned and the subtle and shifting lights of flame danced over his face behind him around him he might have stepped out of one of the pictures jude drew of faerie princes and valiant knights and poetic harpists theres something about the way you look she managed that makes my mouth water half the time i dont much care for it to be honest with you and id prefer getting it out of my system well now his voice was as smooth as hers was annoyed why dont we see what we can do about that keeping his eyes on hers he crossed to her chapter twelve however odd the situation brenna thought it was still shawn a man shed known and cared for all her life however ridiculous it all seemed she still wanted him nerves were as out of place as the harpsong and the candlelight so when he laid his hands on her shoulders when he ran them lightly down her arms to link with her hands she tipped her head up if i laugh she told him its nothing personal its just the whole business of this that strikes me funny all right since he only stood watching her seemed to be waiting she rose to her toes and took his mouth with hers she didnt mean to rush it as shed already concluded he wouldnt allow that in any case but at that first taste she wanted more she wanted it all and quickly her hands flexed in his as she chewed on his bottom lip ive got this powerful urge for you i cant help it whos asking you to he wouldnt rush no but it was tempting to pick up the pace that fascinating little body of hers was already vibrating against his and her mouth was like a fever but he thought it would be much more satisfying all around to let her drive him crazy for a while yet come up here he let go of her hands to take her hips to hitch her up so that her legs wrapped his waist as theyd done once before and kiss me again i like it now she did laugh and the nerves that had worried her flitted away do you now well as i recall the first time i did it she brought her mouth to within a breath of his then drew backonce twice you looked as though id coshed you over the head with my hammer thats because i wasnt expecting it and you turned my brain upside down he gave her bottom an intimate and friendly squeeze bet you cant do it again oh so its a wager is it eyes glinting with the challenge with the fun she fisted her hands in his hair youre about to lose she put herself into her work he had to give her that he could all but feel his eyes roll back in his head as her mouth attacked his there were times when surrender wasnt a humbling experience at all there was a hint of wine still on her tongue warm and rich mixed with her own flavor it spun into him a lovely and intoxicating combination harpsong and candlelight a hotblooded woman twined around him he let both the passion and the romance pump into his system alluring arousing pleasure took on a fine sharp edge she felt his fingers dig into her hips heard his breath quicken like a man whod done a fast sprint up a long hill when he shifted turning toward the bed triumph flashed through her she would have him now her way fast and furious and done then this terrible pressure in her chest her belly her head would find release her breath caught in a laughing gasp when he spilled her onto the bed then covered her pressed her into the mattress tight body to tight body ill have to give you that one there was a gleam in her eye that only sharpened when he pulled her hands over her head and cuffed her wrists but now its my turn as i recall the first time i kissed you your eyes went blurry and blind he closed his teeth gently over her jaw and you trembled deliberately she arched her hips pressed against him ill bet you cant do it again a man that aroused that ready wouldnt dawdle she was sure of it still she braced herself and still she trembled when his lips skimmed tenderly tormentingly over hers her arms went limp her mind blank as glass the pressure that had built to crisis point slid into a glorious aching the first hint of the rising moon slipped into the room to shimmer silver against the gold of candle flames he cupped her breasts his fingers tracing the shape of her against her work shirt before moving to the buttons she wore a mans white tshirt beneath after he tugged the denim aside shawn found himself fascinated at just how sexy her small breasts looked felt under that simple white cotton ive always liked your hands she had her eyes closed now the better to absorb the little shocks of sensation i like them even better now but when he lowered again when his mouth closed over her through the cotton her eyes flew open oh sweet jesus he might have chuckled if he could have found the breath for it but his lungs were clogged and his head already starting to reel where had this been all his life this taste this texture this shape how much more had he missed she was tugging off his sweater as he dragged her up breath ragged they stared at each other whatever shock there was on both sides she nodded as he did too late was all he said and pulled the shirt over her head thanks be to god they dived at each other his hands might have been faster now and just a bit rough here and there his mouth might have been hotter more impatient than it had but it didnt stop him from being thorough he wanted every bit of her and would remember always the taste of her flesh that tender spot just under her breast the way that angle went to curve from her rib cage to her hip and the silken feel of it all under his palm and fingertips the strength of her was no small matter and outrageously erotic as they rolled together as he felt her muscles bunch erotic still when he made that strength waver toward weakness feeling her shudder against him when he found some new spot that pleased her the music was flutes now lilting and faerielike a rise of pipes beneath it the moonlight strengthened a pearl gleam on the air that was fragrant with candle wax and turf smoke she buried her face against his throat fighting to catch her breath shawn for gods sake now not yet not yet not yet he said it like a chant he wanted those small strong hands of hers never to stop running over him he wanted to find more and still more of her with his own didnt those lovely legs deserve his attention now that hed tugged the ripped denim away and the back of her shoulder was such a marvelous place to linger for a little thing theres so much of you desperate she sank her teeth into him ill die in a minute here now here and his mouth took hers again as he slid his hand between her legs slipped his fingers into the heat she came in a flood fast and full with her body bucking against him he swallowed her cry of shock and release absorbed it savored it even as his blood burned for more then she was pliant soft as the wax that pooled at the base of his candles and he was free to feast on her mouth on her throat on her breasts just let me have you for a while the pressure built again layer by layer slick and slippery until she slid off the edge a second time how could he bear it she wondered his flesh was damp as hers his heart leaping as high and fast his body as tensed and ready once again she arched against him once again she wrapped her legs tight around his waist and their eyes met in the shifting light now he murmured it as he slipped into her silky and smooth as if theyd mated a thousand times before her breath trembled in then out his hands covered hers and she laced her fingers with his they watched each other as they began to move easy and lovely like a dance remembered rising and falling pleasure met with pleasure then as if the music demanded it a subtle quickening of pace his eyes were darker now that dreamy blue going opaque as he lost himself when she tightened around him when her eyelids fluttered closed and the moan rippled her throat he held on held on then he buried his face in her hair and let himself go she was going to need a minute perhaps an hour a day or two might be best after that she imagined she could move again or at the very least think about moving but for now it seemed like the finest of ideas to just stay as she was sprawled over shawns bed with him plastering her into the mattress her body was absolutely golden she imagined that if she had the energy to open her eyes and look shed see it glow in the dark it was just as shed said before once the man stopped thinking he did a fine job of things you arent cold are you his voice was muffled and sleepy i doubt id be cold if we were lying naked on an ice floe heading for greenland good he shifted settled in lets just be here for a little while yet just dont fall asleep on top of me he made some sound and nuzzled i like the way your hair smells sawdust theres some of that its nice enough and theres a hint of lemon with it its probably the shampoo i stole from patty her body was waking up again and she began to take more notice to the way he fit against her the way their legs were tangled even as interest began to stir she also noticed the sheer weight of him youre heavier than you look sorry he tucked an arm under her and rolled better it wasnt so bad before but now that he mentioned it it was better to be able to cross her arms over his chest and look down at his face it was so damn pretty that face that she didnt even mind for now the smug way his lips were curved i have to say shawn youre better at the entire business than i figured on he opened his eyes the blue of them was dreamy again well ill admit to having some practice over the years i wont complain about that but theres a problem just the same is there he picked up a lock of her hair twined the curl of it around his finger and what would it be well my idea originally was that wed have sex i recall you mentioning it he let the curl unwind then fall then chose another and i have to admit a fine idea it was that was the first part i mentioned as well that i was looking to do that in order to get this urge i had for you out of my system i recall that as well an itch you said he ran his nails lightly down her back ive done my best to scratch it for you you did and id never deny it but thats the problem part watching him she trailed a finger along his collarbone up the side of his neck and watched his lashes flutter until his eyes were a slit of blue behind them well whats your problem then otoole you see it hasnt appeared to work as yet it seems ive still got this itch so well just have to have sex again if we must we must he sat up taking her with him lets have a shower and a meal first then well see what can be done chuckling she laid her hands on his cheeks were still friends too arent we were still friends he cuddled her closer and intended for the kiss to be light and affectionate but he sank into her her mind was going fuzzy when he turned to lay her back on the bed her arms were reaching up for him as she said what about the shower and the meal later it was later and a great deal later and they both ate like starving wolves here it was easy to fall back into friendship to be two people whod shared meals hundreds of times before did you know betsy clooneys whole broods down with the chicken pox have you noticed jack brennans eyeing theresa fitzgerald now that she and colin riley have broken things off between bites she told him of her sister pattys latest flood of tears over whether to have pink or yellow roses in her bridal bouquet and they lifted a glass to toast the closure of the deal with magee are you thinking hell send a man out to get the lay of the land and design the theater brenna got up to let bub in when he came scratching at the door if thats his plan it hasnt come down to me as yet he watched the cat slink over to brenna to rub against her leg sure its the only way it can be done correctly she considered another serving then decided if she gave in to greed on that shed suffer with a little regret she pushed her plate away he cant be sitting up in his lofty office in new york city and design what should be here in ardmore and how do you know he has a lofty office the rich are fond of lofty grinning she kicked back in her chair ask darcy if lofty isnt an aim when she finds the rich man shes hunting for in any case they have to see what we are and what we have before they set in their minds what well be ill agree with that he rose to clear the table i liked your design maybe you could draw it up a little more formally we could give aidan a look at it if he likes it as i do theres nothing stopping us from passing it onto the magee for his consideration for a moment she simply sat youd do that he glanced over his shoulder as he ran hot water and soap into the sink why wouldnt i it would mean a great deal even if magee laughs it off and tosses it aside it would matter to me im not an architect or engineer or anything that lofty she decided as she got to her feet but ive always had a yen to have a hand in the designing and the building of something from the ground up you get a picture in your head he said an empty field or lot and what youd put on it right down to the fancy work thats right yes how did you know its not so different from building a song thinking of it she frowned at his back never once had she considered that they had anything in common in that area i suppose youre right ill draw it up for you as best i can whether the magee takes a look at it or not im grateful to you for thinking of it she helped him clean up then as it was nearing midnight said she had to go he walked her out and theyd made it nearly to the front door before he changed his mind he settled it by simply plucking her up hauling her over his shoulder and carting her up to bed once again as a result it was halfone when she crept into her house creeping was about all she had the energy for who would have thought the man could near to wear her out she switched off the light her mother had left on for her even in the dark she knew which boards which part of the steps would creak underfoot she made it upstairs and into her room without a sound and since she wasnt a mother she was comfortably unaware that her own had heard her despite the precautions once she slipped into bed she let out a long sigh shut her eyes and fell instantly asleep and in sleep dreamed of a silver palace beneath a green hill around it grew flowers and grand trees that stood out like paintings in the gilded light a ribbon of river ran through them with little diamonds sparkling on its surface in a flash here and there that shocked the eye a bridge arched over it its stones marblewhite as she crossed it she heard the click of her own boots the bubble of the water below and the quick skip of her own heart that wasnt fear but excitement the trees she saw were heavy with golden apples silver pears for an instant she was tempted to pluck one to bite into that rich flesh and taste but even in dreams she knew that if you visited a fearie raft you could eat nothing and drink only water or you were bound there for a hundred years so she only watched the jeweled fruit glint and the path leading under them from the white bridge to the great silver door of the palace was red as rubies as she approached the door it opened and out of it spilled the music of pipes and flutes she stepped inside into the music and into perfumed air where torches as tall as men lined the walls with flames that shot as high and true as arrows the hall was wide and filled with flowers there were chairs with curvy arms and deep cushions all the color of precious gems but she saw no one following the music she climbed the stairs trailing her hand along a banister that was smooth as silk and glinted like a long slender sapphire still there was no sound but the music no movement but her own at the top of the stairs there was another long corridor as wide as the space two grown men would make were they laid head to foot to her left as she traveled along the corridor was a door of topaz and to the right one of emerald straight ahead was a third that glowed white as pearls and it was from there that the music came she opened the white door and stepped inside flowers twined and tangled up the walls tables the size of lakes groaned under the weight of platters filled with food the scents were sensuous the floor was a mosaic a symphony of jewels placed in random patterns there were chairs and cushions and plush sofas but all were empty all but the throne at the rooms head there lounging in the grandeur was a man in a silver doublet you never hesitated he said theres courage in that not once did you think of turning around you just walked straight into whats unknown to you he offered her a smile and with a wave of his hand the gold apple that appeared in it you may have a taste for this i may but i havent a century to spare you he laughed and flicking his fingers vanished the apple i wouldnt have let you as ive more use for you above than here curious she turned in a circle are you alone then not alone no even faeries like to sleep the light was to guide you its night here as it is in your world i wanted to speak with you and preferred to do so alone well then she lifted her arms let them fall im here ive a question for you mary brenna otoole ill try to answer it carrick prince of faeries his lips twitched again with amused approval but his eyes were intense and sober as he leaned toward her would you take a pearl from a lover an odd question indeed she thought but after all it was a dream and shed had stranger ones i would if it was given freely with a sigh he tapped his hand on the wide arm of his throne the ring he wore flashed silver and blue why is it there are always strings attached to answers when dealing with mortals why is it faeries are never satisfied with an honest answer humor brightened his eyes youre a bold one arent you its a fortunate thing ive a fondness for mortals i know you have she walked closer now ive seen your lady she pines for you i dont know if that heavies your heart or lightens it but its what i know resting his chin on his feet he brooded i know her heart now that its too late for me to do much more than wait must there be pain in love before theres fulfillment i havent the answer youve part of it he muttered and straightened again you are part of the answer tell me now whats in your heart for shawn gallagher before she could speak he lifted a hand in warning hed seen the temper flash over her face before you speak mind this youre in my world here and its the simplest of matters for me to make you speak truth only truth we both prefer you answer of your own will i dont know whats in my heart youll have to take that as your truth for ive nothing more then its time you looked and time you knew isnt it he sighed again not troubling to hide his disgust but you wont till youre ready go on to sleep then with a sweep of his arm he was alone with his thoughts in the jeweled light and brenna slept dreamlessly now in her bed she got no more than four hours sleep but went through the day fueled with energy most often a late night followed by an early morning left her out of sorts and cross most of the day but in this case she was so cheerful that her father commented on her bright mood more than once she didnt feel she could tell him what she told herself it was good healthy sex that had her whistling through her work as close as they were and as much as she loved him she doubted her father would want to know how shed spent her evening she remembered the dream remembered it so clearly so precisely that she wondered if she was filling in some blanks without meaning to but it wasnt anything she was going to muddle over for long thats about all for the day wouldnt you say brenna darling mick straightened up stretched his back then glanced over to where his daughter was squatted down painting the floor molding his lips pursed when he noted she was painting the same six inches over and over with lazy swipes of the brush brenna hmm dont you think you might have just about enough paint on that space of wood by this time what oh she dipped the brush again then made sure to hit the fresh wood my mind mustve wandered its time to call it a day already with a shake of his head he gathered up brushes rollers and pans what was it your mother put in your oatmeal this morning to give you such pep and why didnt i have any the day went by fast thats all she got to her feet looked around with some surprise she noted just how much had been done shed gone through the day on automatic pilot she supposed weve nearly finished in here by tomorrow itll be on to the next we deserve big portions of that roast your mother promised for tonight youre tired dad ill clean this up that at least would soften some of the guilt she was going to feel and you know i was thinking id go on into the pub and see darcy would you tell ma ill be grabbing a sandwich there he looked pained when she took the brushes from him youre after deserting me when you know sure as youre born your mother and patty will be into the wedding plans and buzzing around me ears brenna shot him a grin shed forgotten about that and the more genuine excuse not to go straight home want to come to the pub with me you know i would but then your motherd have my head on her best china platter at least give me your word that when your time comes round you wont ask me if i like the lace or the silk best then burst into tears when i pick the wrong one a solemn promise she kissed his cheek to seal it im holding you to it girl he shrugged his jacket on and if things get over sticky at home you may see me down at gallaghers after all ill buy you a pint when he was gone brenna put more time and effort into the cleaning than she had to it made her feel a little less guilty though truth to tell she would be seeing darcy when she went to the village if she saw shawn as well how could she help it he worked there didnt he despite the rationalization brenna made a point of seeking darcy out the minute she walked into the pub since she was down at the end of the bar letting old mr riley flirt with her brenna took the next stool then leaned over to kiss the mans papery cheek and here i find you making eyes at another woman when time and time again youve said you had them for none but me oh now darling a mans got to look in the direction his heads pointed but ive been waiting for you to come along and sit on my knee the man was so thin and she suspected his bones so brittle that an attempt to sit on his knee would shatter it oh we otoole women are jealous creatures dear mr riley now im after taking darcy here aside and giving her a stern piece of my mind for trying to beat my time with you when he cackled she wandered to a table gesturing for darcy to follow im dying for a pint and a hot meal whats shawn got for us tonight darcy narrowed brightblue eyes cocked a dark brow then fisted a hand on her hip well then youve gone and slept with him havent you what are you talking about though darcys voice had been quiet brennas head swiveled in panicked embarrassment until she was assured no one was close enough to hear you think i cant look at a woman ive known since i was born and not see shes had a tumble the night before with shawn you cant be sure as hes half the time got that dreaming look in his eyes but you thats a different kettle so what if i did brenna hissed it as she sat down i said i was going to and no she said as soon as she caught the glint i wont be telling you about it who said id want to know but of course she did she sat herself leaned close one thing no not even one one thingweve had one thing no matter who or what our whole lives damn it it was true and to break tradition now would be breaking a bond four times last night four eyes widened darcy looked toward the kitchen as if she could peer right through the door and pin her brother to the opposite wall well i have to give him a raise in my estimation and its hardly a wonder youre looking relaxed i feel wonderful does it really show you have to look for it ive customers reluctantly darcy rose ill get you a pintand id try the poached chicken tonight people have been pleased with it i will then but i think ill see if i cant have it back in the kitchen fine get your own pint on your way do you want to stay up with me tonight ill bet i can get a bit more out of you you probably could as youre a sneaky nagging sort but i need to go home early i didnt get much sleep last night braggart darcy said with a laugh and flounced off to take an order and how are you brenna aidan asked when she came behind the bar why how do i look he glanced over as her response had been so sharp well you look fine to me i am fine cursing herself under her breath she drew a pint of harp from the tap im a bit tired i suppose i thought id have this and a plate back in the kitchen if its all right with you before i head home youre welcome as always ah will you need an extra hand at all this week aidan i could use yours both friday and saturday nights if you have them free they are ill come round casually she hoped she moved past and pushed open the kitchen door can you spare a hungry woman a hot meal he turned from the sink where he had the water running hot and full his eyes wanned as she lifted her glass to his own lips i think i might have something youll like i wondered if youd wander my way tonight i wanted to see darcy she laughed and sat down with her beer and maybe i dont mind so much seeing you as well he turned the water off pulled at the cloth tucked into his waistband and dried his hands and how would your system be oh my systems doing well thank you though there does seem to be a little bit of a hitch in it still would you be wanting some help with that i wouldnt mind it he walked to her chair and leaning over the back of it sent the system under discussion churning with his teeth on her ear come home with me tonight she shivered couldnt help it there was something unspeakably erotic about the voice the suggestion when she couldnt see his face i cant you know i cant itd be too hard to explain to my family i dont know when i can get another night off her vision wavered doubled as he did something clever with his tongue behind her ear how about mornings it so happens all my mornings for the foreseeable future are free ill come by the first chance i get he straightened then plucking off her cap ran a hand down her hair in a way that made her want to stretch like a cat and purr the doors always open chapter thirteen the morning was soft gentle rain pattered over flowers coming awake for spring fog very thin and nearly white skimmed along the ground and would be burned away at the first ray of sun to beam through the clouds faerie hill cottage was quiet when brenna stepped inside even faeries like to sleep she remembered perhaps ghosts did as well and chose gray and rainy dawns for their dreaming times for herself she was full of energy and she knew exactly how she planned to use it she sat at the base of the stairs to take off her boots then decided it was as good a place as any to dispense with her jacket and cap as well when she hung the cap on the newel post she tapped a finger lightly to the little faerie pin she kept hooked there it had outlasted a number of caps she wondered if anyone but shawn would have thought to give it to her as he had years before most when they gave her gifts chose something practical a tool or a book warm socks or a sturdy work shirt that was how most saw her after all how she saw herself if it came to it a practical person with little time for the foolish or the pretty but from shawn it had been a little silver faerie with slanted eyes and pointed wings and she wondered if someone else had given it to her would she have worn it nearly every day since without really thinking about it she didnt know the answer to either nor the meaning of either so she shrugged thinking that was just the way it was between them however it was her pulse quickened as she climbed the stairs he was sleeping all but buried under sheets and blankets and dead center of the bed like a man who was used to having the place to himself the cat made a black circle on the foot of the covers but opened his eyes a cool steady gleam when brenna stepped in guarding him are you well hell never hear it from me now then unless youre after being embarrassed or envious in very short order id take myself off somewhere else bub arched his back then as if it was an afterthought leaped down to wind his way through brennas legs she reached to give him one long stroke sorry darling but ive a mind to pet someone else this morning the man surely made use of every inch of bed well he was about to share it she thought and unbuttoned her shirt if hed bothered to build a fire the night before it had died to ash kindling one now to chase the chill away might wake him she had plans to do that by other methods altogether he was a quiet sleeper she noted as she stripped down to the skin one who appeared to nestle into dreams without a lot of rolling about as she recalled he slept deep as wellhadnt she heard mrs gallagher shout him awake dozens of times when shed spent the night with darcy down the hall so they would soon see how much time and trouble it took to wake him by other means it was exciting to watch him when he didnt know when he was defenseless when he had no idea of what she had in mind for him his face held both strength and beauty and she supposed a kind of innocence now but then shed always considered shawn a great deal more innocent than herself he believed in things believed they would just happen along at the right time without a body having to take a hand in it put their back into it thats what bothered her the most about him when it came to his music what did the man think that someone would just wander into the cottage and buy up the tunes he had scribbled on papers it wasnt enough to write them why didnt he see that bonelazy she supposed then shook her head if she kept thinking of that shed work herself right out of the mood and that would be a terrible waste of a morning naked she walked to the bed slipped under the covers and straddled him her mouth fit over his she intended to start the process with a reverse on the waking of sleeping beauty but she didnt intend to stop with a kiss he was steeped in dreams all a blur of color and shape a pleasant place to be sensation slowly weaved its way through the warm flavor of woman that stirred the blood and roused the mind then the scent of hersubtle familiar so that the next indrawn breath thickened the pulse and the shape of her the feel of flesh sliding along flesh he lifted a hand lost it in that wonderfully wild tangle of hair even as he murmured her name she was shifting over him surrounding him taking him in the first burst of lust exploded inside him while he was still half sleeping he thrust up into her helpless trapped in a web of need woven while hed been dreaming for the first time in memory he could do nothing to finesse control over his own body nothing but let himself be taken when he opened his eyes she rose over him in the soft gray light her hair bright as fire her eyes sharp and green then she bowed back fisting her hands in her own hair as she rode them both to finish mother of god was all he could manage and nothing could have pleased her more good morning to you she felt golden and bright and thats all the time i have for you ive got to be going what why he grabbed for her hand but she slipped nimbly out of reach well im finished with you boyo and ive work to do come back he thought about sitting up but only rolled to his side ill do better by you now that im waking up i did well enough by both of us she tugged her tshirt on then shrugged the flannel one over it and im expected at the hotel as it is ive got to take at least a quick look at your car since i told dad that was why i was coming by here first tonight then he only grunted when the cat leaped up on his ass and nipped it with his claws find a way and stay here tonight stay was the word that made her uneasy but she snuck a glance at him while she pulled on her work pants his eyes were half closed im working at the pub tomorrow night i can say im sleeping over with darcy why do you have to lie you know how people would talk if anyone knew we were seeing each other this way and that matters of course it does this time when she looked over at him she was surprised to note his eyes werent sleepy but focused and alert is this something that shames you then brenna no but its private ill have a look at your car now and the fact is ill give it a good goingover first chance i have she leaned over to kiss him then shoved back her hair ill be back round soon as i can he rolled over onto his back annoying bub enough to set the cat to stalking off again alone he stared at the ceiling until he heard her shut the front door behind her when he wondered had he started wanting more why should she be the one he wanted more from what was this need that was growing inside him had it always been there questions he thought in disgust well he seemed to have plenty of them without the first answer he rolled out of bed and might have sulked off into the shower but the sound of his own car starting up drew him to the window brenna was just rounding to the bonnet and as he watched she yanked it open stuck her head under he imagined she was already muttering curses because hed neglected this or allowed that to get dirty it never did him a bit of good to tell her that as far as he was concerned everything in there was dirty and mysterious and not of any particular interest to him as long as the engine started when he turned the key he didnt give a rats ass what made the whole business possible she would of course a born tinkerer was brenna she was never happier than when she had something taken apart and all the pieces of it spread out for her examination it made him think he should ask her to have a go at his toaster as it was burning one side of everything he put in it then she pulled her head out slammed the bonnet smartly she shot a look up at the window where he was standing and her eyes full of righteous annoyance flashed to his he sent her what he knew was a cheeky grin in return before she stomped off to her lorry the way her mouth was moving he assumed she was assigning him to the devil rain sprinkled down on her as she hitched herself into her lorry he watched as she with her usual energy and carelessness bulleted in reverse into the road then zipped away over bumps but he was no longer smiling amusement had fallen away into sheer shock he had one of the answers now and he didnt care for it one bit he was in love with her bloody stinking hell what in the wide world am i supposed to do with that he started to jam his hands into his pockets but got no satisfaction as he was naked he turned intending to drown himself in the shower in the hopes the feeling would pass lady gwen stood just inside the doorway her hands folded neatly watching him sweet jesus however foolish it was he snatched the blanket from the bed and wrapped it around him a mans entitled to his privacy in his own home flustered and fumbling he stared back at her she looked as real as he felt and as lovely as all the legends professed now her eyes were full of quiet sympathy and an understanding that had his gut churning uneasily she was there no question that she was there and the cat had come back to ribbon around her skirts and purr ferociously so is this what you were waiting for before you showed yourself to me for me to realize something that hurts well its said misery loves company but i prefer to nurse my own wounds alone she walked to him graceful dignified those soft eyes swimming with emotion he saw her lift a hand and though he felt no pressure no slide of skin to skin he felt the touch of it against his cheek as gentle comfort then she was gone he did what he usually did when he came up against something he didnt want to deal with he tucked it into a corner of his mind trusting hed work out some solution eventually and dived into his music it balanced him fed his heart as close as he was to his family hed never been able to explain what it meant to him to be able to hear music in his head to feel it inside him then to be able to make it sound in the air it was the one thing hed always hadand having neededand needing feared losing until brenna hed always had her as well and needed her without realizing how deep that need was rooted and now knowing he feared losing her and what hed just discovered thoughtfully he opened the little box hed put on the piano inside hed placed the pearl hed been given at maudes grave he understood now what carrick wanted him to do with it but he was far from ready to offer that pearl and himself to brenna whatever others had planned for him he would move in his own time and in his own way hed promised brenna friendship he wouldnt go back on his word but he was beginning to understand just what keeping it would cost him if he couldnt win the whole of her heart the woman whod come to his bed that morning wasnt looking for romance and the promise of a future she was looking only at the moment and the pleasures it could bring he hadnt been so different himself at other times with other women it didnt sit comfortably to be the one pining since comfort was important to him he didnt intend to pine for long it was just a matter of figuring which steps to take in what order and in which direction and as it was brenna he knew that he would get to his objective faster and smoother if he found a way to make her believe it was all her idea in the first place so he ran his hands lightly over the keys he just had to work it out so that he was in the position of being courted by brenna otoole he was amused enough by the notion that his fingers began to move faster to make the tune livelier even as he stopped to scribble down the notes words began to jump into his head come back round so you can catch me ill give you a dance as long as you please but circle back soon my redhaired lovely for its only you im wanting to tease now kiss me quick and say that youll love me from now till ever birds sing in the trees im waiting right here so you can convince me the times come to get down on my knees it made him see the humor of it all and smoothed out the knot of tension from the back of his neck after all how could anyone who knew the pair of them not see the absurdity of it she the planner he the dreamer why they rammed up against each others basic personalities at least as often as they meshed well what did the heart know about the logic of things and he was wise enough to know that if hed fallen for someone more like himself theyd while their lives away without getting the first thing accomplished and though he couldnt think of a man like brenna he imagined if shed come across one the two of them would hammer each others brains out within a week so in the big scheme of things by falling in love with her and arranging for her to decide they should make what was between them a permanent thing he was only saving her from a brief and certainly violent life though he thought it might be best all round if he kept that opinion strictly to himself satisfied he closed the pearl back in its box left his music scattered about and went off to start his day of work he baked apple tarts with brennas appetite in mind if he was going to approach the business from a kind of rolereversal angle baking one of her favorite weaknesses seemed rather canny he toyed with the idea of trying to talk himself out of being in love with her as he imagined people did when the fit wasnt as comfortable as they might prefer he even imagined he could do a fair job of it starting with listing all the reasons why it wasnt a wise idea the head of that would be the simple fact that he hadnt planned on falling in love not seriously for years yet and when he imagined the woman on the receiving end it was always a soft feminine gentlenatured sort a comfortable woman he thought as he trimmed his pastry there was nothing comfortable about the otoole for all she was a blessing in bed after all much as it appealed a man couldnt spend his life in bed with a hotblooded naked woman which made him think about the morning and the way shed ridden him to a blind sweaty finish before his brain had even waked up which made him a great deal less comfortable altogether so being shawn he put that thought away for the time being it hadnt been the sex hed fallen in love with that had simply been the key that opened him up so hed see what had been waiting inside him for her shed never be an easy woman god knew shed poke and shed prod at him until he was ready to throttle her she would pick fights and would always find the way to put his own temper on the boil but jesus she could make him laugh and she knew half of what was in his mind before hed gotten the words out there was treasure in that she knew his every flaw and didnt hold any of them against him overmuch she didnt think much of his music and that stung more than a little but he chose to think it just a lack of understanding just as he had no interest or knowledge of what mysteries were under the bonnet of his car whatever the weight of the scale for or against didnt matter his heart was already hers all he had to do was make her realize she wanted to keep it he fancied up the pastries adding bits of dough in little designs the way hed seen in a picture somewhere after brushing the lot of them with egg wash he popped them into the oven when darcy came in he was whistling over the gallaghers irish stew he had simmering in his big pot my larders bare as the top of rory oharas head i need a sandwich before shift starts ill make it shawn cut her off before she could grab from the refrigerator youll just leave a mess for me to clean up otherwise ill have some of that roast beef if theres any left theres enough well then dont be stingy she sat propping her legs on the chair beside her as much to admire her new shoes as to rest her feet before the long shift ahead when she noted the bowls hed yet to wash she sniffed the air is that apple tarts you have in the oven it might be and i might see theres one left for you if you dont badger me experimentally she ran a finger around the inside of the bowl that had held the filling and licked i seem to recall that brenna favors apple tarts particularly shawn sliced the sandwich neatly in two knowing darcy would complain otherwise i recall that as well his expression bland he slid the sandwich in front of her are you darcy cut herself off picked up the first half of her lunch no i dont want to know my best friend and my brother she said over the first bite i never thought to have to work to keep that image out of my head well keep working at it curious he sat across from her youre friends with jude and it never seemed to bother you that she and aidan i was new friends with jude darcy stared at him over her sandwich with eyes that were blue and sulky its a different matter entirely it has to be your face she decided because she knows you through and through so its certainly not your riveting personality shes just dazzled by the look of you as theres no denying youve a strong and handsome face youre only saying that because we look so much alike her teeth flashed before she bit in again thats true enough but we cant help being beautiful can we darling we can only do our best to bear the terrible weight of it then offer it up he said it ponderously and made her snicker well its a burden i enjoy carrying and if a man doesnt want to look any further than my face ive nothing to complain over its enough that i know ive a mind behind it is the dubliner youve been seeing treating you like a pet then she moved a shoulder annoyed with herself for being dissatisfied with a relationship that held so much potential he enjoys my company and takes me nice places in fine style and because it was shawn she could hiss out a breath where he spends half the time bragging about himself and his work and expecting me to be impressed beyond speech and the thing of it is hes not nearly as smart as he thinks he is and owes most of his accomplishments such as they are to family connections rather than his own hard work or skill youre tired of him she opened her mouth closed it again then shrugged i am yes whats wrong with me if i tell you youll be after throwing that plate at me i wont as a sign of truce she pushed it aside this time all right then ill tell you whats the matter you underestimate yourself darcy then you get annoyed when others do the same you dont have any respect for the men who fall at your feet promising to give you the world on a platter youve filled your own platter all your life and carried it with your own hands and you know you can keep doing it i want more she said it fiercely finding herself inexplicably on the verge of tears whats wrong with wanting more nothing nothing at all he reached out to close his hand over hers i want to go places see things have things she shoved away from the table prowling the kitchen as if it were a cage i cant help wanting it everything would be easier if i could be a little bit in love with him just a little would be enough but im not and i cant talk myself into it so i woke up this morning knowing id be breaking it off and tossing away a lovely trip to paris thats the right thing to do im not doing it because its the right thing to do frustrated she threw up her hands im doing it because im not having my first trip to paris spoiled by sharing it with a man whod bore my brains out shawn she came back to the table sat again and leaning forward spoke seriously im not a nice person he took her hand again patted it i love you anyway it took her a minute then her eyes lit with appreciation i should have known better than to expect you to list my virtues but i feel better in any case because she did she dipped her finger in the bowl again scooped out another smear of filling i wish i could find someone to have a bit of fun and frolic with like you and brenna she might not have caught it the quick change in the eyes before he rose to clear the table but she knew him as well as often better than she knew herself damn it all i was afraid of this youve gone and fallen for her havent you its not for you to worry about it is of course it is when i love both of you you great blockhead couldnt you just enjoy yourself like any other man he thought of that morning and licked a bit of apple filling himself i am enjoying myself and how long will that last now that youve fallen in love with her interested he glanced back at her as he began to work does the fun go out of such matters when love walks in it does when it only walks through one of the doors and the other stays shut you dont have much confidence in me for finding a way of opening a closed door if i put my mind to it shawn i dont want to hurt you and neither would brenna but she told me straight out that she only wanted to sleep with you she was clear enough about what she wanted this time he smiled i want more whats wrong with wanting more this isnt the time to throw my own words back at my head im worried for you dont be he washed the largest of the bowls by hand rather than crowd the dishwasher i know what im about i cant help my feelings and before you say it he continued i know she cant help hers either but whats wrong with doing what i can to change her feelings the minute she thinks youre courting her but i wont be shell be courting me darcys first response was a snort but then she stopped considered arent you the clever one she murmured clever enough to know brenna will prefer to do the persuading rather than be the persuaded he checked his tarts adjusted the heat i expect what weve said here to stay here between the two of us as if id go running off to tell brenna what falls out of your mouth insulted she grabbed a tray his stare from under raised brows made her relent all right in the general way of things thats what i do but this is a different matter you can trust me he knew he could she might try to fracture his skull with a flying plate but darcy would bite off her tongue before betraying a confidence i suppose that means you wont be carrying back to me whatever she might have to say about certain things it does indeed look for your spies elsewhere my lad nose in the air she started to flounce out then there came a hiss of breath from her and she stopped she doesnt think shes built in a particularly attractive way since it was the last thing hed expected to hear shawn merely stared until darcy cursed under her breath im only telling you because she never said it outright to me in just those words but she thinks of her body as a practical thing and not as female as it could be she doesnt think men find her particularly attractivefemalelike and thats why the sex is just sex in her thinking she doesnt believe a man might look at her in a romantic or tender sort of way she paused a moment tried not to wonder if brenna would forgive her if her friend knew shed said such things a woman likes to be told well if youve any brain in your head you should know what a woman likes to be told and its not a matter of just grabbing hold of whats different from yours but telling now close your mouth because you look halfwitted she let the door swing shut behind her chapter fourteen and youll remember dennis magee who went off to americawell neither of us remembers it precisely as its been fifty years if its a day and we werent yet born or barely so in my own case at the time he left old parish but youll remember hearing of it and how he made his fortune with land and building and such over in new york city kathy duffy sat cozily in the otooles kitchen sipping tea and nibbling on iced cakesthough if truth be known the batter could have used just a splash more vanillawhile she shared news and gossip as she was used to having ten words to say for anyone elses one she didnt notice her friends distraction but kept chattering away with the hottest bulletin in old parish always a clever one was dennis so everyone who knew him said and he married deborah casey who was a cousin of my mothers and was reputed to have a good head on her shoulders as well off they went across the foam with their firstborn still in short pants they did well for themselves in america built up a fine business you know old maude was betrothed to the john magee who was lost in the war and he was brother to dennis in all these years kathy went on as she licked a bit of icing from her finger it seems dennis never did look back to ireland or the place where he was born but he had himself a son and the son a son and that one hes looking right enough she waited a beat and mollie roused herself to raise her eyebrows is he he is yes and hes got his sights set on ardmore planning to build a theater here oh yes mollie stirred the tea shed yet to taste i heard brenna talking about it distracted she was but not so deeply that she didnt notice kathys crestfallen expression i dont have the details of it she said to smooth her friends feathers well then delighted kathy edged forward theres a deal being done between the magees in new york city and the gallaghers the word round is theyll be building the theater onto the pub a kind of music hall if im hearing correctly imagine that mollie a music hall right in ardmore and with the gallaghers having their fingers in it if its to be id be happier knowing one of our own had some say in the matter do you know if dennis magee the younger will be coming back to ardmore i dont see how the matter can be done otherwise kathy sat back patted her hair her niece had given her a home perm the week before and she was well pleased with it each curl was like a soldier tucked up in his bedroll dennis and i had a bit of a flirt when we were both young and foolish and he came to visit one summer back some years kathys eyes went dreamy as she looked back on his grand tour was he and wanted to see the place where his parents had been born and reared and where he himself spent the first years of his life he was a finelooking man dennis magee as i recall him the way i remember things you had a bit of a flirt with every finelooking man before you plucked the one you were after kathys eyes went bright with humor whats the point of being young and foolish if you do otherwise because it was one of the things worrying her mollie managed a wan smile and let her old friend settle back into chattering mollie was certain that her oldest daughter was having a great deal more than a flirtation with shawn gallagher that wasnt such a shock not really but the fact that brenna wasnt talking of it with her was both a shock and a concern shed raised her girls to know there was nothing they couldnt share with their mother shed known the night her maureen had fallen in love as the girl had come in flushed and laughing and full of the wonder of it and when kevin had asked her patty to marry shed known the minute her girl had come into the house and thrown herself weeping into her mothers arms that was the way with them maureen laughing over joys and patty weeping over them but brenna the most practical of her children had done neither nor had she as mollie had expected sat down and spoken of what had changed with shawn hadnt she left that very morning saying that she would be staying over with darcy that night and not quite looking her mother in the eye when she lied it hurt knowing your child had the need to lie to you where have you gone off to hmm mollie focused on kathys face again shook her head im sorry i cant seem to keep my mind on things these days its no wonder youve one daughter married only months ago and another planning her wedding is it making you blue a little i suppose because shed let her tea go cold and kathys cup was empty mollie rose to pour hers down the sink and refill both cups with fresh im proud of them happy for them but they grow up so much faster than ever you think they do one minute im scrubbing faces and the next im buying wedding gowns to her surprise helpless tears rushed to her eyes oh kathy there now darling she took both of mollies hands and squeezed i felt the same way when mine left the nest its pattys doing sniffling mollie dug a handkerchief out of her pocket i never cried with maureen except at the wedding thought id go mad from time to time as my maureen wouldnt settle for less than perfection and her idea of it changed daily but patty she gets weepy if we talk about what flowers shell have i swear to you kathy i live in fear that the child will bawl her way down the aisle to poor kevin people would think weve a gun to her head forcing her to take her vows oh now nothing of the sort pattys your sentimental one shell make a lovely bride tears and all of course she will but mollie indulged herself with a few tears of her own then theres mary kate shes taken to mooning aboutover some boy im sureand brooding and closing herself off to write in her diary half the time she wont let alice mae in the room sure theres probably a lad at the hotel she fancies herself in love with is it worrying you not overmuch i suppose mary kates a great brooder and shes of an age where having her younger sister in her pocket becomes a trial just growing pains youve done a fine job of mothering your girls mollie theyre a credit to you each and every one not that that stops a woman from worrying over her chicks well at least brennas not giving you any grief at the moment carefully mollie lifted her cup and sipped brennas steady as a rock she said there were some things you couldnt share even with a friend with the pub closed for an hour between shifts aidan stuck his head in the kitchen can you leave that for a few minutes shawn cast a look around the general disorder caused by a busy afternoon crowd without a seconds hesitation why theres something to talk about and i want a walk shawn tossed his dishcloth aside where the beachll do aidan came through the kitchen and started out the back door he paused there a moment studying the slight rise of land the tidiness of it before it gave way to a smattering of trees the wind had bent seaward second thoughts shawn asked him no not about this but he continued to look and measure the shops and cottages that ran along the sides of his pub the back gardens the ancient dog who lay claim to a shady spot for a nap the corner at the far end of their land where hed kissed his first girl itll change more than a little aidan mused it will it changed when shamus gallagher put up the walls of the pub and every one of us since has changed it in one way or the other this is your change ours aidan said it quickly as it was very much on his mind thats one of the things well talk about i didnt catch darcy the girl was out of the place like a ball from a cannon do you remember playing out here i do absently shawn rubbed his nose aye that i do with a quick laugh aidan walked around the side id forgotten that we had a ball game going out back from time to time and thats where brenna rapped one right in your face christ you bled like a pig the bat was as near as big as she was true enough but the lass has always had an arm on her i remember you lying there cursing and bleeding and when she saw it was no more than your nose that was broken she told you to stop shouting and offer it up we had some fine games back of the pub impending fatherhoods making you sentimental maybe it is they crossed the street quiet this time of day this time of year springs coming aidan added as they worked their way down to the curve of beach and the tourists and holidayers come with it winters short in ardmore shawn dipped his hands in his pocket there was still a bit of bite to the wind you wont hear me complaining over that sand crunched softly under boots as they walked west where it met the horizon the water was a dreamy blue here where it rolled to land it fumed white against green driven by small choppy waves their tips sparkled in the generous stream of sun they walked in silence away from the boats already docked for the day and the nets hung for drying and toward the cliffs that layered their way up toward the sky i spoke with dad this morning hes well and ma too theyre well and fine hes expecting to meet with the lawyers early next week papers at least some of them should be ready to sign hes decided while hes about that to have more drawn up papers that would put the pub in my name in a legal way its time for that as weve known theyve found their spot in boston i told him my thoughts and ill tell you i feel it would be better and more fair if the pub was titled between the three of us when a shell caught his eye shawn bent picked it up examined it thats not our way which had been precisely what his father had said aidan hissed out a breath paced off then back christ youre more like him than any of us sure that doesnt sound like a compliment to either our father or myself just at the moment tickled shawn stood where he was while aidan paced a bit more it wasnt meant as one youve both heads like bricks about certain things wasnt it you who just spoke of change as a good thing if we can change the pub why the devil cant we change the way its passed down absently shawn tucked the shell in his pocket because some things you change and some you dont who decides id like to know shawn cocked his head we do youre outnumbered on this aidan so let it go gallaghers is yours and youll pass it down to the child judes already carrying it doesnt make it less ours darcys and mine not the heart of it im talking about a legal matter exactly its going to be a fine fresh evening shawn said considering the matter closed business should be good what about your children when you have them aidan asked dont you want them to have some legal standing in all of it so why does it have to get legal all of a sudden because its changing shawn exasperation sparked from him as he threw up his hands the theater changes ardmore changes gallaghers changes us it doesnt not the way youre worrying right now more people will come for different reasons shawn mused trying to see it in his mind another b and b might pop up along the way and someone might be inclined to open another shop along the water but gallaghers will still be serving food and drink and offering music as it always has one of us will man the bar and while were about it the boats will go out netsll be cast life goes on as it means to whatever you do about it or whatever you dont aidan asked well now some might disagree with that its the business of it thats weighing on you aidan and better you than me i mean it sincerely carrying the gallagher name is standing enough legal or otherwise for my needs shawn turned back so he could look at the pub the dark wood the cobbled stone the etched glass that caught winks of sunlight its done well enough till now hasnt it when the time comes your children and mine and darcys will work it out for themselves you might marry a woman with other ideas shawn thought of brenna shook his head if a woman didnt believe in me and my family enough to trust in this id have no business marrying her you dont know what it is to be in love beyond reason id have walked away from here from this from everyone if shed asked it of me or wanted it so she didnt ask it of you or want it so you might have desired a woman who would have aidan but youd never have lost your heart to her aidan started to speak then huffed out a breath first an answer for everything and its not a little vexing that each one seems a right one ive given the matter some thought over time now you give me one as ive a question when you love a woman beyond reason does it hurt or give you pleasure both very often at the same time shawn nodded as they started back i thought that might be the case but its interesting to hear it confirmed it was a fair and fresh evening and business was brisk as the wind that tripped in over the sea music drew customers some to listen while they sipped their pints others to join in on the chorus and more than a few who found the music pulled them to their feet to dance despite the fast pace shawn found time to pop out now and then and once watching brenna circling the tables in a pretty waltz with old mr riley he pondered an idea ive a notion here aidan shawn served two orders of fish and chips at the bar himself he took a glass to pull himself a harp and cut his thirst you see brenna dancing there i do aidan topped off the last layer of two guinnesses but i dont believe shes running off with him to sligo no matter how often she promises women are born to deceive a man taking his moment shawn sipped enjoying the way brenna moved in the old mans bony arms but im watching them and the others wholl get up now and then and i wonder wouldnt it be interesting if when we shuffle things about with the theater we found someplace for dancing thats what the stage is for now isnt it not professional dancing but this sort you know how they do in a beer garden but im thinking more intimate well youre thinking thats for certain but aidan paused long enough to watch scan the faces consider its something we might slide around with magee when we get to the design of it all ah brenna she had a kind of design she sketched up i have it in the kitchen still maybe youd like to take a look and if you like what you see you might be interested in the more formal drawing i asked her to do intrigued aidan looked away from the dancing and into his brothers eyes you asked her did you i did because i think she knows what we want and what magee should build is that a problem for you not a problem no problem at all its making me think shawn that you had it right about the legalities of things not changing the heart id like to see what our brenna has in her mind thats fine then and if you like what you see you could send it off to magee for his thoughts i could but id think the man would have his own designers then well have to find a way to bring him round to it if its what we want couldnt hurt shawn murmured still watching brenna to have our fingers in it early on it couldnt aidan agreed however prettily brenna could dance aidan needed her back behind the bar shortly he caught her eye sent her a quick signal but even as she acknowledged it he saw her gaze slip past him to shawn even though he was a bystander aidan felt the heat of it ill thank you not to distract my bartender when were threedeep around here im just standing drinking my beer well stand and drink in the kitchen unless youre after having half the customers raising their eyebrows over the pair of you it wouldnt bother me he held the look another moment a kind of test but it does her because it would annoy him if he dwelt on it shawn slipped back into the kitchen it wasnt a problem to keep himself busy until closing and he calculated another hour at least to clean up before he could call it a night he was scouring pots when one of the musicians strolled in she was a pretty blonde named eileen with sharp features and hair chopped short to show them off she had a fine clear voice and a warm disposition shawn had admired the first and taken advantage of the second in a friendly sort of way when her band had been booked at gallaghers before we did well by each other tonight that we did he rinsed off the pot and angling his body toward her started on the next i liked the arrangement youve put together for foggy dew its the first time weve tried it outside of rehearsal she walked to him turning to lean back against the sink while he worked ive been working on a couple of other numbers i wouldnt mind running them by you she ran her fingertip down his arm i dont have to be back tonight would you care to put me up as you did last time last time theyd enjoyed music and each other for half the night the woman shawn recalled wasnt the least shy about her talents the memory made him grin even as he contemplated the most polite way to turn her down the only thing brenna sawbesides redwhen she carted in the last tray of empties was the way shawn had his head tipped down and the way the blonde had her hand on him she stalked over slammed the tray down on the counter by the sink with enough force to make the glasses dance is there something youre after in here eileen was quick enough to read the threat in the eyes that were burning over her face and the meaning behind them not anymore in a cheerful gesture she patted shawns arm i guess im heading back after all some other time shawn ah hmm he had a split second to make up his mind and going with instinct fixed a guilty sheepish expression on his face well always a pleasure coming to gallaghers eileen added as she strolled to the door she kept the snicker inside and wondered how the pintsize redhead was going to make shawn suffer is this the last of it then shawn began scrubbing the pot again as if hed dedicated his life to that single purpose it is and what was that about id like to know what you and the singer with the big breasts and boys hair oh eileen deliberately he cleared his throat as he set the pot aside to deal with the glasses she was just saying good night hah she skewered a finger into his side and made him jump if shed been any closer shed have been inside your skin well now shes just a friendly sort just keep this in mind while you and i are rolling on the sheets you keep your distance from the friendly sorts even while delight rippled through him he straightened slowly are you accusing me of something brenna it pleased him that he managed the right mix of hurt and insult of making moves toward another woman while im with you i didnt realize how little you thought of me i saw what i saw he studied her a moment then began to wipe off counters with a moody and injured air it would be interesting he thought to see how much she worked to bring him around she had her hand on you i didnt have mine on her did i thats not the damn it brenna folded her arms unfolded them and jammed her hands in her pockets shed wanted to shred the skin off the blondes face still did she admitted if it came to that it wasnt in character at all not that shed back down from a fight but she wasnt one to start a brawl and surely not over a man you were smiling at her ill be sure not to smile at anyone unless you approve it first it looked overly cozy her hand was still balled in her pocket if she hadnt felt so foolish she might have given in to the urge to pop him with it ill apologize if i misunderstood fine leaving it at that he walked over to push open the door and call out his good nights when he turned back she looked so frustrated and unhappy he nearly relented but a man had to finish what he started he spoke coolly with just enough bite to let her know she had more making up to do would you prefer staying over with darcy no no i wouldnt all right then he crossed to the back door opened it waited she got her cap and jacket from the hook by the door then bundled them under her arm and stepped out into the chill they didnt speak as they got into opposite sides of his car she brooded out the window while he drove out of the village and up the road toward the cottage she told herself shed had a perfectly normal reaction and shifting in her seat she told him the same when he didnt answer she had to struggle not to squirm can we agree this is new territory for both of us ah he thought just the direction hed hoped for he sent her one quiet look then nodded and we never i suppose you could say discussed the boundaries of it you wanted sex youre getting it out of the corner of his eye he saw her flinch perfect thats true thats true she repeated in a mutter when he pulled up to his cottage she was starting to feel a little sick to her stomach but i its only that i she cursed and had to scramble out of the car to keep up with him damn it you can at least hear me out im listening to you do you want tea he asked viciously polite as he walked inside no i dont want tea and take that stick out of your arse for one bloody minute if you dont have the sense to see that woman wanted to jump you youre blind as six bats and twice as dim more to the point would be what i wantedand intended he started up the steps shes beautiful so are you what does that have to do with it as her mouth was hanging open it took a minute to get her feet moving in all the years shed known the man hed never told her she was beautiful it threw her off her stride she could feel her mind trip as she tried to keep it on track you dont think of me that way and thats all right its not what im trying to get to anyway i know when we started thiswhen i started thisi never said what i expected wishing she had his clever way with words she dragged a hand through her hair what i mean is that while were together this way until one of us or both of us decide this has run its course i wouldnt consider being with another man he sat on the trunk at the foot of the bed to take off his boots youre meaning that this area of our relationship should be an exclusive one that neither of us sees anyone else is that the way of it aye thats my feeling on it they would be exclusive to each other and it was her ideaeven demand a strong first step he thought to where he wanted her to lead him he took his time letting her believe he was considering that fits in with my feeling on it as well but but how do we know and who decides when that changes brenna i dont have an answer to that i never expected this to be complicated i didnt know it was until i saw that singer hanging all over you i didnt like it while im touching you im touching no one else youll have to trust me i can trust you shawn easier now she stepped toward him its the bigbreasted blondes i have trouble with recently my taste is running strong for wellpacked redheads because she was relieved that the chill had gone out of his eyes she laughed wellpacked my ass have we made up then its a beginning he patted the space beside him lets have your boots off and well make up some more happy to oblige she sat tugged on the laces i hurt your feelings im sorry for that i dont mind spatting with you mary brenna he stroked a hand over her hair but i dont like you thinking that id think of another woman in that way when im with you then i wont think it after toeing off her boots she straightened but her eyes went wary at the way he was staring at her what is it i like looking at you nothing new to see here maybe thats part of it he framed her face then combed his fingers through her hair drawing it back and away i know this face he said quietly as well as i know my own i can conjure it up in my mind the way it runs from cheek to jaw he skimmed his lips along the sweep the shape and color of the eyes and the moods of them just now he noted the mood was surprised and not a little uneasy the mouth he continued brushing it lightly retreating just as hers softened the curves and dips of it such a lovely face i dont mind looking at it even when youre not around thats an odd thing to she trailed off as he brought his mouth back to hers lingered there then theres the rest of you he skimmed his hands down a light play of fingers then captured her hands before she could tug the sweater off no let me he drew her to her feet lifting the sweater inch by inch it gives me pleasure to uncover you to work my way through the layers to that amazing body of yours it drives me mad the way you cover it up she might have gaped if she hadnt been so busy just trying to breathe it does i keep thinking i know whats under all that he loosened the hook of her trousers ive had that under me he let the trousers drop pool at her feet step out of those darling he murmured and toyed with the hem of her undershirt im built like a twelveyearold boy as one whos been a twelveyearold boy he slipped the undershirt over her head then let his gaze run down her i can promise you thats not the case milkmaids skin and strong shoulders he dipped his head touching his lips to one then the other and here slowly he trailed his hands from her waist to cup her breasts her breath caught released shuddered soft and firm and sensitive she started to drift along to cruise on the wonderful slide of his hands then gasped half in shock half in amusement when he lifted her stood her on the little chest but the humor that sparked in her eyes went dark when he closed his mouth over her breast caught her nipple delicately between his teeth oh god i want you to come he traced a finger along the edge of cotton that still covered her and his mouth worked down i want you to call out my name when you do and slipped his finger under the cotton inside her where she was already hot already wet she rocked against him a jerk of movement while her fingers dug into his shoulders pleasure rushed into her so fast it was almost a panic built so high so huge she wondered her body could survive it and it was his name she called out was she falling or flying she felt her legs give way like a melting of bone tried to center herself again when she felt him lift her carry her to the side of the bed the light he laid her on the bed knelt over her well see each other clearly this way this time watching her he took off his shirt do you know how arousing it is to know i can take you up again and again that you have that much inside you for me she reached for him drew him to her i want you inside me and i want you weak first his mouth began to taste his hands to roam and sobbing my name you bastard the fact that she said it on a moan delighted him just try to make me he thought it a lovely challenge and set about meeting it his hands were light as faerie wings one moment hard as iron the next and each touch was a separate thrill he had a way about him that shed never imagined when shed fantasized about having him for a lover the men shed known before him hadnt given her this or lured her into giving so much back there was a freedom here with him that odd mix of wicked surprise with easy recognition and trust absolute trust she opened herself to him willingly perhaps with his skill shed have been helpless to do otherwise but she was willing to take all he offered and to match it even as shocks of sensation lanced through her she yielded it was a surrender shed given to no other as if he sensed it he took her up again slowly this time almost torturously so that her body was a raw aching mass of nerves her skin was damp and slick the heat of her all but stopped his heart with need she moved against him under him with a smooth and sinuous female rhythm that made him ache for joining in the lamplight his eyes were narrowed focused on her face as he strained against his own need and kept her shuddering on the edge quaking she sobbed out his name he drove himself into her more violently than he meant to but she arched up to meet him accept him matching the desperate pace that slapped flesh against flesh and had heart thundering against heart glorying in it he lifted her hips going deeper pushing them both toward delirium no one but you brenna the throbbing in his blood was a drumbeat primitive constant say it back to me say it back no one but you as she said it her world exploded swamped with love he emptied himself into her chapter fifteen it was her habit to wake early and get on with the business of the day on the rare occasions when brenna slept late it was usually because shed had more than her fair share to drink the evening past so as shed had nothing but fizzy water the night before it was a surprise to see the sun was well up when she opened her eyes the second surprise came on the heels of the first when she noted the only thing keeping her from rolling off the bed was the arm that shawn had banded around her hed sprawled himself in the middle of the mattress shoving her to the outer edge but she thought at least he was considerate enough to see that she stayed there and didnt fall on her face she tried to shift around gave him a shove so that she could get free and climb out but he tightened his grip and pulled her back until she was curved against him in the cozy spoon position you might be the lazy sort who lies in bed half the morning but im not she started to wiggle free and wiggling discovered the interesting fact that not all of him was asleep wake up ready do you she said it with a chuckle and pushed at his arms well i dont i want a shower and some coffee his answer was a grunt but his hand snuck up to cover her breast and just keep your hands to yourself i dont want any of this fooling around until ive had my coffee he simply parted her legs and proved her a liar well his voice was thick with sleep but the arm that slid under her was strong enough to hold her in place you can just lie there then while i use you later when she staggered into the shower she thought it wouldnt be such a sacrifice to be used in such a way of a morning every now and again she turned the water on keeping it on the cool side as her skin was still hot and flushed after stepping into the old clawfoot tub she tugged the curtain around then ducked her head under the stingy spray to wet her hair it wasnt an easy business with so little water and so much hair but she had nearly accomplished it when the curtain jingled back she opened one eye and fixed it on shawn i dont suppose you can give me much trouble in here so soon after that care to wager on it he asked as he stepped in with her shed have lost her legs werent quite steady when she snapped down a towel keep your distance now she warned wrapping it around her while her hair dripped everywhere ive no more time for you ive got to get home i suppose you dont have time for any griddle cakes then she shoved wet hair out of her eyes youd be making griddle cakes i had a mind to but if youre in such a rush ill just scramble an egg for myself he was already dried off and was brushing his teeth an easy act of intimacy that barely registered i suppose im not in such a terrible rush have you a spare toothbrush around here i dont but i think under the circumstances you can use mine she kept one at darcys along with a few other essentials but shed been too distracted to remember to gather them up the night before would you mind if i left a few things here for convenience sake he leaned over the sink to rinse so she didnt see the gleam of triumph in his eyes another step he thought theres room he handed her the toothbrush use whatever you need for now ill go down and put on some coffee thanks leaving her to it he stepped out to pull on jeans and a sweater if he hadnt been obliged to be at the pub he wouldve found a way to talk her into spending the day with him as it was they only had an hour or so but he saw clearly saw how it could be with them mornings like this begun with love and slipping into the easy routine of a meal before they went off on their ways brenna sitting in the pub kitchen for a while in the evening while he worked knowing shed be waiting when he got home as he headed downstairs he reminded himself there were a few steps left to take before they got there but he couldnt believe wouldnt believe he could be so in love with someone and not find the way to spend his life with her theyd need their own house one that belonged to them a big kitchen and bedrooms enough for the family theyd make he had enough put by to see about acquiring some land he put on water for coffee and got out the makings for tea as well as he preferred starting his day that way he assembled eggs flour buttermilk then nearly dropped the carton at the knock on the back door im sorry with a laugh in her voice mary kate opened the door i didnt mean to give a start her cheeks were pink from her walk to the cottage her eyes bright and cheerful i was just out it being my day off and i thought id stop by for a moment his mind raced for the way to get her out again fast and smooth with no harm done before hed come up with anything other than yelling fire it was too late why arent i smelling coffee brenna demanded you wear a body out before ten in the morning then cant even her voice simply died away as she walked in and saw her sister all the happy color in mary kates cheeks died and her eyes went wide and dark with hurt for a moment no one moved actors in a bad play waiting for the curtain knowing that when it lifted disaster would follow shawn reached out laid a hand on mary kates arm mary kate he said it gently and the sympathy in the tone snapped her out of her shock she smacked his hand aside turned for the door mary kate wait brenna rushed forward skidded to a halt when her sister turned there was color in her face again the wild deep color that came from shame and fury youre sleeping with him youre a liar and a hypocrite she swung out and as brenna neither braced for nor tried to avoid the blow the slap sent her sprawling and a whore as well thats enough grimly shawn grabbed mary kates arm youve no right to strike her or speak to her that way it doesnt matter brenna got to her knees that was as far as the horrible weight on her chest would allow it matters a great deal be as mad as you want at me he said to mary kate and im more sorry than i can say if i hurt you in any way but whats here is between me and brenna and has nothing to do with you she wanted to weep she wanted to scream and was afraid shed do both at once fighting viciously for one scrap of dignity mary kate lifted her head stepped back from him you didnt have to make a fool of me you knew i had feelings i still do only now i hate you i hate both of you she shoved the door open and fled jesus shawn bent to help brenna to her feet laid a hand over the cheek that flamed an angry red im sorry so sorry she didnt mean what she said she does right now she means it all from the bottom of her heart i know how it is i have to go after her ill go with you no a part of her heart ripped as she backed away from him i have to do it myself it would only hurt more to see us together what was i thinking she shut her eyes pressed her fingers to them what was i thinking you were thinking of me we were thinking of each other weve a right to that she dropped her hands opened her eyes she thinks she loves you i should have thought of that as well i have to go do what i can while i stay here doing nothing shes my sister brenna said simply and left she ran but mary kate had a good head start and longer legs by the time brenna caught sight of her she was already heading down the slope to the backyard of their house the big yellow dog hurrying behind like a rear guard mary kate wait brenna kicked into a sprint and caught up at the edge of the yard wait now you have to let me explain explain what that youve been fucking shawn gallagher that was clear enough by the way you waltzed into his kitchen with your hair still wet its not like that but wasnt that exactly how it had started brenna thought hadnt it been just like that at the beginning the two of you mustve had a fine laugh or two at my expense no not ever i never thought never thought of me mary kate rounded on her shouting so now that the dog slunk off to hide thats fine then that makes it just fine you go off playing whore with a man you know i have feelings for but you didnt give me a thought the flash came into brennas eyes a warning you called me that before and i took it you knocked me on my ass and i took that as well youve had your say now ill have mine you can go to hell she gave brenna one hard shove spun on her heel and marched toward the door then let out a whoosh of air when brenna tackled her from behind you want to settle this with slaps and shoves that suits me she grabbed a fistful of mary kates hair and had just given one good satisfying yank when their mother threw open the door and rushed out what in sweet hell is this get off your sister this instant mary brenna the minute she apologizes for calling me a whore twice in one morning whore tears of pain and rage blurred mary kates eyes but she managed to shout it that makes three they rolled into a vicious tangle of arms and legs and without a minutes hesitation mollie waded in grabbed each by whatever she could snare and hauled them apart and since it was like separating spitting cats she added a cuff on the side of the head to each to keep them there its shamed i am shamed of the pair of you now in the house and one word before you have my leave its the back of my hand for you mary kate got to her feet brushed herself off lowered her head and when she caught brennas eye mouthed whore she had the dark satisfaction of watching brenna start a swing and get another cuff for the trouble a grown woman mollie muttered herding her daughters toward the house where mick stood struggling to look disapproving alice mae watched owlishly and patty stood peering over her fathers shoulder with her best imaboveitall look on her face sit she jabbed a finger at the table then shot a steely look at her other daughters patty alice mae i believe you have other things to do if not i can find plenty to occupy your time she landed you a good one there brenna alice mae clucked her tongue as she studied brennas cheek she wont a second time quiet at patiences end mollie snapped out she pointed to the door come on alice patty laid a hand on alice maes shoulder theres no point in staring at the heathens and the minute theyd rounded the corner both of them hunkered down to hear what they could but when mick started to slither out the door mollie pinned him with a hard stare oh no you dont michael otoole this baggage is as much yours as mine now she planted her hands on her hips what started this brenna its a personal problem between myself and mary kate her eyes clicked to her mother then to her father when he moved to the pot to pour himself more tea when its a problem that has one sister calling another filthy names and the both of you tearing at each other like alley cats its no longer personal you may be near twentyfive years of age mary brenna catherine otoole but you live under this roof and i wont tolerate such behavior im sorry for it brenna set her hands on the table folded them and prepared to hold her ground mary kate what have you to say for yourself that if she lives under this roof i no longer care to that would be your choice mollie said coldly now as all of my children are welcome here as long as they like even whores mind your tongue girl mick stepped forward you want to slap and wrestle thats one thing but youll speak with respect to your mother and you wont use language like that about your sister let her deny it mary kate brennas voice was little more than a whisper and more plea than warning though mary kates lips trembled she couldnt fight off the rage let her deny she spent the night in shawn gallaghers bed the teacup cracked as mick fumbled and knocked it on the edge of the counter all brenna could do was close her eyes as shame and sorrow washed through her i wont deny it i wont deny ive been there before and that every time i have i went freely im sorry that it hurt you she got shakily to her feet but it doesnt make me a whore to care for him and you know if you make me choose between you ill let him go it took all the courage she had left to turn and face her parents the understanding in her mothers eyes might have been a balm if not for the shock in her fathers im sorry for this all of this im sorry i havent been honest with you i cant talk about it anymore now i just cant she hurried out would have rushed right past her sisters but patty reached out its all right darling she murmured it giving brenna a hard hug that broke her set free the tears that were burning in her throat and the back of her eyes blinded by them she rushed upstairs in the kitchen mollie kept her eyes on her younger daughter her heart was aching for both her girls but comfort and discipline would have to be meted out separately the only sound now was mary kates ragged breathing holding the silence a moment longer mollie slipped into the chair brenna had deserted no one noticed when mick walked out the back door i know what it is to have feelings for someone mollie began quietly to see them as the brightest light as the one wholl answer all the questions and fill all the holes whether youre twenty or forty im not doubting what you have in your heart katie i love him defiance still her only shield edged her voice but a single tear spilled over and slid down her cheek she knew its a hard thing to have those feelings for someone who doesnt have them for you he might have but she threw herself at him katie darling there were many things she could have said the mans too old for you this was infatuation and would pass youll fall in love half a dozen times before it matters and takes a firm hold inside you instead she took mary kates hand shawn looked at brenna she said gently and has looked for a long time and she at him neither of them is the careless sort who looks to hurt another you know that they didnt care about me they had their eyes on each other and for a time they didnt see you it was worse a hundred times worse to be looked at with sympathy and still be made to feel like a fool you make it sound like its all right them having at each other that way oh a fine and shaky line mollie thought im not speaking of that as thats between brenna and her conscience and her heart its not for you to judge her mary kate nor for me we cast no stones in this house tears came faster now and with them resentment youre taking her side in this then youre wrong as i have two daughters hurt now and i love each in equal measure if theres sides to be taken brennas just taken yours youve no way of knowing what her feelings are for shawn or how deep they run but shell turn away from him for you is that what you want mary kate would that soothe your heart and your pride the turmoil inside her swallowed her up laying her head on the table she wept like a child there was no choice for a man for a father but to deal with such matters mick would have preferred having his fingers broken one at a time rather than using them to knock on the door of faerie hill cottage but there was nothing else to be done his daughter had given herself to a man been taken by one and that had shattered his comfortable illusions about his firstborn he wasnt a stupid man he knew that women young ones and old ones and those in between had certain needs but when it was a matter of his pride and joy he didnt care to have those needs shoved in his face and he knew as well as any about the needs of a man he might have had a deep affection for shawn gallagher but that didnt negate the fact that the bastard had put his hand on michael otooles baby so he knocked and he was prepared to handle the ù matter in a straightforward and civilized way when the door opened mick rammed his fist into shawns face shawns head snapped back and he took two steps for balance but he stayed on his feet tougher than he looks mick decided lifting his balled fists again for that had been a fine punch if he said so himself come on then defend yourself ya son of a bitch ive come to wipe the floor with you no sir shawns head was ringing and he wanted badly to swivel his jaw to make sure it wasnt broken but he merely stood there arms at his sides the man was half his size and nearly twice his age you can plant another on me if you must but i wont fight you so youre a coward then mick danced inside a boxer prepping for the next round he gave shawn a quick rap in the chest faked another toward his face reluctant admiration bloomed the boy didnt so much as flinch youre standing up for your daughter i cant fight what id do myself if i were you but a sudden horrible thought flew into his head and now his hands did fist did you raise your hand to her over this insult mixed with frustration bloody hell boy never have i raised a hand to one of my girls i leave that to their mother if theyve a need for it she all right then would you just tell me that shes all right no we took a bat to her and bashed her brains to sunday with a windy sigh mick lowered his fists he didnt have the heart to use them again but he was far from done youve some answering to do young gallagher shawn nodded aye do you want me to do it here in the doorway or in the kitchen over whiskey thoughtfully mick rubbed his chin measured his man ill take the whiskey temper was still bubbling under his skin but he followed shawn to the back waited while the bottle was taken from the cupboard and good jamesons poured into short glasses will you sit mr otoole well youve manners dont you at such a time scowling mick sat picked up his glass and eyed shawn over the top of it youve had your hands on my daughter i have mick set his teeth his hand fisted again braced and ready and what are your intentions toward my mary brenna i love her and i want to marry her micks breath hissed out he dragged one hand through his hair as he gulped down the whiskey then held out the glass for more well why the devil didnt you say so ah gingerly shawn cupped his bruised jaw moved it gently side to side not broken he decided just battered its a bit of a dilemma and why would that be i havent brought the matter up to brenna herself as yet if i do you see shell determine to go the opposite way ive been working at bringing the matter round so it seems her idea that way shell make my life hell till i agree to it mick stared then shaking his head set his whiskey down well jesus you do know her dont you i do and i love her with all my heart i want to spend my life with her theres nothing i want more so finished and exhausted from it shawn knocked back his whiskey there you have it you know how to take the wind out of a mans sails mick drank again i love my girls shawn each one of thems a jewel to me when i walked my maureen down the aisle and gave her away i was proud and my heart was breaking youll know how that is one day ive to do the same with patty soon both of them chose men im pleased to call son he held out his glass waited while shawn filled it again my brenna has as good taste and sense as her sisters if not better thank you for that relieved shawn took a second glass himself im wishing shed come round to that sooner rather than later but shes a bit of work if you dont mind me saying i dont im proud of it mick settled in frowned a little this business thats going on between you i dont approve of it he noted shawn was man enough to meet his eye and wise enough to keep his thoughts to himself by god whod have thought brenna would meet her match in this one but shes more than of age mick continued and so are you my approving or not isnt going to stop you from well i dont want to say any more on that particular thing they drank in cautious silence mr otoole i think as things are coming round you should call me mick mick im sorry about mary kate i swear to you i never mick waved a hand before shawn could finish i cant blame you on that score our katie has fancies and a young and tender heart i dont like knowing its bruised but theres no blame brennall blame herself and shell step back from me if i didnt love her i could let her time mick polished off the next whiskey and thought it was a fine morning to get a bit of a drunk on when you get older you come to trust in time not that im meaning you sit idle and let it pass im looking for land shawn said abruptly the whiskey was starting to work in his head and he didnt mind a bit whats that for land to buy for brenna shell want to build her house dont you think tears of sentiment gathered in micks eyes its been a dream of hers to do that i know shes a dream to have a hand in building something from the ground up and im hoping shell have her chance with the theater aye ive been giving her a hand in the drawing of that would you see that i get it so i can pass it on she may not feel as easy about giving it to me now youll have it tomorrow thats fine then and the theaters an important thing for brenna for us for ardmore but a homethats more important than a place of business it is and would be to her as well as to you if you hear of something you think might suit would you pass it on to me mick took out his handkerchief blew his nose and was pleased to see shawn fill his glass without waiting to be asked that ill do eyes narrowed and a bit bright from drink mick peered at shawns jaw hows the face then aches like a bitch in heat mick laughed heartily tapped his glass to shawns well thats something then while mick and shawn bonded over jamesons mollie had her hands full it took nearly an hour of strokes and pats and sympathy before she could tuck mary kate in for a nap her own head was feeling achy but she pressed her fingers to her eyes to relieve some of the pressure before crossing to brennas room she reminded herself she had wanted children and a number of them besides shed been blessed she was grateful and blessed mary she was tired brenna was curled on the bed eyes shut sitting crosslegged beside her alice mae stroked brennas hair at the foot of the bed patty sat dabbing at her eyes it was a sweet sight all in all patty was a romantic and would automatically throw her heart to brenna on this alice mae bless her couldnt bear to see anything or anyone in pain mollie had only to gesture for patty and alice mae to get up and take their leave ill speak to brenna alone she shooed them out before questions could be asked and shut the door as mollie crossed to the bed she saw brenna tense im sorry brenna kept her eyes closed and her voice was rough and strained i dont know what else to say but im sorry dont hate me oh what nonsense using a brisker tone than she had with mary kate mollie sat gave brennas shoulder a little shake why should i are you thinking im so old that i dont understand what feelings churn around in a woman no no miserable brenna curled herself tighter shifting so she could rest her head on her mothers lap oh ma its all my fault i started it i wanted shawn so i went right up to him and said so i kept at him until well hes a man after all is that all there is between you brenna just the need and the act yes no she pressed her face into the comforting give of her mother i dont know it doesnt matter now nothing matters more i cant be with him i wont see him that way anymore if you knew how she looked at us at me all the hurt on her face before the anger came into it i never thought of her she rolled onto her back now stared at the ceiling i only thought of me and what went on inside me when i was with him because of it i lied to you and to dad how can you trust me again after this im not saying the lie was right but i knew it was a lie when you told me she nearly smiled when brennas gaze cut to hers do you think i told my own mother that i was sneaking out of the house on a warm summer night to meet michael otoole so he could make my head swim with kisses her eyes warmed with humor and memory twentysix years weve been married and five children we brought into the world and to this day my mother believes i lay chaste in my bed every night before my wedding with a long sigh brenna sat up and wrapping her arms around mollie laid her head on her shoulder i have a need for him ma and its so big i thought after a bit it would quiet down fade back and away then wed both get back to how things were before but it isnt quieting down at all and ive ruined it because i didnt say to katie this ones mine so find another or whatever i could have said or done now i cant go back to him answer me this as honest as you can mollie drew her back studied her face would shawn have looked in mary kates direction if you hadnt been standing between but thats not the just answer brenna no she let out a painful breath but hed never have hurt her if not for me mistakes were made theres no denying it but mary kates as responsible for her heart and its bruising as anyone martyring yourself wont change what was or what is have a rest she said pressing her lips to brennas forehead youll think clearer when youre heads not aching shall i bring you some tea and toast no but thanks i love you so much there now dont start crying again any more tears today and ill need an oar lets have off your boots and tuck you in as she had with mary kate mollie fussed and stroked and settled brenna under the covers she sat a little while and when brenna was quiet she rose to let sleep do a bit of healing as she passed the window she stopped stepped back stared down at the sight of her husband weaving and stumbling his way home saints in heaven the mans drunk and its not yet noon she pushed at her hair what a family this is chapter sixteen getting ready to go to work was quite an undertaking he was dressed already which was a fortunate thing shaving was out of the question even if hed wanted to deal with scraping a razor over his tender jaw he was just sober enough to fear cutting his face to ribbons in the process so he left it as it was and stumbling over his shoes he thought it might be a fine idea to put them on bub being the perverse creature that he was took the opportunity to crawl all over him then laid stinging furrows over the back of shawns hand when he tried to push him aside vicious bastard he and the cat eyed each other with mutual dislike and from a respectful distance i might have to take a swipe from mick otoole but i dont have to take one from you you blackhearted spawn of satan he lunged missed as the cat streaked away and ended up rapping his already sore jaw on the floor fuck me thats about enough with his ears ringing he managed to get to his hands and knees the fiend of a cat was in for dire consequences later hed let the fiend believe hed won the war then seek revenge at an unexpected moment still sulking over it shawn nursed his hand as he headed out of the house as a matter of habit he turned toward his car then paused balancing himself on the garden gate he was certain he could drive he was a man who could hold his drink wasnt he for christs sake his name was gallagher but the way things were going hed likely run off the road and smash his teeth out on the steering wheel much better to walk he decided clear his head settle his thoughts he started down the road mindful of the ruts and bumps singing to entertain himself on the journey he stumbled a time or two but fell only the one time of course the one time was enough to have his knee find the single sharp rock in the bloody road he was picking himself up from that not far from the village proper when betsy clooney with her car full of her children stopped beside him shawn whats happened youve had an accident he smiled at her she had a pretty brood of children all of them fair of hair and blue of eye the two in the back were squabbling but the youngest secured in her car seat watched shawn like a little owl as she sucked on a red lollipop well hello betsy hows it all going then did you have a car crash she pushed open her door to hurry around to him grinning as he was at her baby and weaving like a man whod gone a hard round with the champ i didnt no ive been walking your hands bleeding and youre bruised on the face your trousers are ripped at the knee are they he glanced down saw the mud and the tear shit look at that will you begging pardon he said quickly remembering the children but she was close enough now to see and to smell just what the matter was shawn gallagher youre drunk i am i suppose a little theyd gone to school together so he patted her shoulder in a friendly manner youve darling children betsy but your oldest girl there is trying to throttle her brother and doing a damn fine job of it betsy merely glanced back and barked out one sharp warning the children broke apart my mother could do the same sheer admiration shone on shawns face half the time it only took a look to curdle the blood in your veins well i must be going get in the back of the car for heavens sake and ill take you home thanks but im for work she rolled her eyes jerked open the car door get in all the same and ill drive you the rest of the way and let the gallaghers deal with their own she thought thats kind of you thanks betsy the children were so entertained by drunk mr gallagher that they behaved themselves until their mother dropped him off behind the pub he waved cheerfully then opened the door tripped over the threshold and as his balance was already impaired nearly went facedown on the floor for the second time that day he caught himself hung on to the side of the counter and waited for the pub kitchen to stop revolving with the careful steps of the drunk he walked over to the cupboard to get out a pan for frying a pot for boiling he was weaving in front of the refrigerator wondering what the hell he was supposed to do with what was inside it when darcy marched in fire in her eyes youre near to an hour late and while youre lazing in bed weve got two bloody buses coming in full of tourists and nothing to put in their bellies but beer nuts and crisps sure ill be dealing with that directly and what id like to know are we to put on the daily while you she broke off took a good look at him his eyes she noted were all but wheeling around in his head look at the sight of you dirty and torn up and bleeding youve been drinking i have he turned gave her the sweet harmless smile of the very drunk considerably well you knothead sit down before you fall down i can stand im going to make fish cakes im thinking ill bet you are amused she pulled him to the table and shoved him into a chair she took a look at his hand decided shed seen worse stay where youre put she ordered and went out to get aidan what dyou mean drunk aidan said after darcy hissed in his ear i think youre familiar with the term but if you need refreshing on it youve only to go into the kitchen and have a look at our brother christ i dont have time for this the pub had only a scatter of customers as the doors had barely opened but within thirty minutes there would be sixty piling in hungry from the bus trip down from waterford city mind the bar then he told her oh no not for a million pounds would i miss this so saying she followed him into the kitchen shawn was singing in his breakyourheart voice about the cold nature of peggy gordon and with one eye closed his body swaying gently he dripped lemon juice into a bowl oh fuck me shawn you are half pissed more of threequarters if the truth be known he lost track of the juice and added a bit more to be safe and how are you today aidan darling get away from there before you poison someone insulted shawn swiveled around and had to brace a hand on the counter to stay upright im drunk not a murderer i can make a goddamn fish cake in me sleep this is my kitchen ill thank you to remember and i give the orders here he poked himself in the chest with his thumb on the claim and nearly knocked himself on his ass gathering dignity he lifted his chin so go on with you while i go about my work what have you done to yourself the devil cat caught me hand forgetting his work shawn lifted a hand to scowl at the red gashes oh but ive plans for him you can be sure of that at the moment id lay odds on the cat do you know anything about putting fish cakes together aidan asked darcy not a bloody thing she said cheerfully then go and call kathy duffy would you and ask if she can spare us an hour or so as we have an emergency an emergency shawn looked glassily around where come with me boyo where shawn asked again and aidan hooked an arm around his waist to pay the piper if youre taking him upstairs darcy called out as she reached for the phone ill thank you to clean up whatever mess is made during the sobering just call kathy duffy and mind the bar aidan took shawns weight and dragged him upstairs i can cook drunk or sober shawn insisted i dont know what youre in such a taking over its just fucking fish cakes and he pressed a noisy kiss to aidans cheek you always were a cheerful drunk and why not shawn hooked an arm around aidans shoulder stumbled my lifes in the toilet and it looks better through the whiskey making sympathetic noises aidan half carried him into darcys tidy little bathroom you had words with brenna did you no but with everyone else in gods creation i spent the night making love to the woman i want to marry i tell you aidan its a different matter altogether being inside a woman when you love her who knew aidan considered the trouble of getting shawn out of his clothes and the mess that would be made if he didnt so he propped his brother against the wall just hold this up for a bit he said all right obligingly shawn braced his weight against the wall she thinks its just sex you know aye well working as fast as he could aidan crouched to take off shawns boots which he noted in disgust had been tied into nasty little knots women are the oddest of creatures ive always liked them myself theres so many varieties but this is like having a lightning bolt smash right into my heart so its all hot and bright and shaky im not letting her go and thats the end of it thats the spirit he got the boots off and the jeans and working briskly as a man with experience in such matters efficiently stripped his brother down to the skin knowing what was to follow he shrugged out of his own shirt and tugged off his pants in you go i cant go anywhere im naked ill be arrested ill post your bond not to worry and not without sympathy aidan turned the shower on full cold and shoved his beloved brother under the heartless spray oh the scream all but peeled the skin off his face and the curses that followed battered his ears but aidan held ground dodged a fist when he had to and clamping shawn in a headlock held him mercilessly under youre drowning me you bastard not yet in a ruthless move aidan used his free hand to yank shawns head back by the hair so the icy spray showered his face just shut your mouth and hold your breath and youll live through it ill kill you dead as abraham when im out of here you think im enjoying this do you laughter rose into his throat as he yanked shawns head back again youd be right head clearing since shawns answer was a glug aidan gave it another minute then switched off the spray he was wise enough to move quickly out of range before tossing his brother one of darcys fancy towels well youre a sorry picture but your eyes are clear are you going to be sick on me now though his limbs were weak as a babys shawn wrapped the towel around his waist and tried for dignity drowning mes one thing insulting mes another i ought to break your face for it crisis passed aidan decided then lifted a brow it appears someone tried to break yours did brenna put that bruise on your chin no her father did mick otoole aidan paused in the act of drying his own chest mick otoole popped you one he did but weve come to terms now shawn stepped out of the shower annoyed that the blissful cushion of whiskey had been washed away so now he could hurt all overface hand leg and heart at a guess id say you got drunk together that was part of the process he flipped down the lid of the toilet sat and as he dressed again he filled aidan in on the morning youve had a busy day aidan laid a hand on his shoulder i can ask kathy duffy to do the whole of the shift no i can work itll keep my hands busy while i figure out what to do next he stood up i mean to have her aidan however it has to be done you gave me advice once on matters of the heart now ill return the favor find the words the right ones and give them to her i imagine theres different ones for different women but when its all cleared away it means the same before he came down again shawn tidied himself up as best he could and did the same for darcys bathroom nothing was worth the spitting lecture shed spew over him if he left it as it was since he felt the beginnings of a filthy head coming on he rooted out the makings of the hangover remedy his family called gallaghers fix and downed a full glass of it he couldnt say he was feeling his best but he thought he could get through the day now without making a bigger muck of things from the look of sympathy that kathy duffy sent him when he entered the kitchen again he imagined he wasnt looking his best either there now lad she clucked over him and had a strong cup of tea ready you just drink this and gather your wits ive got things under control for now im grateful to you i know i left things turned round here if a body cant indulge himself foolishly now and again whats the point she bustled around as she talked dealing with the fry pan and the pot she had simmering ive got the fish cakes doing and theyre selling brisk you had fresh cockles so i did up the soup and its ready for serving now if anys a taste for it now most are wanting chips but ive done up some pan boxty as well its a treasure you are mrs duffy she pinked and fluttered at that oh go on with you its nothing your dear mother wouldnt have done for one of mine if the need were there she flipped fish cakes onto plates spooned up chips that had drained and added bits of parsley and pickled beets as if timed to a turn darcy came in to pick up the orders well the dead have arisen she said with a quick study of her brother though you look like you need to be buried oh hes just a little shaky on his pins is all dont poke at him darcy theres a good girl shawn sent his sister a wide and sour grin behind kathys back as she loaded her tray well need two servings of your soup mrs duffy and another of the fish cakes with the boxty and one further of fish and chips and all would care for the green salad you were kind enough to make while my brother was indisposed in two shakes darling darcy balanced her tray and after shooting an evil look at shawn she headed out singing whiskey for breakfast ill deal with the frying mrs duffy if you wouldnt mind seeing to the salads are you feeling up to it lad i am yes thanks its best to keep busy but mind your hand those are nasty scratches she gave him a little pat as they passed each other and when brenna comes in later to work the two of you will make it up mark my words if shed smacked him over the head with the rolling pin hed have been less staggered brenna im thinking the two of you had a bit of a spat kathy went on cheerfully scooping up salad lovebirds dont always sing pretty tunes recovering shawn narrowed his eyes at the door darcy he said it darkly bitterly and with a hint of the violence he intended darcy with a rumbling laugh kathy lined up the bowls now why would i need darcy to be telling me what i can see with my own eyes wasnt i in the pub myself last night i barely spoke to brenna last night in the pub sulking now shawn set the cakes to sizzling we were the both of us busy i might expect that sort of answer from most men but youre a poet and you know very well just how much can be said with a look the two of you clicked eyes together every blessed time you stepped out of the kitchen nothing i havent been expecting for years oh bloody hell he muttered it well under his breath but the woman had ears like a rabbit now whats the matter its a pretty business seeing the two of you starting to dance in the same direction and a mouth shawn thought that flapped like a sheet in a gale ah the thing of it is mrs duffyand im hoping youll take this as delicate as its meantif as things are brenna hears any talk of the two of us dancing in the same direction as you put it shell do a very fast jig the opposite way judging the progress of the frying she reached up for soup bowls and since when has mary brenna otoole heard anything if it didnt please her to the girls ears are as stubborn as the rest of herand good luck to you with her he shook the fry basket to drain more chips youve a point there well taken ive known the two of you since you were both bumps under your mothers aprons she ladled up soup and was generous with dumplings and ten years backaye ten as i recall it was the summer my patrick broke his arm falling off the cabin roof where he had no business being in the first place ten years ago this summer i said to mr duffy as we sat out in the pub of an evening and brenna sat with her family at a near table and you were playing one of your tunes on the fiddle while your father worked the bar she trailed off as she set the bowls aside for darcy i said to him as i watched her watching you and saw that now and again a glance of yours would land in her direction theres something that will come around when the times right i never thought of her that way back then of course you did kathy said comfortably you just didnt know it when it was time for the evening shift darcy lay in wait for brenna and nearly missed her as brenna came in the front instead of the back you missed a great crowd today darcy sauntered over it took only a strategic shift of her body to corner brenna by the coatrack shawn was late for work she continued in a whisper and was drunk besides whats going on i cant talk about it now i made a mess of things i can say that much darcy laid a hand on brennas shoulder until she finished her study you look terrible was it a big fight or a little one it wasnt a fight at all with shawn she glanced over at the kitchen door wondering how they were going to deal with it all and with each other now got drunk did he well now i wish id thought of that let me go on to work darcy its going to be a long night and the sooner its started the sooner its done if anyone expected her to leave it at that they didnt know darcy gallagher at the first opportunity she was in the kitchen she took a good look at her brother as she relayed orders though he was a bit rough around the edges still he appeared sober and steady brennas come in darcy noted with interest that shawns steady motion with the rolling pin broke she looks unhappy and so do you he went back to rolling out the pastry for meat pies well be all right ill help you he flicked his eyes up why because shes my oldest and dearest friend in all the world and you though an accident of fate are my brother humor flickered across his face well be all right darcy he repeated its for us to work it out youre turning down the assistance of an expert in this particular field of battle he began to score the dough measuring it into neat squares ill hold you in reserve if its all the same to you well its your choice after all she started out stopped turned around does she matter knowing how well his sister read faces shawn kept his head lowered do you think i dont know what comes out of my mouth goes in your ear then off your tongue and into her ear it wont if you ask me he looked up then loyalty was her finest trait as far as he was concerned and he knew shed sooner break her arm than her word then im asking you i feel its my life up on a thin and slippery line step off one way the grounds solid off the other its a bog you sink in and its over then watch your step darcy advised and went back into the pub the noise level was already rising it would be a din hushed down once the music started and peaking again at every break the band took brenna worked the taps with both hands even while she listened to jack brennan lumber his way through a joke hed heard about a princess and a frog though her heart wasnt in it she laughed at the end when the band began to set up she ordered herself to pay no mind no mind at all but her gaze wandered over nonetheless and locked on the blond singer just the type shawn would drift back to she thought shallow bastard what would it take him a month a week a bloody night before he rolled atop another woman im almost afraid to ask jude said as she slid onto a stool but can i have a mineral water you can brenna got the glass remembered ice as jude had that yank preference for it why would you be afraid to ask because you look as if you want to punch someone i wouldnt want it to be me itd more likely be myself or that blonde over there eileen why to start she has tits brenna set the glass down ordered herself to put the rest aside you look well tonight jude frances well and happy im both ive gained two more pounds i cant get my trousers hooked anymore brenna took orders and coin continued to work the taps so youll make use of all those maternity clothes darcy talked you into dont you want a tablea chair for your back no im fine here for now im just staying long enough for the first set and a bowl of soup you want a meal it came out as an accusation making jude stare well id considered it youll want a table brenna said briskly if jude ordered from a table it would be darcys job to go into the kitchen no i dont ive gotten some bits and pieces about trouble between you and shawn you cant deal with it brenna if you cant so much as open that door and shout out an order for soup maybe i dont want to deal with it when jude only folded her hands on the bar brenna hissed out a breath you know im finding married women a pain in the ass she finished building a guinness pulled a pint and a glass of lager and exchanged them for the price youve got fairy tales on your brain she continued thats not how it is here i might agree with you but for one thing well two things carrick and lady gwen brenna snorted and started another pair of pints theyve nothing to do with me ill tell you how id end a fairy tale she continued thinking of jack brennans joke in mine the princess doesnt kiss the frog but dines well on frog legs at end of day ill get your damn soup spoiling for a fight she strode to the door shoved it open shawn was at the stove a wooden spoon in one hand a spatula in the other the heat had his hair curling just a bit and he needed a trim he hadnt bothered to shave which was an odd thing for shawn but under the days growth on his jaw was unmistakable bruising before she could speak the warm liquid voice of the blond singer drifted into the room it didnt matter if it was unreasonable it didnt matter if it was uncalled for it just pissed her off i need an order of soup its hot and ready he said easily because he gauged her mood ive my hands a bit full here if you wouldnt mind spooning it up yourself everyones hands are full she muttered but she got down a bowl what happened to your face he swiveled his jaw i wasnt watching my step aye i heard you got yourself a snootful well thats no answer since shed decided to snipe at him shawn reasoned she wasnt going to wallow and brood much better all around it served at the time she filled the bowl set it on a plate and now he wanted to lean over just lean to her while both their hands were occupied and close his mouth over hers instead he lifted a shoulder and now ill have to be more careful where i step for the hell of it he began to hum in harmony with eileens lovely voice you think its as easy as that do you well its not well talk about this after closing he let her have the last word since it was exactly what hed intended to say to her when she stalked out her face fierce he went back to work with a lighter heart a couple of tourists from cleveland overindulged brenna helped aidan steer them toward the b and b on foot as it was feared theyd break their necks if they attempted to ride their bikes even that far gauging his timing shawn slipped out ah well you got them off then i was thinking you might need an extra pair of hands no they should be able to stumble their way into bed aidan watched them lurch and weave down the street and shook his head at their offkey rendition of whiskey youre the devil a pair of yanks straight out of school well but whats a grand tour without one drunken night in an irish pub after all he caught shawns eye figured the meaning its been a long one so well call it a night thanks for helping out brenna its not a problem good night aidan its been longer for you and me shawn said when he and brenna were alone on the street it has but its not done id like a walk on the beach if its the same to you all right he didnt take her hand but walked beside her his own hands in his pockets its a fresh night full of moon thats lucky we wont freeze or fall on our faces he had to laugh youre such a romantic fool mary brenna a fool from time to time i was foolish with you knowing my sisters feelings with or without you i couldnt give her what she thinks she wants from me theres no getting past that im sorry shes hurt and sorrier still that it was you she struck out at but in thinking it through i dont know if there was a way it couldve been avoided i could have waited until her feelings for you faded off as they will so im the forgettable sort she glanced up at him then away that scores your pride but its the way it is shes barely twenty and cant see through the stars in her eyes but therere none in yours i see clear enough i started this with you and id end it i was prepared to end it but thats not the way to solve the matter mary kate wont forgive and forget just because i step away from you if shes to grow up she needs to learn how to face the hard things so youve decided for all of us then because he stopped she turned to him moonlight streamed at his back spilling over sand and sea like liquid pearls and in its light she saw his eyes werent calm and easy but very near to furious someone has to and its always you maybe ive had enough of you maybe i prefer having my life on balance instead of being in the middle of two women who want to bite and scratch nearly as shocked as she was offended she snapped at him i dont bite and scratch and i wasnt looking to fight mary kate or anyone over the likes of you it just happened and as far as you having enough of me she added thats a different tune youre singing than the one i heard only this morning i know a variety of tunes and as you think so little of me id suspect youd be relieved to part ways in this area both of us can find sex elsewhere when were in the mood for it its not just sex ah he thought finally isnt it he stepped closer backing her toward the sea isnt that what you said you wanted from me yes what was going on in those eyes of his she wondered they were black as night with thoughts and feelings she couldnt read but we have a caring for each other i wont have you cheapen whats between us that way but youll say what ill have and wont what ill do and dont he snatched her up seconds before she backed into the surf why would you want a man touching you who could be so easily ordered about shawn he had her up her feet dangling inches above the ground her heart began to boom set me down you want me to touch you even now thinking you can point and ill go here or ill go there you want my hands on you its nothing to be proud of he jerked her up another inch fuck pride and when his mouth crushed down on hers it was rough and ruthless she might have resisted might have shoved and struggled but she did none of those things she gave because he so rarely demanded she gave because she needed to as her body began a fevered quaking she said his name i could have you right here and now he dropped her abruptly on her feet think about why that is i have she couldnt think at all not with her insides churning and the blood roaring in her head like the sea at her back im going home go then i wont stop you he tucked his hands back in his pockets so he wouldnt be tempted to do just that mind this brenna i wont come to you once you work out whats inside you yourself you know where to find me she walked away shawn could say what he would about pride but she needed herself she didnt start running until her boots hit the street thats the way you charm the ladies is it carrick stood in the shallow surf and lifted the silver pipe he held to his lips to play a quick tune what strange ways you mortals have i know what im about here im sure you think you do you peabrain if you love the woman why do you let her wiggle away like that because i love her the fury hed barely held in check broke out now as he rounded on carrick and you didnt do so very well in your own time with your own woman did you carricks eyes flashed a wild blue that matched the lightning that split the starstrewed sky youre looking to take on the likes of me now gallagher the younger he stepped out of the surf on boots that were soft and dry didnt your dear mother ever warn you about what comes of challenging the good people you dont worry me carrick you need me its come down to you with all your power and all your tricks needing a mortal man so hold your threats and your light shows they dont impress me temper simmered settled hah the woman thinks she knows whats in you but shes yet to dig deep enough have a care you dont show her too much too quickly and scare her off go to the devil carrick flashed his teeth he wont have me said he and faded away to the tune of his pipe chapter seventeen brenna went to early mass the little church with cool morning light coming through the glass smelled of candle wax and holy water it always seemed to her that holy water carried a faint metallic scent when brenna was a child mollie told her it was the blessings in it she often remembered that found comfort in that whether she dipped her fingers in the church font or the water of saint declans well a baby was fussing in the back pew little fretful squawls that his mother tried to hush with murmurs and pats brenna didnt mind it it was rare to sit at mass and not hear a baby whimpering or wailing or children squirming starched clothes scratching against worn wooden pews she liked the familiarity of it as much as the ritual it was a fine time and place for thinking which to her mind was the same as praying half the time she had choices to make and if she wanted to repair the damage that had been done she had to make them quickly when there was a crack in something it only widened if you didnt tend to it let it go long enough a crack became a break and you had a hell of a mess on your hands there was damage now to her relationship with mary kate a split that could undermine the foundation of blood and heart shed had a part in causing it left as it was that damage could run through and fracture the bond of her entire family how it was repaired would determine whether that bond held firm or showed the scars the same was true of shawn there was a foundation there built over a lifetime of affection and shared memories and friendship she wouldnt stand aside and watch it crumble choices she thought of where to begin the repairs and how to go about them each choice took steps and only she could take them best if she began now she slipped out a few minutes before the service ended that way she avoided anyone who wanted to chat or gossip or ask after her family she drove home a bit nervous in the stomach regions but with her mind made up as to which step to take first there you are mollie dressed for church met her at the door i heard you go out earlier ive been to mass oh well the lot of us are about to go ourselves mary katell have to go later brenna moved in and started up the stairs she can use my lorry brenna i want no fighting in this house on the lords day there wont be brenna promised she had a mind to fight elsewhere should it be necessary she got to the top of the steps just as her father came out of his room his face was red and glowing from his shave his hair showing the forks of his comb like little furrows in a sandy field her heart all but broke with love for him dad it was awkward and he imagined it would be so between them for a little while yet but there were tears swimming into her eyes that he couldnt bear your mothers gathering us up for mass ive already been ah well he shifted his feet im after an early start in the morning those back steps of olearys finally fell through as weve been telling them they would of course oleary fell through with them which is no more than he deserves for letting them rot as he did well start there first thing she understood that either of them could have dealt with the job alone that he was having them work together healed the widest crack in her heart ill be ready dad well be late for mass if you dont shake out the lead mollie called up tomorrows as good as today was all mick said and touched his hand lightly to brennas arm as he passed her she took a deep breath not for everything she muttered and pushed open the door to her sisters room alice mae sat patiently on the side of the bed her good shoes polished her hair brushed to a rose gold gleam mary kate primped in front of the mirror adding a coat of mascara to her lashes her eyes were still a little swollen from weeping but her mouth formed a thin sharp line when she saw brenna alice darling mas calling go on now mary kate gave her hair one more toss im coming with you alice mae no youre not brenna corrected and stepped in front of the doorway youll have to make a later mass i dont have to do anything you say you can come with me and have this out away from the house as ive promised ma thered be no fighting in it or you can sulk day and night like a child if you want to be a woman mary kate ill be in my lorry waiting it took less than five minutes for mary kate to saunter out of the house and climb into the lorry shed added lipstick brenna noted as she zoomed out into the road she couldnt understand why so many females saw paint as a kind of shield or weapon then again she knew her ancestors had painted themselves blue before screaming into battle as she figured it as neutral turf or if anything leaned a bit toward mary kates side she drove to the cliff hotel and parked she got out and began to walk knowing her sister would follow and where are you going mary kate demanded somewhere you can toss me off a cliff somewhere i think the both of us will respect enough not to start pulling hair or punching they followed the path crossing the cliffs where the air still had a bite it seemed winter wasnt quite ready to surrender to spring but there were wildflowers beginning to show their faces and tuneful birds that sang out as high and loud as the crying gulls she passed the ruin of the cathedral once built in the name of saint declan and moved beyond his well be yond the three stone crosses toward the ground that held the dead and their markers this is holy ground brenna began and im standing on it when i tell you i wronged you youre my sister my blood and i didnt consider your feelings not as i should have im sorry for it it threw mary kate off and that alone was enough to stir her temper again do you think that makes up for it im thinking its all i can say are you giving him up i thought i would brenna said slowly that was part pride ill give him up for her i thought then shell see how id sacrifice to keep her happy the other part was guilt that id done something to hurt you and ending things with shawn would be my penance for it id think youd have more guilt than pride in the way youve behaved temper flashed once a bright warning in her eyes then brenna snuffed it she knew her sister and she knew just how clever mary kate could be in inciting anger to overpower her opponents reason ive no guilt over whats been between myself and shawn but only that what is between us has hurt and embarrassed you the cool delivery only added impact to the words and for that i was prepared to turn from him as a lover and perhaps as a friend as well then reconsidering it seemed to me that doing that would be something akin to giving in to a childs tantrum and thats hardly treating you or your feelings with respect youre just twisting it all around so you can have what you want suddenly the four years separating them seemed like forty and made brenna unbearably tired there were tears in mary kates voice hot and spiteful ones that reminded brenna of times theyd squabbled over a new toy or the last biscuit in the tin do i want shawn i do i havent figured it all out as yet but the wantings there and i cant deny it im facing you here woman to woman and telling you he wants me as well im sorry mary kate for the unhappiness it causes you but he isnt looking at you that way mary kates chin came up and brenna thought her own would have done the same under the circumstances he might if you werent warming his bed that caused a hitch in her stomach but she nodded the fact is i am in his bed and i wont be rolling out of it to make room for you yesterday i might have because i couldnt stand seeing you so hurt and knowing i was part of the cause but im looking at you here mary kate in clear light with a clear head and youre not hurting now youre just mad how do you know what i feel for him i dont tell me she threw up her head so her hair flew in the frisky wind i love him it was a passionate and almost sweetly dramatic declaration brenna gave her full marks for it knowing she herself could never have pulled it off so impressively why because hes handsome and sensitive and kind aye hes all of those thingsas is the clooney dog what of his flaws he doesnt have any of course he does the fact of them smoothed out brennas nerves and made her feel oddly sentimental hes stubborn and slow to move and absentminded there are times youll be talking to him and you might as well be talking to yourself as his brains gone off somewhere else he lacks ambition and needs to be prodded along every other step or hed stay happy in the same place forever thats how you see him i see him as he is not as a pretty picture out of a book mary kate she stepped forward knowing it was too soon to reach out lets be honest here we two theres something in the way he looks in the air of him that makes a woman want i understand how he makes you feel in that area and ive wanted him myself since i was no older than alice mae something flickered in mary kates eyes i dont believe you you dont wait for anything i thought id get over it then i thought id make a fool of myself brenna pushed at her hair wished shed thought to tie it back before coming up the cliff in the end it was more than a wanting it was a needing you dont love him i think i might the minute the words were out brenna pressed a hand to her heart as if someone had just delivered a blow to it i think i might she said again then just slid down to her knees oh sweet god almighty what am i to do mary kate could only gape her sister had gone dead white and was rocking on her knees and clutching her chest as if she was having a seizure stop that youre playacting im not i cant i cant seem to breathe right suspicious mary kate walked over and gave brenna a hefty thump on the back there her breath whooshed out wheezed in thanks she sank weakly onto her heels i cant deal with this now i cant i shouldnt be expected to it was bad enough the way things were but this wont do it wont do at all this fixes nothing but only shifts the weight damn it since brenna made no move to get up mary kate sat down i think i could forgive you if you were in love with him are you just saying you are so i will no and i didnt say i was i said i might be desperate brenna grabbed her sisters hand youre to tell no one i want your word youre to say nothing of this or ill strangle you in your sleep swear it to me oh for heavens sake why should i go around telling anyone so i can look like a bigger horses ass itll probably go away why should you want it to in love with shawn gallagher brenna rubbed her hands over her face ran them back into her hair what a pretty mess that would be wed drive each other crazy inside a yearme always wanting to get things done him dreaming the time away the man cant remember to plug in a cord much less fix one thats gone off what difference does that make you can fix it and dreamings what he does how else could he make up all that music and whats the point of making it up if you do nothing with it brenna waved it away oh it doesnt matter its not what either of us was after when we started im just doing the bloody female thing and it annoys me why do women have to turn attraction into love maybe there was love hiding under the attraction all along brenna lifted her head why do you suddenly have to get wise maybe because youre not treating me like a foolish girl anymore and maybe because when i look at you right now it occurs to me that it might not have been love i was feeling for him it didnt make me go pale and tremble thats for certain and she sat back a faint sneer on her face maybe because its satisfying under the circumstances to see you look weak and terrified you damn near pulled my hair out by the roots yesterday you got your licks in well it was you taught me to fight at the memory of it sentimental tears clouded mary kates eyes im sorry i called you a whore i did it the first time out of anger and the others out of spite she dabbed at her eyes and im sorry for the things i wrote about you in my diarywell sorry for some of them we wont let it matter their fingers linked i dont want him or anyone between us im asking you not to make me push him away so you can feel righteous and me guilty no ill have none of that a ghost of a smile flitted around her mouth i can get me own man when i want one but she angled her head theres one thing id like to know what would it be does he kiss as well as it seems he would from looking at him when he puts his mind to it he can melt every bone in your body mary kate sighed i had a feeling she walked to the cottage but her mind wasnt much clearer when she arrived than it had been when shed started out there was rain coming a soft one brenna thought from the way the sun was shining under the clouds a good day to curl up by a fire she thought but of course there wasnt a puff of smoke rising from the chimney at faerie hill cottage shawn forgot such things twice as often as he remembered them his car was gone so she imagined hed taken himself off to church shed wait she passed through the garden gate and glancing up half expected to see the quiet green eyes of lady gwen watching but nothing stirred mortal or otherwise she stepped in nearly tripped over his work boots that lay where hed kicked them off the night before with a good coating of dirt on the heels she nudged them aside with the toe of her own then crossed over into the little front parlor to build a fire his music sheets were scattered over the piano and a cup that would have held his tea was sitting carelessly on a table as was a squat green bottle that held a clutch of flowers from the front garden he would think of such things she mused he wouldnt remember to clean off his boots and neither did she more often than not but hed take the time and have the thought to put flowers out why didnt she think of things like that she liked a house with flowers and with candles sitting about and the scents they created together that made the air delicate she would think of cleaning the chimney out and laying by turf or wood but she would never think of the little touches that turned house to home hanging curtains was one thing she decided thinking of lace was another altogether after the fire was going she rose to wander to the piano had he worked here last night she wondered hed been angry with her did he work off a mad here as well as dream his hearts in his song she frowned as she sifted through the pages scribbled with notes and words if that were true why did he leave his music all tossed about this way why didnt he do something with it how could she care so much for a man who lacked basic drive surely it wasnt enough for a man to have such a light inside him if he didnt use it for something these pearls i now lay at your feet she murmured reading his work are only moonshed tears for every time my heart does beat it weeps for you across the years night by night the spell holds fast until the day love breaks the past so he sings of legends brenna thoughtand waits for what she set the sheet aside again when she heard his car hed seen the smoke and knew it would be brenna what he would do about it he was less certain he had to hope as he did with his music that the next passage would just come to him he stepped into the house and turned as she walked to the parlor doorway theres a chill in the mornings yet i lit your fire he nodded do you want some tea no she couldnt read his face and it worried her you were angry with me last night are you still not as much well the sense of awkwardness was something new and not at all welcome i thought i should tell you i had some words with mary kate this morning private words then its better between you it is yes im glad of it with a little time i hope shell be comfortable with me again as well shell be embarrassed for a while but as for the rest after i pointed out all of your flaws she thinks perhaps shes not in love with you after all he lifted his brows that was clever of you shawn she laid a hand on his arm when he started into the room so they stood framed in the doorway im sorry for how we left things last night im sorry were words that didnt slide easily off her tongue he knew so they meant more then so am i and i dont mind your flawsor most of themvery much she smelled of sunday shampoo and soap and her eyes were full of apologies then its better between us as well i want it to be he crossed over sat in the single chair that wasnt full of sheet music why dont you come sit with me awhile mary brenna her eyes twinkled as relief sparkled through her she thought she knew what he was about she couldnt think of a finer way to make up after walking to him she sat on his lap angling herself so their faces were close friends again we ever were i hardly slept for worrying wed never be easy with each other again though i know we promised wed stay friends and we will is friends all youre wanting to be just now for an answer she closed the distance between them and laid her lips on his her little sigh slid into him warm familiar now he drew her closer lingering over the kiss drawing it out soft and sweet before trailing his lips up to her brow then he tucked her head on his shoulder circled his arms comfortably around her puzzled she sat still waiting for his hands to move in the way and to the places she expected but he only held her while the fire smoked and simmered and the rain flowed in to splat and patter gradually she relaxed against him sinking into the comfort and coziness lulled by the intimacy of silence shed never had a lover like him one who understood her who was content to cuddle away a rainy morning was that why shed fallen in love with him or had she always felt the same without knowing it whatever the answer it had to be dealt with explored and examined until the pieces fit im wondering she began if the next evening you have free youd like to go with me up to waterford city ill take you to dinner he smiled into her hair shed taken her time working up to courting him but this was a fine start at it would you be wearing that dress you put on for the dubliner some time back i could i like the way it fits you if im wearing a dress wed best take your car ill give it a good goingover today your engines missing and your oils filthy from the quick look i had under the hood id say the last time your battery connections were cleaned was when i did it myself i prefer leaving such matters to the experts youre just lazy about it theres that as well was that one of the flaws that has mary kate reconsidering it was youre a feckless sort shawn gallagher well now feckless is a harsh word im sorry if it insults you she shifted and didnt look sorry at all but you must admit ambition isnt your middle name ive ambition enough when it matters doesnt your music matter hed leaned forward to nip at her ear but shed thrown him off his rhythm what does my music have to do with it careful brenna she thought take the pieces apart but dont damage them you sit here and make it then leave it all tossed about i know where everything is the point is what are you doing with it getting pleasure from it a block here she noted studying the way his face closed up it would take deft hands to work around itbut she was determined to do it it was one of the steps that needed to be taken thats fine and good but dont you want more dont you want other people to have the pleasure of it as well you dont even like my music now when have i said that at his bland stare she shrugged well if i didtwas only to annoy you i like it very well and now and then when youve played one of your tunes in the pub or at a ceili others have too thats friends and family exactly im a friend arent i you are then will you give me a tune he shifted wary what do you mean give you a tune just that let me have a song for my own a barter for fixing your car on impulse she got up gestured to the piano youve dozens and theyre just lying about id like to have one he didnt believe that for a minute but he couldnt see the trap or the harm its some mood youre in otoole but all right ill give you one he rose but when he started to push through the piles she slapped his hand away no i get to pick it its only fair she snatched up the one shed been reading the one she realized shed been picking out on the keyboard when lady gwen had first shown herself i like this one its not finished yet he couldnt put a finger on the point of his panic he only knew he felt it it needs work its the one i want you wouldnt be stepping back from a bargain would you no but good she folded the sheets in a way that made him wince and tucked them in her back pocket its mine now and thank you she rose up on her toes kissed him lightly ill drive you to the pub drop you off for work that way i can bring your car back to my house where my tools are ill have it running smooth for you ive a bit of time yet well i dont ive considerable to do today if i brought your car down to you before closing would you give me a lift back he tried to put the song out of his mind shed forget it soon enough he decided back to where she smiled slowly here would be just far enough she had one stop to make before she drove home to change and get out her tools with shawn safely at the pub brenna drove down to judes house and parked jude was out in the front garden getting a jump on spring her gloves were already dark with dirt and there were a number of sketches on the walkway beside her at brennas approach she sat back on her heels and tipped up the straw hat she was using to protect her head from the drizzling rain something wrong with your lorry no im doing some work on shawns car as hed rather be nibbled by ants than lift the bonnet your drawings are getting wet i know i have to stop i just wanted to hurry spring along ah youve sketched out your ideas for your gardens crouching brenna used her back to protect the papers like a blueprint thats a clever notion it helps me see it lets go inside out of the wet she started to rise then shifted and put a hand on the slope of her belly my center of gravitys changing another few months you wont be able to get up off your knees without a rope and pulley here ill get these brenna picked up the sketches and judes garden basket i saw colleen ryan going into the market the other day shes due any minute she waddles jude said as they stepped into the house its very sweet but i intend to glide madonnalike through my term you keep thinking that darling brenna carried the basket back to the little mudroom off the kitchen and spread the drawings out on the counter to dry the kettle went on the biscuit tin came down i told aidan id come into the pub for lunch with a sheepish grin jude bit into a sugar cookie but im always hungry these days nothing spoils my appetite expecting looks good on you jude i remember the first time i saw you a year ago standing in the rain at the door to faerie hill cottage looking lost youre found now what a lovely way to put it yes im found now things i wanted and could hardly admit even to myself that i wanted happened you made them happen some of it she nibbled on the cookie while brenna paced the kitchen and some things are meant to be you have to be willing enough brave enough to let them happen when you discovered you loved aidan did you tell him straight out no i was afraid to i didnt trust myself enough brennas eyes sharpened or him or him jude admitted before i came here i never made things happen and it wasnt courage that had me letting them happen around me or to me it was fear and passivity i had to learn the difference to take charge of some things to trust others to fall into place but you had to take steps yes are you in love with shawn frowning brenna sat it seems i am im not ashamed to say its a shock to the system love looks well on you brenna at the turn of her own words brenna let out a short laugh it doesnt feel well but i suppose ill get used to it ill get the tea she said when the kettle sputtered no sit have you told him not bloody likely as a thought struck brenna looked over quickly as jude dealt with the tea i know married couples tend to tell each other most everything but you dont want me to mention this to aidan i dont then i wont thanks brenna let out a breath its a matter now of taking those steps and figuring out which come first as well as i know himshawn im meaninghes not as predictable as i thought before we changed things between us the dynamics are different between lovers than they are between friends even lifelong friends ive discovered that still i know he often takes a good kick in the ass to get moving in some areas im taking that first step with something that bothers me the most and that i think underneath means the most to him shifting her seat she tugged out the sheets of music one of his songs i badgered him into giving it to me theres talent here isnt there jude i think so why doesnt he pursue it you understand how the mind works youre asking a former and mediocre psychology professor jude set the pot on the table fetched cups but my educated guess would be that hes afraid of what of failing in the thing that matters most what if it isnt good enough what if he isnt good enough there are a lot of us who circle that abyss brenna she poured out the tea youre not one of them you just roll up your sleeves and build a bridge over it then im after building one over his he gave me this song and i can do what i like with it i want to send it to someone whod know about such things whod know if its worth buying without telling shawn i wont feel guilty about that brenna muttered if it doesnt work out hell never have to know will he and if it does how can he be anything but pleased im not sure how to go about it or who to send it along to i thought you might have some ideas on it id be wasting my breath trying to talk you out of this you would jude nodded then ill save it i dont know anything about the music business i could ask my agent though i dont think shed as an idea formed she trailed off worked on it what about magee hes built theaters he has to know people in entertainment maybe hed have some connections thats a good notion i can get you his address you can write to him brenna ran her fingers over the notes and the words on the sheet in front of her that takes too long do you have a phone number chapter eighteen the soft rain became a pounding and the pounding a flood swept in by galeforce winds that beat against the coastline and rocked the boats at their moorings for the best part of a week it was too rough to cast a net from shore to horizon was nothing but angry churning gray slashed by whitecaps that looked keenedged enough to slice through a hull those who made their living from the sea waited it out with the grim patience honed in them over generations wind screamed against windows and doors in a constant banshee call and snuck through any crack or crevice to chill the bones smoke belched back down chimneys in nasty fitful streams plucking fingers of wind tore a few shingles from the roof of the market so that they careened away like drunken birds one swooped down and sliced at the back of young davey olearys head as he rode his bike home with a quart of milk and a dozen eggs the head required seven stitches the eggs were a total loss flowers that had wintered over happily enough and those that had begun to show their spring faces were chewed to pieces by the last teeth of winter dooryards went to mud tourists steered clear and reservations were canceled as the storm gleefully battered ardmore power and phone lines gave out on the third day the village huddled down as it had time and again to weather the storm under more than one roof the mood was edgy young children bored and restless drove their mothers mad tears and warmed bottoms were daily occurrences brenna and her father shielded with slickers and wellingtons stood kneedeep in mud and worse as they searched out the break in the duffys septic system filthy work this mick rested against his shovel more than one lowlanders going to find himself wading in shit if this keeps up if those bastards from waterford had showed up wed have the tank pumped out at least if they ever get here with their big pumper i say we toss them headfirst into the muck thats my girl christ jesus what a smell but i think heres the matter dad they hunkered down rain beating over their heads and studied the old cracked line with identical expressions of interest and thoughtfulness on their faces its just as you figured dad the pipes old and gave out under the added pressure it runs from tank to field and burstings turned mrs duffys nice yard into a dung heap well once shes cleared out kathyll have herself a wellfertilized garden wont she as the stench was enormous mick breathed through his teeth it was a good job of you to think of going and getting the pvc pipe ahead of time well replace it and see whats what with a grunt brenna got to her feet they squished over to the truck together the work was nasty but the teamwork routine as they worked she shot little glances at him hed said nothing about shawn not a word and though she understood her father would have some delicacy of feeling about the situation she couldnt stand having it between them unsaid it was a wedge and she needed to knock it loose dad ha nearly got her now bitch may be cracked but shes tough on the joinings dad you know im still seeing shawn mick rapped his knuckles hard against the pipe and his tool squirted out of his hand like wet soap keeping his eyes lowered he plucked it out again then wiped it on his equally filthy trousers i suppose i do are you ashamed of me he worked another moment in silence never have you done anything to shame me brenna but the fact is youre stepping onto boggier ground than were swimming in working with you respecting and admiring your skills is on the one hand but on the other youre my daughter its not an easy thing for a man to discuss such areas with his daughter sex damn it brenna under the filth on his face his cheeks went pink as peonies its there isnt it when the ruined pipe was wrenched free she shoved it aside so is the shit im sitting in at the moment but id just as soon not dwell on it youve been reared as best as your mother and i could and the steps you take as a grownup woman are your own you cant ask me for my blessing in such a thing brenna but im not judging you either hes a good man dad when did i say he wasnt exasperated embarrassed and wanting an end to the topic at hand mick scooted slithered so they could fit the new pipe its just what mary kate said last week she was mad as spit and weve come to our terms on it but i dont want you to think that its cheap between us the girl he thought was as ever like a terrier with a bone she wouldnt have done until it was chewed to her satisfaction what mary kate said to you was uncalled for between sisters and its pleased i am the two of you have made it up as for the other do you care for him i do of course yes and respect him the slight hesitation had mick looking over the pipe meeting brennas eyes ah well now i do respect him he has a good brain when he bothers to use it and he has a kind heart and a good humor that doesnt make me blind to his faults i know hes lazy about things and careless with his own talents on this i do have something to say though youll go your own way no matter he straightened rolled his shoulders you dont fix a man the way you do a fault in a pipe or a leak in a roof you take him as he is mary brenna or you dont take him at all she frowned its not like that but more of a turning in the right direction right for who he gave her a pat on the arm adjustments cant be all on one side darling else the balance goes off and whats being built just falls down for shawn brennas appearance at the back door in the middle of the lunch shift was a shock to all his senses she was filthy from cap to boot and even with the distance let off an aroma that watered the eyes mother of god whatve you been doing septic tank she said cheerfully we scraped and hosed off the worst of it you missed a few spots from where im standing well weve got to do what we can to put mrs duffys yard back together so we didnt bother with all of it but the fact is were near to starving he held up a hand if youre thinking of coming in here otoole pause and reflect im not coming in i told dad id walk up and get us a couple of sandwiches to keep us going and we could use a couple bottles of beer step back out and close the door i will not to annoy him she leaned against the jamb im not hurting anything way over here whatever makings you have handyll do we arent particular thats obvious enough he bumped back the orders hed been filling and got out bread and meat it amused her to see him work with a great deal more speed than was his habit well be a couple hours yet then ive a few things to do i hope bathings one of them its on the list from the looks of things in here the weathers not slowing down your business half the village is in day or night people look for company as much as anything else and a change of view from their own four walls he layered meat and cheese generously weve a seisiun going most the time and a few heated tempers over whatever sporting match is on the telly now that weve got the generator running its keeping us hopping as well i dont think weve had an hour free dad and me since the storm rolled in im looking forward to it rolling out havent seen sun nor star in a week now tim riley says shes breaking though it was easy talk weather and work the sort she could have with anyone she knew wasnt it nice she mused that she liked having it with shawn best of all that was a kind of treasure one she hadnt cherished enough in the past well whether tims right or hes wrong i was thinking i might wander up to faerie hill later on say a bit after midnight the doors open but id appreciate you cleaning off your wellies first he put the sandwiches in a sack added a couple of bags of crisps and two bottles of harp when she started to dig out payment he shook his head no this is on the house i dont think i want any coin you might have in those pockets thanks she took the bag rested it on her hip arent you going to kiss me no but ill make it up to you later see that you do with a grin that might have been flirtatious under different circumstances she sauntered off and left him to close the door she was a woman of her word and she opened the door of his cottage at the stroke of midnight too early she knew for him to be home from work but she liked the quiet of the place the mood of it when she was there alone she took off her boots at the door as shawn often did himself and wandered around in her stocking feet lighting candles and oil lamps as the power had yet to be restored and as she did she was half hoping lady gwen might show herself wasnt it the perfect time for a ghost after all a stormy night alive with rain and whistling wind a little cottage alight with candles and the glow of a fire i know youre here and theres no one but me she waited but the air was still the only sounds the ticking of the cottage as it settled and the incessant call of the wind i wanted you to know that i think i understand what you were telling me that first time his hearts in his song and i have listened i hope what i did was the right thing again she fell silent and again only silence answered her well a lot of help you are irked she marched upstairs she didnt need any ghostly visitations or words from beyond to tell her what to do and how to do it she knew what she was about she had a man she intended to keep since her mind was set on it it was just a matter of seeing to the details she lighted the fire here as well and banked it for the night after setting the flame to a pair of candles she dropped onto the bed propped the pillows at her back and settled down to wait and the days work caught up with her there was no wind no rain the sky was midnight silk studded with stars that flashed ruby sapphire citrine the moon full and white sailed high spilling its light over a sea as calm as a lake the wings of the white horse beat like a heart steady and true astride him the man in silver rode with his back straight and proud while his dark mane of hair streamed back like a cape it wasnt wealth or stature or even immortality she wanted from me it seemed not odd at all to be riding with the prince of faeries and sweeping over ireland what was it she wanted from you promises vows words that come out of the heart why is it that saying i love you is so hard for some saying it lowers all shields he turned his head his eyes bright and bitter exactly so it takes courage for that does it not mary brenna otoole or foolhardiness if love doesnt make a fool of us what will the horse swooped downward at a speed that had her heart bounding with excitement she saw the light glow against the window glass and the shape and shadows of the cottage on the faerie hill hooves sent sparks shooting when they met ground a simple place carrick murmured for so much drama there that pretty garden gate it might be the wall of a fortress for i cant pass through it as once i did she walks the cliffs as well your love she does im told but we cant so much as see each other though we might stand near as side by side there wasnt bitterness in his eyes now but sorrow and brenna thought a painful kind of longing at times i feel her there or catch the scent of her hair or her skin but not once in a hundred years times three have i been able to see or to touch or so much as speak my heart to her you cast a harsh spell on the both of you brenna commented i did yes and i have paid for that rash moment of temper you know of such things he said i do indeed and fortunate it is i havent the power to conjure or cast mortals amusement softened his face youve no concept of what powers you hold and so you use what you have most carelessly on yourselves and each other thats pot calling kettle as you see it he agreed with a nod but there was no faerie magic in what began between me and gwen i neither tricked nor lured her to me as some tell the tale she came to me willing until her father forbade her until he promised her to another for fear of me i believe the truth of that because she did she laid a comforting hand on his arm a maid had less say in such choices then carrick tossed his leg over the horse slid down then make yours i have she mirrored his move watched his mouth twitch but ill follow through in my own way listen was all he said the music drifted out on the air wove around her like a silk net its shawn playing the song he gave me oh she closed her eyes it fills the heart right up theres nothing in your raft lovelier than that she said reaching down to open the gate but it held fast no matter how she pushed or pulled i cant open it panicked she whirled around but horse and rider were gone she turned back gripping the gate with both hands shoved shawn there now she was in his arms and there was a chuckle in his voice you were dreaming an excitable one dreaming her mind was full of mists and stars and music i couldnt open the gate i couldnt get in you are in i am in god im fuzzybrained yet i mustve dropped off like a rock she pushed at her hair give me a minute to wake up ive some news that might clear the cobwebs what is it aidans taken with your drawings of the theater as hed suspected they would the clouds in her eyes cleared immediately really is he he is yes so pleased in fact hes already spoken of them to the magee what did he say which of them both either she gripped his arms and shook dont play with me shawn or ill have to hurt you sure and thats a frightening thought so ill tell you i cant relay exactly what magee said as it was aidan who spoke with him but it seems that the mans interested enough to want to take a look at what youve drawn up shawn toyed with her hair as he spoke a new habit he was enjoying so theyre going off to new york city and well see what we see its a good design it looked good to me it would work and work well worrying over it she gnawed at her lip any dunderhead would see that it blends with whats here adds to it rather than overpowering he wont get better from any of his fancy architects you have to work on your confidence brenna so much modestys unseemly she only snorted but how is magee to know that if he cant actually see the way the pub sits and how the land is and so on he has photographs shawn reminded her finkle took dozens while he was here its not the same i should talk to magee myself is what i should do you may be right but wouldnt it be best to give it a bit of time then see what he thinks before jumping in boots first and pushing at him some take a good push her lips slanted into a sneer as yourself is a perfect example when is aidan sending them maybe i should take another look at them first theyre already on the way he shipped them off in yesterdays post by special courier as magee requested well then well they would stand or fall on their own she thought as shawns song would she nearly blurted out that shed already spoken to magee herself and that between them they were keeping the man busy looking over their efforts no better to wait then give shawn the results instead of the worry of wondering and what are you thinking of so hard and long the next steps and what happens after theyre taken it seems when one thing changes everything changes with it ive thought the same myself look at us he thought and brushed her hair back from her face her pulse stumbled another change she realized that his just touching her could cause that sudden and vivid awareness does it worry you no but if it concerns you at the moment id rather just take you dreaming again his lips cruised over hers as he laid her back if you hold on to me well go together i want to be with you youre the only one it was the closest she could come to lowering her shields he took her dreaming gliding up sinking down with the lights of the candles and turf fire shimmering everywhere there was a tenderness in her she hadnt explored before a welling need to give whatever was asked and give gently they undressed each other no tugs no pulls this time fingers slid over skin and lips followed lingered so that each caress each taste was precious sigh answered murmur a mingling of breath desire without the red flash of flames was gilded at the edges even when he urged her up to that fine and trembling peak the glow held steady they watched each other as he slipped inside her it was like coming home his lips curved as they lowered to hers another link her hands lifted framed his face held him there just there while the beauty of it had tears swimming to her eyes come with me she murmured it against his mouth let go and come with me her breath caught as she began the tumble then released in a sigh when he took her hand and fell with her his mouth was on hers again before the mists cleared stay she shouldnt even as he shifted to draw her against his side she thought of all the reasons why it was best if she left now crept quietly into her own bed all right she said and settling her head on his shoulder slept of course by dawn hed shoved her to the edge of the bed that was a little something theyd have to work on brenna thought as she got up in the halflight shed be damned if shed spend every night of her life fighting for space on the mattress begin as you mean to go on her mother often said well shed begin by shoving her elbow into his ribs several times a night until he learned to share but her eyes were warm watching him as she dressed and the kiss she gave him before she left was unashamedly loving well get a bigger bed she whispered then hurried out to get home before her mother came down to make breakfast an hour later he woke alone and vaguely dissatisfied couldnt the woman have said goodbye at least that was going to change in fact the whole business was going to change and sooner than she might expect he wanted her in his life altogether and not just for snatches of time in his bed he rose and gauging his time figured he had plenty of it to have a look at the land hed gotten word was for sale chapter nineteen the price was as steep as the lay of the land but shawn liked the feel of it as he stood in what was no more than a drizzle now he could see the water from one direction stone gray to mirror the sky and calmer now the storm had died in the night but the beach was littered with shells and kelp and debris that had been heaved out of the sea he imagined they would face the house that way with at least one goodsize window in the front room so they could watch the moods of the water in back there was the rise of distant mountains shadowy bumps up into the cloudy sky then on either side was the fall of hills and fields the deep wet green shimmering through winding ribbons of mist he didnt have the talent to build a house in his mind sketch one on paper or take materials and tools and make it a reality not as brenna did but he could particularly when the interest was personal conjure up a glimmer of it he wanted a music roomwell not just for music he thought as he walked away from the area that he thought most likely for planting a house it would have to be comfortable and welcoming so others would feel easy about coming in and staying awhile but a room and not a tiny cramped one where he could have his piano and his fiddle hed want a kind of cabinetperhaps brenna could build itfor his music and a stand or whatever could be devised for a good tape recorder hed always meant to record his music and it was time to begin if he ever meant to get to the next step which he did in his own time and way and polish a few of his pieces the recorder was essential then hed see about choosing one and going about the business of peddling the tunes because the thought of it stretched his nerves he shook his head but not quite yet of course not quite yet he had a great deal to do first and more than enough time he and brenna had to come to terms first and the house had to be built then theyd want to settle into it and into each other for a while he would get to the other business by and by the road leading to the plot he was considering was a worse mess than the track that led from ardmore to faerie hill then down to the otooles house still it wouldnt worry him overmuch and if it troubled brenna it could be leveled some or widened or whatever that was a business hed leave to her it wasnt a big plot but enough for a sturdy house and garden room enough he calculated for a cabin as well as shed want one for her tools and perhaps a workshop she would need that just as he would his room for music theyd do very well with their separate interests he thought and was grateful neither of them was the type who needed to be in each others pockets day and night they had mutual and opposing ground and he thought it a nice mix there was a skinny stream in the far back and a trio of toughlooking trees that put him in mind of the three crosses near saint declans well the man who wanted to part ways with the land had said that there was a turf bog behind them and that no one had bothered to cut it for years he himself hadnt cut turf since he was a boy and went out with his grandfather on his mothers side the fitzgeralds had been more people of the land and the gallaghers people of the town shawn thought he might enjoy it if his life and comfort didnt absolutely depend upon it he wandered back toward what was grandly called a road where the hedgerows grew tall and had the first haze of spring on them as he did three magpies darted by like bullets shot from the same gun in rapid succession three for marriage he thought and decided it was more than sign enough for him when he drove away toward the village to work he considered himself a landowner as hands had been clasped and shaken on the deal brenna worked at home the early part of the morning the wind had torn a few shingles from the roof and a couple of leaks had sprung with the rain that had been driven hard by the wind it was simple enough work no more than a patch here and there and it gave her a fine opportunity to sit in the wavering sunlight and look out at the water when she built a house she thought shed choose higher ground so her view of the water would be from windows rather than a rooftop it was good to look and see the boats out again and know that life was sliding back into its regular rhythm and maybe shed have some sky windows as well so she could look up and see the sun or the rain or the drift of stars it was time for a home of her own she knew though shed miss the sounds and scents of family but there was something inside her that told her the time was now for the next stage of what she was and where she was going thered been a different tone between her and shawn the night before and it had changed everything in her once and forever her mind and her heart were in one place now it was time to tell him to ask him to browbeat him if there was no choice whatever it took the otooles were going to be planning another wedding god help them all she scooted over to the ladder climbed down leaving her toolbox by the back door she went in to tell her mother the job was done and shed be on her way when the phone rang she picked it up without thinking then guiltily tucked the receiver under her chin and wiped the shingle grime off her hands onto her jeans hello miss otoole this is one of them miss brenna otoole aye youve hit the target automatically brenna pulled open the refrigerator door and perused the contents what can i do for you would you hold the line please for mr magee oh she shot up straight bumping the door with her hip and slamming it on her own hand she bit back a yelp yes i could do that goddamn it she added in a mutter when she heard the line click and sucked at her sore fingers miss otoole trevor magee good day to you mr magee she recognized his deep smooth voice from the time shed waded through what had seemed like an army of assistants to speak with him are you calling from new york city no actually im on my way to london oh her initial disappointment in not taking a call from new york vanished in a fresh thrill are you calling from an airplane then thats right she wanted to shout for her mother to come quick but thought it would sound just a little too countrified its kind of you to take time out of your busy schedule i always make time for what interests me he sounded like he meant it and that the reverse was entirely true as well then perhaps youve had time to look at the package aidan gallagher sent you a good look you and your father are quite a team because her hand was throbbing she pulled some ice out of the freezer we are and i have to add mr magee i know ardmore and what suits it i cant argue with that miss otoole she thought she caught a hint of amusement in his tone and braced herself perhaps you could tell me what your thoughts are on my design then it interests me i have to look at it more thoroughly but it interests me gallagher didnt mention where you had studied design she narrowed her eyes then decided if it was a trap it was best to fall into it now as opposed to later on the job sir my father has worked in the trade all his life and i learned at his side i would imagine you had some of the same sort of experience with your own father you could say that then you know a lot can be learned by the doing of things between the two of us my father and i we handle most of the building and repairing in old parish and if we dont we know who does as that wed be some considerable help to you with your project youll find no better than the otooles in old parishor all of waterford for that matter youre planning to build in ardmore mr magee and its good business im sure youll agree to use local skill and labor when youre able well be happy to send you references and ill be happy to see them you build a strong case miss otoole i can assure you i build better with wood and brick than with words ill see that for myself as im hoping to carve out a day or two to visit the site personally before too much longer if you let us know the particulars my father and i will be happy to meet you at your convenience ill be in touch ah i dont mean to worry you mr magee but im wondering if you had a moment to look at the music i sent along to you yes i did im not sure i understand are you representing shawn gallagher no im not no its a bit complicated then he doesnt have representation ah no not at the present time how the devil did this sort of thing work you could say im acting on his behalf in this particular instance on a personal level hmm she winced thinking there was entirely too much knowledge in that small and casual sound would you mind telling me what you thought of it yourself enough to buy it if gallaghers selling and to want a chance to negotiate for his other work i assume he has other work he does yes scads of it she forgot her throbbing hand dropped her ice in the sink while her feet danced she fought to keep her voice cool and professional youre saying youd buy the tune but for what purpose would that be for the purpose of recording eventually but i was under the impression that you build things one of the things ive built is a record company celtic records he paused and sounded amused when he spoke again do you want references miss otoole well now could i be getting back to you on that ill need to discuss this with shawn of course my new york office knows how to reach me thank you for your time and consideration mr magee i hope to meet you in person before much longer i she simply ran out of words thank you the minute she hung up the phone she let out a shout of triumph then raced through the house to the front door ma ive got to go ill be back when i can go mollie dashed out of the back bedroom to the top of the stairs in time to see her daughters lorry bullet into the road that girl if its not the first thing its the second go where id like to know and is my roof finished or isnt it ill give her both sides of my tongue if i have to listen to water plopping into buckets one more night before she could go back to work she saw shawns car pull in all this coming and going around here she muttered and started down the steps its making my head spin she pushed open the door and waited while shawn made his way to her good morning to you shawn im afraid youve just missed brenna she went tearing out of here not a minute ago like her trousers were afire ah well he cleared his throat i wasnt actually coming by to see brenna werent you now she gave him a considering look but knew better than to wait for him to explain himself that she knew from experience could take half the day and shed as soon be sitting down for part of it well then im all thats left come inside why dont you and well have a cup id be grateful he ducked inside behind her and trailed her into the kitchen i dont want to take much of your time lad youve been in and out of this house since you could toddle no ones ever booted you out the door before and im not after starting now she waved a hand toward the table and went about the business of making tea brennas a heart and mind of her own as im sure you know that i do i thought i should come round to see if to make certain you she had to take pity on him are you afraid i dont love you anymore my handsome lad the worry in his eyes faded away as she reached over and scrubbed a hand over his hair as shed done as long as he could remember theres no danger of that changing now if youd taken up with my katie id have boxed your ears to the back of your head i never meant to give mary kate any encouragement might be the word youre after your tongues tied today boy and thats not the usual case for youve a slick one here now ive a cinnamon bun left from breakfast ill warm it for you and youll tell me whats the matter you make me miss my mother mrs otoole ill stand in her stead as she would in mine she bustled around the kitchen knowing it would put him at ease is brenna giving you headaches then im used to thati dont mind it so much i think i give them back to her in fair measure i ah im thinking mr otoole told you of our discussion a couple weeks back she sent him a look designed to wither a man if youre meaning on the day he came home drunk that he didnt i gathered well enough hed got the whiskey from you as he hasnt a world of choices where he could walk off drink his belly full and walk back again in so short a time he didnt speak to you of it closed up like a clam well you see he was angry and rightfully so until i told him how things were and how are things shawn mollie set down the pot waited im in love with brenna mrs otoole and i want to marry her she stood still a moment then laid her cheek on top of his head of course you are and of course you do dont mind me ive got to sniffle a bit ill be good to her oh theres no doubt in my mind of that dabbing at her eyes she turned to get out the warmed bun youll be good for her too and she for you the other part of it is ive been working her around so to speak so shed come to the idea herself you know how she is when shes got her teeth into a notion clamps down until she gets what shes after or it isnt worth having anymore i always said you were a bright lad shawn thousands wouldnt he said easily i thought i could wait you see im not one who needs to hurry as a rule but it seems i cant wait for this i bought land today she wasnt half as surprised as he thought she was and nearly twice as pleased goodness boy you can move fast enough when youve a mind to shell have her house as she wants it im not fussy about such matters mollie opened her mouth closed it again men she knew very well always said such things and believed them as well then they drove a woman to distraction picking at the details but that was for shawn and brenna to find out for themselves shes always had a mind to build her own she said at length i know it and why shouldnt she shes a talent for such things and a liking for the work myself ive no driving urge to pick up a hammer or saw but i make a good living and ill have a better one yet when the theater goes in there wont be a worry about putting a roof overhead or keeping one there shawn are you asking for my permission to ask brenna to marry you for your blessing it matters to me as much as it will to her ill give you my blessing she took his hands in hers and for all i love her my sympathy as well shell run you ragged i need a favor brenna burst into the pub through the back just as aidan was taking the chairs down timing was everything here she thought as she fought to catch her breath shawn would be coming in any minute well now you look full of surprise and secrets he tucked a chair under a table whats the favor first off i cant tell you the secret automatically she began to tip down chairs herself i have to ask you to do the favor blind he got a good look at her thenthe flushed face the wildly glowing eyes the foolish smile he recalled a very similar look on his wifes face at a certain moment oh lord brenna never say youre breeding breeding the chair nearly slipped out of her hands no no and though she laughed it off she found it interesting to discover she wouldnt have minded it its nothing like that aidan is there any way you could arrange for shawn to have the evening off the whole of it she heard the pain in his tone sympathized i know its a lot to be asking and at the last instant as well but its important ill work this weekend for no pay to make up for it ill go down and talk to mrs duffy myself to see that shell fill in why the devil doesnt shawn ask for time himself instead of sending you in to look at me with those big eyes he doesnt know she moved closer running a hand down his arm another part of the favor is that you dont tell him i asked could you just send him home somehow at the beginning of shift hell certainly wonder why wont he i havent had time to think it all out she whirled away paced but couldnt clear her head oh youll think of something aidan please its a matter of the heart i suppose and youre using mine against my good business sense he let out a windy sigh ill work it out for you oh youre the best and the finest she leaped into his arms to plant a hard noisy kiss on his mouth look at this will you if shes not after one brother shes after another with a lazy yawn darcy sauntered in thats a married man ill have you know you sneaky slut ive got one for you as well before darcy could evade brenna rushed over and gave her the same treatment sweet mary now shes after the girls too but darcys sleepy chuckle faded away she gripped brennas arms brenna are you pregnant oh for heavens sake no cant a body be happy without a baby in the belly ive got to go hell be coming in you dont tell him i was here please im grabbing a bottle of the french bubbly you keep in the back put it on my account would you she dashed out the way shed dashed in and left darcy rubbing her mouth and what was all that about i havent a clue but shes something up her sleeve and shawns not to know secrets i could get it out of her in five minutes no doubt you could aidan agreed but lets let her have her surprise ive already had mine darcy went behind the bar for her change apron shes in love with him does that trouble you no but for the fact that the gallaghers are tumbling like ripe fruit from a tree aidan moved behind the bar with her to check the till afraid its catching darling i would be was i not immune to such weaknesses she heard the back door open again and speaking of clueless theres himself now filled with affection and sentiment darcy headed for the kitchen to torment her brother what do you mean i can go up to his elbows in potatoes shawn turned his head to stare at aidan go where on your way kathy duffyll be right along well why to cover for you aidan had thought of a way and saw no reason not to have a little fun at his brothers expense while he was about it you have the evening off as you asked though its damned inconvenient shawn shoved peelings into the garbage i never asked for the evening off well it mustve been your evil twin then or ive just had a brainstorm fixing a scowl on his face aidan pulled open the refrigerator and plucked out a bottle of water i told you two days past when you asked that id work it out but i youve been dreaming ive ten pounds of potatoes here to deal with why would i be making stovies if i was planning on having the evening free thats a question i cant answer but ive kathy duffy coming in and theres no need for both of you tonight ive no plans but to do my job here youve mixed something up enjoying the timing aidan turned to darcy as she came in darcy did shawn ask for this evening free or did he not he did a couple of days back selfish bastard not one to let an opportunity pass she flashed a challenging look at aidan and since youre so bloody accommodating with our brother im wanting saturday afternoon off for myself saturday afternoon aidan nearly choked on his water you cant have a weekend day off as were heading into spring oh so its all right for him she pointed a finger toward a baffled shawn but its a different matter entirely for me i dont need the evening off youve got it aidan snapped and ground his teeth as darcy folded her arms a weekday evenings a different matter from a weekend afternoon all right fine then ill take the evening off monday next unless me being female means i dont get the same considerations as this one satisfied that shed boxed aidan in she flounced out i dont remember asking for tonight off shawn said vaguely aye and you dont remember to tie your bootlaces half the time seriously annoyed aidan jerked a thumb at the door out with you you troublemaker shoving up his sleeves and squaring his shoulders aidan went out to deal with his treacherous sister she had everything under control and quite the job of work it had been it had to be special and as close to perfect as she could manage shawn gallagher would see he wasnt the only one who could fuss and fiddle and set a nice scene shed been to the market and got all the makings while shawn had been busy cooking at the pub shed been doing the same at the cottage maybe she didnt have his flair with such things but she wasnt altogether helpless shed chilled the wine and had even ferreted out a tin pail shed scrubbed to use as an ice bucket the champagne glasses shed borrowed from jude flutes shed called them brenna thought and elegant they were shed set a nice table if she said so herself a pair of pretty plates and cloth napkins the flowers she scavenged from her mothers garden and the one at the cottage candles she thought as she lighted them surely everything was in place for an atmosphere of romance and celebration oh she couldnt wait to see his face when she told him about his music it had been a test of will and restraint not to shout out the news to everyone shed passed that day but it was for shawn first after theyd celebrated the thrill of it and his future lifted a glass or two shed tell him the rest she couldntwouldntfumble with the words hadnt she practiced them in her head all of the day i love you she said now out loud to the empty room i think i always have i know now i always will will you marry me there she rubbed the heel of her hand against her heart as it was galloping like a wild horse it wasnt so hard really maybe her tongue felt a little thick and clumsy but shed said it straight out without stuttering and if he balked or refused shed just have to kill him as her ears were pricked for it she heard the sound of his car as he turned into the street all right brenna she closed her eyes steadied herself here we go damned if hed asked for an evening off still stewing about it shawn shoved open his garden gate he should know shouldnt he and if he had wouldnt he have made plans for it he knew what was going on in his own life for christs sake not that he couldnt adjust hed ring brenna and see if she was agreeable to having an evening together hed throw a meal together or it was early enough that they could go out to the hotel restaurant aidan and darcy had to be having him on though for the life of him he couldnt think of the purpose the minute he stepped into the house he caught the scent of cooking then the flicker of light back in the kitchen what now was all he could think had lady gwen taken to making meals while he was away from home when he walked in he was as surprised to see brenna as he would have been to see the ghost she was wearing a dress which was odd enough but she was standing smiling with candlelight all around her the good rich scent of stew simmering and a bottle of champagne in a rain bucket standing on the counter behind her whats all this its dinner beef and guinness stew the one thing i can make that no one has trouble choking down you cooked he rubbed his forehead as if he had a headache brewing ive been known to on the rare occasion yes but did we well we mustve he decided scanning all the pretty preparations this is beyond a bit of absentmindedness i think something must be wrong with me you look fine to me since he wasnt going to make a move she did walking to him to kiss him more than fine this time her hands slid over his face and the kiss went dreamy its glad i am to see you shawn he started to question it all again then as brennas mouth moved warm over his thought it was foolish to bother its a pleasure coming home to you get used to it she thought and smiled as she stepped back ive been waiting all but jumping out of my skin she admitted ive things to tell you what are they words leaped to her tongue but she bit them back lets have this open first ill do it he nudged her away from the champagne then lifted his brows at the label the pricey stuff are we celebrating we are she caught the look in his eye and the way his fingers suddenly stilled on the foil if you ask me if im breeding ill brain you i am not her eyes were laughing as she spoke he kept his on them as he twisted the wire youre in a rare mood i am there are some things that dont happen every day of the week and a rare moods what you get from them when they do she felt as bubbly as the wine he poured taking her glass she lifted it this is to you shawn and what did i do we should sit down no i cant well have to stand shawn youve sold your first piece of music chapter twenty the puzzled smile slid away from his face ive done what youve sold your song and therell be others as well but the firsts the biggest thrill isnt it very deliberately he set his glass down again i havent put any music up for sale brenna i did well in a way i did the song you gave me i sent it off to the magee in new york city he called me today just this morning and said how he wants to buy it and that he wants to see your other work she spun in a circle too excited to see how cool his eyes were as they watched her i didnt think id get through the day without telling you what right did you have to do that still beaming she sipped champagne to do what to send my music off that way to take it on yourself to show a stranger what was mine shawn she put a hand on his arm to give him a little shake hes buying it i gave it to you because you asked mebecause i thought you wanted it for yourself and that you valued it for that is this what you planned all along to send it off somewhere have another put a price on it something was wrong badly and dangerously wrong the only way she knew how to deal with it was temper what if it was it got results didnt it what good is it to make songs without doing something with them now you can he met heat with ice and its for you to decide is it what i can and should do and how and when i should do it you werent doing anything about it how do you know what im doing or not planning on doing or not havent i heard you say a thousand times you werent ready to show it for sale the minute the words were out of her mouth she recognized her mistake even as she searched for a way around it he was plowing on thats right you have but that didnt suit you didnt sit well with the way you want things done what good is it youre thinking if you cant make a living from it if you dont have coin to show for it at end of day its not the coin my music is the most personal thing in my life he interrupted whether i ever make a pound from it doesnt change what it is to me you dont understand that brenna or respect that or me thats not true she was beginning to feel something other than anger it was a clawing in the gut in the throat that had nothing to do with temper i only wanted you to have something out of it i had something out of it shed never seen anger so cold so controlled there was no mistaking it in that rigid face those hard eyes it made her feel like a bug not worthy of being squashed for christs sake shawn you should be dancing instead of hammering at me the man wants to buy your song he thinks it should be recorded what he thinks matters more than what i do oh youre twisting this all around you have an opportunity and youre too stubborn to take it is that how it is between us you make the decisions you do the thinking and im just to follow to fall in line and be grateful youre looking out for me as im too halfwitted to look after myself why are you turning this one thing into everything her hand shook as she dragged it through her hair didnt you arrange for the man to look at my design it struck her suddenly that shed forgotten about that about everything magee had said to her about her own work shed forgotten all that in the thrill of his offering for shawns i did shawn countered and you cant see any difference in that brenna than this i talked to you of showing your design i didnt go behind your back with it or pull tricks it wasnt a trick wasnt meant as one but she was beginning to see the wrong turn and the sinking sensation in her stomach layered sickness over understanding you never said you didnt want to do something with your music it was always you werent ready because i wasnt ready well if were stuck on that one point i say you were fear made her lash out and so does a man who appears to be something of the expert on such things damn you you gave the song to me and i did what i chose with it i thought youd be pleased but its not a mistake ill make again he stared her down viciously pleased when she began to tremble and neither will i without another word he turned and walked out of the house you son of a bitch she kicked the door behind him you shortsighted ungrateful simple bastard this is the thanks i get for trying to do something for you if you think im running after you youll have a long wait she snatched up her glass downed the contents bubbles exploded in her throat set her eyes to watering to think of all the time and trouble shed gone to only to have him act as if she were some sort of shrew or bully well she wasnt crying over it or him for that matter she braced her hands on the counter leaning forward and breathing slow to try to relieve the horrible pressure in her chest oh god what had she done she just couldnt get her mind around where shed gone so completely wrong the method yes there she had surely misstepped but the results how could something shed thought would be a joy to him whip out of her hands to lash at them both she turned wanting to sit down until she felt steadier and saw lady gwen a lot of help youve been his song you told me his hearts in his song and i was to listen isnt that just what i did not closely enough was the answer then brenna was alone he knew how to walk off a mad hed done so before he trooped over the fields letting the moonlight guide him thinking wasnt the order of business movement was he climbed the cliffs let the wind and the water clear his head but the anger wouldnt pass hed given his heart to a woman who thought very little of him as a man sent off his music had she and to a stranger a man neither of them had met facetoface or measured and not a word to him about it just following her own whim and expecting him to shuffle right along in her wake well he wasnt having it didnt she think he could see her line of thinking just how simpleminded did she think he was oh shawns an affable sort and clever enough in his way but hell not get off his arse unless someone plants a boot on it so this was her boot this time around if the mans going to sit about and play with music half the time wed best see if we can do something practical with it it was his music not hers and shed never troubled herself to so much as pretend to understand or appreciate it and what did this man magee know about it anyway celtic records shawns mind murmured come now youve looked into such matters enough to know just what magee and his like know about it why pretend otherwise neither here nor there shawn muttered and heaved a rock over the cliff hadnt he already turned it over in his head that once hed met magee for himself gotten a feeling on the man hed consider the possibility of showing him a piece of music a piece he chose a piece he decided was right because by christ it was his work and no one elses and when was the last time hed decided a piece was finished and ready and right approximately never he was forced to admit and heaved another rock for the hell of it magee wanted to buy it well fuck me struggling to separate his anger from the rest shawn sat on the ledge how could he explain to anyone what he felt when he pulled notes and words out of himself that there was a fine and quiet joy in that alone and that the rest the doing something with it as brenna put it made him feel like he was standing way out on the edge of a cliff he hadnt been ready to take the leap now hed been pushed and he resented it no matter that the result was something he wanted the pushing was uncalled for and thats what shed never understand so where were they then if they had no better understanding of each other than this prides an important thing to a man carrick commented from his perch on the rocks shawn barely spared him a glance im having a personal crisis here if you dont mind shes slashed a gash in yours and i cant blame you for taking the stand you have a woman ought to know her place and if she doesnt she needs to be shown it clear its not a matter of place you arrogant jackass dont take it out on me boyo carrick said cheerfully im with you on this one she overstepped no question of it why what was the woman thinking taking something of yours and going off with it that way no matter that youd given it to her a kind of gift one might say thats nothing but a technicality well it is and so im saying then as if that wasnt nerve enough what does she do fixes it up so youve the evening free she fixed it up for lack of something more satisfying shawn heaved another rock i knew i wasnt crazy damn it all playing with your mind thats what shes about carrick waved a hand then tossed the little star that clung to his fingertips out over the water where it trailed silver light cooking you a meal making everything herself included pretty for you a more devious female ive never known youre well shed of her maybe you should take another look at her sister after all shes young but shed be malleable dont you think ah shut up shawn got to his feet and strode off scowling at the merry sound of carricks laughter youre sunk young gallagher carrick sent another star over the water youve not quite resigned yourself to having your head under but there you are mortals why is it that half the time theyd rather suffer than dance this time when he flicked his wrist he held a crystal smooth and clear as a pool of water passing his hand over it he watched the image swimming inside fair of face she was with eyes soft and green as freshly dewed grass and hair pale as winter sunlight i miss you gwen holding the glass to his heart he called for the white horse to ride the sky as he did night by night alone the house was empty when he got back and thats what hed expected it was he told himself what he wanted the solitude shed put the food away and that surprised him knowing her temper hed expected to find shed hurled pot and pan or whatever else around the room but the kitchen was tidy as a church with only the faint scent of candle wax clinging to the air since it made him feel churlish to find it so he got himself a beer and took it into the parlor he hadnt intended to play but to sit by the cold fire and brood but by god if he was going to have an evening off shoved down his throat hed spend it doing something that pleased him he sat laid his fingers on the keys and played for his own pleasure it was the song hed given her that brenna heard when she walked back toward the garden gate her first reaction was relief that shed found him the second was misery as the song was salt in a fresh wound but it was a misery that had to be faced she put her hand on the gate and it held fast against her she shoved it yanked at the latch then stepped back in shocked panic when it refused to open oh a sob rose in her throat oh shawn have you closed me out then the music stopped in the silence she fought back the tears she wouldnt face him with them but when the door opened she hugged her arms hard digging her fingers in to keep those tears at bay he thought hed heard her call a teary whisper in his mind hed known she was out there whether it was sense or magic didnt matter she was there standing under the spill of moonlight her eyes were wet her chin was up are you coming in then i cant the weeping tried to get the better of her and she ruthlessly battled it back i cant open the gate baffled he started down the path but she leaped forward gripped the top of the gate in her hands no ill stay on this side its probably best i went looking for you then i figured well youd come back here sooner or later i ah i had to think it through awhile and maybe i dont do that often enough i was he ever going to speak she thought desperately or would he just stand there looking at her with eyes shielded so she couldnt see into him im sorry im so truly sorry shawn for doing something that upset you i didnt do it with that in mind you have to know but some of what you said before is true and im sorry for that as well oh i dont know how to do this frustration rang in her voice as she turned her back on him what is it youre doing brenna she stared straight ahead into the dark im asking you not to cast me off for making a mistake even a big one like this to give me another chance and if there cant be anything else between us now that you wont stop being my friend he would have opened the gate to her then but thought better of it i gave you my word on the friendship as you gave me yours ill not break it she pressed a hand to her lips held it there until she thought she could speak again you mean so much to me i have to clear this between us steadying herself she turned around some of what you said was true but some was wrong some of the most important parts were wrong and youll tell me which was which she flinched at the icy sarcasm but couldnt find enough of her temper to scrape together for a retort you know how to aim and shoot as well as any she said quietly and its all the more effective as you do it so rarely all right im sorry for that he had to be as hed never seen her look quite so wounded im angry still im pushy she drew a breath in let it out but the ache was still there and singleminded and i can be careless with people even when they matter to me maybe more when they matter i did think well the mans doing nothing with this music of his so ill have to do it for him that was wrong of mewrong to put the way id do things or think about them onto what was yours i should have told you as you told me on that we agree but it wasnt wholly selfish i wanted to give you something something important something that would make you happy and matter to you it wasnt about the money i swear it it was for the glory im not looking for glory i wanted it for you what does it matter to you brenna you dont even care for my music thats not true temper spiked a bit now at the sheer unfairness of it what am i deaf and stupid now as well as a bully i love your music its beautiful it never mattered to you what i thought anyway christ knows poking at you about it over the years never riled you enough to prove me wrong youve been wasting a gift a kind of miracle and it makes me furious with you glaring at him she swiped tears from her cheeks i cant help that i feel that way and it doesnt mean i think less of you you blockhead its because i think so much of you and then you go and write a song that reaches right into my heart that touches me the way nothing ever has before even before it was finished weeks and weeks ago when i saw what there was of it there on the piano just tossed there like you couldnt recognize a diamond if it jabbed your eye out i loved it i had to do something with it and i dont care if it was wrong i was so proud of what you can do i couldnt see past it damn you to hell and back again shed rocked him onto his heels staggered him he whistled out a breath thats quite the apology that is oh fuck you i take back every bit of any apology i was foolish enough to make there he thought was his woman this time he laid his hands on the gate and gave her a look of wicked satisfaction its too late i already have it and im keeping it and heres something back at you it always mattered what you thought of my music and of me it mattered more what you thought than anyone else in the world what do you say to that youre just trying to get round me now because im angry again ive always been able to get round you darling angry or not he nudged and the gate opened smooth and silent come in through the gate she sniffled wished for a tissue i dont want to youll come in regardless he said snatching her hand and yanking her through now ive some things to say im not interested she shoved at the gate again cursed violently when it didnt budge youll listen he turned her trapped her caught her hands before she could think of making fists out of them i dont like what you did or how you went about it but your reasons for it soften that considerably i dont care stop being a twit when her mouth fell open he lifted her a couple of inches off the ground ill get tough with you if i must you know you like it when i do why you when she fumbled for words he nodded ah speechless are you its a refreshing change i dont need someone directing my life but i dont mind someone being part of the direction i wont be pushed or tricked or manipulated and if you try youll be sorry youll make me sorry she all but sputtered im already sorry i did the first thing to try brenna he gave her a casual little shake that had her mouth dropping open again there are times youre better off to just shut your mouth and listen this is one of them now as i was saying he went on while she blinked at him being tricked is one thing but surprised is another matter and im thinking that under it all you wanted to surprise me with something like a gift and i threw it back at you for that brenna im sorry the fear and sorrow were sliding away but it was hard to resist grabbing onto the tail of them i dont think a great deal of your apology either take it or leave it youre awfully damn pushy yourself all of a sudden ive my limits and you should know them well enough by this time so how much is magee willing to pay me for the tune i didnt ask she said stiffly ah so you can keep your fingers out of some pies its good to know youre a hateful man i told you it wasnt about the money she pushed at him and rather than humiliate herself with the bloody gate again stomped down the path i dont know how i could have been blind to that part of your nature all these years how i could have thought myself in love with you ill never know the very idea of spending my life with the likes of you gives me a cold chill he couldnt stop the grin it was so lovely to have all the parts of his life nicely in order again well get to that in just a minute it matters that it wasnt about money brenna matters that you werent thinking well if im going to be with this man hed damn well better prove hes man enough to make a living off his talents and since he wont i will i dont give a tinkers damn how you make your living thats what im seeing now it was more of i want to be with this man and feeling as i do about him i want to help him with that which matters to him its a lovely thought but that doesnt change the fact you shouldve left it to me you can be sure ill be leaving such matters and everything else to you in the future if that vow lasts a week ill expect to see pigs flying over ardmore bay and in case youre wondering in that calculating brain of yours ill be contacting magee myself and ill send him music if what he says convinces mewhich is what i intended to do once he came here and i got his measure she stopped at that eyed him suspiciously you were going to show him your work i was most likely ill admit that dozens of times in the past ive come close to sending it off and then pulled back when something comes out of you its precious there was a fear of others finding it wanting it was safer not to risk it i was afraid of losing something that mattered to me does that make me less in your eyes brenna it doesnt no of course it doesnt but if you dont ask she said remembering her fathers words the answers always no im not arguing your point just your methods now tell me this if magee had said to you why what are you sending me this silly amateur music for whoever wrote it has no talent whatsoever would you have thought less of me of course not you pinhead idve known that magee had no taste other than what he may have in his own mouth ah well now thats tidied up a considerable mess can we go back to the part where youre in love with me no because im not anymore ive come to my senses thats a damn shame that is youll have to wait here a minute theres something i need from inside ill not stand out here im going home ill only come after you brenna he called over his shoulder as he walked to the door and what i have in mind is best done here and in private she considered climbing over the gate just to spite him but the whole emotional mess had made her tired it might as well get finished now as later so she waited arms crossed when he came out he carried nothing which only made her scowl the moons full he commented as he went to her maybe theres others have more to do with the timing of all this than we know but it was meant to be in moonlight and it was meant to be here he slipped a hand into his pocket kept it there i had a plan at one time how id let you chase me down wear at my resistance and convince me there was nothing for me to do but give up and marry you her eyes went blurry with shock i beg your pardon do you really think you were tugging me around like a puppy on a leash is that the kind of man you want when the day is done otoole the kind you want walking beside you through life fathering your children is this a game youve been playing partly and as much as you were games over now and i find i want this done more in what might be the traditional manner brenna he took her hand not at all displeased that it was trembling i love you i dont know when it started years ago or weeks but i know my hearts lost to you and i wouldnt have it another way youre what i want all there is of you make a life with me marry me she couldnt take her eyes from his face the whole world was in his face my head hurts she managed god bless you with a half laugh he took her hand kissed it how could i not love such a woman he kept her hand firm in his as he took the ring from his pocket the pearl gleamed like the moon white and pure in a simple band of gold a moon tear he told her given to me to give to you i know you dont wear rings as a rule itheywith the work they get caught and banged around so i got a chain for it as well you can wear it around your neck he would have thought of such a thing she realized such a small and lovely detail im not working at the moment he slid it onto her finger and her hand steadied under his i suppose it suits me as you do as the whole of you suits me but you wont make me cry yes i will he touched his lips to her forehead her temple i bought you land today what tears might have dazzled her vision but she managed to step back what land you bought land without a word to me without me laying eyes on it if you dont like it you can bury me in it i might you bought land she said again but her voice had gone dreamy so you can build us a house and the two of us can fill it into a home damn it there you are youve made me cry she threw her arms around his neck just hold on a minute im a mess with her face buried against his shoulder she breathed him in i thought it was just a longing for you and that would be enough for both of us i do long for you but its not enough and its not all oh this is where i want to be and i did chase you down nothing will convince me otherwise she drew back enough to touch her lips to his i had it all worked out what i would say to you tonight and now i cant remember just how it was to go only that i love you shawn i love you as you are theres nothing id change thats more than good enough will you come inside now ill warm your supper its the least you could do after you let it go cold she linked her fingers with his you wont insist on a big fancy wedding will you i dont see how when ive a mind to have us wed as quick as can be managed ah she leaned against him i do love you shawn gallagher theres one more thing she said as they walked toward the cottage wont you need a name for your song the one magee wants its brennas song he told her it always was turn the page for a preview of heart of the sea the stunning conclusion in nora robertss allnew irish trilogy of the gallagher siblings the village of ardmore sat snug on the south coast of ireland in the county of waterford with the celtic sea spread out at its feet the stone seawall curved around following the skirt of the gold sand beach it boasted in its vicinity a pretty jut of cliffs upholstered with wild grass and a hotel that clung to them if one had a mind to it was a pleasant if hearty walk on a narrow path around the headland and at the top of the first hill were the ruins of the oratory and well of saint declan the view was worth the climb with sky and sea and village spread out below this was holy ground and though dead were buried there only one grave had its stone marked the village itself claimed neat streets and painted cottages some with the traditional thatched roofs and a number of steep hills as well flowers grew in abundance spilling out of window boxes baskets and pots and from the dooryards it made a charming picture from above or below and the villagers were proud to have won the tidy town award two years running atop tower hill was a fine example of a round tower with its conical top still in place and the ruins of the twelfthcentury cathedral built in the honor of saint declan folks would tell you in case you wondered that declan arrived thirty years before good saint patrick not that they were bragging but just letting you know how things stood those interested in such matters would find examples of ogham carving on the stones put for safekeeping inside the roofless cathedral and roman arcading faded with time and wind but still worth the study but the village itself made no attempt at such grandeur and was merely a pleasant place with a shop or two and a scatter of cottages built back away from lovely sand beaches the sign for ardmore said failte and that meant welcome it was that very combination of ancient history and simple character and hospitality that interested trevor magee his people had come from ardmore and old parish indeed his grandfather had been born here in a small house very near ardmore bay had lived the first years of his life breathing that moist sea air had perhaps held his mothers hand as shed walked to the shops or along the surf his grandfather had left his village and his country taking his wife and young son with him to america he had never been back and as far as trevor knew had never looked back either there had been a distance and a bitter one between the old man and the country of his birth ireland and ardmore and the family dennis magee had left behind had rarely been spoken of so trevors image of ardmore had a ripple of sentiment and curiosity through it and his reasons for choosing it had a personal bent but he could afford personal bents he was a man who built and who as his grandfather and father before him built cleverly and well his grandfather had made his living laying brick and made his fortune speculating on properties during and after the second world war until the buying and selling of them was his business and the building done by those he hired old magee had been no more sentimental about his laborers beginnings than he had been about his homeland to trevors recollection the man had shown no sentiment about anything but trevor had inherited the heart and hands of the builder as much as the cool hard sense of the businessman and had learned to use both he would use them both here and a dash of sentiment as well to build his theater a traditional structure for traditional music using as its entrance the already established pub known as gallaghers the deal with the gallaghers had been set the ground broken for the project before hed been able to hack through his schedule for the time he wanted to spend here but he was here now and he intended to do more than sign checks and watch he wanted his hands in it a man could work up a good sweat even in may in such a temperate climate when he spent a morning hauling concrete that morning trevor left the cottage hed decided to rent for the duration of his stay wearing a denim jacket and carrying a steaming mug of coffee now a handful of hours later the jacket had been tossed aside and a thin line of damp ran front and back down his shirt hed have paid a hundred pounds for one cold beer the pub was only a short walk through the construction rubble he knew from stopping in the day before that it did a brisk business midday but a man could hardly quench his thirst with a chilly harp when he forbade his employees to drink on the job he rolled his shoulders circled his neck as he scanned the site the concrete truck let out its continual rumble men shouted relaying orders or acknowledging them job music trevor thought he never tired of it that was a gift from his father learn from the ground up had been dennis juniors credo and the thirdgeneration magee had done just that for more than ten years fifteen if he counted the summers hed sweated on construction sites hed learned just what went into the business of building the backaches and blood and aching muscles at thirtytwo he spent more time in boardrooms and meetings than on a scaffold but hed never lost the appreciation or the satisfaction of swinging his own hammer he intended to indulge himself doing just that in ardmore in his theater he watched the small woman in a faded cap and battered boots circle around gesture as the wet concrete slid down the chute she scrambled over sand and stone used her shovel to rap the chute and alert the operator to stop then waded into the muck with the other laborers to shovel and smooth brenna otoole trevor thought and was glad hed followed his instincts there hiring her and her father as foremen on the project had been the right course of action not just for their building skills he decided and they were impressive but they knew the village and the people in it kept the job running smooth and the men happy and productive public relations on this sort of project were just as vital as a sturdy foundation yes indeed they were working out well his three days in ardmore had shown him hed made the right choice with otoole and otoole when brenna climbed out again trevor stepped over extended a hand to give her a final boost thanks she sliced her shovel into the ground leaned on it and despite her filthy boots and faded cap looked like a pixie her skin was pure irish cream and a few curls of wild red escaped the cap tim riley says we wont have rain for another day or two and he has a way of being right about such things more than hes wrong i think well have the slab set up for you before you have to worry about weather you made considerable progress before i got here sure and once you gave us the high sign there was no reason to wait well have you a good solid foundation mr magee and on schedule trev aye trev she tipped back her cap then her head so she could meet his eyes she figured him a good foot higher than her fivetwo even wearing her boots the men you sent along from america theyre a fine team as i handpicked them i agree she thought his voice faintly aloof but not unfriendly and do you never pick females then he smiled slowly so it seemed humor just moseyed over his face until it reached eyes the color of turf smoke i do indeed and as often as possible both on and off the job ive put one of my best carpenters on this project shell be here next week its good to know my cousin brian wasnt wrong in that area he said you hired by skill and not gender its a good mornings work here she added nodding to the site that noisy bastard of a truck will be our constant companion for a while yet darcyll be back from her holiday tomorrow and i can tell you shell bitch our ears off about the din its a good noise building ive always thought the same they stood a moment in perfect accord while the truck vomited out the last yard of concrete ill buy you lunch trevor said ill let you brenna gave a whistle to catch her fathers attention then mimed spooning up food mick responded with a grin and a wave then went back to work hes in his heaven brenna commented as they walked over to rinse off their boots nothing makes mick otoole happier than finding himself in the middle of a job site the muckier the better satisfied brenna gave her feet a couple of stomps then headed around to the kitchen door i hope youll take some time to see the area while youre here instead of locking yourself into the job at hand i plan to see whats around he had reports of course detailed reports on tourist draws road conditions routes to and from major cities but he intended to see for himself needed to see it trevor admitted to himself some thing had been pulling him toward ireland toward ardmore for more than a year in dreams ah now theres a finelooking man doing what he does best brenna said when she pushed open the kitchen door what have you for us today shawn he turned from the enormous old stove a rangy man with shaggy black hair and eyes of misty blue for the special weve sea spinach soup and the beef sandwich good day to you trevor is this one working you harder than she should she keeps things moving and so i must for the man in my life is slow i wonder shawn if youve selected another tune or two for trevors consideration ive been busy catering to my new wife shes a demanding creature so saying he reached out to cup a hand on brennas face and kiss her get out of my kitchen its confusing enough around here without darcy shell be back tomorrow and by this time of the day youll have cursed her a dozen times why do you think i miss her give your order to sinead he told trevor shes a good girl and our judes been working with her she just needs a bit more practice a friend of my sister mary kate is sinead brenna told trevor as she pushed open the door that swung between kitchen and pub a goodnatured girl if a bit scattered in the brain she wants to marry billy ohara and that is the sum total of her ambitions at this time and what does billy ohara have to say being not quite so ambitious as sinead billy keeps his mouth shut good day to you aidan and to you the oldest of the gallaghers worked the bar and had his hands on the taps as he looked over will you be joining us for lunch then that we will weve caught you busy god bless the tour buses with a wink aidan slid two pints down the bar to waiting hands do you want us to take it in the kitchen no need for that unless youre in a great hurry his eyes a deeper blue than his brothers scanned the pub service is a mite slower than our usual but theres a table or two left well leave it to the boss brenna turned to trevor how will you have it lets get a table the better to watch how the business ran he followed her out and sat with her at one of the mushroom sized tables there was a buzz of conversation a haze of smoke and the yeasty scent of beer will you have a pint brenna asked him not until after the workday her lips twitched as she kicked back in her chair so ive heard from some of the men word is youre a tyrant on this particular matter he didnt mind the term tyrant it meant he was in control word would be correct ill tell you this you may have a bit of a problem enforcing such a rule around here many wholl labor for you were nursed on guinness and its as natural to them as mothers milk im fond of it myself but when a man or woman is on my clock they stick with mothers milk ah youre a hard man trevor magee but she said it with a laugh so tell me how are you liking faerie hill cottage very much its comfortable efficient quiet and has a view that rips your heart into your throat its just what i was looking for so im grateful you put me onto it thats not a problem not a problem at all its in the family i think shawn misses the little kitchen there as the house were buildings far from finished more than livable she added as it was one of their current sore points but i figure to concentrate on the kitchen there on my off days so hell be happier id like to see it would you surprised she angled her head well youre welcome any time ill give you the direction do you mind me saying i didnt expect you to be as friendly a sort of man as you seem to be what did you expect more of a shark and i hope that doesnt offend you it doesnt and it depends on the waters where im swimming he glanced over and his face warmed as aidans wife came up to the table but when he started to rise jude waved him down again no im not joining you but thanks she rested a hand on her very pregnant belly hello im jude frances and ill be your server today you shouldnt be on your feet like this carrying trays jude sighed as she took out her order pad he sounds like aidan i put my feet up when i need to and i dont carry anything heavy sinead cant handle things on her own not to worry trevor why me own blessed mother dug potatoes on the day i was born then went back to roast them after the delivery at trevors narrowed glance brenna chuckled well maybe not but ill wager she could have ill have todays soup if you dont mind jude and a glass of milk she added with a wicked smile for trevor the same he said plus the sandwich a fine choice ill be right back with it shes stronger than she looks brenna told him when jude moved to another table and more stubborn now that shes found her direction so to speak shell only work harder to prove she can do what you tell her she shouldnt aidan wont let her overdo i promise you the man adores her yes ive noticed the gallagher men seem to be devoted to their women so they better be or their women will know why relaxed she kicked back pulled off her cap those red curls tumbled down so you arent finding it i guess wed say too rustic for you out in the countryside here after being used to new york city he thought of the job sites hed experienced mud slides floods blistering heat petty vandalism and sabotage not at all the village is exactly what i expected after finkles reports ah yes finkle she remembered trevors scout very well now theres a man i believe prefers urban conveniences but youre not so particular then im very particular depending thats why i incorporated most of your design into the theater project now thats a fine and sneaky compliment and nothing could have pleased her more i suppose i was angling more toward the personal i have a special fondness for the cottage on faerie hill and i wasnt sure youd find the place to your liking thinking i suppose a man with your background and wherewithal would be more inclined to settle at the cliff hotel with maid service and the restaurant and so forth hotel rooms become confining and i find it interesting to stay in the house where the woman who was engaged to one of my ancestors was born and lived and died she was a fine woman old maude a wise woman brenna kept her eyes on trevors face as she spoke her graves up near the well of saint declan and its there you can feel her shes not the one in the cottage now who is brenna lifted her eyebrows you dont know the legend then your grandfather was born here and your father as well though he was a babe when they sailed to america still he visited many years back did neither of them tell you the story of lady gwen and prince carrick no so it would be lady gwen who haunts the cottage have you seen her no trevor hadnt been raised on legends and myths but there was more than enough irish in his blood to cause him to wonder about them but theres a feminine feel to the place almost a fragrance so odds are for the lady youd be right about that who was she i figure if im sharing quarters with a ghost i should know something about her no careless dismissal of the subject no amused indulgence of the irish and their legends brenna noted just cool interest you surprise me again let me see to something first ill be right back fascinating trevor mused he had himself a ghost hed felt things before in old buildings empty lots deserted fields it wasnt the kind of thing a man generally talked about at a board meeting or over a cold one with the crew after a sweaty days work not usually but this was a different place with a different tone more he wanted to know everything to do with ardmore and the area was of interest to him now a good ghost story could draw people in just as successfully as a well run pub it was all atmosphere gallaghers was exactly the kind of atmosphere hed been looking for as a segue into his theater the old wood blackened by time and smoke and grease mated comfortably with the creamcolored walls the stone hearth the low tables and benches the bar itself was a beauty an aged chestnut he already noted the gallaghers kept wiped and polished the age of customers ranged from a baby in arms to the oldest man trevor believed hed ever seen who was balanced on a stool at the far end of the bar there were several others he took as locals just from the way they sat or smoked or sipped and three times that many who could be nothing other than tourists with their camera bags under their tables and their maps and guidebooks out the conversations were a mix of accents but predominate was that lovely lilt hed heard in his grandparents voices until the day they died he wondered if they missed hearing it themselves why theyd never had a driving urge to come to ireland again what bitter memories had kept them away skipped over a generation and caused him to come back and see for himself more why he should have recognized ardmore and the view from the cottage and even now know what he would see when he climbed the cliffs it was as if he carried a picture in his mind of this place one someone else had taken and tucked away for him theyd had no pictures to show him his father had visited once when hed been younger than trevor was now himself but his descriptions had been sketchy at best the reports of course there had been detailed photographs and descriptions in the reports finkle had brought back to new york but hed known before hed opened the first file hed already known inherited memory he mused though he didnt put much stock in that sort of thing inheriting his fathers eyes the clear gray color the longlidded shape of them was one matter and he was told he had his grandfathers hands and his mind for business but how did a memory pass down through the blood he toyed with the idea as he continued to scan the room it didnt occur to him that he looked more the local than the tourist as he sat there in his work clothes his dark blond hair tousled from the mornings labor he had a narrow rawboned face that would put most in mind of a warrior or perhaps a scholar rather than a businessman the woman hed nearly married had said it looked to be honed and sculpted by some wild genius the faintest of scars marred his chin a result of a storm of flying glass during a tornado in houston and added to the overall impression of toughness it was a face that rarely gave anything away unless it was to trevor magees advantage at the moment it held a cool and remote expression but it shifted into easy friendliness when brenna came back toward the table with jude brenna he noted carried the tray ive asked jude to take a few moments to sit and tell you about lady gwen brenna began and was already unloading the order shes a seanachais at trevors raised eyebrow jude shook her head its gaelic for storyteller im not really im just and who has a book being published and another shes writing judes bookll be out at the end of this very summer brenna went on itll make a lovely gift so id keep it in mind when youre out shopping brenna jude rolled her eyes ill look for it some of shawns song lyrics are stories its an old and honored tradition oh hell like that one beaming now brenna scooped up the tray ill deal with this jude and give sinead a bit of a goose for you go ahead and get started ive heard it often enough before she has enough energy for twenty people a little tired now jude picked up her cup of tea im glad i found her for this project or that she found me id say it was a bit of both since youre both operators she caught herself winced i didnt mean that in a negative way wasnt taken in one baby kicking it puts a look in your eye trevor explained my sister just had her third third jude blew out a breath there are moments i wonder how im going to manage the one hes active but hes just going to have to wait another couple months she ran a hand in slow circles over the mound of her belly soothing as she sipped you may not know it but i lived in chicago until just over a year ago he made a noncommittal sound of course he knew he had extensive reports my plan was to come here for six months to live in the cottage where my grandmother lived after she lost her parents shed inherited it from her cousin maude whod died shortly before i came here the woman my greatuncle was engaged to yes the day i arrived it was raining i thought i was lost i had been lost and not just geographically everything unnerved me you came alone to another country trevor cocked his head that doesnt sound like a woman easily unnerved thats something aidan would say and because it was she found herself very comfortable i suppose its more that i didnt know my own nerve at that point in any case i pulled into the street the driveway actually of this little thatched roof cottage and in the upstairs window i saw a woman she had a lovely sad face and pale blond hair that fell around her shoulders she looked at me our eyes connected then brenna drove up it seems id stumbled across my own cottage and the woman id seen in the window was lady gwen the ghost thats right yes it sounds impossible doesnt it or certainly unreasonable but i can tell you exactly what she looked like ive sketched her and i knew no more of the legend when i came here than you appear to know now id like to hear it then ill tell you jude paused as brenna came back sat and tucked into her meal she had an easy way with a story trevor noted a smooth and natural rhythm that put the listener into the tale she told him of a young maid whod lived in the cottage on the faerie hill a woman who cared for her father as her mother had been lost in childbirth who tended the cottage and its gardens and who carried herself with pride beneath the green slope of the hill was the silver glory of the faerie raft the palace where carrick ruled as prince he was also proud and he was handsome with a flowing mane of ravenblack hair and eyes of burning blue those eyes fell upon the maid gwen and hers upon him they plunged in love faerie and mortal and at night when others slept he would take her flying on his great winged horse never did they speak of that love for pride blocked the words one night gwens father woke to see her with carrick as they dismounted from his horse and in fear for her he betrothed her to another and ordered her to marry without delay carrick flew on his horse to the sun and gathered its burning sparks into his silver pouch when gwen came out of the cottage to meet him before her wedding he opened the bag and poured diamonds jewels of the sun at her feet take them and me he said for they are my passion for you he promised her immortality and a life of riches and glory but never once did he speak even then of love so she refused him and turned from him the diamonds that lay on the grass became flowers twice more he came to her the next time when she carried her first child in her womb from his silver pouch he poured pearls tears of the moon that hed gathered for her and these he told her were his longing for her but longing is not love and she had pledged herself to another when she turned away the pearls became flowers the last time many years had passed years where gwen had raised her children nursed her husband through his illness and buried him when she was an old woman years where carrick had brooded in his palace and swept through the sky on his horse he dived into the sea to wring from its heart the last of his gifts to her these he poured at her feet shimmering sapphires that blazed in the grass his constancy for her when now finally he spoke of love she could only weep bitter tears for her life was over she told him it was too late that she had never needed riches or promises of glory but only that he loved her loved her enough that she could have set aside her fear of giving up her world for his and as she turned to leave him this last time as the sapphires bloomed into flowers in the grass his hurt and his temper lashed out in this spell he cast she would find no peace without him nor would they see each other again until three times lovers met and accepting each other risking hearts dared the choice of love over all else three hundred years trevor thought later as he let himself into the house where gwen had lived and died a long time to wait hed listened to jude tell the tale in her quiet storytellers voice without interrupting even to tell her that he knew parts of the story somehow he knew hed dreamed them he hadnt told her that he too could have described gwen down to the sea green of her eyes and the curve of her cheek hed dreamed her as well and had he realized nearly married sylvia because shed reminded him of that dream image a soft woman with simple ways it should have been right between them he thought as he headed upstairs to shower off the days dirt it still irritated him that it hadnt been in the end it just hadnt been right shed known it first and had gently let him go before hed admitted hed already had his eye on the door maybe that was what bothered him most of all he hadnt had the courtesy to do the ending though shed forgiven him for it hed yet to forgive himself he caught the scent the minute he stepped into the bedroom delicate female like rose petals freshly fallen onto dewy grass a ghost who wears perfume he murmured oddly amused well if youre modest turn your back so saying he stripped where he stood then walked into the bath he spent the rest of his evening alone catching up on paperwork scanning the faxes that had come in on the machine hed brought with him shooting back replies he treated himself to a beer and stood outside with it in the last of the dying light listening to the aching silence and watching stars pulse to life tim riley whoever the hell he was looked to be right there was no rain coming yet the foundation he was building would set clean as he turned to go back in a streak of movement overhead caught his eye a blur of white and silver across the darkening sky but when he looked back for it narrowing his eyes to scan he saw nothing but stars and the rise of the quarter moon a falling star he decided a ghost was one thing but a flying horse ridden by the prince of the faeries was another entirely but he thought he heard the cheerful lilt of pipes and flutes dance across the silence as he shut the door of the cottage for the night the end
