 chapter one contents next her childhood had been a lie her father had been a thief her mind struggled to absorb those two facts to absorb and analyze and accept kate powell had trained herself to be a practical woman one who worked hard toward goals earned them step by careful step wavering was not permitted shortcuts were not taken rewards were earned with sweat planning and effort that she had always believed was who she was a product of her heredity her upbringing and her own stringent standards for herself when a child was orphaned at an early age when she lived with the loss when she had essentially watched her parents die there seemed little else that could be so wrenching but there was kate realized as she sat still in shock behind her tidy desk in her tidy office at bittle and associates out of that early tragedy had come enormous blessings her parents had been taken away and shed been given others the distant kinship hadnt mattered to thomas and susan templeton they had taken her in raised her given her a home and love given her everything without question and they must have known she realized they must have always known they had known when they took her from the hospital after the accident when they comforted her and gave her the gift of belonging they had known they took her across the continent to california to the sweeping cliffs and beauty of big sur to templeton house there in that grand home as gracious and welcoming as any of the glamorous templeton hotels they made her part of their family they gave her laura and josh their children as siblings they gave her margo sullivan the housekeepers daughter who had been accepted as part of the family even before kate they gave her clothes and food education advantages they gave her rules and discipline and the encouragement to pursue dreams and most of all they gave her love and family and pride yet they had known from the beginning what she twenty years later had just discovered her father had been a thief a man under indictment for embezzlement caught skimming from his own clients accounts he had died facing shame ruin prison she might never have found out but for the capricious twist of fate that had brought an old friend of lincoln powells into her office that morning he was so delighted to see her remembered her as a child it warmed her to be remembered to realize that he had come to her with his business because of the old tie with her parents shed taken the time though she had little to spare during those last weeks before the april tax deadline to chat with him and he just sat there in the chair on the other side of the desk reminiscing hed bounced her on his knee when she was little he said had worked in the same ad firm as her father which was why he told her since hed relocated to california and now had his own firm he wanted her as his accountant she thanked him and mixed her questions about his business and his financial requirements with queries about her parents then when he spoke so casually of the accusations the charges and the sorrow he felt that her father had died before he could make restitution she had said nothing could say nothing he never intended to steal just borrow oh it was wrong god knows i always felt partially responsible because i was the one who told him about the real estate deal encouraged him to invest i didnt know hed already lost most of his capital in a couple of deals that went sour he would have put the money back linc would have found a way always did he was always a little resentful that his cousin rode so high while he barely scraped by and the man god she couldnt remember his name couldnt remember anything but the words smiled at her the whole time he was speaking making excuses adding his own explanations to the facts she simply sat nodding this stranger whod known her father was destroying her very foundations he had a sore spot where tommy templeton was concerned funny when you think it turned out that he was the one to raise you after it all but linc never meant any harm katie he was just reckless never had a chance to prove himself and thats the real crime if you ask me the real crime kate thought as her stomach churned and knotted he had stolen because he was desperate for money and took the easy way out because he was a thief she thought now a cheat and he had cheated the justice system by hitting an icy patch of road and crashing his car killing himself and his wife and leaving his daughter an orphan so fate had given her as a father the very man her own father had been so envious of through his death she had in essence become a templeton had it been deliberate she wondered had he been so desperate so reckless so angry that hed chosen death she could barely remember him a thin pale nervous man with a quick temper a man with big plans she thought now a man who had spun those plans out into delightful fantasies for his child visions of big houses fine cars funfilled trips to disney world and all the while they lived in a tiny house just like all the other tiny houses on the block with an old sedan that rattled and no trips to anywhere so he stole and he was caught and he died what had her mother done kate wondered what had she felt was that why kate remembered her most as a woman with worry in her eyes and a tight smile had he stolen before the idea made her cold inside had he stolen before and somehow gotten away with it a little here a little there until hed become careless she remembered arguments often over money and worse the silences that followed them the silence that night that heavy hurting silence in the car between her parents before the awful spin the screams and the pain shuddering she closed her eyes clenched her fists tight and fought back the drumming headache oh god she had loved them loved the memory of them couldnt bear to have it smeared and spoiled and couldnt face she realized with horrid shame being the daughter of a cheat she wouldnt believe it not yet she took slow breaths and turned to her computer with mechanical efficiency she accessed the library in new hampshire where shed been born and had lived for the first eight years of her life it was tedious work but she ordered copies of newspapers for the year before the accident requested faxes of any article mentioning lincoln powell while she waited she contacted the lawyer back east who had handled the disposition of her parents estate she was a creature comfortable with technology within an hour she had everything she needed she could read the details in black and white details that confirmed the facts the lawyer had given her the accusations the criminal charges the scandal a scandal she realized that had earned print space because of lincoln powells family connection to the templetons and the missing funds replaced in full after her parents were buried replaced kate was certain by the people who had raised her as one of their own the templetons she thought who had been drawn into the ugliness had quietly taken the responsibility and the child and always had protected the child there in her quiet office alone she laid her head on the desk and wept and wept and when the weeping was done she shook out pills for the headache more for the burning in her stomach when she gathered her briefcase to leave she told herself she would bury it just bury it as she had buried her parents it could not be changed could not be fixed she was the same she assured herself the same woman she had been that morning yet she found she couldnt open her office door and face the possibility of running into a colleague in the corridor instead she sat again closed her eyes sought comfort in old memories a picture she thought of family and tradition of who she was what she had been given and what she had been raised to be at sixteen she was taking an extra load of courses that would allow her to graduate a full year ahead of her class since that wasnt quite enough of a challenge she was determined to graduate with honors as well she had already mentally outlined her valedictorian speech her extracurricular activities included another term as class treasurer a stint as president of the math club and a place in the starting lineup of the baseball team she had hopes of being named mvp again next season but for now her attention was focused on calculus numbers were her strong point sticking with logic kate had already decided to use her strengths in her career once she had her mba more than likely she would follow josh to harvard for that she would pursue a career in accounting it didnt matter that margo said her aspirations were boring to kate they were realistic she was going to prove to herself and to everyone who mattered to her that what she had been given all she had been offered had been put to the best possible use because her eyes were burning she slipped off her glasses and leaned back in her desk chair it was important she knew to rest the brain periodically in order to keep it at its keenest she did so now letting her gaze skim around the room the new touches the templetons had insisted she choose for her sixteenth birthday suited her the simple pine shelves above her desk held her books and study materials the desk itself was a honey a chippendale kneehole with deep drawers and fanciful shell carving it made her feel successful just to work at it she hadnt wanted fussy wallpaper or fancy curtains the muted stripes on the walls and the simple vertical blinds fit her style because she understood her aunts need to pamper shed chosen a pretty scrollsided settee in deep green on rare occasions she actually stretched out on it to read for pleasure otherwise the room was functional as she preferred the knock on her door interrupted her just as she was burying her nose in her books again her answer was a distracted grunt kate susan templeton elegant in a cashmere twin set entered her hands on her hips what am i going to do with you nearly finished kate mumbled she caught the scent of her aunts perfume as susan crossed the room midterm math tomorrow as if you werent already prepared susan sat on the edge of the tidily made bed and surveyed kate those huge and oddly exotic brown eyes were focused behind heavy framed reading glasses hair sleek and dark was tugged back into a stubby ponytail the girl cut it shorter every year susan thought with a sigh plain gray sweats bagged over a long thin frame down to the bare feet as susan watched kate pursed her wide mouth into something between a pout and a frown the expression dug a thinking line between her eyebrows in case you havent noticed susan began its ten days until christmas umm midterm week nearly done and its six oclock dont hold dinner want to finish this kate susan rose and snatched kates glasses away josh is home from college the familys waiting for you to trim the tree oh blinking kate struggled to bring her mind back from formulas her aunt was watching her owlishly her dark blond hair curled smoothly around her pretty face im sorry i forgot if i dont ace this exam the world as we know it will come to an end i know kate grinned and rolled her shoulders to loosen them i guess i could spare a couple of hours just this once were honored susan set the glasses on the desk put something on your feet kate okay be right down i cant believe im going to say this to one of my children but susan started toward the door if you open one of those books again youre grounded yes maam kate crossed to her dresser and chose a pair of socks from an orderly pile beneath the carefully folded socks was her secret stash of weighton which had done pitifully little to put more pounds onto her bones after tugging the socks on she downed a couple of aspirin to kick back the headache that was just beginning to stir its about time margo met her at the top of the stairs josh and mr t are already stringing the lights that could take hours you know how they love to argue whether they should go clockwise or counterclockwise tilting her head she gave margo a long study what the hell are you all dolled up for im simply being festive margo smoothed the skirt of her hollyred dress pleased that the scoop neckline hinted at cleavage shed slipped on heels determined that josh should notice her legs and remember she was a woman now unlike you i dont choose to trim the tree wearing rags at least ill be comfortable kate sniffed youve been into aunt susies perfume i have not lifting her chin margo fluffed at her hair she offered me a spritz hey laura called from the bottom of the staircase are you two going to stand up there arguing all night were not arguing we were complimenting each other on our attire snickering kate started down dad and josh are nearly finished with their debate over the lights laura shot a look across the spacious foyer toward the family parlor theyre smoking cigars josh smoking a cigar kate snorted at the image hes a harvard man now laura affected an exaggerated new england accent youve got shadows under your eyes youve got stars in yours kate countered and youre all dressed up too annoyed kate pulled at her sweatshirt whats the deal peters dropping by later laura turned to the foyer mirror to check the line of her ivory wool dress busy dreaming she didnt notice the winces that margo and kate exchanged just for an hour or so i cant wait till winter break one more midterm and then freedom flushed with anticipation she beamed at her friends its going to be the best winter vacation ever i have a feeling peters going to ask me to marry him what kate yelped before laura could shush her quiet she hurried back across the blueandwhitetiled floor toward kate and margo i dont want mom and dad to hear not yet laura you cant seriously be thinking of marrying peter ridgeway you barely know him and youre only seventeen a million reasons against the idea whirled through margos mind ill be eighteen in a few weeks its just a feeling anyway promise me you wont say anything of course not kate reached the bottom of the curving staircase you wont do anything crazy will you have i ever a wistful smile played around lauras mouth as she patted kates hand lets go in what does she see in him kate mumbled to margo hes old hes twentyseven margo corrected worried hes gorgeous and treats her like a princess he has she searched for the word polish yes but ssh she spotted her mother coming down the hallway wheeling a cart laden with hot chocolate we dont want to spoil tonight well talk later ann sullivans brow furrowed as she studied her daughter margo i thought that dress was for christmas day im in a holiday mood margo said breezily let me take that mum far from satisfied ann watched her daughter roll the cart into the parlor before she turned to kate miss kate youve been overworking your eyes again theyre bloodshot i want you to rest them later with cucumber slices and where are your slippers in my closet understanding the housekeepers need to scold kate hooked her arm through anns come on now annie dont fuss its treetrimming time remember the angels you helped us make when we were ten how could i forget the mess the three of you made and mr josh teasing the lot of you and biting the heads off mrs williamsons gingerbread men she lifted a hand to touch kates cheek youve grown up since times like this i miss my little girls well always be your little girls annie they paused in the parlor doorway to survey the scene it made kate grin just the look of everything the tree already shining with lights soared a good ten feet it stood in front of the tall windows that faced the front boxes of ornaments brought out of storage sat ready to be opened in the lapis hearth decked with candles and fresh greenery a sedate fire flickered scents of apple wood and pine and perfume filled the room how she loved this house she thought before the decorating was done every room would have just the right touches of holiday cheer a bowl of georgian silver filled with pinecones would be flanked by candles banks of poinsettias in gilttrimmed pots would crowd all the window seats delicate porcelain angels would be placed just so on glossy mahogany tables in the foyer the old victorian santa would claim his place of honor on the baby grand she could remember her first christmas at templeton house how the grandeur of it had dazzled her eyes and the constant warmth had soothed that ache just under her heart now half of her life had been lived here and the traditions had become her own she wanted to freeze this moment in her mind make it forever and unchangeable there she thought the way the firelight dances over aunt susies face as she laughs at uncle tommy and the way he takes her hand and holds it how perfect they look she thought the delicateframed woman and the tall distinguished man christmas hymns played quietly as she took it all in laura knelt by the boxes lifting out a red glass ball that caught the light and tossed it back margo poured steaming chocolate from a silver pot and practiced her flirting skills on josh he stood on a ladder with the lights from the tree glinting in his bronze hair they played over his face as he grinned down at margo in this room filled with shining silver sparkling glass pol ished old wood and soft fabrics they were perfect and they were hers arent they beautiful annie that they are and so are you not like them kate thought as she stepped into the room theres my katie girl thomas beamed at her put the books away for a while did you if you can stop answering the phone for an evening i can stop studying no business on treetrimming night he winked at her i think the hotels can run without me for one night never as well as they run with you and aunt susie margo lifted a brow as she passed kate a cup of hot chocolate somebodys bucking for another present i hope youve got something in mind other than that stupid computer youve been drooling over computers have become necessary tools in any business right uncle tommy cant live without them im glad your generations going to be taking over though i hate the blasted things youre going to have to upgrade the system in sales across the board josh put in as he climbed down the ladder no reason to do all that work when a machine can do it for you spoken like a true hedonist margo smirked at him be careful josh you might actually have to learn how to type imagine joshua conway templeton heir apparent to templeton hotels with a useful skill listen duchess hold it susan cut off her sons testy remark with an upraised hand no business tonight remember margo be a good girl and pass josh the ornaments kate take that side of the tree with annie will you laura you and i will start over here and what about me thomas wanted to know you do what you do best darling supervise it wasnt enough to hang them the ornaments had to be sighed over and stories told about them there was the wooden elf that margo had thrown at josh one year its head now held on its body with glue the glass star that laura had once believed her father had plucked from the sky just for her snowflakes that annie had crocheted for each of the family members the felt wreath with silver piping that had been kates first and last sewing project the homey and simple hung bough by bough with the priceless antique ornaments susan had collected from around the world when it was done they held their collective breath as thomas turned off the lamps and the room was lit by firelight and the magic of the tree its beautiful its always beautiful kate murmured and slipped her hand into lauras late that night when sleep eluded her kate wandered back downstairs she crept into the parlor stretched out on the rug beneath the tree and watched the lights dance she liked to listen to the house the quiet ticking of old clocks the sighs and murmurs of wood settling the crackle of spent logs in the hearth rain was falling in little needle stabs against the windows the wind was a whispering song it helped to lie there the nerves over her exam the following day slowly unknotted from her stomach she knew everyone was tucked into bed safe sound shed heard laura come in from her drive with peter and sometime later josh returned from a date her world was in order if youre hanging out for santa youve got a long wait margo came into the room on bare feet and settled down beside kate youre not still obsessing over some stupid math test are you its a midterm and if you paid more attention to yours you wouldnt be skimming by with cs schools just something you have to get through margo slipped a pack of cigarettes out of her robe pocket with every one in bed it was safe to sneak a smoke so can you believe josh is dating that crosseyed leah mcnee shes not crosseyed margo and shes built margo huffed out smoke anyone not struck blind could see that compared to margo sullivan leah was barely female hes only dating her because she puts out what do you care i dont she sniffed and smoked and sulked its just so ordinary thats something im never going to be smiling a little kate turned to her friend in a blue chenille robe with her tumbled blond hair margo looked stunning and sultry and sleek no one would ever accuse you of being ordinary pal obnoxious conceited rude and a royal pain in the ass yes but never ordinary margo raised a brow and grinned i can always count on you anyway speaking of ordinary how stuck do you think laura really is on peter ridgeway i dont know kate gnawed on her lip shes been dreamyeyed over him ever since uncle tommy transferred him out here i wish he was still managing templeton chicago then she shrugged he must be good at his job or uncle tommy and aunt susie wouldnt have promoted him knowing how to manage a hotel has nothing to do with it mr and mrs t have dozens of managers all over the world this is the only one lauras gone over on kate if she marries him yeah kate blew out a breath its her decision her life christ i cant imagine why anyone would want to get tied down that way neither can i stubbing the cigarette out margo lay back im not going to im going to make a splash in this world me too margo slanted kate a look keeping books thats more like a slow drip you splash your way ill splash mine this time next year ill be in college margo shuddered what a hideous thought youll be there too kate reminded her if you dont tank your sat well see about that college wasnt on margos agenda i say we find seraphinas dowry and take that trip around the world we used to talk about there are places i want to see while im still young rome and greece paris milan london theyre impressive kate had seen them the templetons had taken her and would have taken margo as well if ann had allowed it i see you marrying a rich guy bleeding him dry and jetsetting all over not a bad fantasy amused by it margo stretched her arms but id rather be rich myself and just have a platoon of lovers at the sound in the hall she shoved the ashtray under the folds of her robe laura blowing out a breath she sat up you scared the wits out of me sorry couldnt sleep join the party kate invited we were planning our future oh with a soft secret smile laura knelt on the rug thats nice hold on eyes sharp margo shifted and took lauras chin in her hand after a moments study she let out a breath okay you didnt do it with him flushing laura batted margos hand away of course i didnt peter would never pressure me how do you know she didnt kate demanded you can tell i dont think you should have sex with him laura but if youre seriously thinking marriage youd better try him on first sex isnt a pair of shoes laura muttered but it sure as hell better fit when i make love the first time its going to be with my husband on our wedding night thats the way i want it uhoh shes got that templeton edge in her voice grinning kate tugged on a curl falling over lauras ear unbudgable dont listen to margo laura in her head sex is equated with salvation margo lit another cigarette id like to know what tops it love laura stated success kate said at the same time well that sums it up kate wrapped her arms around her knees margos going to be a sex fiend youre going to search for love and im going to bust my ass for success what a group im already in love laura said quietly i want someone who loves me back and children i want to wake up each morning knowing i can make a home for them and a happy life for them i want to fall asleep each night beside someone i can trust and depend on id rather fall asleep at night beside someone who makes me hot margo chuckled when kate poked her just kidding sort of i want to go places and do things be somebody i want to know when i wake up in the morning that something exciting is right around the corner and whatever it is i want to make it mine kate rested her chin on her knees i want to feel accomplished she said quietly i want to make things work the way i think they should work i want to wake up in the morning knowing exactly what im doing next and how im going to do it i want to be the best at what i do so that i know i havent wasted anything because if i wasted it it would be like failing her voice broke embarrassing her god i must be overtired because her eyes were stinging she rubbed them hard i have to go to bed my exams first thing in the morning youll breeze through it laura rose with her dont worry so much professional nerds have to worry but margo rose as well and patted kates arm lets get some sleep kate paused at the doorway to look back at the tree for a moment shed been shocked to discover that a part of her wished she could stay here just like this forever never have to worry about tomorrow or the next day never have to concern herself with success or failure or change change was coming she realized it was barreling down on her in the dewy look in lauras eyes the edgy one in margos she turned off the lights there was no stopping any of it she realized so shed better get ready chapter two contents prev next she got through the days and the nights and the work there was no choice but to cope and for the first time in her life kate felt there was no one she could talk to each time she felt herself tipping needing to reach for the phone or run to templeton house she yanked herself back she could not would not pour out this misery these fears to the people who loved her they would stand by her there was no doubt about that but this was a burden she had to carry herself and one she hoped she could hide in some dark corner of her mind eventually she would be able to let it rest to stop feeling compelled to pick it up again and again and examine it she considered herself practical intelligent and strong indeed she couldnt understand how anyone could be the latter without the two formers until this her life had been exactly as she wanted it her career was cruising along at a safe and yes intelligent speed she had a reputation at bittle and associates as a clearheaded hardworking cpa who could handle complex accounts without complaint eventually she expected to be offered a full partnership when that time came she would ascend yet another rung on her personal ladder of success she had family she loved and who loved her and friendswell her closest friends were family and what could be more convenient than that she adored them had loved growing up at templeton house overlooking the wild sweeping cliffs of big sur there was nothing she wouldnt do for aunt susie and uncle tommy that included keeping what she had learned weeks before in her office to herself she wouldnt question them though questions burned inside her she wouldnt share the pain or the problem with laura or margo though she had always shared everything with them she would suppress ignore and forget that she had to believe would be best for everyone her entire life had been focused on doing her best being the best making her family proud now she felt she had more to prove more to be every success she had enjoyed could be traced back to the moment when they had opened their home and their hearts to her so she promised herself to look forward rather than back to go on with the routine that had become her life under ordinary circumstances treasure hunting wouldnt be considered routine but when it involved seraphinas dowry when it included laura and margo and lauras two daughters it was an event it was a mission the legend of seraphina that doomed young girl who had flung herself off the cliffs rather than face a life without her true love had fascinated the three of them all of their lives the beautiful spanish girl had loved felipe had met him in secret walked with him along the cliffs in the wind in the rain he had gone off to fight the americans to prove himself worthy of her promising to come back to marry her and build a life with her but he had not come back when seraphina learned he had been killed in battle she had walked these cliffs again had stood on the edge of the world and overcome with grief had flung herself over it the romance of it the mystery the glamour had been irresistible to the three women and of course the possibility of finding the dowry that seraphina had hidden away before she leapt into the sea added challenge on most sundays kate could be found on the cliffs wielding a metal detector or a spade for months ever since the morning that margo at a crossroads in her life had found a single gold doubloon the three had met there to search or maybe they gathered not so much in hopes of uncovering a chest of gold as simply to enjoy each others company it was nearly may and after the jangled nerves she had suffered leading up to april and the income tax deadline kate was thrilled to be out in the sun it was what she needed she was sure it helped as work helped to keep her mind off the file she had hidden in her apartment the file on her father that she had carefully organized it helped to block out the worries and the ache in her heart and the stress of wondering if shed done the right thing by hiring a detective to look into a twentyyearold case her muscles protested a bit as she swept the metal detector over a new section of scrub and she sweated lightly under her tshirt she wouldnt think of it she promised herself not today not here she wouldnt think of it at all until the detectives report was complete she had promised the day to herself for her family and nothing would get in the way the gorgeous breeze ruffled her short cap of black hair her skin was dusky an inheritance from the italian branch of her mothers family though beneath it was what margo called accountants pallor a few days in the sun she decided would fix that shed lost a little weight in the last few weeks of crunch time and yes because of the shock of discovering what her father had done but she intended to put it back on she always had hopes of putting some meat on her stubbornly thin bones she didnt have margos height or stunning build or lauras lovely fragility she was kate had always thought average average and skinny with an angular face to match her angular body once she had hoped for dimples or the dash of a few charming freckles or deepgreen eyes instead of ordinary brown but shed been too practical to dwell on it for long she had a good brain and skill with figures and that was what she needed to succeed she reached down for the jug of lemonade ann sullivan had sent along after a long indulgent drink kate cast a scowl in margos direction are you just going to sit there all afternoon while the rest of us work margo stretched luxuriously on her rock her sexpot body draped in what for margo sullivan templeton was casual wear of red leggings and a matching shirt were a little tired today she claimed and patted her flat belly kate snorted ever since you found out youre pregnant youve been finding excuses to sit on your butt margo flashed a smile and tossed her long blond hair behind her shoulders josh doesnt want me to overdo youre playing that one for all its worth kate grumbled damn right i am delighted with life in general margo crossed her long gorgeous legs hes so sweet and attentive and thrilled jesus kate weve made ourselves a baby maybe the idea of two of her favorite people being blindly in love starting their own family did bring kate a warm glow but she was bound by tradition to snipe at margo whenever possible at least you could look haggard throw up every morning faint now and again ive never felt better in my life because it was true margo rose and took the metal detector even giving up smoking hasnt been as hard as i thought it would i never imagined i wanted to be a mother now its all i can think about youre going to be a fabulous mother kate murmured just fabulous yes i am margo studied laura who was giggling and digging at a patch of scrubby earth with her two little girls ive got an awfully good role model right there this past years been hell for her but shes never wavered neglect adultery divorce kate said quietly not wanting the fitful breeze to carry her words not a lot of fun and games the girls have helped keep her centered and the shop yeah and speaking of the shop margo turned the detector off leaned on it if these past couple of weeks are any indication we may have to hire some help im not going to be able to give pretenses ten and twelve hours a day after the baby comes always thinking of budget kate frowned the upscale secondhand boutique they had opened on cannery row was primarily margos and lauras domain but as the third partner in the fledgling enterprise kate crunched numbers for it when she could squeeze out the time youve got over six months left that hits holiday shopping time we could think about hiring seasonal help then sighing margo handed the metal detector back to kate the business is doing better than any of us anticipated dont you think its time to loosen up no kate switched the machine back on we havent been open a full year yet you start taking on outside help youve got social security withholding unemployment well yes but i can start helping out on saturdays if necessary and ive got my vacation time coming up work she thought again work and dont think i can give pretenses a couple of weeks full time kate a vacation means whitesand beaches europe a sordid affair not clerking in a shop kate merely raised an eyebrow i forgot who i was talking to margo muttered the original allworkandnoplay girl that was always to balance you the quintessential allplay girl anyway im a onethird owner of pretenses i believe in protecting my investments she scowled at the ground kicked it hell theres not even a bottle cap to give us a little beep and thrill here are you feeling all right margos eyes narrowed looked closer you look a little washed out and frail she realized frail and edgy if i didnt know better id say you were the one who was pregnant that would be a good trick since i havent had sex in what feels like the last millennium which could be why you seem edgy and washed out but she didnt grin really kate whats going on she wanted to say it spill out all of it knew if she did she would find comfort support loyalty whatever she needed my problem she reminded herself nothing kate made herself look down her nose disdainfully except im the one doing all the work and my arms are falling off while you sit on your rock and pose for a glamorous motherstobe photo shoot she rotated her shoulders i need a break margo studied her friend for another moment tapping her fingers on her knee fine im hungry anyway lets see what mum packed opening the nearby hamper margo let out a long heartfelt moan oh god fried chicken kate peeked in the hamper five minutes more she decided then she was digging in mrs williamsons chicken was bound to erase the nagging hunger pains is josh back from london hmm margo swallowed gamely tomorrow templeton london did a little remodeling so hes going to bring back some stock for the shop and i asked him to check with some of my contacts there so we may have a nice new supply it would save me a buying trip i remember when you couldnt wait to get on a plane that was then margo said smugly this is now she bit into the drumstick again then remembered something and waved a hand umm forgot party next saturday night cocktails buffet be there kate winced do i have to dress up yes lots of our customers she swallowed again some of the hotel brass byron de witt pouting kate turned off the machine and grabbed a chicken thigh out of the hamper i dont like him of course not margo said dryly hes gorgeous charming intelligent worldtraveled absolutely hateful he knows hes gorgeous and that takes a lot of nerve i dont really give a damn whether you like him or not hes taken a lot of the weight off josh here at the california hotels recovered a lot of the ground peter ridgeway lost for us she caught herself and glanced over toward laura peter was lauras exhusband the girls father and whatever she thought of him she wouldnt criticize him in front of ali and kayla just be civil im always civil hey guys kate called out and watched ali and kaylas pretty blond heads pop up weve got mrs williamsons fried chicken over here and margos eating it all with shouts and scrambling feet the girls dashed up to join the picnic laura came after them and sat crosslegged at margos feet she watched her daughters squabble over one particular piece of chicken ali won of course she was the older of the two and in recent months the more demanding divorce laura reminded herself as ali smugly nibbled her chicken was very very hard on a tenyearold girl ali pour kayla a glass of lemonade too ali hesitated considered refusing it seemed laura thought as she kept cool calm eyes on her daughters mutinous ones that ali considered refusing everything these days in the end ali shrugged and poured a second glass for her sister we didnt find anything ali complained choosing to forget the fun shed had giggling and digging in the dirt its boring really margo selected a cube of cheese from a plastic container for me just being here and looking is half the fun well whatever margo said was to ali gospel margo was glamorous and different margo had run away to hollywood at eighteen had lived in europe and had been involved in wonderful exciting scandals nothing ordinary and awful like marriage and divorce i guess its kinda fun but i wish wed find more coins persistence kate flipped a finger from alis chin to her nose pays what would have happened if alexander graham bell had given up before he put that first call through if indiana jones hadnt gone on that last crusade if armani hadnt sewed that first seam margo put in and earned a fresh giggle if star trek hadnt gone where no one had gone before laura finished and had the pleasure of seeing her daughter flash a smile well maybe can we see the coin again aunt margo margo reached in her pocket shed fallen into the habit of carrying the old spanish gold coin with her ali took it gingerly and because she was awed as always held it so that kayla could coo over it too its so shiny kayla touched it reverently can i pick some flowers for seraphina sure leaning over laura kissed the top of her head but dont go near the edge to throw them over without me i wont we always do it together i guess ill help her ali handed margo the coin but when she stood up her pretty mouth went thin seraphina was stupid to jump just because she wasnt going to be able to marry felipe marriage is no good anyway then she remembered margo and blushed sometimes laura said quietly marriage is wonderful and kind and strong and other times it isnt wonderful enough or kind enough or strong enough but youre right ali seraphina shouldnt have jumped when she did that she ended everything she could have become threw away all those possibilities it makes me feel very sorry for her she watched her daughter head drooping shoulders hunched walk away shes so hurt shes so angry shell get through this kate gave lauras hand a bracing squeeze youre doing everything right its been three months since theyve seen peter he hasnt even bothered to call them youre doing everything right kate repeated youre not responsible for the asshole she knows youre not to blame inside she knows that i hope so laura shrugged and picked at a piece of chicken kayla just bounces and ali broods well i guess were a textbook example that kids can grow up in the same house and be raised by the same people and turn out differently kates stomach wrenched true margo had a lowgrade urge for a cigarette quashed it but were all so fabulous well she smiled sweetly at kate most of us just for that im eating the last piece of chicken kate popped a couple of turns first medication helped her to eat when she had no desire for food nervous heartburn she thought of the low burn just under her breastbone insisted on thinking of it that way i was telling margo that id be able to pitch in at the shop on saturdays we could use the help laura shifted so she could continue the conversation and keep an eye on her daughters last saturday was a madhouse and i could only give margo four hours i can put in a full day wonderful margo plucked some glossy grapes from a bunch youll be hunkered over the computer the whole time trying to find mistakes if you didnt make them i wouldnt have to find them but she held up a hand not so much to avoid the argument as to make a point ill stay at the counter and i have twenty bucks that says i make more sales than you by the time we close in your dreams powell on monday morning kate wasnt thinking about dreams or treasure hunts at nine sharp with her third cup of coffee at her elbow her computer booted she was behind her desk in her office at bittle and associates following her daily routine she had already removed her navy pinstriped jacket draped it behind her chair and rolled up the sleeves of her starched white shirt the sleeves would be rolled back down and the jacket neatly buttoned into place for her eleven oclock meeting with a client but for now it was just kate and numbers and that was how she liked it best the challenge of making numbers dance and shuffle and fall neatly into place had always fascinated her there was a beauty in the ebb and flow of interest rates tbills mutual funds and a power she could privately admit in understanding even admiring the caprice of finance and confidently advising clients how best to protect their hardearned money not that it was always hardearned she thought with a snort as she studied the account on her screen a good many of her clients had earned their money the oldfashioned way theyd inherited it even as the thought crossed her mind she cringed was that her father in her sneering at those who had inherited wealth taking a deep breath she rubbed a hand over the tense spot in the back of her neck she had to stop this seeing ghosts around every thought in her head it was her job to advise and protect and to ensure that any account she handled through bittle was served well not only was she not envious of her clients portfolios she worked hand in glove with lawyers bookkeepers brokers agents and estate planners to provide each and every one of them the very best in short and longterm financial advice that she reminded herself was who she was what she reveled in was the numbers their stoic and dependable consistency for kate two and two always and forever equaled four to realign herself she skimmed through a spreadsheet for ever spring nursery and gardens in the eighteen months since she had taken over that account shed watched it slowly cautiously expand she believed strongly in the slow and the cautious and this client had taken her direction well true the payroll had swelled but the business justified it outlay for the health plan and employee benefits was high and nipped at the profit margin but as a woman raised by the templetons she also firmly believed in sharing success with the people who helped you earn it a good year for bougainvillea she muttered and made a note to suggest that her client ease some of the last quarters profits into taxfree bonds render unto caesar sure she thought but not one damn penny more than necessary you look beautiful when youre plotting kate glanced up her fingers automatically hitting the keys to store her data and bring up her screen saver hello roger he leaned against the doorjamb posed was kates unflattering thought roger thornhill was tall dark and handsome with classic features reminiscent of gary grant in his prime broad shoulders fit beautifully under a tailored gray suit jacket he had a quick brilliant smile darkblue eyes that zeroed in flatteringly on a womans face and a smooth baritone that flowed like melted honey perhaps it was for all of those reasons that kate couldnt abide him it was only coincidence that they were on the same fast track for partnership that she assured herself often had nothing to do with why he annoyed her or just a very little to do with it your door was open he pointed out and strolled in without invitation i figured you werent very busy i like my door open he flashed that wide toothy smile and eased a hip onto the corner of her desk i just got back from nevis a couple of weeks in the west indies sure clears out the system after the tax crunch his gaze roamed over her face you should have come with me roger when i wont even have dinner with you why would you think id spend two weeks frolicking with you in the sand and surf hope springs eternal he took one of the pencils sharpened like swords from her lucite holder slid it idly through his fingers her pencils were always sharpened and always kept in the same place there was nothing in her office that didnt have a proper slot he knew all of them an ambitious man roger made use of what he knew he also made use of charm keeping his eyes on hers smiling id just like us to get to know each other again outside the office hell kate its been almost two years deliberately she raised an eyebrow since okay since i messed things up he put the pencil down im sorry i dont know how else to say it sorry voice mild she rose to refill her coffee though the third cup wasnt sitting well she sat again watching him as she sipped sorry that you were sleeping with me and one of my clients at the same time or that you were sleeping with me in order to get to my client or that you seduced said client into moving her account from my hands to yours which of those are you apologizing for roger all of them because it invariably worked with females he tried the smile again look ive already apologized countless times but im willing to do it again i had no business seeing bess ah mrs turner much less sleeping with her while you and i were involved theres no excuse for it we agree goodbye kate his eyes stayed on hers his voice flowing just the way she remembered it had when she had moved under him climbing toward climax i want to make things right with you at least make peace with you she cocked her head considered there was right and there was wrong there were ethics and there was the lack of them no damn it with his first sign of temper he stood up from the desk the movement jerky and abrupt i was a son of a bitch i let sex and ambition get in the way of what was a good satisfying relationship youre absolutely right she agreed and you didnt know me well the first time around if you have any hope that id let you repeat the performance i stopped seeing bess months ago on a personal level oh well then leaning back in her chair kate enjoyed a good rolling laugh jesus christ youre a case roger you think because youve cleared the field im going to suit up and jump into the game were associates she told him and thats all im never going to make the mistake of getting involved with someone at work again and im never repeat never going to give you another shot his mouth thinned youre afraid to see me outside the office afraid because youd remember how good we were together she had to sigh roger we werent that good my appraisal would put us at adequate lets just close the books on this one in the interest of sanity she rose held out her hand you want to put it behind us lets no hard feelings intrigued he studied her hand then her face no hard feelings no feelings at all she thought but decided not to say it fresh sheet she said were colleagues marginally friendly and youll stop pestering me about having dinner or taking trips to the west indies he took her hand ive missed you kate missed touching you all right he said quickly when he saw her eyes narrow if thats the best i can do ill take it i appreciate your accepting my apology fine struggling to be patient she tugged her hand away now ive got work to do im glad we worked this out he was smiling again as he walked to the door yeah right she muttered she didnt slam the door behind him that would have indicated too much emotion she didnt want roger the slime thornhill to get the idea there was any emotion inside her where he was concerned but she did close the door quietly purposefully before sitting back down at her desk she took out a bottle of mylanta sighed a little and chugged he had hurt her it was demoralizing to remember just how much he had hurt her she hadnt been in love with him but with a little more time a little more effort she could have been they had had the common ground of their work which she believed could have served as a strong foundation for more she had cared for him and trusted him and enjoyed him and he had used her ruthlessly to steal one of her biggest clients that was almost worse than discovering hed been jumping from her bed to her clients bed and back again kate took another swig from the bottle before recapping it she had at the time considered going to larry bittle with a formal complaint but her pride had outweighed whatever satisfaction she might have gleaned from that the client was satisfied and that was the bottom line at bittle roger would have lost some ground certainly if shed filed a complaint others in the office would have distrusted him pulled back from him and she would have looked like the whining betrayed female sniveling because she had mixed sex and business and had lost better that shed kept it to herself kate decided and put the mylanta back in her drawer better that shed been able to say straight to his face that she had put the whole incident behind her even if it was a lie even if she would detest him for the rest of her life with a shrug she recalled her data better by far to avoid slick smart gorgeous men with more ambition than heart better much better to stay in the fast lane on the career track and avoid any and all distractions partnership was waiting with all the success it entailed when she had that partnership had climbed to that next rung she would have earned it and maybe she thought just maybe when she reached that level of success she would be able to prove to herself that she was not her fathers daughter she smiled a little as she began to run figures stick with numbers pal she reminded herself they never lie chapter three contents prev next the minute kate walked into pretenses margo scowled you look like death thanks i want coffee and a moment alone she headed up the curving stairs to the second floor found the pot already brewing she knew she hadnt slept more than three hours not after poring over every detail in the report from the detective back east and every detail had confirmed that she was the daughter of a thief it was all there the evidence the charges the statements and reading through those papers had killed the faint hope shed hidden even from herself that it had all been some sort of mistake instead she had learned that her father had been out on bail at the time of the accident and had instructed his lawyer to accept the plea bargain hed been offered if he hadnt been killed that night on that icy stretch of road he would have been in prison within the week telling herself to accept it to get on with her life she drank her coffee hot and black she needed to go back down get to work and face a friend who knew her too well to miss signs of stress well she thought carrying her cup with her she had other excuses for a poor nights sleep and there was nothing to be gained by obsessing over facts that couldnt be changed from this moment kate promised herself she would cease to think about it whats going on margo demanded when kate wound her way down the stairs i want an answer this time youve been jumpy and out of sorts for weeks and i swear youre losing weight with every breath this has just gone on long enough kate im fine tired she shrugged a couple of accounts are giving me some problems on top of that its been a weird week kate opened the cash register counted out the bills and coins for morning change monday that scum thornhill came slinking into my office margo turned from setting up the teapot i hope you kicked his ass right out again i let him think weve made up it was easier she said before margo could comment hes more likely to leave me alone now youre not going to tell me thats whats keeping you up at night it gave me some bad moments okay okay margo smiled in sympathy men are pigs and that one is a blue ribbon hog dont waste your beauty sleep on him honey thanks anyway that was only the first weird thing the wacky life of a cpa wednesday i got tossed this new account freeland its a petting zoo kiddie park museum very strange im learning all about how much it costs to feed a baby llama margo paused you lead such a fascinating life youre telling me then yesterday the partners all hud dled together for most of the afternoon even the secretaries were barred nobody has a clue but the rumor is somebodys about to be canned or promoted kate shrugged and closed the cash register ive never seen them powwow like that they had to make their own coffee stop the presses look my little world has just as much intrigue and drama as anyone elses she stepped back as margo advanced on her what just hold still grabbing kates lapel margo pinned on a crescentshaped brooch dangling with drops of amber advertise the merchandise its got dead bugs in it margo didnt bother to sigh put some lipstick on for gods sake we open in ten minutes i dont have any with me and ill tell you right now im not going to work with you all day if youre going to be picking on me i can sell ring up and box just fine without painting my face fine before kate could evade her margo picked up an atomizer and spritzed her with perfume advertise the merchandise she repeated if anyone asks what youre wearing its bella donnas savage kate had just worked up a snarl when laura burst in i thought i was going to be late ali had a hair emergency i was afraid one of us would kill the other before it was over shes getting more like margo every day wishing it were coffee kate strolled over to pour herself tea and used it to wash down a palm full of pills she didnt want either of her friends to see i meant that in the worst possible way she added a young girl becoming interested in appearance and grooming is natural margo shot back you were the changeling in the family still are as you constantly prove by going around like a scarecrow dressed in navy blue serge unoffended kate sipped at her tea navy serge is classic because its serviceable there is only a very small percentage of the population who feel honor bound to fart through silk jesus youre crude margo managed over a laugh i dont even want to argue with you thats a relief hoping to keep it that way laura hurried over to turn the open sign around im still crosseyed from arguing with allison if annie hadnt intervened it would have been hairbrushes at ten paces mum always could defuse a good fight margo commented okay ladies remember were pushing mothers day and in case it slipped both of your minds expectant mothers also warrant gifts kate braced for the onslaught and struggled to ignore the viselike clamp on her temples that was usually the sign of a migraine on the boil within an hour pretenses was busy enough to keep all three of them occupied kate boxed up a hermes bag of darkgreen leather wondering what anyone needed with a green leather purse but the slick slide of the credit card machine kept her cheerful she was by her calculations neck and neck with margo on sales it was a fine feeling she thought as she wrapped the gold and silver box in elegant floral paper watching the business progress and the combo of competition and medication had eased the headache that had been threatening she had to give margo full credit for it pretenses had been a dream rising like smoke from the ashes of margos life just over a year ago margos career as a popular model in europe her exposure and financial rewards as the bella donna woman had been rudely cut off not that margo was blameless kate thought smiling as she handed the purchase to her customer shed been reckless foolish headstrong but she hadnt deserved to lose everything shed come back from milan broken and nearly bankrupt but in a matter of months through her own grit she had turned her life around opening a shop and selling her possessions in it had been josh templetons idea originally his idea kate mused to keep margo from sinking since he was blindly in love with her but margo had expanded the idea nurtured it polished it then laura reeling from her husbands deceit betrayal and greed had taken the bulk of what hed left of her money and helped margo buy the building for pretenses when kate had insisted on acquiring a onethird interest thus making herself a partner it had been because she believed in the investment because she believed in margo and because she didnt want to be left out of the fun of all of them she understood the risks best nearly forty percent of new businesses failed within a year and almost eighty percent went under within five and kate worried over it gnawed on it at night when she couldnt sleep but pretenses margos conception of an elegant exclusive and unique secondhand shop that offered everything from designer gowns to teaspoons was holding its own kates part in it might have been small and her reasons for getting involved certainly straddled the practical and the emotional but she was enjoying herself when she wasnt obsessing here was proof after all that life could be what you made of it she badly needed to hang on to that idea is there something i can show you the man she smiled at was thirtyish attractive in a rugged livedin manner she appreciated the worn jeans the faded shirt the dashing reddish moustache ah well maybe this necklace here she looked down into the display zeroed in on his choice its pretty isnt it pearls are so classic not regular pearls she thought as she lifted the necklace out what the hell were they called she continued to search through her mind as she draped the necklace over a velvet form seed pearls she remembered and beamed at him he really was awfully cute its called a lariat she added shed gotten that off the tag three strands and the clasp or the slide thing has a give me a minute a mabe pearl set in gold tradition with a flair she added enjoying the ad lib i wondered how much hesitating he flipped the tiny discreet price tag over to his credit he winced only slightly well he smiled a little it hits the top of my price range its something shell wear for years is it for mothers day yeah he shifted his feet running a calloused finger over the strands shed go nuts over it she melted toward him any man who would take such time and trouble for a gift for his mother earned top points from kate powell especially when he looked just a little bit like kevin costner we have several other really nice pieces that arent quite so expensive no i think maybe could you put it on so i could get a better picture sure happy to oblige she fastened it around her neck what do you think is it great she angled the counter mirror so that she could judge for herself and added laughing if you dont buy it i might have to snap it up myself it looks awfully pretty on you he said with a shy quiet smile that made her want to scoop him up and bundle him into the back room shes got dark hair like you wears it longer but the pearls look good with dark hair i guess ill have to take it along with that box over there the silver one with all the fancy scrolling still wearing the necklace kate scooted out from behind the counter to get the trinket box hed pointed to two presents she reached up to undo the necklace clasp your mother must be a very special woman oh shes great shes going to like this box she sort of collects them the necklace is for my wife though he added im getting all my mothers day shopping done at one time your wife kate forced herself to keep her lips cheerily curved at the corners i guarantee shell love it but if she or your mother prefers something else we have a thirtyday exchange and return policy with what she considered admirable restraint kate laid the necklace down now will that be cash or charge ten minutes later she watched him saunter out the cute ones she muttered to laura the nice ones the ones who love their mothers are all married there there laura patted kates arm before reaching under the counter to select the proper box it looked like a very good sale puts me at least two hundred up on margo and the days young thats the spirit but i should warn you shes got one back in the wardrobe room now and shes definitely leaning toward versace shit kate turned to scan the main showroom for prey im going for the bluehaired lady with the gucci bag shes mine reel her in tiger kate didnt break for lunch and told herself it was because she wanted to keep up her momentum not because her stomach was acting up again she had tremendous success in the secondfloor ladies boudoir and racked up two peignoirs a stainedglass accent lamp and a tasseled footstool maybe she did sneak into the back room a couple of times to boot up the computer and check margos bookkeeping but only when her lead was comfortable she corrected the expected mistakes rolled her eyes over a few unexpected ones and tidied up the files she was forced to admit in the end that accountants lapse was what cost her the victory when she came back smug already preparing the lecture she intended to deliver to margo on the cost of careless accounting her rival was closing a sale a whopper kate knew antiques a child didnt grow up at templeton house and not learn to recognize and appreciate them her heart sank even as dollar signs revolved in her head when she recognized the piece margo was cooing over louis xvi kate recited in her head a secretaireaabattant probably near the marquetry panels typical of that era included vases and garlands of flowers musical instruments and drapery oh it was a stunner kate thought and one of the remaining pieces from margos original stock im sorry to lose it margo was telling the dapper whitehaired gentleman who leaned on a goldheaded cane and studied the secretaire and the woman who described it with equal admiration i bought it in paris several years ago you have a wonderful eye in fact you have two wonderful eyes oh mr stiener thats so sweet of you in her shameless style margo trailed a finger down his arm i do hope youll think of me now and again when youre enjoying this i can promise you i will now as to shipping just come over to the counter and ill take all the necessary information margo crossed the room hips swinging and shot kate a triumphant look i think that crushes you for the day ace she said when her customer strolled out the days not over kate insisted we still have two hours until closing so until the fat lady sings which will be you in a few months dont count your chickens such a sore loser margo clucked her tongue and was ready to pounce when the door jangled it wasnt a customer but she pounced anyway josh he caught her kissed her then pulled her to a chair off your feet he kept one hand on her shoulder and turned to glare at kate youre supposed to be keeping an eye on her making sure she doesnt overdo dont hang this on me besides margo doesnt stand when she can sit and doesnt sit when she can lie down and i made her drink a glass of milk an hour ago josh narrowed his eyes a whole glass what she didnt spit at me because it amused and touched her to see her big brother worry and fuss kate decided to forgive him she stepped over and kissed him welcome home thanks he stroked a hand over her hair wheres laura upstairs with a couple of customers and theres another one in the wardrobe room margo began so sit josh ordered kate can handle it youre looking pale margo pouted i am not youre going home and taking a nap he decided no way youre going to work all day then run around giving a party kate and laura can finish out here sure we can kate shot margo a smug look a couple of hours should do it keep dreaming powell ive already won won always interested in a bet josh looked from woman to woman won what just a friendly wager that i could outsell her which shes already lost margo pointed out and im feeling generous you can have the twohour handicap kate taking joshs hand she rubbed it against her cheek and when youve lost officially you wear the ungaro slip dress the red to the party tonight the thing that looks like a nightgown you might as well be naked really josh wiggled his eyebrows no offense kate hope you lose come on duchess home bed im not wearing a red slip to any party kate insisted then dont lose margo said with a careless shrug as she walked with josh to the door but when you do have laura pick out the accessories she wore a hammeredgold collar and triangular earrings that danced below her lobes her complaints that she looked like a slave girl captured by the klingons fell on deaf ears even the shoes had been forced on her red satin skyscrapers that had her teetering at three and a half inches over her normal five seven she sipped champagne and felt like a fool it didnt help matters that some of her clients were there margo and joshs acquaintances ran toward the rich the famous and the privileged and she wondered how she was going to maintain her image as a clearheaded precise and dedicated accountant when she was dressed like a bimbo but a bet was a bet stop fidgeting laura ordered when she joined kate on the terrace you look stunning this from a woman tastefully garbed in an elegant suit that covers her extremities what i look she said after another gulp of champagne is desperate i might as well be wearing a sign single woman hiv negative apply in person laura laughed as long as youre hiding out here i dont think you have to worry about it with a sigh she leaned back on the decorative banister god its a beautiful night halfmoon starlight the sound of the sea a sky like that it doesnt seem like anything bad could ever happen under it this is a good house can you feel that kate margo and joshs house its good excellent investment prime location excellent view she smiled at lauras bland stare okay yeah i can feel it its a good house it has heart and character i like thinking of them here together of them raising a family here relaxed now she leaned back with laura there was music drifting through the open doors and windows the friendly sound of conversation the tinkle of laughter she could smell flowers the sea a mix of feminine perfumes exotic tidbits being passed around on silver trays and she could simply by standing there feel the permanence and the promise like templeton house she mused where she had spent so much of her life maybe that was why she had never been driven to make a home of her own why an apartment convenient to work was all shed wanted because she thought with a faint smile she could always go home to templeton house and now she could always come here as well oh hello byron i didnt know you were here at lauras easy greeting kates pretty mood popped she opened her eyes straightened up from the banister and squared her shoulders something about byron de witt always made her feel confrontational i just got here i had some business that ran over you look lovely as always he squeezed lauras offered hand lightly before turning his gaze to kate the shadows were deep enough that she didnt notice his deepgreen eyes widen slightly but she did catch the quick amused grin nice to see you can i get either of you a fresh drink no i have to get back inside laura stepped toward the terrace doors i promised josh id charm mr and mrs ito were in hot competition for their banquet business in tokyo she was gone too quickly for kate to scowl at her would you like another glass of champagne kate scowled down into her glass instead it was still half full no im fine byron contented himself by lighting a thin cigar he knew kates pride wouldnt permit her to bolt normally he wouldnt have stayed with her any longer than manners dictated but at the moment he was a little tired of people and understood that ten minutes with her would be more interesting than an hour with the party crowd especially if he could irritate her as he seemed so skilled at doing thats quite a dress katherine she bristled as hed expected at his use of her full name grinning around the cigar he leaned back and prepared to enjoy the diversion i lost a bet she said between her teeth really he reached out to toy with and tug up the thin strap that had slid off her shoulder some bet hands off she snapped fine deliberately he moved the strap down again so that she was forced to pull it up youve got a good eye for real estate he commented and nodded at the surroundings when she frowned at him you steered josh and margo to this place didnt you yeah she watched him waited but he seemed content to puff on his cigar and study the view he was just the type shed decided to dislike posterboy gorgeous she termed it derisively thick brown hair that showed hints and streaks of gold waved with careless attraction around a heartstopping face what would have been charming dimples in his youth had deepened to creases in his cheeks that were now designed to incite a womans sexual fantasies the firm heros chin the straight aristocrats nose and those dark dark green eyes that could at his whim slide over you as if you were invisible or pin you shuddering to the wall six two she judged with the long limbs and strong shoulders of a longdistance runner and of course that voice with its faint misty drawl that hinted of hot summer nights and southern comfort men like him kate had decided were not ever to be trusted thats new he murmured caught staring and appraising as his sharp green eyes shifted to hers kate looked quickly away what that scent youre wearing it suits you better than the soap and talc you seem so fond of straight up sexy he continued smiling when she gaped at him no games no illusions shed known him for months ever since he had transferred from atlanta to monterey to take over peter ridgeways position at templeton he was by all accounts a savvy experienced and creative hotelier one who had worked his way to the top of the templeton organization over a period of fourteen years she knew he came from money polite southern wealth steeped in tradition and chivalry she had disliked him on sight and had been confident despite his unflagging manners that her feelings were reciprocated are you coming on to me his eyes still on hers filled with humor i was commenting on your perfume katherine if i were coming on to you you wouldnt have to clarify she tossed back the rest of her wine a mistake she knew with a migraine lurking dont call me katherine that always seems to slip my mind like hell exactly and if i were to tell you youre looking particularly attractive tonight that would be an observation not an overture anyway kate we were discussing real estate she continued to scowl even margos favored cristal champagne didnt sit well on a nervous stomach we were or were about to im considering buying a home in the area since my sixmonth trial period is almost over you had a trial period it cheered her considerably to picture him on probation at templeton california i had six months to decide if i wanted to be based here permanently or go back to atlanta reading her mind easily he grinned i like it here the sea the cliffs the forests i like the people i work with but i dont intend to continue to live in a hotel however well run and lovely it may be she shrugged irritated by the way the wine seemed to be sitting like lead under her breastbone your business de witt not mine he would not he told himself patiently allow her prickly nature to divert him from his objective you know the area you have contacts and a good eye for quality and value i thought you could let me know if you hear about any interesting property particularly in the seventeen mile drive area im not a realtor she muttered good that means i dont have to worry about your commission because she appreciated that she bent there is a place might be a little big for your needs i like big figures its near pebble beach four or five bedrooms i cant remember but its back off the road a lot of cypress trees and a nice established yard decks she continued squinting her eyes as she tried to remember front and back wood cedar i think lots of glass its been on the market about six months and hasnt moved theres probably a reason for that might be it was waiting for the right buyer do you know the realtor sure theyre a client monterey bay real estate ask for arlene she shoots straight i appreciate it if it works out ill have to buy you dinner no thanks just consider it a she broke off as pain stabbed into her stomach then like a sick echo erupted in her head the glass slipped out of her hand and shattered on the tile even as he grabbed her hold on he picked her up had a moment to notice she was little more than bones and nerves before he eased her onto the cushions of a chair jesus christ kate youre dead white ill get someone no biting back on the pain she grabbed at his arm its nothing just a twinge sometimes alcohol wine on an empty stomach she managed regulating her breathing i should know better his brow knit his voice thrummed with impatience when did you eat last i was kind of swamped today idiot he straightened theres enough food around here for three hundred starving sailors ill get you a damn plate no i ordinarily that vicious look wouldnt have quelled her but at the moment she was feeling shaky okay thanks but dont say anything itll only worry them and theyve got all these people here just dont say anything she repeated then watched him after one last smoldering look stride off her hand trembled a bit as she opened her bag and swigged from a small medicine bottle all right she promised herself she would take better care of herself shed start trying those yoga exercises margo had shown her shed stop drinking so much damn coffee she would stop thinking by the time he came back she was feeling steadier one look at the plate he carried and she let out a laugh how many of those starving sailors do you intend to feed just eat he ordered and popped a small succulent shrimp into her mouth himself after a moments deliberation she scooted over on the cushion a distraction even in the form of byron de witt was what she needed i guess i have to ask you to sit down and share youre always so gracious she chose a tiny spinach quiche i just dont like you de witt fair enough he dipped into some crab souffle i dont like you either but i was taught to be polite to a lady yet he thought of her odder still he dreamed of her a fogdrenched erotic dream he couldnt quite remember in the morning something about the cliffs and the crash of waves the feel of soft skin and a slim body under his hands those big dark italian eyes staring into his it left him uncomfortably amused with himself byron de witt was sure of many things the national debt would never be paid women in thin cotton dresses were the best reason for summer rock and roll was here to stay and katherine powell was not his type skinny abrasive women with more attitude than charm didnt appeal to him he liked them soft and smart and sexy he admired them simply for being women and delighted in the bonuses of quiet conversation hardheaded debate outrageous laughter and hot mindless sex he considered himself as much of an expert on the female mystique as any man could be after all hed grown up surrounded by them the lone son in a household with three daughters byron knew women and knew them well and he knew what he liked no he wasnt remotely attracted to kate still the dream nagged at him as he prepared for the day it followed him into the executive weight room tugged at the back of his mind as he pushed himself through reps and sets and pyramids it lingered while he finished off his routine with twenty minutes of the wall street journal and the treadmill he struggled to think of something else the house he intended to buy something close to the beach so that he could run on the sand in the sun instead of on a mechanical loop rooms of his own he mused done to his own taste a place where he could mow his grass turn his music up to earsplitting levels entertain company or enjoy a quiet private evening there had been few quiet private evenings in his childhood not that he regretted the noise the crowds he had grown up with he adored his sisters had tolerated their everincreasing hordes of friends he loved his parents and had always considered their busy social and family life normal indeed it had been the uncertainty as to whether he could bear to be so far away from his childhood home and family that had made him put the sixmonthtrialperiod clause into his agreement with josh though he did miss them hed realized he could be happy in california he was nearly thirtyfive and he wanted his own place he was the first de witt to move out of georgia in two generations he was determined to make it the right move if nothing else it would stop the notsosubtle family pressure for him to settle down marry start a family the distance would certainly make it difficult for his sisters to continually shove women they considered perfect for him under his nose he had yet to meet a woman who was perfect for him as he stepped into the shower back in his penthouse office suite he thought of kate again she was definitely wrong if hed dreamed about her it was only because shed been on his mind annoyed that she continued to be byron turned up the radio affixed to the tiles until bonnie raitt bellowed out the challenge to give them something to talk about he was merely concerned about her he decided shed gone so pale become so quickly and unexpectedly vulnerable hed always been a sucker for a damsel in distress of course she was an idiot for not taking care of herself health and fitness werent an option in byrons mind but a duty the woman needed to learn to eat properly cut back on the caffeine exercise build up some flesh and jettison some of those jangling nerves she wasnt half bad when she lost the attitude he decided stepping out of the shower with bonnie still blasting shed given him a decent lead on the kind of property he was interested in and theyd even managed to have a reasonable conversation over a shared plate and she had looked interesting in that excuse for a dress shed been wearing not that he was interested byron assured himself as he lathered up to shave but she had a certain gamine appeal when she wasnt scowling almost audrey hepburnish he swore when he nicked his chin with the razor put the blame for his inattention directly on kates head he didnt have time to analyze some bony unfriendly numbers cruncher with a chip on her shoulder he had hotels to run chapter four contents prev next kate knew it was a mistake even when she set up the appointment it was she admitted like picking at a scab ensuring that a wound would never heal cleanly her fathers friend steven tydings was more than willing to meet her for lunch she was after all his new cpa and hed told her he was a man who liked to keep his finger on the pulse of his finances she was sure she could work with him do her job yet every time kate had opened his file shed fought off a sick feeling in her stomach flashback memories of her father bitter complaints about bills about just missing that big break she had forgotten all of that forged her memories of her parents more out of need she realized now than reality hers had not been a happy home nor had it been a stable one though she had woven it as such in her dreams now that it was impossible to pretend otherwise she realized it was equally impossible not to probe not to poke not to know she had nearly balked when tydings insisted on meeting at templeton monterey the dining room there was the best in the area the view of the bay superb none of the excuses that she came up with had changed his mind so at twelvethirty sharp she sat across from him at a window seat with a chefs salad in front of her it didnt matter where she was kate told herself as she picked at her meal laura was working at pretenses if anyone recognized her and mentioned it it would be a simple matter to tell laura shed been lunching with a client it was after all true for the first half hour kate guided the conversation to business strictly business whatever the circumstances his account was entitled to and would receive her best and he was pleased telling her so often as she constantly eased her dry throat by sipping templeton mineral water your dad had a way with numbers too tydings told her he was a toughly built compact man in his middle fifties who beamed at her out of darkbrown eyes success sat as stylishly on him as his suit did he kate murmured staring down at tydingss hands wellmanicured businessmans hands no flash but a simple gold band on his finger her father had liked flash heavy gold watches the small diamond ring he wore on his pinky why should she remember that now i dont remember well you were just a little thing but ill tell you linc had a gift for numbers he could run figures in his head youd have thought he had a calculator in there it was her opening and she had to take it i dont understand how someone that good with numbers could make such an enormous mistake he just wanted bigger things katie tydings sighed eased back in his chair he had a run of bad luck bad luck bad luck and bad judgment tydings qualified the ball got away from him mr tydings he embezzled funds he was going to prison she took a deep breath braced herself was money so important to him that he would steal that he would risk everything he risked just to have it you have to see the whole picture understand the frustrations the ambitions well the dreams katie linc always felt he was overshadowed outclassed by the templeton branch of the family no matter what he did how hard he tried he could never measure up that was a hard pill for a man like him to swallow just what kind of a man was he that he would be so envious of someone elses success it wasnt like that exactly obviously uncomfortable tydings shifted in his seat linc had a powerful need to succeed to be the best yes she struggled against a shudder tydings might have been describing the daughter rather than the father i understand that he just felt that if he could catch a break just one break he could build on it make something he had the potential the brains he was a smart hardworking man a good friend with a weakness for wanting more than he had he wanted the best for you tydingss smile spread again i remember the day you were born katie how he stood there looking at you through the glass and making all these big plans for you he wanted to give you everything and it was hard for him to always settle for less she hadnt needed everything kate thought later when she sat alone at the table she had only needed parents who loved her and loved each other now she would have to live knowing that what her father had loved most was his own ambition something wrong with your lunch she glanced over and the hand she had pressed protectively against her stomach fisted as byron slid into the chair that tydings had vacated are you on dining room detail i thought the brass stayed up in the lofty regions of the penthouse oh we mingle with the lower floors occasionally he signaled to a waitress hed been watching kate for ten minutes she had sat completely still staring out of the window her meal untouched her eyes dark and miserable the chicken bisque he ordered two i dont want anything i hate to eat alone he said smoothly as the waitress cleared the dishes you can always play with it like you did your salad if youre not feeling well the bisque should perk you up im fine i had a business lunch under the table she pleated her napkin in her lap she wasnt ready to get up wasnt sure her legs were strong enough who eats at business lunches everyone leaning forward he poured two glasses of mineral water you look unhappy i have a client with an imbalance of passive income that always makes me unhappy what do you want de witt a bowl of soup a little conversation you know i developed this hobby of conversation as a child ive never been able to break it thank you lorna he said when the waitress set a basket of warm rolls between them ive noticed that you often have a bit of trouble in that area id be happy to help you as im sort of a buff i dont like small talk there you are i do he held out a roll hed broken apart and buttered in fact im interested in all manner of talk large small meaningless profound why dont we start this particular session with me telling you that ive got an appointment to view that house you recommended good for you since the bread was in her hand now she nibbled the realtor speaks highly of you when kate only grunted then scowled down at the bowl of soup that was slipped under her nose byron smothered a grin damned if she wasnt too much of a challenge to resist i may just solicit your services myself as ill be staying in monterey hardly practical to keep my accountant back in georgia its not necessary to have an accountant in the same location if youre satisfied with his or her work theres no need to change thats the way to drum up business kid i also have a habit of eating he continued if you need help along those lines i can tell you that you start by dipping your spoon into the soup im not hungry think of it as medicine it might put some color back in your cheeks you not only look unhappy kate you look tired beaten down and closing in on ill hoping it would shut him up she spooned up some soup boy now im all perked up its a miracle when he only smiled at her she sighed why did he have to sit there acting so damn nice and making her feel like sludge im sorry im lousy company was your business meeting difficult yes as a matter of fact because it was soothing she sampled the bisque again ill deal with it why dont you tell me what you do when youre not dealing with difficult business problems the headache at the edges of her consciousness wasnt backing off but it wasnt creeping closer i deal with simple business problems and when youre not dealing with business she studied him narrowly the mild polite eyes the easy smile you are coming on to me no im considering coming on to you which is entirely different thats why were having a basic conversation over a bowl of soup his smile widened flirted it also gives you equal opportunity to consider whether or not youd like to come on to me her lips twitched before she could stop them i do appreciate a man who believes in gender equality she also had to appreciate that for a few minutes hed taken her mind off her troubles that he knew it yet didnt push the point i think im beginning to like you kate you are i believe an acquired taste and ive always enjoyed odd flavors thats quite a statement my hearts going pittypat he laughed a quick fullthroated masculine sound that appealed however much she would have preferred otherwise yeah its definite i like you why dont we expand this conversation thing over a full meal say dinner tonight she was tempted to agree for the simple reason that being around him made her think about something other than herself but she set her napkin beside her bowl she thought it would be best to err on the side of caution with a man like byron de witt i dont want to form habits too quickly i have to get back to the office she rose amused when he automatically got to his feet gender equality or not she decided he was southern gentleman through and through thanks for the soup youre welcome he took her hand held it lightly and enjoyed the faint line that popped up between her brows thanks for the conversation we will have to do it again hmm was her best response as she slid the strap of her briefcase over her shoulder and walked away he watched her go and wondered what problem business or otherwise had made her look so devastated and so alone the rumor mill was working overtime at bittle and associates every tiny underripe fruit plucked from the grapevine was chewed lavishly at the water cooler the copy room the storage closet larry bittle and his sons lawrence junior and martin just call me marty continued their closeddoor meetings with the other partners every morning copies of accounts were delivered to the group by bittle seniors tightlipped sharpeyed executive assistant regularly if she knew anything went the wisdom of the water cooler she wasnt saying theyre working their way through every account roger told kate hed hunted her down in the stockroom when she went to replenish her supply of computer paper marcie in accounts receivable said theyre even going over internal ledgers and beth the dragon ladys assistant says theyve been on the hot line with the lawyers lips pursed kate grabbed a handful of ticonderoga number s are all your sources female he grinned no but mike in the mail room is coming up dry whats your take gotta figure internal audit yeah thats mine but heres the question kate why in truth that very question had been on her mind for days she considered smart ambitious ruthless people had the best gossip since roger fit all the requirements she decided to share her thoughts in hopes of priming his pump okay weve had a couple of really good years in the past five weve increased our client base by fifteen percent bittles growing so im thinking expansion maybe a new branch theyd put lawrence in charge add more associates and give some of us the option of relocating a big step like that would take a lot of thought and planning and the partners would want to focus hard on the bottom line could be theres been noises before about opening in the la area snagging more media accounts but ive been hearing other grumblings too he leaned closer lowered his voice and his eyes were bright with excitement larrys been thinking about passing the torch retiring why would he kate whispered in response they sounded like conspirators hes only sixty sixtytwo roger glanced over his shoulder and you know how his wife likes those cruises shes always bugging him to take one to europe around the med that sort of thing how do you know that beth assistant to the assistant she got brochures for the old man the bittles fortieth anniversary is coming up this year if he retires early theres going to be a partnership slot up for grabs a new partner it made sense perfect sense all the meetings the account checks the current partners would have to weigh and judge debate and discuss who would be most qualified to move up she barely stopped herself from dancing a jig she had to remember who it was she was talking to roger was her toughest competitor maybe she shrugged though inside glee was spreading like a lovely pink balloon but i dont see larry sailing off into the sunset yet no matter how much his wife nags him well see roger kept a sly smile on his face but somethings going to happen and its going to happen soon kate walked sedately back to her office closed the door put her supplies neatly away then she danced her jig she didnt want to get ahead of herself didnt want to start projecting the hell she didnt dropping into her chair she spun herself around once twice and a giddy third time she had an mba from harvard had graduated in the top ten percent of her class in the five years shed worked for bittle she had brought in twelve new accounts through client recommendations and had lost only one to that jerk roger but even that hadnt gone out of house she personally generated over two hundred thousand a year in billing so did roger she admitted she kept an eye on him but when marty had awarded her a raise last year hed told her she was considered the cream of bittles associates larry bittle called her by her first name and his wife and daughtersinlaw had been known to drop by pretenses to shop a partnership at twentyeight she would be the youngest partner ever at bittle she would have exceeded by years her own rigid expectations of herself and wouldnt it in some way erase this taint she felt this secret she had buried inside if she was a success it would overshadow all the rest she allowed herself to dream about it the new office the new salary the new prestige she would be consulted on policy her opinion would be weighed and respected giggling she leaned back in the chair and spun again she would have a private secretary she would have everything shed ever wanted kate imagined picking up the phone calling the templetons in cannes theyd be so happy for her so proud of her finally she would be able to believe that everything theyd done for her was deserved shed have a celebration with margo and laura oh that would be sweet at long last kate powell had come into her own had done something important and solid years and years of work and study of aching shoulders tired eyes and a burning stomach would have paid off all she had to do was wait forcing herself to push the dream to the back of her mind she swiveled to her computer and got to work she hummed as she ran figures calculated expenditures logged tax deductions clucked over capital gains and figured depreciation as usual she tuned in to the work and lost track of time kate came up blinking when the beep from her watch told her it was five oclock another fifteen minutes to close the file she decided then glanced up in mild annoyance at the knock on her door yes ms powell lucinda newman or the dragon lady as she was unaffectionately called among the rank and file stood imposingly in the doorway youre wanted in the main conference room oh kates heart gave a wild joyful leap but she kept her face composed thanks ms newman ill be right there well aware that her hands were trembling with anticipation kate pressed them together in her lap she had to be cool and professional bittle wasnt going to offer a partnership to a giddy giggling woman she had to be what she always was what they expected her to be practical levelheaded and oh she was going to savor the moment remember every detail later when she was out of sight and earshot she would scream all the way to templeton house kate rolled down her sleeves shrugged into her jacket and smoothed it into place she hesitated over taking her briefcase then decided it only made her look more dedicated to the job with measured steps she took the stairs to the next floor walked past the partners offices toward the executive conference room no one who chanced to see her in the quiet corridor would have realized her feet werent touching the tasteful tan carpet she thumbed an antacid out of the roll in her pocket knowing it would do little to calm her jittery stomach she wondered if a bride on her wedding night could feel any more nervous and thrilled than she did as she raised a hand to knock politely on the thick paneled door come in she lifted her chin put a polite smile on her face as she turned the knob they were all there and her heart gave another skipping leap all the partners the five powers of the firm were seated around the long glossy table large tumblers of water stood by each place she skimmed her gaze over each of them wanting to remember this moment fusty calvin meyers with his usual suspenders and red bow tie elegant and terrifying amanda devin looking stern and beautiful marty of course sweet and homely and rumpled lawrence junior steady balding and cool and of course the senior bittle she had always thought he looked like spencer tracy that livedin face the sweep of white hair the stocky powerful little body her pulse bumped aware that all eyes were on her you wanted to see me sit down kate from his seat at the head of the table bittle gestured to one at the foot yes sir he cleared his throat as she took her chair settled we thought it best to meet at the end of the workday youre aware im sure that weve been involved for the past several days in a check of our accounts yes sir she smiled speculations been racing down the corridors when he didnt smile back she felt a nervous tickle at the back of her throat its hard not to get on the rumor train sir yes he let out a breath folded his hands a discrepancy in an income tax payment came to mr bittle juniors attention last week a discrepancy her gaze shifted to lawrence in the sunstream account he clarified thats one of mine the nervous tickle at the back of her throat changed to a nervous dread in her stomach had she made some sort of stupid error in the chaos of the tax crunch what kind of discrepancy the clients copy of the tax form indicates a federal payment due of seven thousand six hundred and fortyeight dollars lawrence opened a file took out a thick stack of papers is this your work ms powell he was the only bittle who called her ms powell everyone in the firm was accustomed to his formality but it was the clipped manner of his speech that put her on alert carefully she took out her glasses and slipped them on as the papers were passed down to her yes she said after a quick glance its my account i did the tax work this is my signature and as with several of our clients the firm cuts the checks for tax payments for this one some prefer it she dropped her hands into her lap it distances them a bit from the sting and its more convenient convenient amanda commented and drew kates eye for whom this was trouble was all kate could think but from what and where many clients prefer to come into the office discuss the tax situation and the results argue and vent they all knew this she thought scanning the table again why did she have to explain the client will sign the necessary forms and the account exec will issue the check out of escrow ms powell lawrence took another stack of papers from his file can you explain this as smoothly as possible kate wiped her damp palms on her skirt then studied the forms passed to her her mind went momentarily blank she blinked focused swallowed hard im not sure i understand this is another copy of the filed for sunstream but the tax due amount is different twentytwo hundred dollars less amanda pointed out this is the form and the payment made on april fifteenth of this year to the irs the check drawn out of escrow was for this amount i dont understand when or how the other copy was generated kate began all work sheets are filed of course but any excess forms are shredded kate bittle drew her attention with one quiet word the excess money was transferred via computer out of the clients escrow account in cash in cash she repeated blank since this came to our attention we initiated a check on all accounts bittles face was grave as he watched her since late march of this year amounts that total seventyfive thousand dollars have been withdrawn from escrow accounts seventyfive thousand in excess of tax payments computer withdrawals in cash from your accounts from my clients she felt the blood drain out of her face couldnt stop it its the same pattern calvin meyers spoke for the first time tugging on his bright red tie two copies of the s small adjustments on various forms to total excess on the clients copy in amounts ranging from twelve hundred to thirtyone hundred dollars he puffed out his cheeks we might not have caught it but i golf with sid sun hes a whiner about taxes and kept after me to look over his form and be certain there was nothing else he could use to cut his payment embezzlement were they accusing her of embezzlement was this some awful nightmare they knew about her father and thought no no that was impossible while her hand flexed nervously in her lap she kept her voice even you examined one of my accounts calvin lifted an eyebrow the last thing hed expected from steadyasshegoes kate powell was blankeyed panic i did so to get him off my back and in examining his copy i found several small errors i thought it best to look further and pulled out our file copy of his latest return she couldnt feel anything even her fingertips had gone numb you think i stole seventyfive thousand dollars from my clients from this firm kate if you could just explain how you think this might have happened marty began were all here to listen no her father had stolen from clients her father not her how could you think it her voice shook shamed her we havent come to any firm conclusion amanda countered the facts the numbers however are here in black and white black and white she thought as the print blurred as it overlapped with visions of newspaper articles from twenty years past no i she had to lift a hand rub her eyes to clear them its not i didnt amanda tapped one scarlet nail on the tabletop shed expected outrage had counted on the outrage of the innocent instead what she saw was the trembling of the guilty if marty hadnt gone to bat for you if he hadnt insisted we search for some rational explanation even incompetence on your part we would have had this meeting days ago amanda bittle said quietly but she shook her head larry this is embezzlement and over and above the legal ramifications client trust and confidence have to be considered we need to clear this matter up quickly ive never taken a penny not a penny from any client though terrified that her legs would buckle kate shot to her feet she would not be sick she told herself though her stomach was heaving into her throat i couldnt it seemed to be all she could say i couldnt lawrence frowned at his hands ms powell money is easily hidden laundered spent youve assisted a number of clients in investments accounts in the caymans in switzerland investments bad investments she pressed a hand to her throbbing temple no that had been her father thats my job i do my job you recently opened a business calvin pointed out im a onethird partner in a secondhand boutique grief and fear and nausea swirled inside her made her hands shake she had to be coherent she ordered herself shaking and weeping only made her look guilty it took almost all my savings to do it she drew in a breath that burned stared straight into bittles eyes mr bittle but her voice broke and she had to begin again mr bittle ive worked for you for five years you hired me a week out of graduate school ive never given this firm anything but my complete loyalty and dedication and ive never given a client anything but my best im not a thief i find it difficult to believe you are kate ive known you since you were a child and always considered my decision to hire you one of my best judgment calls i know your family he paused waiting for her to rebound to express her fury at being used to demand to assist the firm in finding the answers when she did nothing but stare blindly he had no choice however he said slowly this matter cant be ignored well continue to investigate internally for now it may become necessary to go outside the firm with this to the police the thought of it dissolved her legs so that she had to brace herself with a hand on the table her vision grayed and wavered youre going to the police if it becomes necessary bittle told her we hope to resolve the matter quietly bittle and associates is responsible at this point for adjusting the escrow accounts bittle studied the woman standing at the end of the table shook his head the partners have agreed that it is in the firms best interest for you to take a leave of absence until this is cleared up youre suspending me because you think im a thief kate we need to look into this carefully and we have to do whatever is in the best interest of our clients a suspected embezzler cant handle accounts the tears were going to come but not yet she could hold them back just a little longer youre firing me a leave of absence bittle repeated its the same thing accusations disgrace you dont believe me you think ive stolen from my own clients and you want me out of the office he saw no other choice at this time yes any personal items in your office will be sent to you im sorry kate marty will escort you out of the building she let out a shuddering breath i havent done anything but my best picking up her briefcase she turned stiffly and walked to the door im sorry christ kate with his lumbering stride marty caught up with her what a mess what a disaster he started huffing when she took the stairs down to the main level i couldnt turn them around she stopped ignoring the pain in her stomach the throbbing in her head do you believe me marty do you believe me she saw the flicker of doubt in his earnest myopic eyes before he answered i know theres an explanation he touched her gently on the shoulder its all right she made herself push through the glass doors on the lobby level walk outside kate if theres anything i can do for you any way i can help he trailed off lamely standing by the door as she all but ran to her car nothing she said to herself theres just nothing at the last minute she stopped herself from running to templeton house to laura to annie to anyone who would fold her in comforting arms and take her side she swung her car to the side of the road rather than up the steep winding drive she got out and walked to the cliffs she could stand alone she promised herself she had had shocks survived tragedies before shed lost her parents and there was nothing more devastating than that there had been boys shed dreamed over in high school who had never dreamed back shed gotten over it her first lover in college had grown bored with her broken her heart and moved on she hadnt crumbled once years before she had fantasized about finding seraphinas dowry all alone of bearing it proudly home to her aunt and uncle she had learned to live without that triumph she was afraid she was so afraid like father like daughter oh dear god would it come out now would it all come out and how much more damning then what would this do to the people who loved her who had had such hopes for her what was it people said blood will tell had she done something made some ridiculous mistake christ how could she think clearly now when her life had been turned upside down and shattered at her feet she had to wrap her arms tight around her body against the spring breeze which now seemed frigid shed committed no crime she reminded herself shed done nothing wrong all shed done was lose a job just a job it had nothing to do with the past nothing to do with blood nothing to do with where she had come from with a whimper she eased down onto a rock who was she trying to fool somehow it had to do with everything how could it not shed lost what she had taught herself to value most next to family success and reputation now she was exactly what shed always been afraid she was a failure how could she face them any of them with the fact that shed been fired was under suspicion of embezzling that she had as she always advised her clients not to put all of her eggs in one basket only to see it smashed but she would have to face them she had to tell her family before someone else did oh and someone would it wouldnt take long she didnt have the luxury of digging a hole and hiding in it everything she was and did was attached to the templetons what would her aunt and uncle think they would have to see the parallel if they doubted her she could stand anything anything at all except their doubt and disappointment she reached in her pocket chewed viciously on a tums and wished for a bottle of aspirin or some of the handy tranqs margo had once used to think shed once been so disdainful of those little crutches to think she had once considered seraphina a fool and a coward for choosing to leap rather than stay and face her loss she looked out to sea then rose and walked closer to the edge the rocks below were mean that was what shed always liked best about them those jagged unforgiving spears standing up defiantly to the constant violent crash of water she had to be like the rocks now she thought she had to stand and face whatever happened next her father hadnt been strong he hadnt stood he hadnt faced it and now in some twisted way she was paying the price byron studied her from the side of the road hed seen her car whiz past as he was leaving joshs house he wasnt sure what impulse had pushed him to follow her still wasnt sure what was making him stay there was something about the way she looked standing there at the edge of the cliff so alone it made him nervous and a little annoyed that vulnerability again he supposed a quiet neediness that called to his protective side he wouldnt have pegged her as the type to walk the cliffs or stare out to sea he nearly got back into his car and drove off but he shrugged and decided that since he was here hed might as well enjoy the view hell of a spot he said as he walked up to her it gave him perverse pleasure to see her jolt i was enjoying it she muttered and kept her back to him plenty of view for two to enjoy i saw your car and when he got a look at her he saw that her eyes were damp hed always been compelled to dry a womans tears bad day he murmured and offered her a handkerchief its just windy not that windy i wish youd go away ordinarily i try to comply with womens requests since im not going to in your case why dont you sit down tell me about it he took her arm thinking the tension in it was edgy enough to cut glass think of me as a priest he suggested dragging her with him i wanted to be one once to use some clever phrasing bullshit no really he pulled her down on a rock with him i was eleven then puberty hit and the rest is history she tried and failed to tug free and rise did it ever occur to you that i dont want to talk to you that i want to be alone to soothe because her voice was catching helplessly he stroked a hand over her hair it crossed my mind but i rejected it people who feel sorry for themselves always want to talk about it that next to sex was the main reason i decided against the seminary and dancing priests dont get lots of opportunity to dance with pretty women which i suppose is the same thing as sex well enough about me he put a determined hand under her chin and lifted it she was pale those long spiky lashes were wet and those deep does eyes damp but your eyes arent red enough for you to have had a good cry yet im not a sniveler listen kid my sister highly recommends a good cry and shed deck you for calling her a sniveler gently he rubbed his thumb over kates chin screamings good too and throwing breakables there was a lot of that in my house theres no point venting he interrupted smoothly purging there arent any breakables around here but you could let out a good scream emotions welling up inside her threatened to choke her furiously she jerked her face free of his hand i dont need you or anyone to charm me out of a mood i can handle my own problems just fine if i need a friend all i have to do is go up to the house up to the house she repeated as her gaze focused on the towering structure of stone and wood and glass that held everything precious to her covering her face with her hands she broke thats a girl he murmured relieved by the natural flow of tears come here now he drew her close stroking her hair her back get it all out she couldnt stop it didnt matter who he was his arms were strong his voice understanding with her face buried against his chest she sobbed out the frustration the grief the fear let herself for one liberating moment be coddled he rested his cheek on her hair held her lightly lightly because she seemed so small so fragile a good grip might shatter those thin bones tears soaked through his shirt cooled from hot to cold on his skin im sorry damn it she would have pulled away but he continued to hold her humiliated she squeezed her aching eyes shut i never would have done that if youd left me alone youre better off this way its not healthy to hold everything in automatically he kissed the top of her head before easing her back to study her face why it should have charmed him wet blotchy streaked with mascara as it was he couldnt have said but he had a terrible urge to shift her onto his lap to kiss that soft sad mouth to stroke her again not quite so consolingly bad move he cautioned himself and wondered how any man faced with such sexy distress could think like a priest not that you look better he took the handkerchief shed balled up in her fist and mopped at her face but you should feel better enough to tell me why youre so upset it has nothing to do with you so what she could feel another sob bubbling in her chest and blurted out the words before it could escape i got fired he continued calmly cleaning and drying her face why they think her voice hitched they think i take a breath he advised and say it fast they think i stole money out of client escrow embezzled seventyfive thousand watching her face he stuck the ruined linen back in his pocket why because because there are duplicate s and money missing and theyre my clients and my father my father but she couldnt say that not out loud in fits and starts she babbled out the gist of her meeting with the partners a great deal of it was incoherent details crisscrossing and overlapping but he continued to nod and listen i didnt take any money she let out a long unsteady breath i dont expect you to believe me but of course i believe you it was her turn to gather her wits why leaning back a little he took out a cigar shielding the flame on his lighter with a cupped hand in my line of work you get a handle on people quickly youve been around the hotel business most of your life you know how it is there are plenty of times with a guest or staff that you have to make a snap judgment youd better be accurate puffing out smoke he studied her my take on you katherine in the first five minutes was well among other things that youre the type of woman who would choke on her integrity before she loosened it to breathe her breath came out shaky but some of the panic eased i appreciate it i think id have to say you worked for a bunch of shortsighted idiots she sniffled theyre accountants there you go he smiled ran a finger down her cheek when she glared a flash there in those big brown eyes thats better so are you going to take it lying down rising she straightened her shoulders i cant think about how or what i can take now i only know i wouldnt work at bittle again if they came crawling on their hands and knees through broken glass thats not what i meant i meant someones embezzling and pointing the finger at you what are you going to do about it i dont care you dont care he shook his head i find that hard to believe the katherine powell ive seen is a scrapper i said i dont care and her voice hitched again if she fought looked too close demanded too much they might uncover what her father had done then it would be worse theres nothing i can do youve got a brain he corrected it doesnt feel like it at the moment she put a hand to her head everything inside was mushy and aching they cant do anything else to me because i dont have the money and theyd never be able to prove i do as far as im concerned right now finding whos skimming is bittles problem i just want to be left alone surprised at her he stood up id want their ass right now i just want to be able to get through the next few hours i have to tell my family she closed her eyes earlier today i actually thought hoped that i was going to be called in and offered a partnership signs indicated she said bitterly i couldnt wait to tell them brag but he said it gently with hardly any sting i suppose look at what i did be proud of me because well thats done now i have to tell them that i lost it all that the prospects of getting another position or finessing any clients are nil for the foreseeable future theyre family he stepped toward her and laid his hands on her shoulders families stand by each other i know that for a moment she wanted to take his hand he had such big competent hands she wanted to take it and press it to her cheek instead she stepped back turned away that makes it worse i cant begin to tell you how much worse now im feeling sorry for myself all over again it comes and goes kate well aware that they were doing a little dance and dodge of physical contact he draped an arm around her shoulders do you want me to go up with you no she was appalled because for an instant shed wanted to say yes to lean her head against that broad shoulder close her eyes and let him lead no i have to do it she slipped away from him again but faced him this was awfully nice of you really nice he smiled his dimples deepening that wouldnt have been insulting if you hadnt sounded quite so surprised i didnt mean to be insulting she managed a smile of her own i meant to be grateful i am grateful father de witt testing he lifted a hand skimmed his fingers through her short cap of hair i decided i dont want you to think of me as a priest after all his hand slid down the back of her neck its that sex thing again she felt it herself inconvenient little hormonal tugs hmm it seemed as good a response as any and certainly safe id better go get this done eyes warily on his she backed up ill see you around apparently you will he stepped forward she backed up again what are you doing amused at both of them he raised his eyebrows going to my car im parked behind you oh well as casually as possible she turned and walked to the car as he fell into step beside her i ah have you seen the house yet the one on seventeen mile i have an appointment to view it tonight as it happens good thats good she jangled her keys in her pocket before pulling them out well i hope you like it ill let you know he closed a hand over hers on the door handle when her gaze flew suspiciously to his he smiled my daddy taught me to open doors for ladies consider it a southern thing she shrugged slid into the car well bye ill be in touch she wanted to ask what that was supposed to mean but he was already walking toward his own car besides she had a pretty good idea chapter five contents prev next its outrageous its insulting in a rare show of temper laura stormed around the solarium thirty minutes before kate had interrupted homework time and laura had shifted from solving the mysteries of punctuation and multiplication tables with her daughters to the shock of hearing kates story watching her friend kate was glad shed had the presence of mind to ask to speak to laura privately the flash in the gray eyes the angry flush staining those cool ivory cheeks and the wild gestures might have frightened the children i dont want you to be upset kate began you dont want me to be upset laura rounded on her the curling swing of chinlength bronze hair flying the soft pretty mouth pulled back into a snarl then what exactly should i be when my sister gets plugged between the eyes oh yeah kate thought this definitely would have given the girls a jolt if she hadnt been so miserable she would have laughed laura the cool had metamorphosed into laura the enraged despite being five two she looked capable of going ten rounds with the champ dont want me to be upset laura repeated her small almost fairylike frame revving high as she stalked around the lush glasswalled room well im not upset im past upset and heading beyond pissed how dare they how dare those pinheaded idiots think for one minute for one instant that youd steal money she slapped at the swaying fronds of a potted palm when i think how many times the bittles have been guests in this house it makes my blood boil treating you like a common criminal escorting you out of the building im surprised they didnt bring out the cuffs and the swat team sun pouring through the glass walls glinted fiercely in her eyes bastards idiot bastards she pounced all five feet two inches of raging fury on the slim white phone beside the padded chaise were calling josh were suing them hold it no hold it laura torn between tears and laughter kate slapped a hand over her friends for the life of her kate couldnt remember why shed hesitated to come here to templeton house this was exactly what shed needed to snap her back i cant tell you how much i appreciate the tirade but you havent begun to see a tirade ive got nothing to sue them about the evidence i dont give a fuck about evidence at kates bubble of laughter her eyes narrowed just what the hell are you laughing at ill never get used to hearing you say fuck its just not natural but she swallowed because the laugh had come perilously close to hysteria and seeing you storm around this elegant room with all the hibiscus and ferns is quite a show she caught her breath i didnt come here to send you on a rampage though its doing wonders for my bruised ego this isnt about ego laura struggled to get a grip on her temper she lost it rarely because it was a powerful thing a dangerous thing its about defamation of character loss of income were not going to let them get away with this kate weve got a lawyer in the family and were going to use him there was no use in pointing out that josh wasnt a litigator she certainly wouldnt have told laura that the very thought of pursuing the matter particularly through the legal system had her feeling nauseated again instead she struggled to keep it light maybe we could have him tack on loss of consortium just for kicks i always liked that one how can you joke because youve made me feel so much better suddenly she felt like crying again and hugged laura tight instead i knew in my heart youd stand behind me but in my head in my gut i was just so shattered oh god she eased away to press a hand to her stomach im going to start again oh kate oh honey im so sorry gently now laura slipped a hand around her waist lets sit down well get some tea some wine some chocolate and figure this out kate sniffed back the tears nodded teas good alcohol hasnt been agreeing with me lately she managed a smile chocolate never fails okay just sit right here normally she would have gone to the kitchen herself but she didnt want to leave kate alone instead she crossed the glossy fieldstone floor to the intercom by the doorway the system peter had insisted they install to summon the servants after a few murmured instructions she came back to kate and sat down i feel so useless kate said so stripped i dont think i appreciated really how margo must have felt last year when she had the rug pulled out from under her you were there for her just like margo and i and everyone will be here for you anyone who knows you wont believe you did anything wrong even one who doesnt she murmured thinking of byron still plenty will believe it its going to get out i can promise you that im used to defending myself she continued skinny girls with more brains than charm tend to hide through high school or fight through it and you always fought im out of practice she closed her eyes and leaned back the room smelled like a garden she thought peaceful calm she badly needed to find calm again i dont know what im going to do laura its probably the first time in my life i dont have a plan she opened her eyes again met the concern in lauras i know its going to sound foolish but everything i am and wanted to be was tied up in my career i was good at it more than good i needed to be i chose bittle because it was an old established firm there was plenty of room and opportunity for advancement because it was close to home i liked the people there and i dont like that many people i felt comfortable and appreciated youd feel comfortable and appreciated at templeton laura said quietly and took her hand you know theres no question that you could have a position there tomorrow mom and dad wanted you in the organization with a taint on her she thought that stretched back a generation no that she would not ask theyve done enough for me kate thats ridiculous not to me i cant go crawling to them now id hate myself it was the only thing she felt capable of standing firm on maybe it was pride but it was all she had left its going to be hard enough to call them and tell them about this you know exactly what their reaction will be but ill do it if you like would they remember kate wondered just for an instant remember and doubt that she had to face as well alone no ill call them in the morning she ran a hand over her slim navy skirt and tried to be practical ive got a little time to weigh my options money isnt an immediate problem ive got some set aside and theres the income meager though it is from the shop her hand jerked oh god oh my god is this going to affect the shop of course not dont worry dont worry kate sprang up her stomach began doing flipflops again pretenses third partner suspected of embezzlement cpa skimming client accounts former templeton ward under investigation she squeezed her eyes shut terrified of what that investigation might uncover blood will tell think of now she ordered herself one step at a time jesus laura it never occurred to me until this second i could ruin it a lot of my clients shop there just stop it youre innocent i wouldnt be surprised if a great many of your clients dismiss this whole business as nonsense people have a funny attitude about their money laura and about the people they hire to handle it for them that may be but youre going to start handling mine dont even think about arguing laura said before kate could open her mouth i dont have a lot to work with since peter scalped me in the divorce but i expect you to fix that and its about time you started pulling your weight at the shop margo and i are adequate bookkeepers but thats a matter of opinion pleased laura cocked a brow well then youd better get busy protecting our investment you were too busy before but now youve got time on your hands so it seems and by putting in some time behind the counter as well you can take some of the pressure off margo and me kates mouth fell open you expect me to clerk regularly damn it laura im not a saleswoman neither was margo laura said placidly and neither was i circumstances change bend or break kate she wanted to remind laura that she had an mba from harvard shed graduated with honors a full year early shed been within a breath of a partnership at one of the most respected firms in the area had handled millions of dollars a year in accounts she closed her mouth again because none of it was worth a damn at the moment i dont know an armani from anything youll learn it was selfindulgent but she pouted anyway i dont even like jewelry the customers do i dont understand why people need to clutter up their house with dust catchers laura smiled if kate was arguing she thought she was coming around thats easy to keep us in business good point kate conceded i havent done too badly the few saturdays ive been able to help out its just dealing with people day after day youll learn to live with it we really need you on the books we didnt push it before because we didnt want to pressure you actually margo did but i talked her out of it one of the many wounds shed been planning to lick healed over really no offense kate but weve been open about ten months margo and i decided after about ten days that we really hate accounting we hate spreadsheets we hate percentages we hate figuring the sales tax we have to send off every month laura let out a sigh lowered her voice i shouldnt tell you she asked me not to but what well margo we didnt think we could add to our overhead with a fulltime bookkeeper not yet anyway so margos been looking into taking classes classes kate blinked accounting classes margo jesus christ and business management and computers laura winced now with the baby coming along it seems like a lot to handle im fairly computerliterate she added hoping to press her point i have to be working conventions and special events at the hotel but retails a different matter entirely knowing the value of timing she waited a beat let it sink in i just dont see how i could squeeze any classes in myself between working at templeton the shop the girls of course not you should have told me you were having that rough a time id have picked up the ball youve been crosseyed with work for six months it didnt seem fair fair hell its business ill come in first thing in the morning and take a good look at the books laura managed to keep her smile pleasant rather than smug as ann sullivan wheeled in a tea cart the girls have finished their homework ann began i brought extra cups and plates so they could join you i thought you might enjoy a little tea party thank you annie miss kate its good to see her smile of greeting faded the minute she looked into kates swollen redrimmed eyes whats the matter darling oh annie kate caught the hand ann had lifted to her cheek soothed herself with it my lifes a mess ill get the girls laura said rising and another cup she added nodding at ann well have our tea party and work on straightening it out because kate had always been the awkward one and the feisty one she held a special place in anns heart after pouring two cups selecting two chocolatefrosted cakes ann sat down and draped an arm around kates shoulder now you drink your tea and eat some sweets and tell annie all about it sighing kate burrowed dorothy from kansas was right she decided there really was no place like home i dont like the way she keeps talking about software behind the counter of pretenses margo muttered into lauras ear the only software i want to know about is cashmere we dont have to know laura muttered right back because she knows think about all the sunday evenings we sweated over the books right but margo pouted actually i thought i was getting pretty good at it the way she talks its like i was braindead want to go into the back room and help her out no that was definite margo scanned a browsing customer calculated nine more seconds before the next subtle sales pitch but i dont like the way shes taking this whole mess no way our kate walks away from a fight shes hurt shaken though laura was worried over it herself this is just recovery time it better be im not going to be able to hold josh back from storming into bittle much longer a martial light glowed in her mediterranean blue eyes im not going to be able to hold myself back for that matter creeps jerks she continued to mutter as she approached the customer but her face underwent a metamorphosis easy sophisticated beauty thats a gorgeous lamp isnt it it belonged to christie brinkley margo trailed a finger down the motherofpearl shade confidentially it was a gift from billy and she didnt want to keep it around any longer truth or fiction laura wondered muffling a laugh the ownership was fact but the little sidebar was probably fantasy laura with the longsuffering look shed worn after the first hour with the books kate stepped out of the back office do you realize how much money youre wasting by shortordering boxes the more you order at a time the less each costs the way we go through them ah yes youre right out of defense and necessity laura looked at her watch oops piano lessons gotta go youre buying tape at the dime store rather than through a wholesaler kate added dogging laura to the door i should be shot bye and she escaped her foot tapping kate turned with the intent of nagging margo but her partner was busy fussing with a customer over some silly little lamp that didnt look as if it could light a closet much less a room it helped to nag it felt good to take charge even if it was over boxes and tape miss oh miss another woman came out of the wardrobe room carrying a pair of white spangled pumps do you have these in an eight narrow kate looked at the shoes looked at the woman and wondered why anyone would want a pair of shoes covered with iridescent sequins everythings out thats in stock but these are too small she all but wailed it thrusting the shoes at kate theyre perfect with the dress ive chosen i have to have them look kate began then ground her teeth together as margo caught her eye with a fiery warning look she remembered the routine margo had drummed into her head hated it but remembered pretenses is almost exclusively one of a kind but im sure we can find something that works for you already missing her computer she guided the customer back into the wardrobe room it took a great deal of control not to yelp shoes were tumbled everywhere rather than neatly arranged on the shelves half a dozen cocktail dresses were tossed haphazardly over a chair others had slipped to the neat little aubusson been busy havent we kate said with a frozen smile the woman let out a trill of laughter that cut right through the top of kates skull oh im just in love with everything but im very decisive once ive made up my mind that was a statement for the books okay which dress have you become decisive about it took twenty minutes twenty hemming and hawing oohing and ahing minutes before the customer settled on a pair of white slingbacks with satin bows kate struggled to arrange the yards of white tulle in the skirt of the dress the woman couldnt live without tulle kate thought as she finally zipped it into a bag that would certainly make the woman resemble an oversized wedding cake her work complete kate handed over dress shoes and sales receipt and even managed a smile thanks so much for shopping at pretenses oh i love it here i just have to see these earrings earrings kates heart sank these i think theyd be wonderful with the dress dont you could you just take it out of the bag again so i could see you want me to take the dress out of the bag with a fierce smile kate leaned over the counter why dont you oh the austrian crystals just make those earrings dont they dashing around the counter margo gave kate a shove that knocked her a full foot sideways i have a bracelet thats just made to go with them kate why dont you take the dress back out while i unlock the case ill take the damn dress back out kate muttered with her back turned but im not putting it in again no one can make me spoiling for a fight she scowled as the door jingled open her scowl only deepened at byrons quick smile hello ladies ill just browse until youre free youre free margo said meaningfully to kate ill finish up here one devil was the same as another kate supposed and walked reluctantly out from behind the counter looking for something mothers day i bought my mothers birthday present in here a couple of months ago and it made me a hero i figured id stick with a winner he reached out skimmed a knuckle along her jaw how are you feeling fine embarrassed at the memory of sobbing in his arms she turned stiffly away did you have anything specific in mind in answer he put a hand on her shoulder turned her around i thought wed parted on semifriendly terms at least we did she reeled herself in there was no point in blaming him though it was more satisfying im just a little wired i nearly punched that customer lifting an eyebrow byron glanced over kates head at the woman currently sighing over a bracelet because she wanted to see earrings kate said between her teeth good god what is the world coming to if you promise not to hit me i swear i wont even look at a pair of earrings in here i may never look at a pair anywhere again she supposed that deserved at least a smile sorry its a long story so what does your mother like earrings sorry he let out a rumbling chuckle hard to resist shes an internist with nerves of steel a wicked temper and a sentimental streak for anything that has to do with her children im thinking hearts and flowers anything that falls into that basic symbolism thats nice she did smile she was a sucker for a man who not only loved his mama but understood her i dont know the stock very well its my first week on the job she looked neat as a pin he mused in her tidy little gray suit with a windsorknotted striped tie the sensible shoes shouldnt have led him to speculate on her legs surprised that that was exactly what he was doing he cleared his throat hows it going she glanced back at margo i think my coworkers are plotting my demise other than that good enough thanks but when he continued to study her she shifted you did come in for a gift right not to check up on me or anything i can do both id rather you the door opened again heralding the entrance of three laughing chattering women kate grabbed byrons arm in a steely grip okay im with you you need my undivided attention ill give you ten percent off if you take up all my time until they leave a real people person arent you katherine im a desperate woman dont screw with me she kept her hand firmly on his arm as she steered him to a corner of the shop your scents different again he commented indulging himself with a sniff close to her hair subtle yet passionate something margo squirted on me when i was distracted she said absently this was her new life she reminded herself the old was gone and she was going to make the best of what she had left she likes us to push the merchandise shed have hung jewelry all over me if i hadnt escaped from her safe distance she glanced back and made a face at her partner look she made me wear this pin he glanced down at the simple gold crescent adorning her lapel its very nice and drew the eye to the soft swell of her breasts simple classic subdued yeah right what do pins do but put holes in your clothes okay back to business it so happens theres this music box that might make you a hero again music box he brought himself back to the business at hand could work i remember it because margo just picked it up at an estate sale in san francisco shed know the circa this and the design that i can tell you its lovely she lifted it a glossy mahogany box large enough for jewelry or love letters on its domed lid was a painting of a young couple in medieval dress a unicorn and a circle of flowers the lid opened to deepblue velvet and the charming strains of fur elise theres a problem he began why her back went up its beautiful its practical its romantic well he rubbed his chin how am i going to take up all your time when youve shown me the perfect gift first thing oh kate glanced over her shoulder again the three fresh customers were in the wardrobe room making a lot of femaleonthehunt noises trying not to feel guilty she looked over at margo who was expertly rebagging the tulle want to buy something else its never too early to shop for christmas he angled his head youve got to learn to gauge your clientele kid heres a man coming in to buy a mothers day gift three days before the mark a gift that he will now have to have shipped overnight to atlanta that type doesnt shop for christmas until sometime after december twentyfirst thats very impractical i like to use up my practicality at work life is different when he smiled at her the creases in his face deepened she liked the look of them caught herself wondering how it would feel to trace her finger along those charming dents surprised at herself she blew out a breath steady girl then maybe you should look at something else to like compare no this is it it intrigued him to see that he was making her uncomfortable and that the discomfort was sexual deliberately he put his hands over hers so that they held the box together why dont i dawdle over the wrapping paper that she decided was definitely a comeon shed have to think about whether or not she liked it later okay thatll work she sent margo a beaming smile as they crossed paths then set the music box carefully on the counter margo closed the door behind her nowsatisfied customer and aimed an automatically flirtatious smile at byron hello byron its wonderful to see you margo he caught her hand brought it to his lips the gesture was as automatic as her smile you look incredible as always she laughed we just dont get enough men in here particularly handsome gallant ones have you found something you like kate saved my life with a mothers day gift did she as kate studiously boxed byrons selection margo leaned over the counter caught kate by her redandbluestriped tie and tugged viciously im going to kill you later excuse me byron i have customers kate kept her hot eyes on margos retreating back see i told you she wants me dead one definition of family is a constant state of adjustment kate lifted a brow from websters from de witts lets try the paper with the little violets margos a remarkable woman ive never known a man who didnt think so no thats wrong she said as she measured wrapping paper lauras exhusband couldnt stand her of course that was because shes the housekeepers daughter and hes a pussfaced snob and i think it was because he wanted her men do and it irritated him intrigued by the brisk way she worked the almost mathematical manner in which she aligned the box and folded corners on the gift wrap he leaned on the counter her hands were really quite lovely he noted narrow competent unadorned how did he feel about you oh he hated me too but that didnt have anything to do with sexual fantasy im the poor relation who has the nerve to say what she thinks when her stomach jittered she glanced up and frowned i dont know why i told you all that could be repressed conversation urges you dont talk to people for long periods then you get caught in a conversation and forget you dont like to talk to people i told you it can be a pleasant hobby i dont like to talk to people she muttered most people you want purple ribbon or white purple you interest me kate wary she looked up again i dont think thats necessary just an observation i assumed you were cold prim rude annoying and selfinvolved im not ordinarily that far wrong with people she jerked the ribbon into a knot snipped off the ends youre not this time either except for the prim no the rude and annoying probably stick but ive been reevaluating the rest she chose a large elaborate bow i dont want an evaluation i didnt ask its another hobby of mine gift card frowning again she found the one to match the paper and slapped it on the counter in front of him we can overnight it im counting on it he handed her his credit card then took out a pen to write on the card oh by the way i made an offer on the house you recommended like the music box its exactly what i was looking for good for you after a brief search she found the shipping form set it down beside the box she suppressed the urge to ask him about it the house what had appealed to him the terms damn conversation if youll fill in the name and address where you want it shipped well have fedex pick it up in the morning shell get it with twentyfour hours to spare and save you a whining phone call his head lifted my mother doesnt whine i was referring to you her smug smile faltered when two more customers came in isnt that handy byron dashed off his mothers name and address were all done just in time for you to help some new customers listen de witt byron no no dont bother to grovel youre on your own he pocketed his card the receipt then tore off his copy of the shipping form himself see you around kid he strolled toward the door the sound of miss could you show me these earrings was music to his soul chapter six contents prev next byron didnt like to interfere with his department heads but he knew and wanted them to know that at templeton problems rose to the top his interest in hotels and all their crosshatched inner workings had begun during a summer stint at atlantas doubletree three months as a bellman had taught him more than the proper way to handle a guests luggage and had earned him more than enough cash to buy his first vintage car hed learned there were dramas and tragedies playing out daily not just behind the closed doors of rooms and suites but behind the front desk in sales and marketing in housekeeping and engineering in fact everywhere within the buzzing hive of a busy hotel it had fascinated him had pushed him toward sampling other aspects from desk clerk to concierge his curiosity about people who they were what they expected what they dreamed of had given him a career he wasnt the doctor his parents had not so secretly hoped he would be nor had he been the travelweary trustfund kid his circumstances could have made him he had a career he enjoyed and the constant variety of life in a big hotel continually intrigued him he was a problem solver one who considered the individual as well as the big picture his choice of moving into the templeton organization had been a simple one hed spent a great deal of time studying hotels the luxurious the opulent the small and tidy the chains with their brisk pace the old europeans with their quiet charm the las vegas ones with their flash and gaudiness templeton had appealed to him because it was familyrun traditional without being stodgy efficient without sacrificing charm and above all personable he didnt have to make it his business to know the names of the people who worked with and under him it was simply a part of his makeup to take an interest to retain information so when he smiled at the woman currently checking in a guest called out a casual good morning linda he wasnt aware that her pulse picked up several beats or that her fingers fumbled on the keyboard as she watched him pass through on his way to the offices another section of the beehive was here ringing phones clicking faxes humming copiers the clack of keyboards he passed stacks of boxes crowded desks he exchanged a few greetings as he went causing several pairs of shoulders to straighten and more than a few female employees to wish theyd checked their lipstick the door to his destination was open and he found laura templeton with a phone to her ear she offered him a harried smile and gestured to a chair im sure we can arrange that mr hubble in catering yes yes i understand how important it is mr hubble she broke off rolled her eyes at byron how many extra chairs would you like ms bingham she listened patiently a small smile playing at the corners of her mouth no of course not and im sure youll have plenty of room if you make use of the terrace no i dont believe its calling for rain it should be a lovely evening and im sure your reception will be elegant mr hubble now she gritted her teeth why dont i talk to mr hubble for you and get back to you yes by noon i will absolutely youre welcome ms bingham she hung up ms bingham is insane is she the orthodontist convention or the interior decorating decorating she has decided at the last minute that she simply must give a reception tonight for sixty of her closest friends and associates for reasons i cant explain she doesnt trust bob hubble to pull it off templeton byron said and smiled at her the trouble is your name is templeton which puts you in a lofty position you wouldnt know it from her office he thought it was tiny cramped and windowless he knew shed chosen the position and the work space herself when she had decided to squeeze out time for a parttime job at the hotel byron didnt know how she managed her family and home the shop the hotel but she seemed to him to be the soul of serenity and quiet efficiency until you looked close enough at the eyes there shadowed in their lakegray depths were doubt and worry and grief remnants he thought of a shattered marriage you didnt have to come down here byron she finished scribbling notes to herself as she spoke i would have made it up to your office this morning its all right problem with the tooth soldiers youd think orthodontists would have a little decorum wouldnt you with a sigh she pulled papers out of a file weve had complaints from both bars but thats nothing i cant handle ive yet to come across anything you cant handle i appreciate that but theres a delicate situation one of the doctors apparently was having a lets say intimate moment with one of the other doctors when her husband decided to pay an unannounced surprise visit god i love this job byron settled back its like a longrunning soap opera easy for you to say i spent an hour this morning dealing with the penitent woman she sat where you are spilling out tears and the whole sordid story of her marriage her affairs her therapy weary with the memory laura pressed her fingers to the inside corner of her eye almost relieving the tension that was living there this is her third husband and she claims to be addicted to adultery she should go on oprah women who are addicted to adultery and the men who love them do you want me to talk to her no i think i sent her off steady enough our problem is the husband wasnt too thrilled to find his wife and his she winced his brotherinlaw wrapped in matching templeton robes it just gets better dont stop now the husband popped his brotherinlaw who i should add for clarification is married to our heroines sister in the mouth knocked out several thousand dollars worth of caps and so forth there was some damage to the room nothing major a couple of lamps and crockery she waved that away but our problem is that the guy with the broken mouth is threatening to sue the hotel another victim if he hadnt been so amused with the scenario he would have sighed whats his rationale that the hotel is responsible for letting the husband in he the husband called room service from a house phone ordered champagne and strawberries for his wifes room he had a dozen roses with him she added then he waited until the wine arrived slipped into the room behind the waiter and well the rest is history i dont think weve got any real problem here but ill take the file i appreciate it relieved laura passed the torch id talk to the man myself but i get the impression hes not too keen on women in authority and to be honest im swamped the orthodontists have their banquet tonight and the cosmetic people are coming in tomorrow and of course ms bingham right she checked her watch and rose id better get down to catering there was one other little thing standing up himself he raised an eyebrow the decorators are wrestling in the atrium not yet because she appreciated him she smiled it was second nature to laura to hide nerves it was an idea i had for the shop but since it involves the hotel i wanted to run it by you laura its your hotel no at the moment i work here and youre the boss she picked up her clipboard and passed it from one of her hands to the other last fall we put on a reception and charity auction at the shop we intend to do it every year but i was thinking we could plan another event straight advertising really a fashion show using clothes and accessories from the shop during the holiday season the white ballroom would be ideal and its not booked for the first saturday in december i thought we could feature gala attire formals ballgowns in addition to accessories all from the shop wed advertise it in both the hotel and the resort with percentageoff certificates issued to templeton employees and guests youve got marketing in the blood listen laura you work conventions and special events he put an arm around her shoulders as they left the office you dont need my goahead i like to dot my is so to speak after ive talked it over with margo and kate ill work up a proposal fine shed given him the opening hed been hoping for so how is kate shes holding up of course she occasionally drives margo and me crazy a born salesman kate isnt laura said with feeling but shes competitive enough to make it work her smile softened spread and if margo or i so much as breathes on the books she hisses so thats a blessing still still they damaged something inside her i dont know how seriously yet but shes too together too controlled she wont talk about it wont even discuss what should be done just closes up when any of us try to draw her out kate used to be a champion tantrum thrower now her fingers fidgeted restlessly tapping a pencil plucking at papers on her clipboard shes taking this without a fight when margos career blew up and she lost her spot as the spokeswoman for bella donna kate wanted to organize a protest she actually talked about going down to la and picketing on rodeo drive remembering put a smile back on lauras face i never told margo because i managed to talk kate out of it but thats the way she is she spits and claws and slaps when shes up against a personal problem but not this time this time shes pulled in and i dont understand it youre really worried about her byron realized yes i am sos margo or she would have strangled kate half a dozen times by now she wants us to fill out a sheet in something called a columnar pad every day once an accountant he said she carries one of those electronic memo pads in her pocket all the time shes starting to talk about colinking and getting online its terrifying when he laughed laura caught herself and shook her head ask a simple question she began does everybody dump on you this way you didnt dump i asked josh said you were the only man he wanted in this job its easy to see why youre so different from peter this time she didnt just catch herself she clenched her teeth no im not getting started on that im already behind schedule and ms binghams waiting thanks for taking the orthodontists off my hands my pleasure you might not hear it very often but youre an asset to templeton im trying to be as she walked away byron turned in the opposite direction studying her careful and precise report as he went at the end of the day he met with josh at templeton resort the office there was a sprawling room on the executive level with windows offering a view of one of the resorts two lagoonlike pools surrounded by hibiscus in riotous bloom and a patio with redwood tables under candypink umbrellas inside it was built for comfort as well as business with deeply cushioned leather chairs deco lamps and a stylish watercolor street scene of milan want a beer at the offer byron merely sighed low and deep he accepted the bottle from josh tipped it back sorry to hit you at the end of the day its the first i could get away there is no end of the day in the hotel business josh said your mother said that byron grinned susan templeton was one of his favorite people you know if your father would just step aside like a gentleman id beg her to marry me he drank again then nodded at the file hed put on joshs desk i started to fax this business over then thought id just swing by personally instead of going behind the desk josh picked up the file and stretched out in the chair opposite byron he skimmed the reports with varying reactions a chuckle a groan a sigh an oath that sums up my feelings byron concurred i had a talk with dr holdermen myself a few hours ago hes still a guest hes got temporary caps on and a real beaut of a black eye my take is he doesnt have a case but hes pissed off enough and embarrassed enough to pursue it josh nodded came to his own conclusions and your recommendation let him agreed josh tossed the file onto his desk ill pass it along to legal with that recommendation now josh settled back the beer bottle cupped loosely in his hand his eyes curious why dont you tell me why youre really here you can handle this kind of nuisance in your sleep byron rubbed his chin we know each other too well ten years on and off should be enough whats on your mind by kate powell joshs brows shot up really not in that context byron said a bit too quickly it was something laura said today that got me thinking about the whole situation bittle made some serious allegations against her yet they havent pursued it and neither has she its going on three weeks now im going to get pissed off again feeling his temper bubbling josh rose and paced it off my father used to play golf with larry bittle i dont know how many times hes been over to the house hes known kate since she was a kid have you talked to him kate almost took my head off when i threatened to scowling josh gulped down his beer that was okay but then she just shut down she seemed so shaky over the whole thing i didnt push hell ive been so wrapped up in margo and the baby i let it slide we did this heartbeat thing at the doctors today it was so cool you could just hear it beating away this quick little bopping he stopped when he caught byrons grin kate he began again thats okay you can indulge in obsessive expectant fatherhood for a minute theres more its not an excuse for letting my sister dangle he sat again with a muscle in his cheek twitching weve decided to settle with ridgeway goddamn bastard cheats on laura scalps her ignores his children alienates half the staff at the hotel and we end up cutting him a check for a quarter million just to avoid a premature termination suit its rough byron agreed but hell be gone he better stay gone you could always break his nose again byron suggested there is that willing himself to relax josh rolled his shoulders you could say ive been a little distracted the last few weeks and kate shes always been so selfreliant you begin to take it for granted lauras worried about her laura worries about everyone but laura josh brooded for a minute i havent been able to get through to kate she wont talk about it at least not to me i hadnt considered going over her head to bittle is that what youre getting at its none of my business the thing is byron studied his beer for a moment then lifted those calm clear eyes to josh hed thought it through as he did any problem and had come to one conclusion if bittle does decide to pursue a case against her wouldnt she be better off to take the offensive now the threat of a nice fat libel suit an unjustified suspension loss of income emotional distress byron smiled and finished off his beer well youre the lawyer it took him the best part of a week but josh was hotly pleased when he strolled into pretenses hed just come from a meeting with the partners of bittle and associates he caught his wife around the waist and kissed her thrillingly to the delight of the customers milling about the shop hi hi yourself and what are you doing in my parlor in the middle of the day i didnt come for you he kissed her again and barely restrained himself from laying a hand on her stubbornly flat stomach he couldnt wait for it to grow i need to talk to kate captain queeg is in the office rolling marbles and talking about strawberries josh winced i thought you were calling her captain bligh these days he wasnt insane enough shes redoing the filing system colorcoded good god whats next margo narrowed her eyes she put up a bulletin board she must be stopped ill go in he drew a deep breath if im not out in twenty minutes remember ive always loved you very funny she muttered and managed to hold the smile back until hed slipped into the rear office josh found kate mumbling over files her hair stood up in spikes and the first two fingers of her right hand were covered with rubber tips less than a year she said without turning around and you and laura have managed to misfile half of everything why the hell is a fire insurance invoice in the umbrella file someone should be flogged unamused she turned eyed him i dont have time for you josh your wifes making my life a living hell funny she says the same thing about you despite her ferocious glare he walked over and kissed the tip of her nose i hear youre colorcoding the files somebody has to the software i installed keeps clean records but youre better off backing up with hard copy in retail i told margo to do this months ago but shes more interested in selling trinkets god knows how you can expect to keep a retail business running by selling things she drew in a breath refusing to hear how foolish she sounded my point is you can hardly keep any business successful if you dont concern yourself with the details shes been logging shoes under wardrobe instead of accessories she needs to be punished he grabbed kates shoulders let me do it chuckling she shoved him back go away i dont have time to laugh right now i didnt come by for laughs i need to talk to you he pointed to a chair so sit cant this wait i have to be back in the showroom in an hour i want to get the files in shape first sit he repeated and gave her a brotherly nudge i just had a meeting at bittle the impatience drained out of her eyes leaving them cold and blank excuse me dont take that tone with me kate its past time this was dealt with she continued to take that tone quiet and icy as fear clawed at her insides and you decided you were the one to deal with it thats right as your attorney youre not my attorney she shot back who went to court to get you out of that speeding ticket three years ago you but and who looked over your lease for your apartment before you signed it yes but who wrote your will her face turned mutinous i dont see that that has anything to do with it i see idly he studied his manicure just because ive handled all the pesky little legal details of your life doesnt make me your lawyer it doesnt give you the right to go behind my back and talk to bittle particularly since i asked you to leave it alone fine it doesnt being your brother does bringing up family loyalty was in kates opinion hitting below the belt she sprang to her feet im not the inadequate incapable little sister and i wont be treated like one im handling this how primed to fight he got to his feet as well by colorcoding the files in here yes since he was shouting now kate matched her voice to his by making the best of the situation by getting on with my life by not whining and crying by backing down and doing nothing he poked his finger against her shoulder by going into denial well its gone on long enough bittle and company know that theyre facing legal action legal action the blood drained out of her face she could feel every drop flow you told them i was going to sue oh my god dizzy she leaned on the desk hey he grabbed her in alarm sit down catch your breath leave me alone leave me the hell alone what have you done what needed to be done now come on honey sit down jesus christ she exploded and rather than a poke on his shoulder she landed a punch on it how dare you her color was back flaming how dare you threaten legal action i didnt tell them you were going to sue i merely left them chewing over that impression i told you to leave it this is my business mine she threw up her arms spun around what gave you this brainstorm joshua im going to kill margo margo didnt have anything to do with it though if you would open your beady eyes for five minutes youd see how worried she is about you how worried everyone is because he might poke her again he decided his hands were safer in his pockets i shouldnt have let it go this long but ive had things on my mind if by hadnt dropped by and given me a push it would have taken me longer but id have gotten to it stop breathing hard she held up a hand playback byron de witt talked to you about me realizing his misstep josh tried a quick retreat your name came up in conversation thats all and it started me my name came up now she was breathing between clenched teeth teeth that matched the fists ready at her sides anger was better she realized than panic oh i just bet it did that son of a bitch i should have known he couldnt keep his mouth shut about what dont try to cover up and get out of my way her shove was fierce enough and unexpected enough to knock him back before he could make the grab she was sailing past him just a damn minute i havent finished you go to hell she shot back over her shoulder causing several customers to glance around nervously as she stormed out of the office she sent margo one seething glare before slamming the front door behind her well struggling with a smile margo handed a bagged purchase to a wideeyed customer thats thirtyeight fiftythree out of forty still smiling she handed over the change and the show was free please come again with the wariness of a man who understood trouble when it stared at him from sultry blue eyes josh approached the counter sorry about that well deal with sorry later she said under her breath what did you do to upset her just like a woman he thought to take the womans side i tried to help her you know how she hates that why instead of taking your head off did she storm out of here looking like she was going to take someone elses head off he sighed scratched his chin shuffled his feet shed finished taking my head off now shes going for byrons he sort of suggested that i help her margo tapped coraltipped nails on the glass counter i see i really ought to call him give him some advance warning but when josh reached for the phone on the counter margo laid a firm hand over his oh no i dont think so we wouldnt want to spoil kates advantage margo its only fair fair has nothing to do with it and youre going to be too busy waiting on customers to make personal calls now he stuck his hands in his pockets duchess ive got a meeting in a couple of hours i dont have time to help you out around here thanks to you im shorthanded knowing that that wouldnt get her very far she let her shoulders slump and im feeling a little tired tired panic came on wings you should get off your feet youre probably right though she felt strong as a horse she scooted a stool over to the cash register and perched on it ill just sit here and ring up sales for the next hour oh josh darling be sure to offer the customers champagne enjoying herself she slipped off her shoes and prepared to watch her adorable husband handle a storeful of customers the only show she would have preferred to witness was the one that would be starting shortly in the penthouse office of templeton monterey the first analogy that came to byrons mind was that of a wild possibly rabid deer charging kate cut through his shocked protesting assistant like a sharp knife through quivery jelly snarled like a feral shewolf and might very well have delivered the knockout punch of a flyweight champ if byron hadnt signaled his assistant to retreat well katherine he barely missed a beat when she slammed the door with a resounding crack what an unexpected pleasure im going to kill you im going to rip off your meddling nose and stuff it in your flapping mouth as much fun as im sure thatll be would you like a drink first some water youre a bit flushed who the hell do you think you are she sprang toward the desk smashed her palms down on its polished and just now crowded surface what possible right do you have to mix in my business do i strike you as some weakwilled emptyheaded woman who needs a man to defend her which one of those questions would you like me to answer first why dont i take them in order he said before she could shout again you know exactly who i am i didnt mix in your business any more than any tentative and concerned friend would and no no indeed i dont see you as weakwilled or emptyheaded i see you as stubborn rude and potentially dangerous you havent got a clue how dangerous pal that threat might have more weight if youd take off those filing tips they spoil the image a strangled sound erupted from her throat as she looked down and discovered the brown rubber tips still on her fingers smooth and quick she ripped them off and threw them at him just as smooth just as quick he caught them both before they hit his face good arm he commented i bet you played ball in school i thought i could trust you for reasons she didnt want to analyze thinking of that made her eyes sting i even for one brief foolish moment thought i could learn to like you now i see that my first impression of you as an arrogant selfimportant sexist jerk was totally on the mark her sense of betrayal was every bit as keen as her fury i was reeling when you found me on the cliffs i was vulnerable everything i said there i said to you in confidence you had no right to run to josh with it he set the rubber tips on his desk i didnt say anything to josh about that day on the cliffs i dont believe you you went to him i dont lie he said sharply she glimpsed the steel beneath the polish yes i went to him sometimes it takes someone outside the family to put things on the table and your family is torn up about what happened to you kate more worried about the way youre behaving my behavior isnt any of my business he finished for her odd that something as harmless as my speaking with josh sends you into a tailspin of revenge and retribution but being questioned about embezzlement makes you curl up in the fetal position and suck your thumb you dont know what im doing what im feeling and you have no right to pass judgment no thats all quite true if you werent so selfinvolved youd see that no ones passing judgment but as an outsider i can tell you that your family is hurting for you her flush died until her cheeks were bonewhite dont lecture me about my family dont you dare theyre the most important people in the world to me im handling this my way because of my family he cocked his head which means which means that too is none of your business she pressed her fingers to her eyes fighting for control nothing and no one is more on my mind than my family he believed that without hesitation and only felt more sorry for her your way of handling this situation isnt working how the hell do you know because people talk to me his voice was gentle now and the edge of temper had smoothed out of it margo laura josh because i know how worried and angry id be if it was my sister well it isnt your sister the anger snapped back into her voice but her cheeks stayed white im capable of dealing with this josh has enough on his plate without being guilted into taking this on do you really think guilt has anything to do with it she fumbled recovered dont twist my words around de witt those were your words powell now if youve finished with your tantrum we can discuss this tantrum id heard you were good at them but now that ive had a firsthand demonstration i see the reports were understated hed never thought that dark glossy brown could turn to fire until he watched it happen in her eyes ill show you a tantrum with one swipe she sent most of the papers on his desk flying then raised her fist come out from behind that desk oh you tempt me his voice was ominously quiet his eyes dangerously cool ive never hit a woman in my life and never have i found it necessary to make that statement before but you tempt me katherine to break all kinds of records now either sit down or get out im not sitting down and im not getting out until we she broke off strangling a cry as she pressed a hand under her breasts now he did come around the desk cursing all the way damn it damn it what are you doing to yourself dont touch me the burning pressure made her eyes water but she struggled when he led her to a chair youre going to sit down youre going to try to relax and if you dont have your color back in thirty seconds im hauling your skinny butt to the hospital just leave me alone she fumbled out her antacids knowing it was like trying to put out a forest fire with a water pistol ill be fine in a minute how often does this happen none of your business she yelped in pain and shock when he pressed two fingers to her abdomen do you have your appendix keep your hands off me dr feelgood he only continued to frown and moved his fingertips to the inside of her wrist been skipping meals again before she could evade he caught her face in his hands and took a long objective look her color was seeping back slowly and her eyes were filled with temper again rather than pain but he saw other things youre not sleeping youre tired overstressed and undernourished is that how youre handling this her stomach quivered an echo of pain and nerves i want you to leave me alone you dont always get what you want youre exhausted kate and until you start taking better care of yourself someone else will have to do it for you be still he ordered in an absent murmur holding a hand on her shoulder as he checked his watch im tied up here until after six ill pick you up at seven will you be at the shop or at home what the hell are you talking about im not going anywhere with you i realize im annoyed with myself for handling this matter badly you do seem to bring out the worst in me he added mostly to himself so youre going to get a decent meal and the opportunity to discuss these gripes of yours in a civilized manner it was frightening her the casual manner he assumed the glint of heat in his eye that warned he could shift out of casual mode at any moment i dont want to have dinner with you and im not feeling civilized considering he rocked back on his heels so that their eyes were level lets try it this way you go along with this or i pick up the phone and call laura it should take her about two minutes to get up here and when she does ill tell her that twice now ive seen you go white and double over you have no right no kate what i have here is the hammer that beats the hell out of rights he checked his watch again i have a conference call coming through in about five minutes or wed finish more of this now since the reasonable thing for you to do is go home and get some rest i assume youll go back to the shop ill pick you up at seven trapped she nudged him aside and got to her feet we close at six then youll have to wait wont you and dont slam the door on your way out of course she did and he found he had to smile but the smile faded when he picked up the phone and hurriedly punched in a number dr margaret de witt please its her son another look at his watch brought out a mild oath no i cant wait would you ask her to call me when shes free the office before six at home after seven thanks he hung up then began to put in order the papers kate had scattered almost amused he pocketed the filing tips shed left behind he doubted that kate would appreciate him calling his mother the internist for an overthephone diagnosis of her symptoms but somebody had to look out for her whether she wanted it or not chapter seven contents prev next she was going to be calm kate promised herself that shed made a fool of herself barging into byrons office shouting and raging she wouldnt have minded that so much if it had worked there was nothing worse than having a good temper fit snuffed out by reason patience and control it was more than humiliating she didnt much care for taking orders either frowning she looked around the shop shed just closed she could simply walk out she considered drumming her fingers on the counter she could just stroll right out go anywhere she wanted home for a drive to templeton house for dinner that might be the best option she thought rubbing a hand absently over the grinding ache in her stomach she was hungry that was all a good meal at templeton house an evening with laura and the girls would soothe all the pangs and nerves it would serve byron right if she wasnt there when he came gunning for her for that she was sure was his intention soothe the victim with reason with promises of calm discussions then pow shoot her between the eyes and that she knew was the reason she was staying put kate powell never walked away from a challenge let him come she told herself grimly as she began to wander about the shop she could handle byron de witt in her sleep men like him were so used to getting their own way with a quick smile a murmured word they didnt know how to act with a woman who stood firmly on her own feet besides now that her finances were a little strained she acknowledged the advantage of a free meal the grinding came back like a sneering echo nerves she thought again of course she was nervous she knew better than anyone that pretenses could barely support three incomes and stay afloat they were lucky to have made it through the first year but the odds were still against them she frowned down at a stylish glass rhinoceros in pale gold how long she wondered were they going to be able to sell things quite that foolish the price tag made her laugh nine hundred dollars who in their right mind would plunk down nearly a thousand dollars for something so ridiculous margo she decided and her lips curved up again margo had a keen eye for the expensive the ridiculous and the salable if pretenses went down the toilet margo would be fine she had josh now a baby on the way a beautiful home a far cry from her circumstances a year ago kate mused and was glad for her but there was laura to worry about and the girls they wouldnt starve kate knew the templetons wouldnt allow it they would live in templeton house which would give them far more than a roof over their heads it would give them a home since laura was too proud to touch the income from her templeton stocks she could work at the hotel and earn a living a good one but how badly would her ego be bruised if the business she started herself failed kate had discovered a great deal about the difficulties of functioning with a scraped ego they had to make the shop work it was margos dream and it had become lauras it was all kate had to hold on to all her neat little plans were ruined there would be no partnership at bittle no possibility of striking out with her own firm at some future date no pretty brass plaque on her office door no office she thought and sat down on a painted wooden bench right now she had sleepless nights headaches that never quite faded a stomach that refused to behave and pretenses pretenses she thought with a thin smile margo had named it well the three owners were just full of them the knock on the door made her jolt then swear then straighten her shoulders as she rose and went to unlock it she nudged byron aside stepped out onto the little flowerdecked veranda and locked up again pedestrian and street traffic churned past with all the noise and bustle that usually accompanied it tourists she thought absently searching for just the right spot to enjoy a vacation dinner members of the workforce heading home after a long day couples out on dates just where did kate powell fit in im not going because you told me i was going she said without preliminary im going because i want the opportunity to speak calmly and clearly about the situation and because im hungry fine he cupped a hand under her elbow well take my car i managed to find a space in the lot across the street its a busy area its a good location she began as he led her to the curb a stones throw from fishermans wharf and the water tourists are a big part of our business but a lot of the locals come here to shop too two young boys on a rented tandem bike whizzed by behind her laughing like hyenas it was a beautiful evening full of soft light and soft scents a night for beach walking she mused or for tossing hunks of bread to the gulls as the couple by the water was doing just now a night she thought for couples kate nibbled her lip as byron guided her across the street i can follow you there are a dozen restaurants within walking distance for that matter well take my car he repeated gently and firmly maneuvering through the crowded parking lot and ill bring you back to yours when were finished it would save time and be more efficient if kate he turned and looked at her really looked and scotched the annoyed remark hovering on his tongue the woman was exhausted why dont you try something new go with the flow he opened the passenger door of his vintage mustang and waited with some amusement for her badtempered shrug he wasnt disappointed she watched him round the hood hed ditched his tie and jacket she noted opened his collar the casual easy look suited those linemans shoulders she supposed the beachcomber hair she decided to realign her strategy and wait until they were at dinner before beginning the lecture shed been planning she could when necessary manage small talk with the best of them so youre into classic cars he settled behind the wheel the minute he turned the key the radio exploded with marvin gaye byron turned it down to a murmur before cruising through the lot sixtyfive mustang with a v a car like this isnt just a mode of transportation its a commitment really she liked the creamy white bucket seats the trainedpanther ride but couldnt think of anything more impractical than owning a car older than she was dont you have to spend a lot of time babying it finding parts thats the commitment runs like a dream he added with an affectionate stroke to the dash as he merged into traffic she was my first first what first car thats right he grinned at her baffled stare bought her when i was seventeen shes got over two hundred thousand miles on her and still purrs like a kitten kate would have said it was more roars like a lion but that wasnt her problem nobody keeps their first car its like your first lover exactly he downshifted eased around a turn as it happens i had my first lover in the backseat one sweet summer night pretty lisa montgomery he sighed reminiscently she opened a window to paradise for me god bless her a window to paradise unable to resist kate craned her neck and studied the pristine backseat it wasnt very difficult to imagine two young bodies groping all that in the back of an old mustang classic mustang he corrected just like lisa montgomery but you didnt keep her you cant keep everything except memories remember your first time in my college dorm room i was a slow starter marvin gaye had given way to wilson pickett kates foot began to keep time he was captain of the debate team and seduced me with his argument that sex next to birth and death was the ultimate human experience good one ill have to try it sometime she slanted a look at his profile hero perfect she judged with just a hint of rugged i dont imagine you need lines it never hurts to keep a few in reserve so what happened to the captain of the debate team he was used to getting his point across inside of three minutes that ability bled over into the ultimate human experience oh byron fought back a grin too bad not really it taught me not to build up unrealistic expectations and not to depend on someone else to fulfill basic needs kate scanned the scenery her foot stopped tapping as she tensed up again why are we on seventeen mile its a pretty drive i enjoy taking it every day did i mention that i was able to arrange renting the house im buying until we settle no you didnt but she was getting the drift you said we were going to have dinner and a civilized discussion and we are you can take a look at the favor you did for me at the same time even as she formulated several arguments against byron turned into a driveway and pulled up behind a dramatically glossy black corvette its a first year the stingray rolled out of detroit he said with a nod toward the car three hundred sixty horsepower fuelinjected an absolute beauty not that the original vette wasnt a honey before the redesign they dont make bodies like that anymore why do you need two cars need isnt the issue anyway i have four cars the other two are back in atlanta four she murmured and found this little quirk of his amusing fiftyseven chevy cubicinch v baby blue white sidewalls all original equipment there was affection in his voice kate thought the southern heat of it flowed over the words like a man describing a lover every bit as classy as the songs they wrote about her billie jo spears kate knew her music trivia fiftyseven chevrolet thats the best surprised and impressed he grinned at her keeping her company is a gto three deuces and a four speed right his grin widened and a she grinned back just what the hell are three deuces automotively speaking if you dont know already it would take a little time to explain just let me know if you ever want a serious lesson then he put a hand over kates and shifted his gaze to the house she was relaxed enough not to pull away its great isnt it its nice all wood and glass she mused bilevel decks flowers already blooming riotously that wonderful cypress bent and magical ive seen it before from the outside knowing shed never wait for him to come around to her door he leaned across her to open it and inhaled the simple scent of soap enjoying it he let his gaze wander lazily from her mouth to her eyes youll be another first excuse me god was he losing his mind or was he actually starting to look forward to that edgy tone my first guest he got out of the car retrieved his briefcase and jacket as they started up the walk he took her hand in a friendly gesture you can hear the sea he pointed out its just close enough ive caught a couple of glimpses of seals too it was charming almost too charming she thought the setting the sounds the scent of roses and nightblooming jasmine what was left of the setting sun spread vivid heartbreaking color across the western sky the twisted shadows from the trees were long and deep a lot of tourists drive along here she said fighting the spell isnt that going to bother you no the house is set back from the road and the bedrooms face the water he turned the key in the lock theres just one problem she was glad to hear it perfection made her nervous what i dont have much in the way of furniture he opened the door and proved his point it shouldnt have delighted her bare floors bare walls bare space yet she found it delightful the way the entranceway flowed into a room the simplest of welcomes the wide glass doors on the facing wall exploded with that stunning sunset almost demanded to be opened wide to it the yellow pine floors gleamed under her feet as she stepped inside crossed over them there was no rug as yet to tame that ocean flood of shine he would get one she imagined it was practical sensible but she thought it would also be a shame from her outside survey of the house she hadnt guessed that the ceilings were so high or that the stairs leading to the next level were open as open as the carved pickets in the ornate railing that skirted the second story she could see how cleverly how simply one room became another so that the house appeared to be one large living space white walls golden floors and the beautiful bleeding light from the west great view she managed and wondered why her palms were damp casually she wandered to a crate on which stood an elaborate stereo system the only piece of furniture was a ratty recliner with duct tape holding the arms together youve got the essentials i see no point in living without music i picked up the chair at a yard sale its so awful its wonderful want a drink just some club soda or water alcohol was off the list for a couple of reasons and he was one of them ive got some templeton mineral water she smiled then youve got the best ill take you on a tour after ive gotten dinner started come in the kitchen and keep me company you know how to cook it was the shock of it that made her follow him actually i do you like grits and chitlins right he waited a beat turned and wasnt disappointed with the look of sheer horror on her face just kidding how about seafood not those crawfish things i make a hell of a crawfish etouffee but well save that for when were better acquainted if the rest of the house hadnt already sold me this would have done it the kitchen was done in dramatic maroon and white tiles with a center island that gleamed like an iceberg a builtin banquette curved in front of a wide window that looked out on blooming flowers and the deepgreen lawn subzero byron commented running a loving hand over the stainlesssteel front of a wide refrigerator convection oven jennair range teak cabinets there was a big blue bowl of fresh glossy fruit on the counter the grinding in kates stomach told her if she didnt eat soon shed die you like to cook it relaxes me okay why dont you relax ill watch she had to admit it was an impressive show she sipped chilled water while he sliced an array of colorful vegetables his movements were brisk and as far as she could tell professional intrigued she moved closer watched his hands very nice hands now that she took a good look long fingers wide palms with a neat manicure that didnt take away from the basic masculinity did you like take a course or something or something we had this cook maurice byron turned a red bell pepper into long neat strips he told me hed teach me how to box i was tall and skinny regularly got the shit beat out of me at school kate stepped back did a slow survey broad shoulders trim waist narrow hips long limbs certainly and with his sleeves rolled up for cooking she could see forearms that looked just a bit dangerous what happened steroids he chuckled and went briskly to work on an onion i grew into my arms and legs after a while started working out but i was about twelve and pathetically awkward yeah kate sipped remembering her own adolescence the trouble was shed never grown into anything still the runt of the litter she mused its a rough age so maurice said hed teach me to defend myself but i had to learn to cook it was according to him just one more way to become selfsufficient byron drizzled oil into a large castiron pan already heating on the stove in about six months i whipped curt bodines bad ass he was the bane of my existence at the time i had candy dorall now litchfield kate put in conversationally she was always my bane the terminally pert candace litchfield redhead smug foxy face annoying little giggle anyone who described candy so accurately deserved a smile i think i might like you after all did you ever punch candy in her sassy nose its not her nose she had rhinoplasty kate snacked on a strip of pepper and no but we did stuff her naked into a locker twice not bad but thats girl stuff me i just beat the hell out of curt salvaged masculine pride while earning the appropriate macho rep and i could produce a chocolate souffle to die for when she laughed he paused and turned to face her do that again when she didnt respond he shook his head you really ought to laugh more katherine its a fascinating sound surprisingly full and rich like something youd expect to hear floating out of the window of a new orleans brothel im sure thats a compliment she lifted her water glass again made herself keep her eyes level with his but i rarely laugh on an empty stomach well fix that he tossed minced garlic into the hot oil the scent was immediate and wonderful the onion went in next and she began to salivate he pried the lid off a covered bowl slid shelled shrimp and scallops into the pan she thought it was a bit like watching a mad scientist at work a glug of white wine a pinch of salt a slight grating of what he told her was ginger quick stirs and shakes to mix all those pretty strips of vegetables in less time than it might have taken her to peruse a menu she was sitting down to a full plate its good she said after her first bite its really good why arent you in food services cookings a hobby like conversation and old cars vintage cars it pleased him to see her eat hed decided on the menu because hed wanted to get something healthy into her he imagined her snatching junk food when she remembered to eat at all snacking on antacids no wonder she was too thin i could teach you teach me what to cook she speared a shrimp i didnt say i couldnt cook can you no but i didnt say i couldnt and i dont need to as long as theres takeout and microwave ovens because shed refused his offer of wine he stuck with water himself i bet theres a place reserved for you at mcdonalds drivethrough window so its quick its easy and its filling nothing wrong with the occasional french fry but when its a dietary staple dont start with me byron this is why im here in the first place remembering her plan she got down to business i dont like people particularly people i barely know interfering in my life we have to get to know each other better no we dont it was weird she realized how easily shed become distracted and interested and at ease time had slipped by when all shed meant to do was give him the sharpest edge of one piece of her mind your intentions might have been good but you had no business going to josh your eyes are fabulous he said and watched them narrow with suspicion i dont know if its because theyre so big so dark or because your face is narrow but they really pack a punch is that one of your reserved lines no its an observation i happen to be looking at your face and it occurs to me that it has all these contrasts the snooty new england cheekbones the wide sexy mouth angular nose the big doe eyes it shouldnt work but it does it works better when youre not pale and tired but that adds a rather disconcerting fragile quality she shifted im not fragile im not tired and my face has nothing to do with the subject under discussion but i like it i liked it right away even when i didnt like you now i wonder kate he continued laying a hand over hers twining fingers why did you put so much effort into making sure i didnt look twice in your direction i didnt have to put any effort into that im not your type any more than youre mine no youre not he agreed still i occasionally enjoy sampling something different im not a new recipe she pulled her hand free pushed her plate aside and i came here to have as you termed it a civilized discussion this seems civilized to me dont pull out that reasonable tone she had to squeeze her eyes shut and count to ten she made it to five i hate that reasonable tone i agreed to go to dinner with you so that i could make myself clear so that i could do so without losing my temper the way i did earlier today for emphasis she leaned forward a little was distracted by discovering that there was a thin gold halo around his pupils i dont want you meddling in my life i dont know how to make it any more plain than that thats plain since they seemed to have finished the meal he picked up the plates and carried them to the counter sitting again he took a cigar from his pocket lit it but theres a problem ive developed an interest in you yeah right you find that difficult to believe he puffed out smoke considered so did i initially then i realized what kicked it off im driven to solve problems and puzzles answers and solutions are essential to me do you want coffee no i dont want coffee didnt he know it drove her crazy the way he could slide from one topic to the next in that slow southern drawl of his of course he did and im not a problem or a puzzle but you are look at you kate you whiteknuckle your way through life he reached out deliberately uncurled her fist i can almost see whatever fuel you bother to put inside you being sucked away by nerves you have a loving family a solid base an excellent mind but you pick at details as if they were knotted threads you never consider just snipping one off yet when youre faced with the injustice the insult of being fired from a job that was a huge part of your life you sit back and do nothing it grated and hurt and shamed and because she couldnt explain to him or to those who cared for her it festered im doing what works for me and i didnt come here for an analysis i havent finished he said mildly youre afraid to be vulnerable even ashamed of it youre a practical woman yet youre aware youre physically rundown and youre doing nothing about that either youre an honest woman but youre putting all of your energy into denying there might be even a mild hint of attraction between us so you interest me he took a last drag on his cigar tamped it out the puzzle of you interests me she got to her feet slowly to prove to both of them she was still in control i realize it might be difficult no next to impossible for you to realize that im not interested in you im not vulnerable im not ill and im not even mildly attracted well he unfolded himself and rose we can put at least one of those statements to the test his eyes stayed watchful on hers as he cupped a hand behind her neck unless youre afraid youre wrong im not wrong and i dont want he decided it was simpler not to let her finish the woman could argue with the dead he covered her mouth with his quietly with barely a whisper of pressure and promise when her hands jerked up to his chest he scooped an arm around her waist and brought her gently closer for his own pleasure he skimmed his tongue over her lips then dipped inside when they parted he thought foolishly that he could hear a new window to a new paradise begin to creak open then she trembled and he forgot to be amused at both of them when he eased back he saw that she was still pale her eyes dark and clouded testing he pressed light kisses on either side of her mouth and watched her lashes flutter i dont i cant god the hand pressed against his chest balled into a fist i dont have the time or the inclination for this why because her head was spinning her pulse was pounding and her juices were running in a way they hadnt in ever youre not my type that clever mouth curved youre not mine either go figure men who look like you are always scum she knew better absolutely knew better but she couldnt stop her hands from streaking up his chest and grabbing all that wonderful goldtipped hair its like the law his lips curved whose law she could have had a snappy comeback for that if shed just been able to concentrate oh the hell with it she muttered and dragged his mouth back to hers nerves and needs seemed to pulse from her in fast greedy waves he couldnt stand against them could barely stand at all once her mouth started its assault he should have known she wouldnt believe in the slow and the gradual or the easy sweetness of a lazy seduction but he hadnt considered that the firedrenched demands of that mobile mouth would undermine his innate sense of reason in the space of a heartbeat he went from enjoying her to devouring her his arms banded around her forgot about her long fragile bones and soft spare flesh he used his teeth because that mouth that wide sultry mouth seemed to have been made for him to ravish the scent of soap was absurdly sexy he could almost taste it as he ran hot wild kisses down her throat its only because i havent had sex in so long she gasped out the rationale even as her eyes crossed okay whatever he curled his hands around her tiny tight butt and muffled a moan against her throat a year she managed okay its been nearly two but after the first few months you hardly jesus touch me im going to scream if you dont touch me where he nearly panicked he was unable to tell one part of her from another he was steeped in all of her instinct had him tugging her crisp white shirt out of the waistband of her skirt fumbling with buttons upstairs he swore ripely as the buttons refused to yield he didnt have enough sanity left to be appalled at how his fingers shook we should go upstairs ive got a bed desperate she grabbed his hand and pressed it to her breast herself youve got a floor right here he managed a laugh im beginning to love practical women you havent seen anything then it hit her the first wave of pain was followed so swiftly by a second she barely managed a choked gasp what what is it did i hurt you no its nothing he was trying to straighten her up as she doubled over its just a twinge its but the burning was spreading like wildfire and the fear burst through with it as she felt her skin break out in a cold clammy sweat just give me a minute blindly she reached out for something to balance her and would have fallen if he hadnt scooped her up the hell with this the words exploded between gritted teeth the hell with it im taking you to the hospital no stop it desperate for relief she hooked an arm under her breasts and pressed just take me home in a pigs eye like a warrior hoisting his conquest he carried her out of the house save your breath and yell at me later right now youre doing what youre told i said take me home she didnt bother to fight him when he strapped her into the car all of her energy had to focus on dealing with the pain he backed out of the drive saying nothing as she tore tums out of the roll habitually in her pocket instead he snatched up the car phone and punched in a number mom he drove fast whipping the car around curves and interrupted his mothers apology for not returning his call its okay listen ive got a friend a woman five sevenish maybe a hundred and five pounds midtwenties he swore lightly cradling the phone on his shoulder as he shifted gears its not that he said at the inevitable chuckle im taking her to the hospital right now shes got abdominal pain it seems to be habitual its just stress kate managed between shallow breaths and your lousy cooking yes thats her she can talk and shes lucid i dont know he glanced briefly at kate any abdominal surgery kate no dont talk to me yeah id say she lives with a lot of stress brings most of it on herself wed eaten about fortyfive fifty minutes before he said in response to his mothers brisk questions no no alcohol no caffeine but she lives on goddamn coffee and eats tums like chocolate drops yeah is there a burning sensation he demanded of kate its just indigestion she muttered the pain was backing off wasnt it please wasnt it yes he listened again nodded he was grimly aware of where his mothers questions were heading how often do you get that gnawing ache under the breastbone none of your business you dont want to piss me off right now kate you really dont how often a lot so what youre not taking me to any hospital and the grinding in the stomach because he was describing her symptoms with pinpoint accuracy she closed her eyes and ignored him he spoke to his mother another moment punched up the gas thanks thats what i figured im going to take care of it yeah ill let you know i will bye he hung up kept his eyes firmly on the road congratulations you idiot youve got yourself a nice little ulcer chapter eight contents prev next no way did she have an ulcer kate comforted herself with that thought and the image of how foolish byron was going to look for rushing her to the hospital with a case of nervous heartburn ulcers were for repressed wimps who didnt know how to express their emotions who were afraid to face what was inside them kate figured she expressed her emotions just fine and at every opportunity she was simply dealing with more stress than usual who wouldnt have a jittery stomach after the two months shed just had but she was handling it she told herself shutting her eyes tight against the incessant burning pressure she was handling it her way the minute byron stopped the car she would explain yet again calmly that kate powell took care of kate powell she would have too if she could have caught her breath but he jerked to a halt in front of the emergency room slammed out of the car and plucked her out of her seat before she could so much as squeak then it was worse because she was inside with all the sounds and scents of a hospital emergency rooms were all the same everywhere the air inside was thick with despair and fear and fresh blood antiseptics alcohol sweat the slap of crepesoled shoes and the whisper of wheels on linoleum it paralyzed her it was all she could do to keep herself from curling into a ball in the hard plastic chair where hed dumped her stay he ordered curtly before marching over to the admitting nurse she didnt even hear him flashes of memory assaulted her she could hear the high desperate scream of sirens see the red lights pulsing and spinning she was eight years old again and the dull throb deep inside her ached like a wound and blood she could smell it not hers or very little of her blood shed barely had a scratch contusions they had called them minor lacerations a mild concussion nothing lifethreatening nothing lifealtering but they had wheeled her parents away even while shed screamed for her mother and they had never come back its your lucky night byron said when he came back to her not much going on theyre going to take a look at you now i cant be here she murmured i cant be in a hospital thats the breaks kid this is where the doctors are he lifted her to her feet surprised when she went along like an obedient puppy he passed her off to a nurse then settled down to wait kate told herself the more she cooperated the quicker they would let her go and they had to let her go she wasnt a child now who had no choice she stepped into the narrow examining area shuddering once at the sound of the curtain being drawn closed behind her lets see what weve got here the doctor on duty was young and pretty a round face narrow eyes behind wireframed glasses dark hair scooped back at the side with simple bobby pins it had been a man before kate remembered hed been young too but his eyes had been exhausted and old mechanically kate answered the standard questions no she didnt have any allergies shed had no surgery she was taking no medication why dont you lie back ms powell im dr hudd im going to check you out are you having pain now no not really the doctor lifted an eyebrow no or not really kate closed her eyes and struggled to steep herself in the here and now some tell me when it increases soft hands kate thought as they began to probe her doctors always seemed to have soft hands then she hissed as the doctor applied pressure under her breastbone thats the spot huh how often does this happen it happens do you find the discomfort occurs after a meal say an hour or so after a meal sometimes she sighed yes and when you drink alcohol yes is there any vomiting no kate swiped a hand over her clammy face no dizziness no well not really dr hudds unpainted mouth pursed as she pressed her fingers to kates wrist your pulse is a little fast i dont want to be here kate said flatly i hate hospitals yeah i know the feeling the doctor continued as she made notations on a chart describe the pain for me kate stared up at the ceiling pretended she was talking aloud to herself its a burning in the torso or an aching she wouldnt stay here she reminded herself calmly on this table behind these curtains more like sharp hunger pains in my stomach they can get pretty intense i bet how have you been dealing with it my heartburn kate said dully mylanta the doctor chuckled patted kates hand are you under a lot of stress ms powell my father was a thief ive lost my job and the cops could be knocking on my door any minute theres nothing i can do about it nothing that wont make it worse who isnt she tried not to jerk when the doctor lifted her eyelid and shined a light to check her pupils how long have you been having these symptoms somewhere around forever i dont know theyve gotten worse in the last couple of months sleeping well no taking anything for that no how about headaches no thanks i have plenty of them nuprin she said anticipating the question excedrin i switch off mmhmm when was your last physical when kate didnt answer me doctor eased back pursed her lips again that long ago huh whos your regular doctor i go see minelli once a year for a pap i dont get sick youre doing a good imitation of it now ill follow that up with my imitation of an exam lets check your blood pressure kate submitted to it she was calmer now certain that the ordeal was almost over she imagined the doctor would dash off a prescription and be done with it blood pressures a little high hearts strong youre underweight ms powell dieting no i never diet lucky you hudd said with a considering look in her eye it was a look kate recognized one that made her sigh i dont have an eating disorder doctor im not bulimic not anorexic no binging no purging no pills ive always been thin so you havent lost any weight lately a few pounds maybe kate admitted my appetites been kind of sporadic look ive had some problems at work and its stressed me out thats all believe me if i had a choice id rather have curves than angles well when we solve this problem you should put them back on after we run a few tests kates hand shot out curled around the doctors wrist tests what kind of tests nothing that involves torture chambers i promise we need some xrays a barium certainly and i recommend an upper gi these are to pinpoint and to eliminate i dont want any tests give me a pill and let me out of here ms powell its not quite that simple well get you in and out of xray as quickly as possible ill try to schedule the gi for first thing in the morning once we get you admitted panic was white kate realized white rooms and women in white uniforms youre not keeping me here just overnight the doctor soothed its not that i dont respect your boyfriends diagnosis hes not my boyfriend well id work on that if i were you but in any case hes not a doctor his mother is he talked to his mother on the way over ask him i want you to get him back here i want you to get him all right try to calm down ill go talk to him just lie down here and try to relax the doctor eased kates shoulders back once she was alone kate struggled to breathe deeply evenly but terror was circling still arguing byron began when he stepped into the room kate popped up like a spring i cant stay here she snatched at his shirt front with trembling hands you have to get me out now listen kate i cant stay here overnight i cant spend the night in a hospital i cant her voice lowered to a broken whisper my parents confusion came first did she expect him to call the templetons in france to back her up then he remembered her own parents were dead had been killed in an accident hospital and he saw that what he had taken for pain and bad temper in her eyes was sheer terror okay baby to soothe her he pressed his lips to her brow dont worry youre not going to stay i cant she felt her breath hitch felt the simmering hysteria start its greasy rise you wont i promise he cupped her face until her swimming eyes met his i promise kate im going to talk to the doctor now then ill take you home hysteria receded replaced by trust all right okay she closed her eyes all right just give me a minute he stepped to the other side of the curtain with the doctor shes got a phobia i didnt realize it look mr de witt most people dont like spending time in hospitals there are times i dont like it myself im not talking about ordinary resistance frustrated he dragged a hand through his hair thats all i thought it was but its a lot more listen her parents were killed in some sort of accident when she was a kid i dont know the details but there must have been some hospital time shes panicked at staying here and she isnt the panicking type she needs these tests the doctor insisted dr hudd is it dr hudd shes got an ulcer textbook symptoms we both know it because your mother said so my mothers chief of internal medicine at atlanta general hudds brows shot up dr margaret de witt she sighed again impressive ive read a number of her papers though i tend to agree with her diagnosis im sure shed agree with my procedure signs point to a duodenum ulcer but i cant discard other possibilities these tests are standard and if the patient is so distressed emotionally wrecked that the idea of the tests aggravates the preexisting condition he waited a beat neither one of us is going to be able to force her to have them shell just walk out of here go on popping tums until shes got a hole in her stomach you could sink a putt through no i cant force her to have the tests hudd said irritably and i can give her medication in exchange for a promise that she comes back as an outpatient for a barium xray if symptoms recur ill see that she does youd better her blood pressures up her weights down shes hoarding stress id say shes got a breakdown on the boil ill take care of her dr hudd hesitated a moment measuring him then nodded im sure you will she reached for the curtain glanced back is your father dr brian de witt thoracic surgery and youre in hotels he smiled charmingly but my sisters are doctors all three of them theres one in every family im sorry kate murmured she kept her head back resting it against the cars seat kept her eyes closed just follow doctors orders take your medicine get your rest cut back on the jalapenos she knew he said it to make her smile and tried to oblige him and i was just craving some i didnt want to ask until i was sure wed managed the great escape but how did you talk her out of admitting me reason charm compromise and by invoking my mothers name shes a big deal oh and a promise he added that if it happens again you go in for xrays as an outpatient he laid a hand over hers squeezed this isnt something you can ignore kate you have to take care of this and yourself she fell silent again it was all too embarrassing and there were still little hot licks of panic flickering in her stomach when she opened her eyes again she saw the moonkissed sweep of big sur the rise of cliffs the flash of forests the wild curve of the road with thin mists of fog hovering tears stung her eyes shed asked him to take her home and hed understood home was templeton house the lights were glowing against the windows glowing in a warmth and welcome that was as dependable as sunrise she could smell the flowers hear the sea even before he had fully stopped the car at the top of the drive the door swung open laura raced out oh honey are you all right her robe swirling around her legs laura wrenched open the car door and all but absorbed kate into her arms ive been so worried its all right its so silly i then she spotted ann hurrying out and nearly broke there darling girl crooning ann tucked an arm around kates waist lets get you inside now i but it was too easy to just let her head rest on anns shoulder here were memories of warm cookies and sweet tea of soft sheets and cool hands byron laura cast a distracted look back at him im so grateful you called i she looked toward kate already halfway to the house with ann please come in let me get you some coffee no ill head on home it was obvious that laura was oblivious to everyone but kate ill come by later and see how she is go ahead thank you thank you so much she dashed away he watched her catch up and flank kate on the other side the three of them slipped into the house as one she slept for twelve hours and awakened rested and dazed she was in the room of her middle childhood the wallpaper was the same the subtle pastel stripes the blinds of her late adolescence had been replaced by lace curtains that swayed at the open windows they had been kates grandmothers had hung in her own mothers bedroom aunt susie had thought they would bring her comfort when she had first settled in templeton house and shed been right they brought her comfort now there had been many a morning kate had lain in the big soft fourposter and watched those curtains flutter and felt her parents close if she could just talk to them now she thought just try to understand why her father had done what he had done but what comfort would there be in that what excuse could possibly justify it she had to concentrate on the now had to find a way to live in the now and yet how could she not drift back it was the house most of all she supposed it held so many memories there was history here eras people ghosts like the cliffs the forests those wildly shaped cypress trees it held magic she turned her face into the pillow encased in irish linen ann always saw to it that the bed linen was scented lightly with lemon there were flowers on the night table a waterford vase filled with sweetsmelling freesia a note was propped against it recognizing lauras handwriting she stirred herself to reach out kate i didnt want to wake you when i left margo and i are at the shop this morning we dont want to see you there annie has agreed to lock you in your room if necessary youre to take your next dose at eleven sharp unless you sleep through it one of us will come home at lunchtime youre expected to stay in bed if you ever scare us like this againill threaten you in person i love you laura just like her kate mused and set the note aside but she couldnt very well stay in bed all day too much thinking time in bed no she decided to call it by its name brooding time so she would find something to keep her from brooding her briefcase had to be somewhere she decided shed just and what do you think youre about young lady ann sullivan stood in the doorway with a tray in her hand and a hard light in her eyes i was going to go to the bathroom thats all cautiously kate finished climbing out of bed and ducked into the adjoining bath smiling ann set down the tray and moved to fluff the pillows all her girls thought they could lie when the chips were down she mused and only margo was any good at it she waited her back soldier straight until kate came back in then ann merely pointed at the bed now im going to see to it that you eat take your medicine and behave yourself with smooth efficiency ann fit the tray over kates lap an ulcer is it well were not putting up with that no indeed now mrs williamson has fixed you some nice soft scrambled eggs and toast and theres herb tea she says chamomile will soothe your innards youll eat the fruit too the melons very mild yes maam she felt as though she could eat for hours annie im sorry for what for being knotheaded well you should be but she sat on the edge of the bed and in the timehonored fashion laid her hand over kates brow to test for fever working yourself up until youre sick and look at you miss kate nothing but a bag of bones eat every bite of those eggs i thought it was heartburn she murmured then bit her lip or cancer what is this nonsense appalled ann snagged kates chin in her hand you were worrying you had cancer and did nothing about it well i figured if it was heartburn i could live with it and if it was cancer id just die anyway she grimaced at the violent glare i feel like such a fool im glad to hear it for you are clucking her tongue annie poured kates tea miss kate i love you but never in my life have i been more angry with anyone no you dont dont you dare tear up while im yelling at you kate sniffled took the tissue ann held out and blew her nose fiercely im sorry she said again be sorry then exasperated she handed over another tissue i thought margo was the only one of you who could make me crazy you may have waited twenty years to do it my girl but youve matched her did you once tell your family you were feeling poorly did you once think what it would mean to us if you ended up in the hospital i thought i could handle it well you couldnt could you no eat those eggs before theyre cold theres mrs williamson down in the kitchen fretting over you and old joe the gardener cutting his precious freesia so you could wake to them thats to say nothing of margo who kept me on the phone thirty minutes or more this morning so worked up over you she is and mr josh who came by and looked in on you before he would go on to his work and do you think miss laura got a wink of sleep last night as she lectured ann piled toast with raspberry preserves and handed it to kate thats to say nothing of how the templetons are going to feel when they hear oh annie please dont dont tell them ann said with a fierce look at kate is that what you were going to say missy dont tell the people who loved and cared for you who gave you a home and a family no one kate thought miserably piled on jam or shame like ann sullivan no ill call them myself today thats better and when youre feeling more yourself youre going to go and thank mr de witt in person for taking care of you i foreseeing fresh humiliation kate toyed with her eggs i did thank him and youll thank him again she glanced up as a maid knocked quietly on the open door excuse me these just arrived for miss powell she carried in a long white florists box and set it on the foot of the bed thank you jenny wait just a moment and well see what vase well use no you finish eating ann continued ill open this she undid the bow opened the lid and the room was filled with the scent of roses two dozen longstemmed yellows bloomed against a bed of glossy green she allowed herself one quiet feminine sigh fetch the baccarat will you jenny the tall one in the library breakfront yes maam now i know im sick cheered kate plucked up the envelope imagine margo sending me a bunch of flowers but when she tore out the card her jaw dropped not from margo i take it with the privilege of time and affection ann slipped the card out of kates fingers and read relax byron well well well its nothing to well about hes just feeling sorry for me two dozen yellow roses are something aside from sympathy girl thats moving toward romance hardly seduction anyway kate remembered the wild embrace in his kitchen hot intense rudely interrupted maybe sort of if i was the seducing type we all are thank you jenny ill take it from here ann took the vase from the maid and went into the bathroom to fill it she wasnt surprised and not just a little pleased to see kate sniffing thoughtfully at one of the blooms when she came back drink your tea now while i arrange these its a relaxing thing arranging flowers she took a pair of scissors from the old kneehole desk spread the tissue that had covered the flowers on the dresser and got to work something you take your time about enjoy plunking them by the handful into a handy vase doesnt bring any joy kate dragged her thoughts away from detailing a list of byron de witts qualities confident kind interfering sexy meddlesome sexy it gets the job done if thats all youre after in my opinion miss kate youve always been in a hurry to get the job done whatever it may be youve forgotten the pleasure of doing rushing through something to get to the next something might be productive but its not fun i have fun kate muttered do you now from what ive seen youve even turned your weekly treasure hunts into a scheduled chore let me ask you this if you were by some wild chance in your quest for efficiency to stumble over seraphinas dowry what would you do with it do with it thats what i asked would you take the riches and sail around the world lie on some lazy beach buy a fancy car or would you invest it in mutual funds and taxfree bonds properly invested money makes money ann slipped a stem gently into the vase and for what so it can pile up neatly in some vault is that the only means to the end or end to the means not that you havent done a tidy job with helping me build up a fine nest egg darling but youve got to have dreams and sometimes they have to be beyond your immediate reach i have plans i didnt say plans i said dreams wasnt it odd ann mused her own daughter had always dreamed too much miss laura had dreamed simple dreams that had broken her heart and little miss kate had never let herself dream enough what are you waiting for darling to be as old as me before you indulge yourself enjoy yourself youre not old annie kate said softly youll never be old tell that to the lines that crop up on my face daily but she smiled as she turned what are you waiting for katie i dont know exactly her gaze shifted to the crystal vase behind ann filled to bursting with yellow flowers that glowed like sunlight she could if she bothered to count on one hand the number of times a man had sent her roses i havent really thought about it then its time you did top of the list is what makes kate happy youre good at list making god knows she said briskly then went to the closet for the robe kate always left in her room at templeton house now you can sit out on the terrace in the sun for a while you sit there and do nothing but dream for a bit chapter nine contents prev next a week of pampering was excellent medicine for kate it was also nearly an overdose yet anytime she made noises about going home and getting back to work everyone within earshot ganged up on her telling herself she would turn over a new leaf if it killed her she struggled to let it ride to go with the flow to take life as it came and wondered how anyone could live that way she reminded herself that it was a gorgeous evening that she was sitting in the garden with a child snuggled in her lap another at her feet her ulcer if it was an ulcer hadnt given her any real trouble in days and she had found there in the home of her childhood a peace that had been missing i wish you could live with us forever and ever aunt kate kayla looked up her gray eyes soft in her angels face wed never let you get sick or worry too much aunt margo says youre a professional nitpicker ali giggled at the term and carefully brushed pink polish on kates toenails whats a nit aunt margo wasnt it bad enough kate thought that she was going to have hotpink toenails without adding insult to injury good thing for her i happen to like nits if you didnt go back to your apartment we could play with you every day for kayla this was the ultimate bribe and you and mama could have tea parties like annie said you used to when you were little we can all have tea parties when i come visit kate reminded her thats more special but if you lived here you wouldnt have to pay rent ali capped the polish and looked entirely too wise for a ten year old until you regain your financial feet a fresh smile flitted around kates mouth whered you get that youre always saying stuff like that ali smiled and pressed her cheek against kates knee and mamas working a lot now and nothings the way it used to be its better with you here i like being with you too touched and torn kate stroked alis curly hair a sunshineyellow butterfly flitted through the air and landed gracefully in the cup of a red petunia for a moment kate caressed the child and watched the butterflys wings gently open and close as it fed how hard would it be she wondered to simply stay here like this forever just drift forget everything not hard at all she realized and wasnt that part of the reason it wasnt possible for her i have to go back to my own place that doesnt mean i wont spend lots of time with you every sunday for sure so we can find all of seraphinas gold she looked up in relief at the sound of footsteps if this kept up shed be ready to agree to anything her nieces wanted theres the nit now margo only raised an elegant eyebrow as the girls giggled ill consider that a private joke im too jazzed to be annoyed with you look after tugging up her sleek linen tunic she pulled out the elastic waist of her slacks i couldnt get my skirt zipped this morning im starting to show her face glowing she turned to the side can you tell you look like a beached whale kate said dryly but kayla bounced up and rushed over to press an ear against margos tummy i cant hear him yet she complained are you sure hes in there absolutely sure but i cant guarantee the he part abruptly her lips trembled her eyes filled kate it moved this afternoon i was helping a customer decide between an armani and a donna karan and i felt this this fluttering i felt the baby move i felt i felt she broke off and burst into wild tears oh jesus jolting up kate gathered the goggleeyed girls and nudged them toward the flagstone path this is a good thing she assured them shes crying because shes happy tell mrs williamson we want a whole jug of lemonade the kind she makes that fizzes whirling back to margo she hugged her close i was only kidding before youre not fat i want to be fat margo sobbed i want to waddle i want to stop being able to sleep on my stomach okay torn between amusement and concern kate patted her okay honey you will in fact i think youre already starting to waddle a little really margo sniffed caught herself oh shit listen to me im crazy im doing this kind of thing all the time these days i felt the baby move kate im going to have a baby i dont know anything about being a mother im so scared im so happy hell ive wrecked my mascara thank god shes coming back a little shaky herself she eased margo into a chair what does josh do when you have one of these crying jags passes the tissues great without much hope kate searched her pockets i dont have any i do margo sniffed and blew and sighed wacky hormones she used a fresh tissue to dab then ran an expert hand over her fancy french braid i came out here to see how you were feeling unlike you there doesnt seem to be anything going on in my stomach its fine i think that ulcer business was just bullshit recovered margo lifted a brow oh do you do you really because she recognized that tone kate braced for a fight dont start on me ive waited for days to start on you but youre feeling fine now so i can tell you youre an insensitive selfish idiot you sent everyone who has the poor judgment to care about you into a tailspin of worry oh and it would have been sensitive and selfless of me to whine and complain which youre an expert at and take care of yourself margo finished see a doctor no not you youre too smart for that too busy for that get off my back pal ive just climbed on and im staying there like that monkey in the story youve had a week of everyone patting your head and stroking you now you can take your dose of reality mr and mrs t are on their way back here guilt heaped on kates head why theres no need for them to come all this way its just a stupid ulcer ah now you admit its an ulcer margo popped up again whirled around the chair if this was a twelvestep program youd have made it to step one theyd have been on the first plane the minute laura called them but she and josh convinced them everything was under control and to finish up their business first but nothing would stop them from seeing for themselves that their kate was well i talked to them myself i told them it was nothing major no no nothing major you get suspended under suspicion of embezzlement end up in the er nothing for them to worry about she propped her hands on her hips who the hell do you think you are i josh is furious blaming it all on bittle and beating himself up because he didnt jump on them the minute they axed you that has nothing to do with it kate sprang up as well her shouts matching margos decibel for decibel josh has nothing to do with it thats just like you thats just perfectly like you nobody has anything to do with anything when it applies to you thats why lauras been blaming herself for not paying attention to how you were feeling what you were doing that doesnt mean a damn to you with fizzing lemonade sloshing in a glass pitcher laura all but ran toward the sounds of battle whats going on here margo stop yelling at her shut up margo and kate shouted in unison as they faced off i could hear you all the way in the kitchen struggling not to slam glass on glass laura set the pitcher down on the table wideeyed and fascinated her daughters watched the threeway bout i have to yell margo insisted to get the sound through that thick head of hers youre too busy feeling sorry for her to yell dont drag laura into this but even as she said it kate whirled on laura and you have no business blaming yourself for my problems you are not responsible for me if you took better care of yourself laura snapped back no one would have to be responsible for you ladies not sure whether he should be amused or wary josh stepped behind his nieces took the glasses they carried out of their hands is this any way to throw a party stay out of this kates voice vibrated with fury all of you stay out of my life i dont need to be watched over and worried over im perfectly capable of making yourself sick margo finished everybody gets sick kate roared everybody has pain and those who are capable seek help laura put her hands on kates shoulders and firmly shoved her into a chair if youd had any sense youd have gone to the doctor gone into the hospital for tests instead you act like an idiot and send the entire family into an uproar i couldnt go to the hospital you know i cant cant remembering laura rubbed her hands over her face this is where temper got you she thought sniping at a hurting friend okay her voice gentle now she eased onto the arm of kates chair when her eyes met margos she saw that margo had also remembered kates shuddering childhood fear thats done now you have to start taking care so it doesnt happen again which means you have to start practicing to be human margo said but there wasnt any sting in it are they still mad kayla whispered still clutching joshs trouser leg with one hand maybe a little but i think its safe now mama never yells unsettled uneasy ali chewed on her nails she never yells she used to yell at me it takes a lot to make her yell it has to really really matter and once she hit me right in the nose josh said fascinated kayla reached up and rubbed her fingers over joshs nose as he bent down did it bleed and everything and everything kate and margo had to pull her off me then she felt really bad then he grinned even though i started it what do you say we have some of that lemonade ali walked behind her uncle and studied her mother with a curious and considering eye it had to be done kate reminded herself it was sunday morning her aunt and uncle were expected by midafternoon before she faced them she had to face byron it was her new plan for a healthy life deal with your personal and emotional problems as carefully as you dealt with the practical ones why she wondered was it so much harder shed secretly hoped he wouldnt be home a lot of people went to brunch on sunday mornings or to the beach somewhere but both of his cars were in the drive even parked behind them she could hear the music pounding out of the windows creedence clearwater revival she spent a moment listening to john fogertys fervent warning about a bad moon on the rise she hoped it wasnt an omen it was difficult to reconcile a man with his looks smooth elegant and his obvious preference for downanddirty rock and edgy motown well she wasnt here to analyze his musical tastes she was here to thank him and then turn the page on this awkward chapter in her life prompting herself as she went kate got out of the car started toward the house she would be casual brief friendly cheerful she would turn the whole matter into a joke on herself show the proper appreciation for his consideration and concern and get out she drew a breath rubbed her hands over the thighs of her jeans then knocked and laughed at herself superman wouldnt have heard a knock over the blast of ccr she pressed the doorbell hard at the tinny notes of hail hail the gangs all here she gaped in shock then shook with laughter enjoying the absurdity she pressed it again then a third time he came to the door sweaty and incredibly sexy in tattered shorts and a sweatshirt with the sleeves torn off the doorbell tune isnt mine he said immediately i cant change it until after the settlement i betthats what you tell everyone she indulged herself with a long thorough look did i interrupt a wrestling match weight lifting he stepped back come on in look i can come back when youre not busy pumping iron christ he had amazing muscles everywhere how had she missed that i was nearly finished anyway gatorade he held up the bottle in his hand and when she shook her head glugged from it himself how are you feeling fine thats why i dropped by to he leaned close closed the door behind her and made her jump to tell you i was fine and to thank you for things the flowers they were nice any flareups no its not a big deal really nervous she shrugged her shoulders rubbed her palms together one out of ten people ends up with a peptic ulcer all socioeconomic levels too theres no clear evidence that they hit on you know people with a lot of stress and harried schedules been researching have we a smile flirted around his mouth well it seemed the logical thing to do all in all uhhuh and did your research also reveal that people with chronic anxiety tend to be more susceptible and to aggravate the condition she dipped her restless hands in her pockets maybe sit down he gestured to the single chair before he walked over to turn down the music i cant stay my aunt and uncle are coming in today their flights not due until twothirty hed know of course she caught herself twisting her fingers together and made herself stop yes but i have things to do and so do you so ill just she was saved by a scrabbling sound and the surprising sight of two running balls of yellow fur oh god automatically she went down on her knees and caught the deliri ously happy puppies in her arms oh youre so cute arent you sweet arent you wonderful in unanimous agreement they bathed her face with eager tongues yipped and wiggled crawling over each other to get closer thats nip and tuck byron informed her as he got down on the floor with them which is which he sent one puppy into slanteyed ecstasy by scratching a furry belly i dont know i figured wed work it out with time ive only had them a couple of days kate picked one up to nuzzle and forgot shed been anxious to get in and out what are they a little of this and a little of that some golden retriever some lab before the second puppy could desert her she kissed his nose followed you home right i adopted them from the animal shelter theyre eight weeks old byron found the remnants of a wellchewed rawhide bone on the floor and skidded it over the polished wood for the pups to chase mind if i ask what youre going to do with two puppies when youre at work take them with me for a while i figure i can fence in part of the backyard and theyll have each other for company when im not here they came barreling back jumped him i was only going to get one but then well theyre brothers and it seemed only fair he glanced over found her smiling at him what you wouldnt know it to look at you wouldnt know what youre a sucker he shrugged tossed the bone again id think a practical woman like you would see the value of taking both a backup dog is a sensible plan yeah right jesus kate have you ever been in one of those shelters they break your heart he tolerated wet sloppy kisses from the rebounding puppies theyre doing a great job dont get me wrong but all those cats and dogs just waiting for somebody to come along and take them or yeah or she reached over rubbing her hand over the dog in his lap you saved them her gaze came back to his youre good at that he reached out curled a hand around her calf and slid her over until their knees bumped i tend to get attached to things i save you look good anticipating her he kept his hand on her leg and kept her from scooting back rested i didnt do much more than rest all week and eat she smiled a little i gained three pounds well strike up the band it may not seem like much to you ace but ive spent most of my life trying to develop something resembling a figure i tried everything you read about in the back of magazines and sunday supplements he had to grin get out of here no really there i was faced with margo who i think was born built and lauras feminine little body i always looked like their undernourished younger brother you dont look like anyones younger brother kate believe me feeling foolishly flattered she shrugged anyway despite the amazing weight gain and the lack of symptoms he interrupted you are going to see your regular doctor i dont have much choice my familys ganged up on me thats what familys for you gave us a scare i know ive been lectured by experts on my careless selfish ways he smiled and patted her legs sting bigtime im thinking about just having im sorry tattooed on my forehead so i dont have to keep repeating myself and speaking of apologies she blew out a breath fluttered her bangs i was going to try to get out of here without bringing this up but im trying to reform her brows knit as they did whenever she had to face a thorny problem or unsettling task this qualified for both the other night before i had my little attack we were on our way to the floor as i remember he reached over the puppy that had fallen asleep in his lap brushed at the hair above her ear looks like we got there after all what i want to say is that things got out of hand my fault as much as yours she added faults assigned when theres a mistake thats my point she should have known it wouldnt be simple nip or tuck was draped across her thigh snoring she busied herself with stroking his head we dont i dont jump into bed with men i hardly know it was going to be the floor he reminded her he still had a hard time going into his own kitchen without imagining what might have been and i never assumed you did otherwise it wouldnt be two years since youve had sex her mouth dropped open where did you get an idea like that you mentioned it he said easily when i was trying to get your clothes off she closed her mouth let air out her nose oh well that only strengthens my point uneasy she watched him gently lift the puppy from his lap and set it aside where it curled deeper into sleep what happened was just a moment he repeated the procedure with the second puppy kates heart began to thud a hormone burst uhhuh he didnt even touch her just leaned forward until his mouth slid expertly over hers kate could almost feel her mind tilt and her brains flow out well she needed a distraction didnt she an outlet for all this tension it seemed like the most sensible thing in the world to unfold her legs wrap them around his waist and dive in this only proves it she murmured she threaded her hands through his hair and gripped proves im right shut up kate okay it was wonderfully brutally hot she hadnt known until that instant how cold she had been until his unshaven cheeks rubbed roughly over her skin she hadnt known how soft she could be or how gratifying it could be to be the soft one she let out a long grateful moan when his hands streaked under her tshirt to stroke her back slid around to cup and squeeze her tingling breasts the flick of his thumbs over her nipples shot a bolt of heat through her center that vibrated achingly in her crotch arching back she pulled his head down until his mouth replaced his hands he suckled through cotton tormenting himself with fantasies of what her flesh would feel like taste like sliding under his tongue she was so slight that neat almost boyish torso should never have appealed to him there was no womanly flare of hip and her breasts were small and firm and warm the way she moved against him that edgy eagerness of a woman already teetering on the edge was viciously arousing he wanted needed to shove her back rip aside that denim and drive himself inside her until they were both screaming instead he dragged his mouth back to hers slid a hand between their bodies and sent her freefalling over the edge he shuddered himself when she convulsed ordered himself to breathe when her head dropped limply on his shoulder well he thought that should hold one of us it took her a moment to realize that hed stopped was just holding her what she managed why the dazed questions nearly made him smile i decided i didnt want it to be a hormone burst for either of us he eased her back studied her flushed face the heavy glazed eyes better now i dont think couldnt think i dont know dont you want to he crushed his mouth to hers in a kiss that tasted of dark and swirling frustration does that answer your question taking her by the shoulders he gave her a quick satisfying shake youre trying to confuse me part of her brain was starting to regenerate and with it temper this is some kinky version of gaslight this time he did smile god youre a pain in the ass listen to me katherine i want you i havent the smallest clue why but i just want the hell out of you if id followed my first instinct youd be flat on your back naked and id be feeling a lot better than i do right now but ill be goddamned if youre going to pick yourself up afterward and claim i just helped you end your sexual drought her eyes snapped back into focus thats a hideous thing to say yeah it is and thats just how youd have rationalized it im not giving you the chance what i am doing is giving you the chance to get used to the idea of having me as a lover of all the just keep quiet for once he said mildly were going to take this slow go out together in public have a few reasonable conversations take some time to figure each other out in other words its going to be all your way he angled his head nodded yeah that sums it up when she tried to wriggle free he simply sighed and held her in place honey im as stubborn as you are and a hell of a lot stronger that puts me one up youre not going to keep me here when i dont want to be here he gave her a friendly kiss on the nose you may be a scrapper but youve got toothpick arms we can work on that he added ignoring the strangled sounds she made in fact theres no time like the present she thought shed had all the shocks she could handle for one morning but she got a fresh one when he hauled her up and slung her over his shoulder are you insane put me down you musclebound son of a bitch ill have you hauled in for assault its muscles were going to deal with he said mildly as he carted her into an adjoining room believe me theres nothing like a good workout to relieve tension considering your ulcer and your desire to gain weight this is something you should add to your daily routine he set her down caught the fist she swung at him in his hand gave it an affectionate squeeze you want to be able to put some power behind that punch well work on your biceps this isnt happening she said and closed her eyes im not even here we need to work on diet and nutrition too but well get to that they were going to get to a lot of things he thought as soon as she didnt look as if he could knock her flat with one exhale right now i think you should start off with threepounders he took two metal dumbbells from a rack youll work up to five youre going to want to go buy yourself some girl weights she opened her eyes again did you say girl weights no offense they make these nice plasticcoated sets of free weights in colors he put a weight into each of her hands curled her fingers around them the only thing that stopped her from dropping them on his feet was curiosity why are you doing this you mean besides because i find myself oddly attracted to you he smiled into her eyes as he positioned her elbows at her waist i think im starting to like you now pretend youre lifting and lowering these through mud concentrate on your biceps and keep your elbows in place i dont want to lift weights hadnt this man just minutes ago taken her to rough and blistering orgasm i want to hit you just think about how much harder youll be able to hit me once youve got some muscle he guided her arms down then up just like that but resist both ways these are too light its silly they wont feel so light after a few sets youre going to work up a nice sweat before im finished with you she sent him a sweet smile yeah thats what i thought before pleased with herself she lowered the weights lifted them then her brain flashed goddamn you byron are you saving me again he stepped behind her positioned her shoulders just pump iron kid well work out the details later chapter ten contents prev next it was always good to have aunt susan and uncle tommy home kate had worried that something would show in her face or worse that there would be something in theirs the knowledge of crimes past the doubt of her own innocence but there had been only concern and acceptance their visit also meant extending her stay at templeton house it was difficult seeing them every day with the questions she tried to ignore drumming in the back of her mind questions she couldnt bring herself to ask she used the routine to carve out the path she intended to follow days at the shop work to challenge the brain and keep it busy evenings with her family to soothe the heart the occasional date with byron to keep her on her toes he was a new element seeing him wondering about him helped keep her from brooding about the turn her life had taken shed decided to think of him as a kind of experiment kate preferred that term to relationship and it wasnt an altogether unpleasant experiment a few dinners a movie now and again perhaps a walk on the cliffs then there were those long stirring kisses he apparently loved to indulge in kisses that had her heart flopping in her chest like a landed trout sent her senses cartwheeling into each other then ended leaving her aching and baffled and itchy the entire relationship no experiment she corrected left him far too much in control now that she was feeling a little steadier all right healthier she was going to work on balancing the power thats good to see susan templeton stood at the doorway her arm tucked through her husbands our kate never did enough daydreaming did she tommy not our sensible girl he closed the door to the office behind them he and his wife had worked out the logistics of this maneuver and following their plan they flanked the small desk where kate had been pretending to work i was trying to calculate our advertising budget for the next quarter she flipped the screen saver onto her monitor if youre smart you two will hide in here before margo can put you to work i promised her a couple of hours thomas winked she thinks she charmed me into it but i get a kick out of working that old cash register maybe youll give me some tips on salesmanship i cant quite get the knack of it love what you sell katie girl even if you hate it he cast an experienced eye around the office noted the tidy shelves the organized work space somebodys been streamlining in here nobody puts things and people in their place better than kate susan laid a hand over kates kept her soft blue eyes level why havent you put bittle in his kate shook her head because shed been waiting for days for one of them to bring it up she didnt panic she had her rationale ready its not important but susans eyes stayed on hers calm patient waiting it was too important she corrected im not going to let it matter to me now you listen here girl tommy susan murmured no he cut his wife off with a snap of sizzling temper in contrast to susan his slategray eyes were sizzling i know you wanted to softpedal this business susie but damned if i will he loomed over the desk a tall man powerfully built well used to taking control be it in business or family i expected better of you kate letting yourself get run roughshod over giving up without a fight turning your back on something you worked for your whole life worse getting yourself sick over it instead of standing up to it im ashamed of you those were words hed never said to her before words shed worked her entire life to keep him from saying now they struck her like a backhanded slap i i never took any money of course you didnt take any money i did the best i could i know i let you down im sorry were not talking about me he shot back were talking about you youve let yourself down no i ashamed of her he was ashamed of her and angry i put everything i had into my job i tried to i thought i was on the fast track to partner and then youd so the first time you take a knock you crumble he leaned forward poking his finger at her is that your answer no unable to face him she stared at her hands no they had evidence i dont know how because i swear to you i never took any money give us some credit katherine susan said quietly but they had the forms my signature the breath was backing up in her lungs if id pushed they might have filed charges it might have gone to court id have to youd have to i know people are whispering about it and thats embarrassing for you but if we just leave it alone itll pass itll just pass this time susan held up a hand before her husband could interrupt she too was accustomed to control youre concerned that were embarrassed it all reflects its all of a piece isnt it she squeezed her eyes tightly shut i know that what i do reflects on you if i can just wait it out build something here with the shop i know i owe you what bullshit is this thomas exploded hush tommy susan sat back folded her hands id like kate to finish what do you owe us kate everything she looked up then eyes swimming everything everything i hate disappointing you knowing ive disappointed you i had no way to stop it to prepare for it if i could fix it if i could go back and fix she broke off shuddering as she realized she was mixing past and present i know how much youve given me and i wanted to pay you back once id made partner it would have been a proper return on our investment susan concluded she got slowly to her feet because every muscle in her body was tingling that is insulting arrogant and cruel aunt susie be quiet do you actually believe we expect payment for loving you how dare you think such a thing but i meant i know what you meant all but shaking with fury she clutched her husbands shoulder you think we took you into our home into our lives because we felt pity for the poor orphaned child do you think it was charity worse the kind of charity that comes with strings and expectations oh yes she continued fired up now the templetons are known for their charitable works i assume we fed you clothed you educated you because we wanted the community to witness our largesse and we loved you comforted you admired you disciplined you because we expected you to grow into a successful woman who would then pay us back for our time and effort with the importance of her position rather than interrupt what he couldnt have said better himself thomas handed kate a handkerchief so she could wipe her streaming eyes susan leaned over the desk her voice was low had remained low even in anger yes we pitied the little girl who had lost her parents so tragically so brutally so unfairly our hearts ached for the child who looked so lost and so brave but ill tell you something katherine louise powell the minute you stepped through the door of templeton house you became ours ours you were my child then and you still are and the only things any of my children owe me or their father is love and respect dont you ever ever throw my love in my face again she turned on her heel sailed out of the room and let the door click quietly behind her thomas huffed out a long breath his wifes tirades were few and far between but they were brilliant put your foot in it didnt you katie girl oh uncle tommy she could see the world shed tried to piece back together shattered in her hands i dont know what to do start by coming over here when shed crawled into his lap and buried her face in his chest he rocked her never knew such a bright child could be so stupid im screwing everything up i dont know what to do i just dont know how to fix it whats wrong with me plenty id say but nothing that cant be mended she was so angry with me well that can be mended too you know one of your problems kate youve focused on figures so long you think everything has to add up and be equal its just not true with people and feelings i never wanted to bring either of you into this to hurt you remind you she broke off shook her head fiercely i always wanted to be the best for you the best in school in sports everything and we admired your competitive spirit but not when it eats a hole in your gut exhausted from tears she laid her head against his shoulder it was cowardice she thought that had eaten that hole in her gut now she had to face it all what had been what was and what would come im going to fix things uncle tommy take my advice and give susie a little time to cool off she gets hard of hearing when her tempers on boil okay kate drew a deep breath and sat up then i guess ill start with bittle his face broke into a huge grin now thats my kate in the parking lot of bittle and associates kate flipped down her rearview mirror to take one last critical look at her face margo had performed a little miracle shed dragged kate upstairs and with cold compresses eyedrops lotions and makeup had erased all traces of damage kate decided she no longer looked as though she had spent twenty minutes bawling like a scolded child she looked efficient composed and determined that was perfect she told herself it didnt bother her that conversations stopped when she sailed into the firstfloor lobby she didnt mind the stares and murmurs the strained smiles and curiositylaced greetings they were in fact an eyeopener the few people who greeted her warmly who detoured to stop her on her march to the second floor and offer support showed her that shed made more friends at bittle than shed realized it took only one twist of the corridor to bring kate face to face with the dragon newman raised a brow gave kate one brief chilly stare ms powell may i help you im on my way to see marty do you have an appointment kate angled her chin the fingers gripping the handle of her briefcase tightened ill take that up with marty and his secretary why dont you go tell mr bittle senior that the disgraced associate has invaded the hallowed halls like a swiss guard protecting royalty newman shifted her stance i see no reason for you to kate roger poked his head out of his office rolled his eyes behind newmans back and beamed a smile good to see you i was hoping youd make it by oh ms newman ive got that report mr bittle senior needed like a magician pulling a rabbit out of his hat roger produced a sheaf of papers he was anxious to see it very well she shot kate one last warning glance then hurried down the hallway thanks kate murmured i think we might have come to blows my money was on you he put a supportive hand on her shoulder this situation really sucks id have called you but i didnt know what to say he dropped his hand stuck it in his pocket how to act it doesnt matter i didnt have anything to say myself until now now she had plenty to say listen he nudged her toward his office door but didnt kate noted wryly invite her inside i dont know how much pressure your lawyers putting on my lawyer templeton the partners went into a powwow after he came in and stirred them up maybe thats a good thing i dont know youve got to handle it the way you think best i can tell you that it looks like the partners are divided over whether or not to pursue and prosecute his brow creased and his voice like a conspirators was low and dramatic amandas leading the charge and bittle juniors behind her my take is that calvin and senior are on the fence with marty solidly against its always good to know whos in your corner and whos going for your throat kate murmured all this craziness over a lousy seventyfive k roger said in disgust its not like you killed anyone kate stepped back studied his face stealing is stealing seventyfive cents or seventyfive k and i didnt take any money i didnt say you did i didnt mean it that way but there was doubt in his voice even as he took her hand to squeeze it i meant everybody overreacted i get the impression that if you came up with the money it would all go away slowly firmly she drew her hand free would it i know its a lousy deal either way but hell kate the templetons sneeze that much money away every day it would offset the chance of you being charged ruining your whole damn life sometimes youve got to choose between the rock and the hard place and sometimes youve got to stick thanks for the advice kate he took a step after her but she didnt stop or look back with a shrug he went back into his office word was already out marty came to his door personally to meet her he offered his hand shook hers in a friendly professional manner kate im glad you came by come inside i should have come before she began as she followed him past his secretary who was doing her best to look busy and disinterested i thought you would want anything coffee no it was the same old marty she thought as she took her seat from the wrinkled shirtsleeves to the affable smile im cutting back i want to say first that i appreciate you seeing me like this i know you didnt skim any funds kate the quiet statement stopped the neat little opening speech shed prepared if you know that why well why i know it he said because i know you the signatures the forms indicated otherwise but im sure as im sitting here that theres another explanation he wagged a finger signaling her that he wasnt finished but was formulating his thoughts the gesture nearly made her smile it was so famil iar so marty certain people ah believe that i feel so strongly in this matter because im attracted to you well thats just silly actually i am was am stopping himself he rubbed his hands over his rapidly coloring face kate i love my wife i would never that is other than the occasional thought which i would never act on i would never never he finished leaving her quite literally speechless um was all she could think of in response im not bringing that up to embarrass either one of us though it seems to have done just that he cleared his throat as he rose and with nervous hands poured two mugs of coffee as he handed her one he remembered sorry you said you didnt want any ill take it what was a little afterburn in comparison with staggered shock thanks i only mentioned that because people who know me well have sort of noticed that i not that youve done anything to encourage or that i would have done anything even if you had i get the picture marty she allowed a breath to ease quietly through her lips studied his wide harmless homely face im flattered it muddies the waters so to speak im sorry for that but i feel your record with this firm stands for itself ill continue to do everything i can to prevent formal charges being filed and to get to the bottom of this situation i dont think i appreciated you enough when i worked here she set her mug aside and rose marty i want to talk to the partners all of them i think its time i took a stand he nodded as though hed merely been waiting for her to say so ill see if i can arrange it it didnt take him long he might have been considered the puppy dog of bittle but he knew what buttons to push within thirty minutes kate was again seated at the long polished table in the conference room in keeping with the strategy shed outlined on the drive over she made eye contact with each partner then settled her gaze firmly on bittle senior ive come here today without my lawyer in an effort to keep this meeting informal even personal i realize your time is valuable and i appreciate each of you taking that time to listen to what i have to say she paused once again glanced at the faces around the table once again addressed herself to the senior partner and founder i worked for this firm for nearly six years i dedicated my professional and a good deal of my personal life to it my goals were not selfless i worked very hard to bring in accounts to keep accounts assigned to me satisfied and viable in order to increase bittles revenue and reputation with the ultimate aim of sitting at this table as a partner not once during my employment here did i ever take one penny from an account i was raised as you know mr bittle by people who value integrity it is your accounts that remain in question ms powell amanda put in briskly your signature if youve come here today with an explanation we are prepared to hear it i havent come here for explanations i havent come to answer questions or to ask them ive come here to make a statement i have never done anything illegal or unethical if there is a discrepancy in the accounts i am not responsible for it im prepared to make this same statement if necessary to each client involved just as i am prepared to go to court and defend myself against these charges her hands were beginning to shake so she gripped them tightly together under the table if charges are not brought and this matter is not satisfactorily resolved within thirty days i will advise my attorney to file suit against bittle and associates for unjustified termination and slander you would dare to threaten this firm though his voice was quiet and clipped lawrence fisted a hand on the table its not a threat she said coolly even as her stomach jittered and churned my career has been sabotaged my reputation impugned if you believe i would sit idly by and do nothing about that then im not surprised that you believe i would embezzle from my accounts because you dont know me at all bittle leaned back in his chair he steepled his hands considered its taken you some time to come around to this position kate yes it has this job meant everything to me im starting to believe that everything is just too much i couldnt have stolen from you mr bittle you of all people know me well enough to be sure of that she waited a moment wanting him to remember her personally if you want a question to ponder she continued ask yourselves this why would i have pilfered a measly seventyfive thousand when if i had needed or wanted money i would only have had to go to my family why would i have worked my butt off for this firm all these years when i could have taken a top position in the templeton organization at any time we have asked ourselves those questions kate bittle told her and those questions are the very reason this matter hasnt been resolved she rose slowly then ill give you the answer im not sure its an attractive one but i know the answer is pride im too goddamn proud to have taken a dollar from this firm that wasnt mine and im too proud to do nothing when im accused of embezzlement ms devin gentlemen thank you for your time she shifted her gaze smiled thanks marty not a single murmur followed her out the door she stopped shaking when she hit highway and realized where her instincts were taking her even before she pulled her car to the shoulder got out to walk toward the cliffs she was calm again there were fences to mend work to do responsibilities to handle but for a moment there was just kate and the soothing roar of the sea today it was sapphire that perfect blue that called to lovers and poets and pirates the foam far below the lapped shale and rock was like the froth of lace on the hem of a womans velvet skirt she climbed down a ways enjoying the swirl of wind the taste of salt and sea that flavored it wild grasses and flowers defied the elements and grew fighting their way out of thin soil and cracks in stone gulls wheeled overhead their breasts as white as moonlight the golden sun flashing off their spread wings diamonds glittered on the water and further out whitecaps rode the sea like fine horses the music never stopped she thought the ebb and flow the crash and thunder the eerily female screams of the gulls how often had she come here to sit to watch to think she couldnt count the number of hours sometimes she was pulled here simply to be other times to sit in solitude and work out some thorny problem in her early years at templeton house she had come here to these cliffs above this sea under this sky to quietly grieve for what she had lost and to struggle with guilt over being happy in her new life she didnt dream here had always told herself to wait for that until next year or the next the present had always taken priority what to do now she stood on the comfortably wide ledge and asked herself what to do now should she call josh and tell him to go ahead with preparation for a suit against bittle she thought she had to as difficult and potentially dangerous as such an action was she could no longer ignore or pretend to ignore what had been done to her life she hadnt been born a coward nor had she been raised as one it was time she dealt with that part of herself that was constantly in fear of failure in a way she supposed she had acted like seraphina metaphorically tossing her life over a cliff rather than working with the hand shed been dealt that was over now a little late she admitted but she had done the right thing the templeton thing she thought with a smile as she picked her way down a rough and crooked incline uncle tommy had always said that you couldnt be stabbed in the back if you faced your attackers the first step she needed to take was to face her aunt somehow she had to make things right there again kate looked back and though she was too far down the slope to see the house she could picture it always there she mused tall and strong and waiting offering shelter hadnt it been there for margo when her life had smashed around her for laura and her girls during the most difficult period of their lives it had been there for her kate thought when she had been lost and afraid and numb with grief just as it was there now yes shed done the right thing kate thought again as she looked back out to sea she hadnt given up shed finally remembered that a good noisy fight was better than a quiet dignified surrender she laughed a little and drew a deep breath the hell with surrender she decided it was no more palatable than a cowardly plunge off the cliffs the loss of a job a goal a man wasnt an ending it was just another beginning byron de witt was another step she needed to take she decided time for another beginning there the man was driving her crazy with his patience and it was past time for her to take control again maybe she would just ride over there later and jump him the thought of that had her laughing loud and long imagine his reaction she mused clutching her stomach what did a proper southern gentleman do when a woman threw him down and tore off his clothes and wouldnt it be fascinating to find out she wanted to be held and touched and taken she realized as the laughter in her stomach melted into warm liquid need but not by just anyone by someone who could look at her the way he did the way he looked deep as though he could see places inside her that she hadnt dared to explore yet she wanted the mystery of that wanted to match herself against a man strong enough to wait for what he wanted hell she admitted she wanted him if she was strong enough to screw up her courage and face the partners at bittle if she had enough left inside her to deal with the damage shed done to the aunt she adored then she damn well had enough grit to handle byron de witt it was time she stopped planning and started doing turning she started back up the narrow path it was right there as if it had been waiting at first she simply stared sure that she was imagining things hadnt she just come that way hadnt she and laura and margo combed every inch of this section of the cliffs over the past months slowly as if her bones were old and fragile she bent down the coin was warm from the sun glinting like the gold it surely was she felt the texture the smooth face of the longdead spanish monarch she turned it over in her palm twice each time reading the date as if she expected it to change or simply vanish like a waking dream seraphinas treasure that small piece of it had been tossed at her feet chapter eleven contents prev next kate broke records on the drive back to pretenses even the state trooper who stopped her to issue a lecture on traffic laws and a speeding ticket didnt dampen her spirits or slow her down she made it into monterey in under twenty minutes too wired to cruise for a legal parking space she zipped through traffic doubleparked and raced through the strolling wall of tourists she spun to the left narrowly avoiding a collision with a kid on a skateboard and all but stumbled through the door of the shop her eyes were more than a little wild i started to call from the car gasping she pressed both hands to her thudding heart as margo gaped at her im winded she realized im going to have to take those workouts byrons come up with more seriously you had an accident margo bolted from the customer shed been waiting on and made it to kate seconds before thomas got there he was calling for susan as he hurried over to take kates arm are you hurt youd better sit down he halfway carried her to a chair im not hurt there wasnt an accident her adrenaline was so high she was surprised everyone couldnt see it bouncing off the walls well there was the skateboard incident but we both escaped unharmed i didnt call because it wouldnt have seemed dramatic enough over the phone then she began to laugh so hard and so deep she was forced to clutch her ribs margos hand snaked out and pushed kates head between her knees get your breath back margo ordered maybe she had a flareup maybe we should call the doctor no no no still laughing kate dug into her pocket and held up the coin like a trophy look damn it kate howd you get my coin its not yours kate nipped it back before margo could make the grab this ones mine she bolted up and kissed margo hard on the mouth mine i found it on the cliffs it was just lying there out in the open look it didnt even have any sand or salt on it it was just there after deciding the glowing flush on kates face didnt jibe with an ulcer attack margo exchanged a quiet look with thomas sit down kate catch your breath let me finish up here she doesnt believe me kate grinned hugely as margo moved off to her customer she thinks i snatched hers and went crazy its all the stress im under letting her head fall back she laughed like a loon stress is a killer maybe some water thomas murmured and looked up in relief as his wife hurried down the stairs kate seems to be a little hysterical calmly efficient susan took the bottle of champagne from the ice bucket and poured half a glass drink she ordered then breathe okay kate obeyed but she couldnt stop snickering youre all looking at me as if id grown another head i havent snapped uncle tommy i promise i just found part of seraphinas dowry i was walking on the cliffs and it was right there bright as a penny and a lot more valuable just sitting there margo hissed as she walked by carrying a limoges box in the shape of a sun hat like hell take her upstairs will you mrs t ill be up as soon as i can good idea kate agreed theres more champagne up there were going to need a lot of it she tucked the coin back in her pocket toyed with it as she climbed the winding stairs first things first she ordered herself and turned as she stepped into the kitchen i need to talk to you aunt susie hmm her back stiff susan crossed to the stove and put a kettle on to boil the pretty little eyebrow windows were open to the breeze and all the bells and whistles that were summer on cannery row but susan said nothing youre still angry with me kate sucked in both breath and triumph i deserve it i dont know how to apologize but i hate knowing that i hurt you i hate knowing you feel the way you do kate shifted her feet staring at the pretty footed glass bowl filled with fresh fruit that sat on the counter she tried to find the right words you never gave anything to me with strings attached i put them there susan turned met kates eyes why im no good at explaining things that dont add neatly up im better with facts than with feelings but i already know the facts dont i susan said quietly youll have to make an attempt at explaining your feelings if were going to settle this kate i know i love you so much aunt susie the words and the simple emotion in them neatly sliced away a layer of susans anger but the bafflement was still there and under it the hurt ive never doubted that kate i wonder why you should doubt how very much i love you i dont its just knowing she was already fumbling it kate slid onto a stool folded her hands on the counter when i came to you you were already a unit whole templeton house you and uncle tommy all so open and perfect like a fantasy a family her words stumbled over each other in their hurry to get out there was josh the crown prince the heir apparent the clever golden son laura the princess sweet and lovely and kind margo the little queen stunning dazzling really and so sure of her place then me bruised and skinny and awkward i was the ugly duckling that makes you angry she said when susans eyes fired i dont know how else to describe it deliberately she made herself slow down choose her words with more care you were all so good to me i dont mean just the house the clothes the food i dont mean the things aunt susie though they were staggering to a child whod come from my barely middleclass background do you think we would have treated you differently if we hadnt had certain advantages no kate shook her head briskly absolutely not and that was only more staggering pausing she stared down at her hands when she lifted her eyes again they were glossy with threatening tears all the more staggering she repeated now because i found out about my father susan simply continued to stare her head angled attentively found out about what he did about the charges against him sick and terrified kate watched her aunts brow crease then slowly clear oh she let out a long long sigh god id forgotten you youd forgotten stunned kate ran a hand through her hair youd forgotten he was a thief youd forgotten that he stole was charged that you paid off his debts and took his daughter into your home the daughter of a stop it it was a sharp order rather than the sympathy susan would have preferred but she knew her kate youre in no position to judge what a man did twenty years ago what was in his mind or heart he stole kate insisted he embezzled funds you knew all of it when you took me in you knew what hed done what he was now im under suspicion for essentially the same thing and it becomes clear why you sat back and took it and made yourself ill oh you poor foolish child susan stepped forward cupped kates face in her hands why didnt you tell us why didnt you let us know what you were thinking feeling we would have helped you through it why didnt you tell me why didnt you tell me what he had done to what purpose a griefstricken child has burden enough he made a mistake and he would have paid for it you paid for it she tried to swallow couldnt you took your own money and made restitution for him for me do you think that matters that tommy or i gave that part of it even a moments thought you mattered kate only you mattered she smoothed back kates hair how did you find out a man a client who came in he was a friend of my fathers he thought i knew im sorry you found out that way susan dropped her hands stepped back maybe we should have told you when you were older but after a while it just passed away what timing she murmured heartsick you found this out shortly before the business at bittle a couple of months before i looked into it found articles from newspapers hired a detective kate susan wearily pressed her fingers to her eyes why if youd needed to know to understand we would have explained you had only to ask if youd wanted to talk about it you would have after a moment susan nodded all right all right thats true i just needed to know for certain then i tried to put it aside i tried aunt susie to forget it to bury it maybe i could have i dont know but then all of a sudden i was in the middle of this the discrepancy of funds from my clients accounts what was my explanation internal investigations suspension her voice broke like glass but she made herself go on it was a nightmare like an echo of what must have happened to my father i just couldnt seem to function or fight back or even think ive been so afraid kate pressed her lips together i didnt think i could tell you i was ashamed to tell you and afraid that you might think even for just a second you might think that i could have done it because hed done it i could stand anything but that i cant be angry with you again even for such foolishness youve had a rough time of it kate susan gathered her close itll come out kate murmured i know it will and people will talk some will assume i took money because my father took money i didnt think i could stand that but i can she sat back scrubbed away her tears i can stand it but im sorry im so sorry it touches you i raised my children to stand on their own feet and to understand that family stands together i think you forgot the second part of that for a while maybe aunt susie she had to finish finish all of it you never made me feel like an outsider not from the first moment you brought me home you never treated me like a debt or an obligation but i felt the debt the obligation and wanted always to be the best i never wanted you to question whether youd done the right thing by taking me by loving me with her own heart still aching susan folded her arms do you think we measure our love by the accomplishments of the people we care for no but i did do its my failing aunt susie not yours at first id go to bed at night wondering if youd change your mind about me in the morning send me away oh kate then i knew you wouldnt i knew you wouldnt she repeated youd made me part of the unit part of the whole and im sorry if it makes you angry or hurts you but i owe you for that i owe you and uncle tommy for being who and what you are id have been lost without you did you ever consider kate what you did to complete our lives i considered what i could do to make you proud of me i couldnt be as beautiful as margo as innately kind as laura but i could be smart i could work hard plan things out be sensible and successful thats what i wanted for myself and for you and theres something else you should know susan turned to switch off the spurting kettle but didnt pour the hot water over the waiting tea what kate i was so happy at templeton house and i would think that i wouldnt be there with you with everyone if the roads hadnt been icy that night if we hadnt gone out and the car hadnt skidded and crashed if my parents hadnt died she lifted her eyes to susans and i wanted to be there and as the years passed i loved you so much more than i could remember loving them and it seemed horrible to be glad i was with you instead of them and youve nurtured that ugly little seed all these years susan shook her head she wondered if parents and their children ever really understood each other you were a child barely eight years old you had nightmares for months and you grieved more than any child should have to why should you go on paying for something over which you had no control kate her fingers stroked gently over kates temples why shouldnt you have been happy would you have been better off clinging to the pain and the grief and the misery no so you chose guilt instead it seemed that the best thing that had ever happened in my life had grown out of the worst i could never make sense of it it was as if my life began the night they died i knew if a miracle had happened and my parents had come to the door of templeton house i would have run to you and begged you to keep me kate susan shook her head smoothed kates hair back from her face if god almighty had come to the door id have fought him tooth and nail to keep you with me and i dont feel the least bit guilty about it what happened wasnt your fault or mine it doesnt make sense it just is nearly believing it kate nodded please say youll forgive me susan stepped back eyed her her child she thought a gift given to her out of tragedy so complicated so layered so precious if you feel you have to owe me for how did you put it making you part of the unit the payment is that you accept who you are what youve made yourself well be even then ill work on it but in the meantime youre forgiven but she continued as kate sniffled were going to work on the rest of this together together kate when bittle deals with one templeton hell deal with all of them okay kate knuckled a tear away i feel better im sure you do susans lips curved so do i eyes wide and a little wild margo burst into the kitchen let me see that coin she demanded and thrust a hand into kates pocket before kate could move hey oh my god margo goggled at it then goggled at the matching doubloon she held in her other hand i checked my purse i really thought you were playing some sort of idiotic joke on me theyre the same and the world somehow settled neatly back into place i was trying to tell you kate began then grunted when margo grabbed her and squeezed theyre the same margo shouted and held the coins in front of susans face look mrs t seraphina theyre certainly from the right place and the right time struggling to switch gears susan frowned over the coins you just found this one kate no this one in a proprietary move kate snatched the coin from margos left hand mine she stated i cant believe it all these months since i found the first one all these months weve been searching and scraping and hauling that silly metal detector around and you just stumble over it it was just there exactly margo crowed in triumph just like the first one was just there its a sign kate rolled her eyes its not magic margo its luck theres a difference i just happened to be there after the coin got kicked up or washed up or whatever hah was all margo had to say to that weve got to tell laura oh who the hell can remember where she is with that insane schedule of hers if youd bother to look at the weekly schedule ive posted in the office youd know exactly where she is feeling superior kate glanced at her watch if memory serves shes at the hotel for the next thirty minutes then she has a meeting with alis teacher after that we dont need after that well just margo stopped short hell we cant just close the shop in the middle of the afternoon go ahead susan told her tommy and i can mind the store for an hour really margo beamed at her i wouldnt ask but this is so exciting and were in it together youve always been in it together susan said it perked her up margo loitered in the lobby after their brief contact with laura its frustrating to have to wait until sunday to go back and look but with her schedule were lucky to manage that dont you think shes taken on an awful lot kate scanned the sweeping lobby with its elaborate potted plants half hoping to see byron breeze by on some executive mission instead she saw wandering guests bustling bellmen a group of women standing near the revolving doors with shopping bags heaped at their feet and a look of happy exhaustion on their faces i know she likes to fill her time kate continued and it probably helps keep her mind off things but she barely has a minute in the day just for herself ah you finally noticed then margo shook her head and sighed i cant nag her about it anymore when i suggested that the shop could probably swing a parttime clerk and that she could cut back there she almost took my head off absently she rubbed a soothing hand over her belly as the baby kicked i know the bulk of her salary here at the hotel is earmarked for the kids tuition that bastard peter kates teeth began to grind even as she thought of it he was a slimy creep for taking lauras money but taking his own childrens that makes him whatevers lower than slime she could have fried his sorry ass in court thats what id have done margo agreed amused she noted that two men in one of the lobbys plush seating areas were trying to catch her eye what youd have done laura has to handle this her own way and her way is to hold down two jobs raise two children on her own support a full staff because shes too softhearted to lay anyone off she cant keep working twenty out of twentyfour hours margo you try telling her out of long habit she sent the hopeful men a quick flirtatious smile stop playing with those insurance salesmen kate ordered is that what they are carelessly margo scooped her long hair back anyway josh and i have pushed laura as far as we can push shes not budging nobody could tell you to take a vacation could they to see a doctor okay okay that was the last thing kate wanted to hash over i had reasons and ill explain it to you when we have a little more time i should have told you before what well talk about it she promised then baffled her friend by leaning in and kissing her i love you margo okay what have you screwed up nothing well everything but im starting to fix it now back to laura well just have to do more to pick up the slack maybe take the girls off her hands a few hours every week or run some of the errands shes always got a million of and worrying about this is spoiling my mood she pulled the coin out of her pocket watched it glint once we find seraphinas dowry the rest will be irrelevant once we do im going to open a new branch of pretenses in carmel i think surprised kate swept her gaze up to margos face id have figured you for a cruise around the world or a new haute couture wardrobe people change margo shrugged but i might add in a short cruise and a swing down rodeo drive its a relief to know people dont change too much but maybe they could kate mused maybe they should look theres something i want to do can you handle the shop until closing with mr and mrs t there i dont have to go back myself with a chuckle margo dug out her car keys if i could keep them in the shop for a month wed double our profits oh say hi to byron for me i didnt say i was seeing byron margo sent a sly smile over her shoulder as she walked away sure you did pal it was demoralizing to realize she was so obvious demoralizing enough that kate nearly talked herself out of going up to the penthouse she was still arguing with herself when she stepped out of the elevator when she was told mr de witt was in conference she decided it was for the best at loose ends she rode back down but rather than heading to her car she wandered out to the pool leaning on the stone wall that skirted it she watched the play of the courtyard fountain the people who sat at the pretty glass tables sipping colorful drinks under festive umbrellas she spotted name tags pinned to lapels that identified conventioneers taking a break from seminars in striped lounge chairs around the curving tiled pool lounged bodies slicked with sunscreen magazines and bestsellers were being read headphones were in place waitpeople in cool pastel uniforms delivered drinks and snacks from the poolside bar and grill other guests splashed and played in the water or simply floated dreaming they knew how to relax kate thought why had she never acquired this simple skill if she were to stretch out in one of those lounge chairs shed be asleep in five minutes that was how her body was trained or if sleep refused to come restlessness would have her up and gone with her mind ordering her not to waste time since this appeared to be a redletter day in the life of kate powell she decided to give wasting time a try she slid onto a seat at the bar and ordered something with the promising name of monterey sunset she lingered over it for nearly half an hour watching people come and go catching snatches of conversation then she ordered another it wasnt so bad this time wasting she decided especially when she felt so hollowed out inside a good feeling she realized as if shed purged herself of something that had been gnawing at her too long it was time to repair those rents in her life or perhaps to ignore some of them and move on there was promise in this hollow feeling in the possibilities of how to fill it carrying her drink she wandered through the hotel gardens reminding herself to enjoy the scents of camellia jasmine to appreciate the vivid shades of the tumbling bougainvillea she sat on a stone bench near a pair of cypress and wondered how people managed to do nothing and not go insane it was probably best to try it in stages she decided like exercise an hour the first time out was probably overdoing she rose with the idea of going back to the shop and checking inventory then she heard his voice be sure to crosscheck the details with ms templeton tomorrow shell need to be aware of these changes yes sir but it will require more staff at least two more waitpeople and an extra bartender three more waitpeople we want this smooth i think ms templeton will agree that this is the best position for the third bar setup we dont want staff running through the guests with ice buckets do we now lydia ms templeton has her finger on this particular pulse yes sir but these people keep changing their minds thats their prerogative its our problem to accommodate them what i wanted to discuss with you lydia is the complimentary coffee setup on the east terrace every morning we refined that a bit at the resort a couple of weeks ago and its working out well he came around the path as he spoke caught sight of kate sitting on the stone bench with a pretty drink in her hand and a quiet smile on her lips and lost his train of thought mr de witt lydia prompted the coffee setup ah right check with my assistant for the memo its all laid out let me know what you think he didnt precisely push her along but the intent was there well go over all of this with ms templeton in the morning once lydia was on her way he stopped at the bench looked down at kate hi hi im practicing practicing what doing nothing he thought it was like coming across a fawn in an enchanted garden those dark deep oddly slanted eyes the warm and humid scent of flowers hows it going its not as easy as it looks i was about to give up lets give it another minute he suggested and sat beside her i didnt think the brass worried about little things like complimentary coffee setups every detail is a piece every piece makes up the whole and speaking of details he turned her face toward his touched his lips to hers you look wonderful really id say revived i feel revived its a long story he grinned id like to hear it i think i might like to tell you she thought he was someone she could tell no she realized she knew he was i came by to tell laura a portion of it then decided to hang around and try the nothing experiment he struggled with disappointment the way hed found her sitting there it had been as though shed been waiting for him want to go into the details over dinner id love to she rose held out a hand if youre cooking he hesitated hed been very careful to avoid being completely alone with her when he was alone with her he seemed to forget little things like timing and finesse now she was standing there holding out her hand with her lips curved in a way that let him know she understood his dilemma and was enjoying it fine itll give me a chance to try out the barbecue grill i picked up a couple days ago tell you what ill bring dessert and meet you there sounds like a plan testing both of them she stretched onto her toes and closed her mouth softly lingeringly over his im a terrific planner he stood where he was his hands firmly tucked in his pockets while she walked away he decided one of them was about to have their plans tumbled it would certainly be interesting to see which one it was flaky creamy decadent chocolate eclairs had seemed the perfect choice kate set the bakery box on the table in his kitchen and watched him through the window hed left the door unlocked in invitation shed accepted it had come in to a blast of searing bruce springsteen noted hed added a couple of pieces of furniture to complement the ratty recliner the low coffee table with the checkerboard inlay looked expensive and unique as did the stainedglass lamp and the thick geometricpatterned area rug she admitted she was dying to see the rest of the house but she made herself go into the kitchen and there he was in the backyard wrestling the puppies over a sock he looked as at home in jeans and a tshirt as he had earlier in his tailored suit and silk tie it made her wish shed taken the time to swing by home and change into anything she thought but this tidy pinstriped suit and sensible shoes in compromise she took off her jacket and undid the top button of her shirt before she went out to join him she stepped onto the redwood deck a deck she noticed that hed made his own with the simple addition of pottery planters filled with geraniums and pansies and trailing vines a complex and somewhat terrifying gas grill stood shiny and new near the double glass doors and a pair of redwood chairs deeply cushioned in navy were positioned to offer a view of the lawn leading down to the sea hed had the yard fenced in she noted with wooden pickets to keep his precious pets in but still leave it all open to the view a gate stood by the beach steps offering easy access to the sea hed planted something at regular intervals along the fencing she could see tender young plants and the carefully packed mulch around them she imagined hed done the digging there himself some sort of trailing flowering vine she supposed that would in time grow and tumble color over the fence a patient man byron de witt she mused one who would enjoy watching those vines grow and bloom and tangle year after year and she knew he would experience a quiet satisfaction when the first bud blossomed then he would tend it the man enjoyed tending things puppies yapped the sea murmured and the wind trailed lightly through the fluttering cypress leaves as the sky deepened from blue to indigo splashed with scarlet she felt a quick flutter around her heart there were she supposed perfect spots in the world it seemed byron had found one of them and claimed it and so did he look perfect she realized with the wind in his hair puppies at his feet that long mouthwatering muscular build was tucked snug and sexy into denim and cotton her reaction to it to him completely unprecedented was to grab hold and tear in with fingers and teeth she wanted to taste and take she wanted to be taken she wanted with legs less than steady she descended the short flight of steps to the yard the puppies dashed up to her yipping and leaping even as she crouched to welcome them she kept her eyes on byron what did you plant along the fence wisteria itll take a little while to establish he looked over to the fence line but itll be worth the wait there was always some growing on a trellis outside my bedroom back in georgia its a scent that stays with you youve already done a terrific job with the place its gorgeous out here must take a lot of time to add all these touches when you find what youre looking for you take care of it he crossed to her we can take a walk down to the beach after dinner if you like he stroked a hand over her hair much as he had done to the dogs fur then he stepped back catch this he snapped his fingers twice sit butts wiggling frantically both dogs sat he had them offer their paws and after some confusion lie down though their bodies quivered with suppressed excitement very impressive kate commented does everyone do what you tell them its just a matter of asking often enough in the right way he pulled two dog biscuits out of his back pocket and bribery usually works the dogs took the treats and raced away to feast ive got a nice red bordeaux breathing why dont i get it and you can tell me about this interesting day of yours she lifted a hand laid it on his chest felt the heat the rhythm theres something i think i want to say to you all right lets go inside he thought it was best to get into the brightly lit kitchen away from the sumptuous sunset and seductive night air but she kept her hand on his chest and stepped closer it must have been their color byron thought that made her eyes glow so erotically through the twilight shadows i was going to avoid men like you on a personal level she began it was to be a kind of principle a rule of thumb im very fond of rules and principles he arched a brow and generalities yes and generalities because they usually have some basis in fact or they wouldnt have gotten to be generalities id decided after a couple of unfortunate experiences that when something or someone looked too good it was probably bad for me you may be bad for me byron have you been working on this theory long actually i have but it may need some further adjustments in any case i didnt like you when i first met you now theres a surprise she smiled and disconcerted him by moving closer i didnt like you because i started wanting you the first minute that was uncomfortable for me you see i prefer wanting things that are tangible and that can be acquired through time planning and effort i dont like being uncomfortable or wanting someone i dont understand who is in all probability bad for me and who doesnt fit my requirements you have requirements too he didnt care for the sensation of being annoyed and aroused at the same time absolutely one of the main requirements is a lack of demand i dont think youre an undemanding man and thats undoubtedly going to be my biggest mistake one of the other things i really really hate to do is make mistakes but im working on being more tolerant of myself is that something else youre practicing like doing nothing exactly i see well now that weve established that this fledgling relationship with me is practice for your personal tolerance ill start dinner she laughed and put her other hand on his chest i irritate you i dont know why i find that so funny it doesnt surprise me katherine you have an abrasive contrary nature and like nothing better than stirring things up youre right absolutely right its terrifying how easily you understand me and the more patient you are the more compelled i am to poke at you we are so completely wrong for each other byron whos arguing he curled his fingers around her wrists intent on pushing her hands aside take me to bed she said simply and slid her hands through his loosened grip to his shoulders now chapter twelve contents prev next he wasnt easily shocked but her simple demand rocked him back as efficiently as a short left jab hed been sure she was ending what had barely begun between them hed been prepared to be coldly furious but to school himself into not giving a damn because it was undoubtedly unwise to touch her he kept his arms at his sides you want me to take you to bed now because its a mistake because youve theorized that im bad for you and because were completely wrong for each other yes and because i want to see you naked he managed a laugh and would have stepped back but she locked her hands at the back of his neck i think i need a drink he muttered byron dont make me get rough with you she moved in her body bumping his her arms tightening ive been working out sort of i think i could take you if i had to telling himself to be amused he pinched her biceps gently the tiny muscle gave like putty yeah youre a regular amazon honey you want me she nipped her way up his throat if you dont ill have to kill you the little blood left in his head shot straight to his loins i think my lifes safe kate her hands raced busily to the snap of his jeans dont christ and tugged at his zipper hell he muttered and gave in to the animal long enough to savage her mouth with his she made a sound in her throat like a cat purring over prey hold on he grabbed her shoulders and pushed her back just hold on one damn minute he panted out a breath then another you know the trouble with flings no whats the trouble with them im trying to remember he wanted to rub his hands over his face but he didnt dare release her okay ive got it however momentarily satisfying they are you end up dissatisfied thats not the way its going to be here this isnt going to be a fling youre going to have to accept that what was wrong with him she wondered men werent supposed to complicate sex fine well call it something else there are strings kate his hands still on her shoulders he began slowly backing her toward the house he could already see her naked and gleaming trust honesty affection once i touch you no one touches you but me theyre not exactly lined up around the block waiting to get their hands on me her feet bumped into the steps automatically she stepped up back again he was looking at her in that way that made her both nervous and eager as if he were looking beyond to what no one else had seen even herself i dont sleep around neither do i i consider intimacy a serious business and ill have intimacy from you kate in bed and out thats bottom line look her throat was burning dry her hormones bouncing this isnt a business contract no he backed her easily through the kitchen its a personal one thats much more involved much more important you put the deal on the table he swept her into his arms im defining the terms i maybe i have terms of my own better put them out here then this deals about to close we need to keep this simple not an option at the top of the stairs he turned left carried her through a doorway and into a room washed with the last vivid light of the western sky were healthy unattached adults she began talking fast now this is a mutual physical relationship theres more to sex than the physical he smiled as he laid her on the bed i guess ill have to show you he kissed her a long slow lazy meeting of lips that lingered until every nerve in her body was vibrating like the strings of a plucked harp eager for more she dragged him closer so that all the heat swirling through her seemed to center on their mouths he could have taken her in one greedy gulp knowing it he eased back honey where i come from we pace ourselves he linked his fingers with hers so that she couldnt tear down his defenses with those narrow nervous hands now relax he lowered his head to trail nibbling kisses along her jawline and enjoy down her throat weve got all the time in the world she thought he would kill her with patience rip her to shreds with gentleness his lips were soft smooth deliciously devastatingly slow as they cruised over her face each time they met hers he took the kiss just a degree deeper just a whisper warmer her muscles went from hot wires to soft wax the change aroused him mercilessly the sound of her breathing low and deep and slow the thrill when a breath ended on a moan a sigh her quivering impatience slipped into mindless pliancy when he unbuttoned her shirt revealing the simple white camisole beneath she did nothing more than murmur her pleasure fascinated by the simplicity of her form he traced his fingertips over the soft cotton then up over softer flesh the most subtle of curves he mused as her breath began to quicken again at his feathering touch linking fingers again he nuzzled the cotton aside flicked his tongue over her nipple she arched in response biting back a groan so small he thought so firm so sensitive he swept his tongue under the cotton moistening her other breast and felt her quake beneath him so he suckled slowly gently darkly pleased with the way she writhed under him with the quick helpless whimpers that sounded in her throat as he increased pressure and speed when he felt as if he might die if he didnt plunge into her when her hips were pistoning as if she would explode if he didnt fill her he drew back and slipped out of bed what what dazed desperate she sat up the lights going he said quietly i cant see you i want to see you there was the abrasive scratch of a match striking the flare of light that softened as flame was touched to the wick of a candle then a second a third and the room was suddenly rich and romantic with wavering light she pressed a hand to her breast shocked to realize that the hot quivering nerves inside belonged to her what was he doing to her she wanted to ask but was afraid of the answer then he tugged the tshirt over his head tossed it aside she let out a breath of relief now it would be now and all these twisting sensations would smooth out into the understandable he stepped out of his shoes she was only mildly surprised when he slipped hers off as well slid his hand up her leg to just under the hem of her ruckedup skirt would you take your top off all but hypnotized she blinked at him what oh slowly he said laying a hand on hers before she could yank it free no rush she did as he asked because her limbs were so heavy his gaze took a lazy journey from her face down her torso and back again before he took the thin cotton from her set it aside his eyes stayed on hers as he eased her back you keep looking at me she murmured her skin trembled when he slid his hands further under her skirt when he curled his fingers around the waistband of her panty hose and began to draw them down i dont know what you expect neither do i i thought wed find out together he lowered his head and pressed his lips to her inner thigh now i know why you always walk as if you were ten minutes late for a fiveminute appointment its all this leg all this long leg byron she was burning up good god couldnt he feel it i cant take this but she would he thought and unhooked her skirt i havent even started yet he slipped the skirt off and quivered himself at the sight of that slim angular body in his bed resting a bent knee on the bed he cupped her she bowed back pressing desperately against him his eyes darkened dangerously as he watched her face the play of sensations and light the helpless trembling of lashes and lips then the utter surrender to self and to him when the orgasm rippled through her wanting more as wildly as she he closed his mouth over her breast and built her relentlessly toward peak again i cant nearly terrified at what hed pulled out of her of what he seemed to create inside her she dragged at his hair im not sure you can he gasped out the words before his mouth fused with hers heat was pouring out of her all but pumping out of her pores hed never known a woman to be so responsive and so resistant at once the need the drive to show her he was the one the only one who could bring that response and break that resistance made him hold off that final pleasure for the tortured maze of sensations between it seemed he owned her body she had no control and had lost the will to find any his hands his lips were everywhere and each time she thought he would rush to finish it he would cause her to erupt again then move patiently on she was painfully aware of her body and his the melding and the contrasts the race of pulses candlelight flickered over his face those sleek slick muscles making it all almost too beautiful to bear the taste of him was potent like some dark slowacting drug that had already seeped into her blood to addict her he braced himself over her waiting for her eyes to open and focus on his i didnt want you he said in a voice strained to the edge of control then i wanted nothing else understand that for gods sake byron now now he echoed and plunged into her but not just now the warm red haze over her mind cooled slowly she became aware of the world outside of her own body the candlelight continued to flicker against her closed lids in soft surreal patterns the night wind had risen causing the curtains at the windows to whisper she could hear the music again the low throb of bass from the stereo downstairs the answering wail of a tenor sax the smell of hot pooling wax and sweat and sex she had the taste of him in her mouth and the good solid feel of him beneath her hed rolled her over so that she lay sprawled across him concerned she supposed that he would crush her always the gentleman just how did she play this she wondered how did she handle the aftermath of such wild spectacular sex initiating it was one thing participating was clearly and fabulously another but she felt certain that these first few moments of the after would set the precedent for how they would go on i can actually hear your mind clicking back in gear he murmured there was a hint of amusement in his voice as he smoothed down her messy cap of hair its fascinating i dont know that ive ever been quite so attracted to a womans brain before when she started to shift he ran his hands down her back gave her butt a friendly squeeze no dont move yet your heads ahead of me she took a chance raised her head to look at him those gorgeous green eyes of his were at halfmast the mouth that had so recently sent her system into overdrive was softened with a faint smile he was she decided the perfect picture of the fully satisfied male animal is this going to be awkward she wondered aloud doesnt have to be it seems to me that weve been heading here since the first minute we met whether we knew it or not which poses the next question ah that tidy practical ordered mind he thought which is what direction do we take from here well have to talk about that he rolled her over and before she could speak again took her mouth in a long deep mindhazing kiss but first the practicalities he scooped her off the bed into his arms her system gave a fresh jerk it was so odd being carried this way experiencing the arousing vulnerability of being physically outmatched im not sure i like the way you do this let me know when you make up your mind meanwhile i vote for a shower and dinner im starving no it wasnt going to be awkward she concluded in fact it was amazingly pleasant to be wearing one of his faded tshirts listening to bob segers sandpaper vocals grinding out rock byron had trusted her to put a salad together while he grilled the steaks she was finding the process enjoyable the colors and textures of the vegetables hed set out for her the summergarden scent of them she couldnt remember being quite so aware of food before she liked to eat kate thought but taste had always been the main stimulus now she decided there was more to it than that there was the feel of the food the way different ingredients played off each other harmonized or clashed the moist feathery layers of an artichoke heart the firm snap of a carrot the subtle bite of cucumber the delicacy of salad greens she set down the chefs knife and blinked what the hell was she doing romanticizing a salad good god carefully she poured herself half a glass of the wine hed set on the counter to breathe though she hadnt had any recent flareups she was still leery of alcohol she sipped the wine gingerly she could see him through the glass doors talking to the dogs as he turned the steaks flame and smoke billowed they were cooking together she thought she was wearing his shirt dogs were begging for scraps and music was playing it was all so quietly domestic terrifying honey byron slid open the doors you want to pour me a glass of that these steaks are about done sure easy girl she warned herself this was just a nice pleasant evening between two consenting adults nothing to get jittery over thanks byron took the glass she brought to him swirled the wine before drinking you want to eat out here its a nice night okay and more romantic she thought as they carried out the dinnerware why shouldnt she enjoy a little starlight and wine with the man whod just become her lover there was nothing wrong with that youve got that line between your eyebrows he commented sampling and approving her mixed salad the one you get when youre trying to calculate your bottom line i was calculating how much of this steak i can eat without exploding eyes on her plate she cut another bite its wonderful while i find it surprisingly satisfying to feed you the food isnt whats bouncing around in your mind like a pinball he started to ask her to look at him then took the more direct route he laid a hand on her bare thigh and watched her gaze shoot to his why dont i make it easy for you i want you to stay with me tonight she picked up her wineglass fiddled with the stem i dont have any clothes so well get up early give you enough time to swing by your place and change before work he reached out ran a fingertip down her throat such a long slim throat i want to make love with you again i want to sleep with you is that simple enough because it should have been she nodded ill stay but i dont want any complaints when the alarm goes off at six he only smiled it was a rare day for him not to be up already and jogging along the beach by six whatever you say now theres more i said there were strings i meant it that was what shed been trying to keep neatly locked in the back of her mind wanting to choose her words with care she continued to eat im not involved with anyone she began yes you are youre involved with me a quick chill of warning ran down her spine i meant im not involved with anyone else i dont intend to see anyone else while were involved however it may seem by the way i came here tonight sex isnt casual for me nothings casual for you he topped off his wine then hers but sex is the easy part it doesnt take a lot of thought instinct kicks in the body takes over his gaze rested on her face her eyes were wary he noted like those of a doe that had unexpectedly come across a stag in the woods or a hunter i have feelings for you her heart bumped she used knife and fork to cut meat as if the precise size and shape of it were paramount i think weve established that not just desires katherine feelings id planned on sorting them out before we found ourselves at this stage but he shrugged ate let her absorb the words i like maps her already baffled brain clicked over into complete confusion maps points of interest routes from one place to the next i like plotting them out one of the reasons im interested in hotels is because theyre like a world selfcontained full of movement and places and people as he spoke he cut the bone from what was left of his meal then did the same with kates he gave each of the wideeyed dogs a feast hotels are never really stationary just the building is but inside there are births deaths politics passions celebrations and tragedies like any world it runs more or less a certain way along a certain route but the detours the surprises the problems are always there you explore them enjoy them solve them i fucking love it she pondered as he sat back lit one of his cigars she had no earthly idea how they had shifted from a discussion on their relationship to his work but it was fine with her relaxed again she picked up her wine thats why youre so good at your job my aunt and uncle consider you the best and theyre very picky we generally do our best with something we enjoy he watched her through a haze of smoke i enjoy you her smile spread slowly as she edged toward him well then youre a detour he murmured taking her hand before it could become too busy bringing it to his lips when i map out the particular world im moving in i always anticipate a few detours im a detour she was insulted enough to tug her hand free thats flattering it was meant to be he grinned at her while im on this intriguing and very attractive alternate route i dont intend to worry how long it will take to navigate it and im along for the ride is that it id prefer saying were in this together where we end up depends on both of us but i know this i want you with me i havent completely figured out why but i cant get past the wanting part when i look at you its enough no one had ever made her feel more desired hed used no soft alluring words composed no odes to her eyes and yet she felt vital and alive and very much wanted im not sure whether im confused or seduced but it seems to be enough for me too good most of the tension hed been holding in seeped away as he brought her hand to his lips again now that youre relaxed why dont you tell me about this fascinating day of yours my day absolutely blank she stared at him then her eyes cleared went bright oh jesus my day id completely forgotten i cant tell you how gratifying that is he laid a hand on her thigh again slid it slowly up if youd like to forget about it for a while longer no as she pushed his hand firmly away she chuckled i was bursting to talk about it and then i started thinking about getting you into bed and it slipped down a couple of notches on the priority list how about i let you get me in bed again and we talk later nope she scooted out of reach ive already had you pal the encore can wait that sound you hear is my ego deflating he sat back with his cigar his wine gestured with the glass okay kid spill it she wondered how it would feel to simply say it aloud in march i found out that my father had embezzled funds from the ad agency he worked for before he was killed she let out a breath pressed a hand to her stomach god it was he thought the piece hed been sure was missing falling into place in march byron repeated studying her face you hadnt known about it before no nothing i keep expecting people to be shocked why arent you shocked people make mistakes and his voice softened when he calculated just how much shed suffered cut you off at the knees didnt it i didnt cope very well i thought i was i thought i could bury it just push it in didnt work you didnt talk to anyone i couldnt margo found out she was pregnant and laura shes handling so much and i was ashamed thats what it comes down to i couldnt face it and had made herself ill he thought with worry and stress and guilt then you got hit at bittle it didnt seem that it could really be happening some sort of cosmic joke it paralyzed me byron ive never been so afraid of anything or felt so helpless ignoring it seemed the only solution it would go away somehow just go away id just keep myself busy with other things not think about it not react and it would get better some snap he murmured some collapse and some dig their trenches and i pulled the covers over my head well thats done in a halftoast to herself she lifted her glass i talked to my aunt and uncle instead of making it better that made it worse i hurt them i was trying to explain why i was grateful to her and uncle tommy and i said things wrong or i was wrong and it came out badly she was so angry with me i dont remember her ever being that angry with me she loves you kate youll square this with her shes already forgiven me or mostly but it made me realize i had to face it all of it i went to bittle today now youre digging the trenches she let out a shaky breath at his response its past time i did now are you going to beat yourself up because you werent iron woman because you needed time to pull your resources together the corner of her mouth twitched shed been tempted to do just that apparently he knew her very very well no im going to concentrate on dealing with now you didnt have to go to bittle alone she looked down at the hand that had covered hers what made him offer support so easily she wondered and what was making her count so heavily on the offer no i did have to go alone to prove to myself and everyone at bittle that i could i used to play baseball in school i was a good clutch hitter two out a run behind put kate in the box id concentrate on the feel of the bat in my hands because my stomach would be churning and my knees shaking if i concentrated on the feel of the ash solid in my hands and kept my eyes dead on the eyes of the pitcher id still be terrified but nobody would know it trust you to turn a game into life or death baseball is life or death especially in the bottom of the ninth she smiled a little thats how i felt when i walked into bittle two out bottom of the ninth and theyd already winged two strikes past me while i stood there with the bat on my shoulder so you figured if you were going to go down youd go down swinging yeah now you get it honey i was a starting pitcher all the way through college went allstate i ate clutch hitters like you for breakfast when she laughed some of his worry eased she took a moment to sip her wine study the starstrewn sky it felt good it felt right even being scared felt right because i was doing something about it i demanded a partners meeting and there i was back in the conference room just like the day they fired me only this time i fired back she took a deep breath before launching into a playbyplay of what had happened inside the conference room he listened admiring the way her voice strengthened her eyes hardened perhaps her vulnerability pulled at him but this confident determined woman was no less appealing and youre prepared to deal with the fallout if they press formal charges im prepared to fight and to face all the fallout and im prepared to do some serious thinking about who set me up because somebody did either because they were focused on me or because i was convenient but someone used me to cheat the firm and the clients and theyre not going to get away with it i can help you he held up a hand before she could object ive got a feel for people and ive spent my entire adult life dealing with the intrigues and petty pilfering of a large organization youre the expert with figures im better with personalities motivations he could see her turning it over in her mind weighing the possibilities he smiled lets use baseball again youre the batter im the pitcher you swing away i finesse you dont even know any of the people involved he would make it his business to he thought grimly but he kept his voice mild so youll tell me about them youre practical enough to admit theres an advantage to a fresh viewpoint i suppose it wouldnt hurt thanks we can start working on the bios tomorrow i can see why you were wired youve had quite a day it took some doing to bring myself down after the business at bittle then i knew i had to face aunt susie i took a breather at the cliffs and she jumped up from her chair jesus i forgot i cant believe i actually forgot god what did i do with it foolishly she patted her hips then remembered she was wearing nothing but an oversized tshirt my pocket ill be right back stay here she streaked inside like a bullet leaving byron shaking his head after her the woman was a mass of contradictions he decided as he rose to clear the table it was no use reminding himself that he preferred the quiet soothing and sophisticated type the laura type he supposed wellmannered wellread wellbred yet hed never felt this bright hot need with laura or with anyone for that matter instead it was kate this bumpy and often inconvenient detour who continually fascinated him just how would his complicated and turbulent kate react if he told her he was beginning to believe he was falling in love with her hah triumphant she bolted back into the kitchen prepared to bask in his astonishment she smiled smugly as he stared at her eyes dark and intense i found it she was flushed and rumpled her short hair stood in spikes those long slim legs pale gold beneath the hem of his shirt she had no figure to speak of was more bone than curve the little mascara shed bothered with was smudged under her eyes her nose was crooked had he noticed that before the nose was just slightly off center and her mouth was certainly too wide for that narrow face youre not beautiful he said in a quiet statement that made her brow knit why do you look beautiful when youre not how much of that wine did you drink de witt your face is wrong as if to prove it to himself he came around the counter for a closer look its like whoever put it together used a couple of spare parts from someone elses this is all very fascinating she said impatiently but at first glance your body looks like it belongs to a teenage boy all arms and legs thank you very much mr universe have you finished your unsolicited critique of my looks almost his lips curved a little as he skimmed a hand along her jaw i love the way you look i cant figure out why but i love the way you look the way you move he slipped his arms around her drew her in the way you smell this is a novel way to seduce me the way you taste he continued and skimmed his lips up her throat and its surprisingly effective she managed between shivers but i really wanted you to look at this he plucked her up set her down on the counter then slid his hand around to cup her bare bottom im going to make love with you here he closed his teeth over the nipple that strained against the thin cotton is that all right with you yes good her head fell back wherever satisfied with that he rubbed his lips over hers what do you want me to see nothing just this he caught the coin that slipped through her fingers and puzzled over it spanish a doubloon i suppose isnt this margos no mine i found it she drew in a long shuddering breath let it out god how do you do that its like turning off a switch in my head i found it she repeated struggling to separate her sense from her senses today on the cliffs it was just lying there seraphinas dowry youve heard the legend sure intrigued he turned the coin over in his hand the starcrossed lovers the young spanish girl left behind in monterey when the boy she loves goes off to fight the americans she hears hes been killed and in despair she jumps off the cliffs he lifted his gaze from the gold to her eyes the cliffs its said across from templeton house she had a dowry kate added right a chest filled with her bride gift bestowed by a loving indulgent father one variation says she hid it to protect it from the invaders until her lover returned another says she took it into the sea with her well kate picked the coin out of his palm i go with the first havent you and laura and margo been combing those cliffs for months so margo found a coin last year now ive found one at this rate youll be rich beyond your wildest dreams about the middle of the next millennium you believe in legends what of it ready to pout she shifted seraphina existed theres documentation and no he kissed her gently dont spoil it its nice to know you can just believe its even nicer to know you want me to believe she studied his face well do you he took the coin from her and set it down where it gleamed like a promise beside them of course he said simply chapter thirteen contents prev next storms blew in pelting the coast with driving rain sweeping it with raging winds relief that the dangerously dry season might be averted with the unrelenting wet warred with worry over flooding and mudslides kate tried not to take the nasty weather personally but there was no doubt that it prevented her from intensifying the treasure hunts even as the rains abated the cliffs were too wet for safety so they would wait there was certainly enough to occupy her pretenses summer season was in full swing tourists crammed cannery row jammed the wharf queued up for a trip through the aquarium arcades clattered with the sounds of games and jingling tokens and families strolled the sidewalks licking ice cream from sugar cones the busy carnival atmosphere out in the streets meant business some came to feed the gulls and watch the boats some came to gaze upon the street that steinbeck had immortalized some came to bask in the eternal spring that monterey offered or take the sweeping drive along the coast many many were lured by margos clever display windows to come in and browse and those who browsed often bought i see dollar signs in your eyes again laura murmured were up ten percent from this period last year kate turned from her desk and looked at laura by my calculations margo should be able to pay off all of her debts by the end of the next quarter when the holiday shopping season hits were actually going to be in the black eyes narrowed laura came farther into the room i thought we were already in the black not technically as she spoke she continued to crunch figures we take a minimum percentage in lieu of salary we have our pool for resupplying then theres operating expenses she worked onehanded as she reached for her cup of tea and tried to pretend it was coffee initially the bulk of our stock was margos property and she took the lions share of those profits in order to square with her creditors were gradually moving into new stock which is acquired by kate just skip all the details are we operating at a loss we have been but ive been taking money every month of course you have you have to live we have to live kate amended quickly seeing the guilt cloud lauras eyes seeing that it would be necessary to explain and reassure she set the cup down resisted the keyboard this is how it works laura we take what we need what were entitled to and plow the rest back into the business each of us has personal expenses in addition to the shop overhead once those are seen to we reinvest the profit if there is any and if there isnt were in the red and that means that means reality theres nothing unusual in operating at a loss in a new business kate bit back a sigh and wondered why she hadnt begun the discussion a different way forget all the ledgers for a minute what im telling you is good news were going to end this calendar year not just eking out a minimal living and paying off old debts were going to make a profit a real profit thats rare in a business thats barely into its second year by my projections well have a net gain in the mid five figures so were okay laura said cautiously yeah were okay smiling kate ran her fingers over the keys of her computer as if they were adored children if the charity auction goes as well as last year well be cooking thats what i came in to talk to you about laura hesitated frowned at the figures on the screen were really all right if you cant trust your accountant who can you trust right she had to believe it well then you wont have any problem cutting a few checks youve come to the right place humming kate took the invoices from laura and then choked what the hell are these refreshments laura offered a bright hopeful smile entertainment oh and advertising all auctionrelated christ were paying this for mindnumbing chamber music from a bunch of nerds why cant we just plug in a cd i told margo kate its a matter of image and this trio isnt a bunch of nerds theyre very talented she patted kates shoulder well aware why margo had suggested that she be the one to pass along the bills its union scale just like the waitpeople grumbling kate flipped open the checkbook margo has to do everything in an ornate and showy fashion thats why we love her just think how the cash registers going to sing the week after the auction all those rich materialistic customers with large disposable incomes youre trying to sweettalk me is it working say large disposable incomes again large disposable incomes okay i feel better really good laura winced held her breath about the fashion show weve set up for december you agree thats still a good idea its a great idea a wellexecuted special event will more than pay for itself and it has the potential of generating new clientele exactly my thought okay heres my preliminary budget she kept her eyes squeezed shut as she dropped the figures in kates lap she heard the yelp and when she opened her eyes she saw kate plucking at the back of her shirt what are you doing im trying to pull out the knife you just stuck in my back jesus christ laura weve got the clothes youve tapped your committees for the models why do you need all this money decorations advertising refreshments its all listed its negotiable she said backing out consider it a wish list gotta get back on the floor making noises in her throat kate scowled at the door the trouble was she decided both of her partners were too used to being rich to fully appreciate that they no longer were or that pretenses wasnt she corrected margo had married for love but shed married a templeton and templeton meant money laura was a templeton and despite being hosed by her exhusband she would always have access to millions she just wouldnt take it it was up to good old practical kate she decided to keep things on an even keel when the door opened again she didnt bother to turn around dont hassle me laura i swear ill cut this wish list of yours down until you wont be able to serve anything but popsicles and club soda kate lauras voice was quiet enough that kate whipped around in her chair whats wrong what she broke off at the sight of the man standing beside laura fiftyish she judged with a hairline beyond what could legitimately be called receding he had the beginnings of jowls and bland brown eyes his suit was neat and inexpensive somewhere along the line hed punched extra holes in his brown leather belt to accommodate his paunch but it was his shoes that tipped her off she couldnt have said why those shiny black shoes with the doubleknotted laces shouted cop kate this is detective kusack he wants to talk to you she wasnt certain how she managed to get to her feet when shed stopped feeling her legs but she was facing him surprised somehow that their eyes were on a level am i under arrest no maam i have a few questions regarding an incident at bittle and associates he had a voice like gravel bouncing on sandpaper it reminded her foolishly of bob segers gritty rock and roll i think id like to call my lawyer margos already calling josh laura moved to her side thats your option ms powell kusack poked out his bottom lip as he considered her maybe it would be best all round if he met us at the precinct if youll come along with me ill try not to take up too much of your time i can see youre busy its all right kate put a hand on lauras arm before laura could step forward its all right dont worry ill call you im coming with you no with icy fingers kate picked up her purse ill call you as soon as i can she was taken to an interview room designed to intimidate intellectually she knew that the plain walls the scarred center table and uncomfortable chairs the wide mirror that was obviously twoway glass were all part of a setup to aid the police in getting information from suspects no matter how kates practical side ordered her not to be affected her skin crawled because she was the suspect she had josh beside her looking particularly lawyerly in a tailored gray suit and muted striped tie kusack folded his hands on the table big hands kate noted distractedly adorned with a single thin gold wedding band he was a nailbiter she thought staring with dull fascination at his ragged painfully short fingernails for the space of several heartbeats there was nothing but humming silence like the hushed anticipation just before the curtain rose on the first act of a major play a bubble of hysterical laughter nearly fizzed out of her throat at the image act one scene one and she had the starring role can i get you something ms powell kusack watched her muscles jerk in reaction to his voice as her gaze flew from his hands to his face coffee a coke no nothing detective kusack my client is here at your request in the spirit of cooperation his cultured voice chilly and hard josh gave kates tense hand a comforting squeeze under the table no one wants this matter cleared up more ms powell is willing to make a statement i appreciate that mr templeton ms powell id like it if youd answer a few questions so i can get this all straight in my mind he gave her a kindly avuncular smile that made her insides quiver im going to read you your rights now thats just procedure just the way we have to do things he recited the words that anyone who had ever watched an episode of a police drama from kojak to nypd blue knew by rote she stared at the tape recorder silently documenting every word every inflection you understand these rights ms powell she shifted her eyes stared into his the curtain was up she thought damned if she was going to blow it yes i understand you worked for the accounting firm of bittle and associates from he flipped pages in a small dogeared notebook read off dates yes they hired me straight out of graduate school harvard right you got to have a lot of smarts to get into harvard i see you graduated as a baker scholar too i worked for it bet you did he said easily what kind of stuff did you do at bittle tax preparation financial and estate planning investment advice i might work in tandem with a clients broker to build or enhance a portfolio josh lifted a finger i want it on record that during my clients employment at this firm she increased business by bringing in accounts her record there was not only unblemished it was superior uhhuh how do you go about bringing in accounts ms powell contacts networking recommendations from current accounts he took her through the daytoday business of her work the questions slowly paced quietly asked until she began to relax he scratched his head shaking it me i cant make a damn bit of sense out of all those forms uncle sam wants us to fill out used to sit down with them every year all spread out on the kitchen table with a bottle of jack to ease the pain he grinned winningly the wife finally had enough of that now i take everything up to h r block in april and dump it on them that makes you very typical detective kusack theyre always changing the rules arent they he smiled again somebody like you would have to understand rules and how to get around them when josh objected to the tone of the question kate shook her head no i can respond to that i understand the rules detective kusack its my job to recognize whats black and white and where the shades of gray are a good accountant uses the system to circumvent the system when possible its kind of a game isnt it yes in a way but the game has rules too i wouldnt have lasted a month at a firm with bittles structure and reputation if i hadnt played by those rules an accountant who doctors tax forms or cheats the irs endangers herself and her client i wasnt raised to cheat you were raised right here in monterey werent you you were the ward of thomas and susan templeton my parents were killed when i was eight i your father had a bit of a financial problem before his death kusack commented and watched kates face go sheetwhite charges brought and never resolved concerning my clients father twenty years ago have no bearing here josh stated just background counselor and an interesting coincidence i wasnt aware of my fathers problems until recently kate managed how had he found out so quickly she wondered why had he looked as i said both my parents were killed when i was a child i grew up in templeton house in the big sur area she took a quiet breath the templetons didnt consider or treat me as a ward but as a daughter you know id have figured theyd have taken you into the templeton organization a woman with your skills and theyve got all those hotels the factories i didnt choose to join the templeton organization now why was that because i didnt want to take anything else from them i wanted to go out on my own they respected my decision and the door remained open josh put in anytime kate wanted to walk through detective i dont see what this line of questioning has to do with the matter at hand just laying a foundation despite the recorder he continued to make little notations in his tattered notebook ms powell what was your salary at bittle at the time of your termination a base of fiftytwofive plus bonus fiftytwo thousand nodding he flipped through his book as if checking facts thats quite a comedown for someone who had the run of a place like templeton house i earned it and it was enough for my needs she felt a line of cold sweat drip down her back i know how to make money from money and in an average year i would add twenty thousand to that base in bonuses last year you opened a business with my sisters with margo and laura templeton kate qualified its risky starting a business those bland eyes stayed on hers and expensive i can give you all the statistics all the figures you like to gamble ms powell no i dont not in the standard sense of vegas or the track the odds always favor the house but i appreciate an intelligent and cautious investment risk and i consider pretenses to be just that some businesses need to be fed a lot something like this shop of yours keeping stock all that overhead my books are clean you can kate josh put a hand on her arm in warning no furious now she shook it off hes implying that i would take the easy way because my father did that i embezzled from bittle to keep pretenses afloat and im not having it weve worked too hard to make the shop run especially margo im not having it josh hes not going to say that the shops involved she seared kusack with one hot glare you pick up the books at the shop anytime you go over them line by line i appreciate the offer ms powell kusack said mildly he opened a folder slid papers out do you recognize these forms of course thats the i completed for sid sun and that other one is the altered duplicate thats your signature yes on both copies and no i cant explain it and these printouts for computergenerated withdrawals from bittles escrow accounts its my name my code who had access to your office computer everyone and to your security code no one but me as far as i know you gave it to no one no you kept it in your head of course kusack kept his eyes on hers as he leaned forward must be some trick keeping all kinds of numbers in your head im good at it most people keep numbers in their heads social security pin numbers telephone numbers dates me i have to write everything down otherwise i mix it all up i guess you dont worry about that i dont kate josh interrupted again met her impatient glance with a quiet look where do you record the numbers in my head she said wearily i dont forget i havent had to look up the security code in years lips pursed kusack examined his ragged nails where would you look it up if you had to in my filofax but her voice trailed off as the impact hit home in my filofax she repeated i have everything in it she grabbed her purse fumbled through it and took out the thick leatherbound book for backup she said opening the book backups the first rule here she located the page nearly laughed my life in numbers kusack scratched his chin you keep that with you i just said its my life thats literally true its always in my bag where do you keep your bag say during office hours in my office and youd carry it around with you i know my wife never takes two steps without her pocketbook only if i was leaving the building josh she clutched his hand only if i was leaving the building anybody in the firm could have taken the code christ anybody at all she squeezed her eyes tight i should have thought of it before i just wasnt thinking at all thats still your signature on the forms ms powell kusack reminded her its a forgery she snapped and rose to her feet you listen to me do you think id risk everything i worked for everything i was given for a lousy seventyfive k if money was what was important to me i could have picked up the phone called my aunt and uncle called josh and they would have given me twice that without a single question im not a thief and if i were i sure as hell would cover my tracks better than this what idiot would use her own code her own name leave such a pathetically obvious paper trail you know ms powell kusack folded his hands on the table again i asked myself that same question ill tell you what my take is the person had to be one of three things stupid desperate or very very smart im very smart that you are ms powell kusack said with a slow nod that you are youre smart enough to know that seventyfive large isnt peanuts smart enough to be able to hide it where it couldnt easily be found detective my client denies any knowledge of the money in question the evidence is not just circumstantial but highly questionable we both know you cant make a case with this and youve taken up enough of our time i appreciate your cooperation kusack tidied the papers and put them back in his file ms powell he continued as josh led her to the door one more thing howd you break your nose excuse me your nose he said with an easy smile howd you break it baffled she lifted a hand and rubbed it felt the familiar angle bottom of the ninth stretching a double into a threebagger in a bad imitation of pete rose i cracked it against the fielders knee his teeth flashed safe or out safe he watched her go then flipped the file open again and studied the signatures on the forms stupid desperate or very very smart he thought chapter fourteen contents prev next he doesnt believe me reaction set in the minute the door closed behind her all the anger and righteousness jittered away into fear im not so sure of that josh murmured and navigated her out of the interviewing area he could feel her body vibrate through the hand he held to her back but what matters is they dont have a case there isnt enough to take to the da and kusack knows it it does matter she pressed a hand to her churning stomach not the ulcer this time she hoped but that was little comfort when the alternative diagnosis was shame and fear it matters what he thinks what bittle thinks what everyone thinks however much i dont want it to it matters listen to me he turned her in the corridor to face him kept his hands on her shoulders you did fine in there better than fine it might not have been the exact route i would have recommended as your attorney but it was effective the records in your filofax open up a whole new area of investigation now consider who led you to that you did when he shook his head she drew her brows together because josh expected it she ordered herself to think clearly he did kusack did he wanted me to tell him i had the code written down somewhere somewhere where it could be accessed joshs hands gentled on her shoulders now i want you to put this aside i mean it kate he continued even as she opened her mouth to protest let kusack do his job let me do mine you have people behind you thats something i dont want you to forget again im scared she pressed her lips together wanting her voice to be level even in the admission the only time i wasnt scared was when he made me mad now im scared all over again why did he bring up my father josh how did he know about it what reason would he have for looking that far into my background i dont know im going to find out they have to know at bittle despair was a stone sinking in her gut if kusack knows so do the partners maybe they knew about it before and thats why kate stop but what if they never find out who did it if they dont find out then im always going to i said stop we will find out thats a promise not from your lawyer but from your big brother he drew her close kissed the top of her head then spotted byron striding down the hall he recognized barely controlled fury when he saw it and decided it was just what kate needed to take her mind off the interview by good timing youll run kate home wont you she spun around confused and embarrassed what are you doing here laura tracked me down he shot a look at josh that clearly stated they would talk later and began to usher kate down the hall lets get out of here i need to go back to the shop margos alone margo can handle herself he towed her down the steps past the desk and outside where the sun was blinding bright are you all right yeah a little turned around inside but okay hed driven his vette the sleek streamlined twoseater in musclecar black settling inside a thirtyyearold car only made the entire day all the more surreal you didnt have to come all the way down here obviously despising the impotency he gunned the engine viciously youd have called if youd wanted my help now youre stuck with it there wasnt anything you could do she began and winced at the molten look he shot her before he cruised out of the parking lot they didnt charge me with anything well its our lucky day isnt it he wanted to drive he wanted to drive fast to dissipate some of the bubbling anger before it boiled over and burned them both to cancel any possibility of conversation he flicked up the volume on the car stereo and eric claptons angry guitar licks scorched the air perfect kate thought and shut her eyes mean music a muscle car and southernfried temper she told herself the migraine brewing and the highly possible visit by her old pal mr ulcer were enough to worry about she found her sunglasses in her purse and put them on before dryswallowing medication through the tinted lenses the light seemed calmer kinder the wind whipped cooling her hot cheeks she had only to lay her head back raise her face to see the sky byron said nothing but sent the car slashing up highway like a bright black sword cleaving through sea and rock it tore through a lowlying cloud burst out of the thin vapor and roared back into the flash of sun hed been battling feelings of impotence and hot fury since lauras call the police took kate in for questioning we dont know what theyre going to do a detective came to the shop and he took her the jingle of fear in lauras usually calm voice had set off a violent chain reaction in him the fear had been fueled by hurt kate hadnt called him hed imagined her alone it hadnt mattered that laura had assured him josh was with her hed envisioned her alone frightened at the mercy of accusations his overworked imagination had pictured her handcuffed and led off in chains and there was nothing he could do but wait now she was sitting beside him her eyes shielded by dark glasses that made her skin all the more pale in contrast her hands were clasped in her lap deceptively still until you noted the knuckles were white and she had told him there was no need for him he didnt question the impulse but swung to the side of the road at the templeton house cliffs where she had once wept on his shoulder she opened her eyes it didnt surprise her in the least that he had stopped there there at a spot of both peace and drama before she could reach for the door handle he was leaning across her to jerk open the door himself an old habit she decided with all that temper swirling around in him the gesture couldnt be considered courtly in silence they walked to the cliffs why didnt you call me he hadnt meant to ask that first but it popped out of his mouth i didnt think of it he whirled on her so quickly so unexpectedly that she stumbled back a step crushed a scattering of tiny white wildflowers underfoot no you wouldnt just where the hell am i on that agenda of yours katherine i dont know what you mean i didnt think of it because because you dont need anyone but kate he shot back because you dont want to need anyone who might upset that profitandloss ledger in your head i wouldnt have been of any practical use so why bother thats not true how could she deal with an argument now she wondered how could she handle that brilliant fury in his eyes she had a terrible urge to simply press her hands to her ears squeeze her eyes shut so that she could neither see nor hear so she could just be alone in the dark i dont understand why youre so angry with me but i just dont have the energy to fight with you now he gripped her arm before she could turn away good then you can just listen try to imagine what it was like to be told by someone else that the police had taken you in to visualize what might be happening to you what you were going through and to be powerless to change it thats just it there wasnt anything you could do i could have been there he shouted over the wind that raked through his hair like wild fingers i could have been there for you you could have known there was someone who cared there for you but you didnt even think of it damn it byron i couldnt think at all she jerked away walked along the cliff path even a few steps would distance her from the upheaval of emotion the avalanche the flood of it before she broke into pieces it was like being shut down or frozen up i was too scared to think it wasnt personal i take it very personally we have a relationship kate he waited while she slowly turned around watching him through eyes guarded by dark glasses with some effort he drew in his temper and spoke with measured calm i thought i made it clear what that entails for me if you cant accept the basic terms of a relationship with me then were wasting our time she hadnt thought anything could squeeze past the pain in her head the ache in her stomach the sizzle of shame in her blood but she hadnt counted on despair somehow despair always made room for itself her eyes burned as she looked at him standing in the sun and wind well you dumping me certainly puts a cap on the day she started past him with some idea of running up to templeton house getting inside and shutting everything else out goddamn it he spun her around crushing his mouth to hers in a kiss that tasted of bitter frustration how can you be so hardheaded he shook her then kissed her again until she wondered why her overtaxed brain didnt simply implode cant you see anything unless its in a straight line im tired she hated resented the shakiness of her voice im humiliated im scared just leave me alone id like nothing better than to be able to leave you alone just walk away and chalk it up to a bad bet he pulled off her sunglasses stuck them in his pocket hed wanted to see her eyes and now he recognized swirling in them the same anger and hurt that twisted in him do you think i need the turmoil and complications youve brought into my life do you actually think id tolerate all that because were good in bed you dont have to tolerate it she fisted her hands on his chest you dont have to tolerate any of it damn right i dont but i am tolerating it because i think im in love with you shed have been less surprised if hed simply hauled her up and tossed her over the cliff in an attempt to keep her reeling head in place she pressed a hand to her temple hard to come up with a response his voice was as sharp and smooth as a newly oiled sword thats not surprising emotions dont add up in neat columns do they i dont know what im supposed to say to you this isnt fair its not about fair and at the moment i dont like the situation any more than you do youre a far cry from the girl of my dreams katherine that had her eyes clearing now i know what to say go to hell unimaginative he decided now get this into that com puterchip brain of yours he pulled her up onto her toes until their eyes were level i dont like to make mistakes any more than you do so im going to take the time to figure out exactly how i feel about you if i decide youre what i want then youre what ill have her eyes narrowed glinting with dangerous lights how incredibly romantic his lips curved in quick and genuine humor ill give you romance kate and plenty of it you can take your warped concept of romance and he cut her off with a soft quiet kiss i was worried about you he murmured i was afraid for you and you hurt me because you didnt turn to me i didnt mean to she snapped back before her bones could melt youre twisting this around youre trying to confuse me surrendering to pain she shut her eyes oh god my head aches i know i can see it as a parent might soothe a child he touched his lips to her left temple then her right lets sit down he eased her down onto a rock then stood behind her to massage the tense muscles of her neck and shoulders i want to take care of you kate i dont want to be taken care of i know over her head he watched the sea gleam as the sun burned through a cloud and streamed down she couldnt help that he supposed any more than he could help his own need to protect and defend well have to find an area of compromise there you matter to me i know you matter to me too but thats a nice place to stop he told her im asking you to think of me and to accept that you can turn to me for the little things and for the big ones can you handle that much i can try she wanted to believe it was the medication finally kicking in that was making the pain slide away but a part of her the part shed long considered foolish thought it was the sea and the cliffs and him byron i didnt mean to hurt you i hate hurting people i care about its the worst thing for me i know he pressed his thumbs to the base of her neck searching out stubborn knots of tension and smiled when she leaned back against him when i saw you in the police station i was embarrassed i know that too well its nice to be so transparent i know where to look in you it seems to be some kind of innate skill its one of the reasons i think i may be in love with you he felt the tension leap back into her muscles relax he suggested we may both learn to live with it my life is to put it mildly in upheaval she stared straight ahead to the horizon the sky always met the sea she mused no matter how distant but people didnt always couldnt always find that joining point i also know my own limitations she continued im not ready for that kind of leap im not sure i am myself but if i take it im pulling you with me he came around the rock to sit beside her im very good at handling complications kate ill handle you when she opened her mouth he pressed his fingers to it no you dont youll tense up again youre just going to say you wont be handled then ill have to say something about how if you let someone take part of the control now and again you wouldnt have so many headaches then wed just go around until one of us gets pissed off again she frowned at him i dont like the way you fight it always drove my sisters crazy suellen used to say i used logic like a left jab youve got a sister named suellen he raised an eyebrow from gone with the wind my mother chose all our names from literature got a problem with that no she plucked at a speck of lint on her skirt it just sounds so southern he chuckled wondering if she realized she made the south sound like another planet honey we are southern suellen charlotte as in bronte meg from little women and byron as in lord exactly you dont have the poetic pallor or the clubfoot but you do sort of have the dreamy good looks flattery he kissed her lightly in response i guess youre feeling better i guess i am so he draped an arm over her shoulders how was your day with a weak laugh she turned her face nuzzled it against the curve of his neck it sucked it really really sucked want to talk about it maybe it wasnt really so hard to lean against a strong shoulder she decided if she just concentrated i should call laura i told her i would josh will tell her youre with me she wont worry shell worry whether i call or not laura worries about everyone kate let the silence soothe a moment then began with kusacks appearance at the shop byron didnt interrupt but listened assessed and considered i dont think he believed me the way he kept watching me with this kind of cat patience you know when he mentioned my father my brain just froze up i knew i should have been prepared for it right from the start of this i knew that would be the worst and i should have been prepared but i wasnt it hurt you byron murmured more than any of the rest yes she reached back gripped his hand baffled and relieved that he would understand so easily it hurt that this stranger this cop should damage the man im trying to remember the one who used to spin ridiculous dreams for me who im trying to believe only wanted the best for me and i cant defend him byron because what he did is against everything i believe in that doesnt mean you didnt love your father and arent entitled to remember the best parts of him im working on that she murmured the problem is i have to stay focused on whats happening now its harder than i imagined when kusack brought out the forms i couldnt explain why they both had my signature but josh seemed to think it went well especially that business with the security code electronic thievery rolled in right along with the microchip you said the siphoning off started about a year and a half ago whos had access to your computer during that time period dozens of people isnt that why its all so hopeless she thought theres not a big turnover at bittle its a good firm so who needs money whos smart and who would point the finger at you who doesnt need money she countered irritated because her mind was refusing to travel a logical path bittle hires smart and i dont know anyone in the firm who has it in for me personally maybe it wasnt personal so much as convenient a cautious amount of money he murmured like a test or a way to offset small annoying debts and the timing kate havent you considered the timing i cant follow you why now why you is it just a coincidence that you should find out about your father at essentially the same time this skimming was noticed what else could it be maybe someone else found out and used it i didnt tell anyone what did you do the day you found out what did you do i sat there at my desk reeling i didnt want to believe it so i checked he would have banked on it how i accessed the library back in new hampshire ordered faxes of newspaper articles contacted the lawyer who handled the details i hired a detective he considered every one of those steps generated data phone records computer records paper trail and noted the data in your filofax well yes the names and phone numbers but and the transmissions to and from new hampshire were on your computer i she began to see began to feel ill all over again yes the records of faxes sent and received if someone wanted to look but still theyd have to have my password and which is noted in your filofax he finished who would be the last person questioned coming out of your office if you werent mere any one of the partners i suppose one of the executive assistants she shrugged unsurprised to find that her shoulders were tightening up again hell any of the other accountants on that floor no one would think twice about seeing an associate breeze out of another associates office then well concentrate on those the third bittle you talked about who is it marty marty wouldnt embezzle from his own company thats ludicrous well see meanwhile how do you think hed react if you asked him to get you copies of the forms in question i dont know why dont we find out an hour later kate hung up the phone in byrons kitchen i should have known hed come through hell make copies as soon as hes able to and bring them to you at the hotel she worked up a smile its like a little intrigue im surprised he didnt ask for passwords hes actually enjoying it our man on the inside i should have thought of this angle right from the beginning now i can add feeling stupid to the rest of it emotions tend to cloud logic he told her otherwise i might have hit on it earlier myself well she wasnt sure she was ready to deal with that line of thought just now anyway marty told me that they decided to turn it over to the police after my showdown the other day his fathers not happy about it but the vote carried do you regret facing up to them no but theres going to be gossip now plenty of it trying to keep it light she smiled at him how do you feel about having an alleged embezzler of dubious lineage for a lover i think that requires a test he gathered her close skimming his hands up her back and into her hair in the way shed come to anticipate her mouth lifted to his opened for his i guess this means youre not going back to work this afternoon good guess his mouth stayed busy as he circled her out of the kitchen where are we going havent i already mentioned all this floor you have around here he chuckled against her throat i havent shown you my new sofa oh she let him ease her back on the generous cushions its very nice she murmured as his weight pressed her deeper into them long his fingers parted her blouse exposing her as she arched to his touch soft we so rarely make it to the bedroom he lowered his head nipped lightly at her breasts i wanted something accommodating on the main level very considerate of you she gasped when his mouth closed over her sucked her in it was so easy to let the heat take her to spin her mind away to follow the demands of her own body for pleasure for sensation for tastes and textures she tugged his tie loose when his mouth sought hers again loosened the buttons that prevented flesh from meeting flesh but he wouldnt let her hurry and her impatience drained away until she was steeped and savoring strong broad shoulders hair glorious gold at the tips the subtle creases in his cheeks that long rippled torso she luxuriated in the feel of those smooth hands gliding over her lingering here pressing there then skillfully bringing her to a long shimmering orgasm that poured through her system like warmed wine he thought it stunning to watch her the flickers of pleasure and tension and release that played over her face arousal had blood rising to her cheeks caused her eyes to darken and glow like rich aged brandy the body beneath his arched and flowed quivered and grew erotically damp the taste of soap and salt between her breasts enchanted him the feel of those narrow restless hands enjoying his own flesh delighted him darkly the need to be in her to join body to body and bury himself deep was overpowering he filled her shuddering when those exotically female muscles clutched around him yet it wasnt enough he pulled her up until her arms were wrapped around his neck her legs around his waist with his mouth he swallowed each of the moans that trembled from her throat then raced his lips over that long white column where a pulse beat like fury she panted out his name blinded by the single primal urge to reach the summit her hips pumped jackhammer quick as the craving grew maddening the pleasure unbearable she was willing to beg if only the words would come but instead she sank her teeth into his shoulder it flashed through her like an overstoked furnace hot and violent stunned and helpless she clung then felt the magic pulse between them as he poured himself into her the phone awakened her an hour later disoriented kate fumbled for the receiver before she remembered she wasnt home yes hello oh im sorry i must have the wrong number im calling byron de witts residence dazed kate stared around the room the antique oak chest of drawers the warm green walls and white curtains the clever watercolor seascapes a thriving ornamental lemon tree in a glazed pot in front of the window and the lulling ceaseless sound of the sea byrons bedroom ah she sat up rubbing a hand over her face cool ivory sheets slipped down to her waist this is mr de witts residence oh i didnt realize hed gotten a housekeeper already i expect hes at work i was just going to leave a message on the machine for him tell him lottie called wont you honey he can reach me anytime this evening hes got the number bye now before kate was fully awake she was staring at the receiver and listening to the rude buzz of a dial tone housekeeper lottie hes got the number well fuck she slammed down the phone and scrambled up the scent of him was still on her skin and he was getting calls from some bimbo named lottie typical she decided and looked around for her clothes which were she recalled downstairs where hed left them when he carried her up to bed ordered her to take a nap and shed been so softened by lovemaking that she meekly obeyed hadnt she told herself from the start that men like him were all the same the betterlooking they were the more charming they were the bigger scum they were men who looked like byron had women crawling all over them every day of the week and hed said he thought he loved her what a crock energized with righteous fury she marched downstairs and snatched up her clothes scum swine slime ignoring her hose she struggled into skirt and blouse fumbling with her buttons as he came through the deck door with the dogs at his heels thought youd still be sleeping she eyed him narrowly i bet you did i took the dogs for a run on the beach we should go down later the storms brought some nice shells in he walked into the kitchen as he spoke swaggering like a gunslinger she followed want a beer he twisted the cap off one guzzled as he lowered the bottle he caught the glint of steel in her eyes problem problem no no problem at all before she could stop herself shed bunched up her fist and plowed it into his belly it was like hitting rock be sure when you see lottie you tell her im not your goddamn housekeeper he rubbed his belly more in surprise than discomfort huh oh brilliant you always have such a sharp riposte de witt how dare you how dare you say the things you said to me do the things you did and have some some tramp named lottie on the side it wasnt quite clear but he thought he was starting to catch up lottie called he ventured she made the same sound in her throat that hed heard once or twice before as much for her sake as his own he held up a hand and backed off youre going to hurt yourself if you hit me again her gaze shifted lingered on the kitchen block filled with blackhandled knives he didnt believe it not for an instant but he stepped between her and the sharp implements now im going to guess that the phone woke you up and it was lottie and lottie by the way is not a tramp i say she is and either way youre still a lying twotiming scum how long did you expect to get away with telling her i was your housekeeper and just what were you going to tell me she was he studied his beer for a moment tried to keep the gleam out of his eyes when they met hers my sister oh very original im out of here not so fast it wasnt much of a challenge to grab her onearmed around the waist and haul her to a chair she was kicking swinging but he managed it easily lottie he said as he shoved her in place again is my sister you dont have a sister named lottie she fired back you idiot you told me your sisters names just a few hours ago suellen meg and charlotte he finished and didnt bother to conceal the smugness lottie shes a pediatrician married three kids and she has just the kind of warped sense of humor that might make her appreciate having my lover call her a tramp he watched the embarrassed blush stain kates cheek want that beer now no voice strained pride forfeited she got to her feet i apologize i dont normally jump to conclusions its been a difficult and emotional day uhhuh damn him i was asleep when she called and she never gave me a chance to say anything thats lottie and i just assumed i was asleep she said furious disoriented i was jealous he finished and backed her up against the refrigerator thats okay i like it to a point i dont like it to any point im sorry i hit you youre going to have to work on those arms if you want to have any impact he put a hand under her chin to lift it you wouldnt have gone for the knives would you of course not she slanted her gaze toward them shrugged probably not he let his hand drop took another swig of beer honey you terrify me im sorry really theres no excuse for behaving that way it was kneejerk she pressed her hands together confession always hurt i was involved with someone a couple of years ago i dont get involved easily and he wasnt what you could term the faithful type did you love him no but i trusted him he nodded set the beer aside and trust is more fragile than love he cupped her face in his hands you can trust me kate he pressed his lips to her brow then eased back with a grin on his face i would never risk having you slice off any important appendages with a chefs knife feeling both soothed and foolish she settled into his arms i would never have used it her lips curved against his probably chapter fifteen contents prev next this is so incredibly dumb naked kate fidgeted and blew the bangs out of her eyes i feel like an idiot leave your hair alone margo ordered i worked too hard on it to have you screw it up and stop gnawing on your lip i hate wearing lipstick why wont you let me see my face kate craned her neck but margo had draped the mirror in the wardrobe room i look like a clown dont i you made me look like a clown actually its more like a twentydollar hooker but its such a nice look for you hold still damn it so i can get you into this thing suffering mightily kate lifted her arms as margo hooked her into what seemed to be some instrument of medieval torture why are you doing this to me margo i cut the check for your dippy string trio didnt i i went along with the truffles even though theyre snuffed out by pigs and hideously expensive her face set like a general leading troops into battle margo adjusted the bustier you agreed to follow my guidance for your image tonight the annual reception and charity auction is pretenses most important event now stop bitching stop playing with my tits oh but i love them so there margo stepped back then nodded in satisfaction i didnt have much to work with but keep it up miss d cup kate grumbled then looked down and goggled jesus where did they come from amazing isnt it in the right harness those puppies just rise i have breasts stunned kate patted the swell rising above black satin and lace and cleavage its all a matter of proper positioning and making the most of what we have even when its next to nothing shut up grinning kate slicked her hands down her torso look ma im a girl you aint seen nothing yet put this on margo tossed her a thin swatch of stretchy lace kate studied the garter belt tugged it snorted youre kidding im not putting it on for you margo patted the bulge under her sparkling silver tunic at seven months and counting bending over isnt as easy as it used to be i feel like im in dress rehearsal for a porn flick but after a struggle kate snapped the garter belt into place its a little hard to breathe hose margo ordered youd better sit down to put them on with her hands on her hips margo supervised the production not so fast youll snag those arent your industrialstrength panty hose brows beetled kate flicked up a glance do you have to watch me yes wheres laura margo wondered and began to pace she should be here and if the musicians dont show up in the next ten minutes they wont have time to set up before the guests start to arrive everythingll be fine stalling kate smoothed her hose up her legs you know margo i really do think it would be best if i kept sort of a low profile tonight with this cloud over my head it makes things awkward chicken kates head shot up i am not a chicken im a scandal and last year i was the scandal margo shrugged her shoulders maybe we can work something out so that laura can fill the role next year its not funny nobody understands that better than i do margo laid a hand on kates flushed cheek nobody understands how scared you are right now better than i do i guess not comforted kate turned her face to margos palm its just that its dragging on for so long i keep expecting that kusack character to show up and cart me off in chains its not enough that they cant prove i did it if i cant prove i didnt im not going to say youll get through it thats not enough either but no one who knows you believes it and didnt you say byron had some sort of angle to work on he didnt really explain she moved her shoulder tugged at the elastic strap on the lacy belt just mumbled the equivalent of me not worrying my pretty head over it i really hate that men like to play white knight kate it doesnt hurt to let them do that now and again its been weeks since marty got the copies to us ive gone over them all line by line but she trailed off well weve all been pretty busy and i havent been jolted out of sleep by the sound of bullhorns telling me theyve got me surrounded dont worry when that happens we wont let them take you alive if they raid the shop tonight well have byron help you escape in one of his macho cars if he makes it at all he had to fly down to la this morning i thought i told you hell be back in time he couldnt say for sure and kate refused to pout over it it doesnt matter youre crazy about him i am not we have a very mature mutually satisfying relationship distracted she tugged on the strap again how do these silly things work god let me huffing margo knelt down and demonstrated how to hook the hose i beg your pardon laura paused at the doorway stuck her tongue in her cheek i seem to be de trop perhaps theres something you two would like to share with me another comedienne kate looked down at the top of margos head and giggled christ now heres a scandal pregnant former sex symbol and suspected embezzler celebrate their alternative lifestyle could i just go get my camera laura asked done margo proclaimed then held up a hand stop snickering laura and help me up sorry as she hauled margo to her feet lauras gaze fell on kate her friend was sitting in an elegant queen anne chair wearing a black bustier with matching lacy garter belt and sheer black stockings why kate you look so different i have tits she stated and rose margo gave them to me what are friends for you might want to finish dressing unless thats your outfit for this evening the musicians pulled up behind me terrific laura its the offtheshoulder floorlength bronze margo gestured vaguely as she started into the main showroom ill be back why does she think i need to be dressed ive been dressing myself for several years now let her fuss laura took down the gown margo had cho sen it helps keep her from being nervous about tonight and laura pursed her lips as she studied the dress shes got a hell of an eye this is going to look great on you i hate all this sighing lustily kate stepped into the gown i mean its okay for her she loves it and you youd look elegant in tinfoil id never be able to wear what youve got on what is that anyway ancient laura said dismissing her smartly tailored coppertoned evening suit im getting one last wear out of it before i put it into stock there all hooked in stand back let me see i dont look stupid do i my arms arent bad now i mean my biceps are sort of happening ive been working on the delts too bony shoulders arent very attractive you look beautiful i dont really care but i dont like looking stupid okay were right on schedule margo announced as she hurried back in with one hand she supported her belly and tried to ignore the fact that the baby seemed determined to settle directly on her bladder she tilted her head took a long narrowedeyed study of her creation and nodded good really good now a few finishing touches oh listen oh mommy do i have to wear that exquisite jeweled collar margo whined as she lifted it from the box oh please not those gorgeous earrings too kate rolled her eyes as margo decorated her can you imagine what shes going to do to that kid the minute it pops out shes going to have it swaddled in armani and accessorized ungrateful brat margo took a purse atomizer out of her pocket and spritzed before kate could evade you know i hate that why else would i do it turn around and drum roll please with a flourish margo tugged the draping off the mirror holy shit her mouth agape kate stared at the reflection there was enough of kate to recognize she thought dazed but where had those exotic eyes come from and that unquestionably erotic mouth the figure an actual figure draped in shimmering bronze that made all that exposed skin seem polished she cleared her throat turned turned again i look good she managed a grilled cheese sandwich looks good margo corrected baby you look dangerous i kind of do kate grinned and watched that sirens mouth move smugly damn i hope byron gets here wait till he gets a load of me he was doing his best to get there the trip to la had been inconvenient but necessary under normal circumstances he would have arranged to make a full swing of it spotchecking the hotels and resorts in santa barbara san diego san francisco it was important he knew for the staff at every templeton hotel to feel that personal connection with the home base josh handled the factories the vineyards and orchards the plants and continued to spotcheck the international branches but california was byrons responsibility he never took responsibility lightly and there were still ruffled feathers to be smoothed from peter ridgeways reign which by all accounts had been as cold as it had been efficient he knew what was expected of him the personal touch that templeton was founded and thrived on the memory for names and faces and details even as he jetted back byron dictated a raft of memos to his assistant fired off countless faxes and completed one final meeting via air phone now he was home and late but hed anticipated that with the finesse of long habit he quickly fastened the studs on his tuxedo shirt maybe he should call kate at the shop and tell her he was on his way a glance at his watch told him the reception was into its second hour shed be busy would she miss him he wanted her to he wanted to imagine her looking toward the door whenever it opened and hoping he wanted her to be thinking of him wishing he were there so they could share some comment or observation about the other guests the way couples always did he looked forward to seeing that speculation in her eyes when she studied him that look of hers that so clearly said what are you doing here de witt whats going on between us and why she would continually march along looking for the practical answer the rational one and he would cruise on the emotional it made he decided as he adjusted his black tie for a good mix he was willing to wait for her to come to the same conclusion at least for a little while she needed to resolve this crisis put the whole ugly business behind her he intended to help her and he could wait for that before looking toward the future when the phone beside the bed rang he considered letting the machine take it family or work he supposed and either of those could do without him for a couple of hours then again suellen was expecting her first grandchild and hell he snapped up the phone de witt he listened questioned verified and with a grim smile on his face hung up it appeared he had a stop to make before the party kusack was still at his desk it was his wifes bridge night and her turn to host the evening he preferred the sloppy meatball sandwich and lukewarm cream soda at his desk to the tiny lady treats being served at chez kusack he definitely preferred the smell of stale coffee the headachy ringing of phones and the incessant bickering and complaining of his colleagues to the cloying perfumes the giggles and gossip of the ladies bridge club there was always paperwork to see to though it would have earned him sneers to admit it he enjoyed paperwork and plowed through it like a st bernard through a blizzard slow and steady he liked the tangibility of it even the foolish convoluted policespeak so necessary to any official report hed made the adjustment to computers more smoothly than many cops his age to kusack a keyboard was a keyboard and he had used what he called the bible method of typing seek and ye shall find all of his professional life it never failed him he was tapping on keys grinning to himself as the letters popped onto his screen when a man in a tuxedo interrupted him detective kusack yeah kusack sat back skimmed his cops eyes over the suit no rental job he deduced tailormade and very pricey it aint prom night and youre too old anyhow what can i do for you im byron de witt im here regarding katherine powell kusack grunted picked up his can of soda i thought her lawyers name was templeton im not her lawyer im her friend uhhuh well friend i cant discuss ms powells business with anybody who walks in here no matter how nice they dress kate didnt mention how gracious you were may i make yourself at home kusack said sourly he wanted the monotony of his paperwork not chitchat with prince charming underpaid public servants are always at your disposal it wont take long i have new evidence that i believe weighs in ms powells favor are you interested kusack or shall i wait until you finish your dinner kusack ran his tongue around his teeth and eyed the second half of his meatball sub information is always welcome mr de witt and im here to serve at least until the bridge club clears out what is it you think you have i obtained copies of the documents in question did you kusacks bland eyes narrowed did you really and how did you do that without breaking any laws detective once the copies were in my possession i did what it seems to me in my muddled civilian capacity should have been done at the outset i sent them to a handwriting expert leaning back kusack picked up what remained of his dinner used his free hand to motion byron to continue i just received my experts report via phone i had him fax it to me byron took the sheet out of his inside pocket unfolded it and laid it on kusacks desk fitzgerald kusack said with his mouth full good man considered tops in his field so josh had said byron thought hes been used for over a decade by both prosecutors and defense attorneys mostly for the defense rich defense said kusack he caught the whiff of templeton influence costs a goddamn fortune and has a very full schedule byron thought hence the delay in the report whatever his fee detective his reputation is unimpeachable if you care to read his report youll see dont have to i know what it says it was small of him kusack supposed but it gave him a little lift to tweak a man who didnt appear to have an ounce of extra fat on his body and who could wear a monkey suit and not look like a fool byron folded his hands patience was and always had been his best weapon then youve been in contact with mr fitzgerald on this matter nope kusack dug out a napkin wiped his mouth got our own handwriting analysts got their final take in a couple weeks ago politely he stifled a belch the signatures on the altered forms are an exact match too exact he added before byron could snarl nobody writes their name the exact and precise same way every time all the doctored forms have the same precise signature stroke for stroke loop for loop copies likely tracings of ms powells signature on the one if you know that why are you sitting here this is hell for her yeah i figured that trouble is i gotta cross all my ts dot all my is thats the way things work around here weve got a few lines of inquiry going here that may be detective but ms powell has a right to know the status of your investigation as it happens mr de witt im finishing up my report on the progress of this investigation right now ill see mr bittle first thing in the morning and continue my investigation you certainly dont believe kate copied her own signature you know i believe shes smart enough to have done something just that clever he balled up the napkin and twopointed it into an overflowing wastebasket but i dont think shes stupid enough or greedy enough to have risked her job and her freedom for a piddly seventyfive large he rolled his shoulders which had grown stiff after hours at his desk i dont believe shed have risked it for any amount of money then you believe shes innocent i know shes innocent kusack sighed a little and adjusted his girth look de witt ive been doing this job a long time i know how to look into peoples backgrounds their habits their weaknesses my take is that ms powells weakness if you want to call it that was making a big splash at bittle now why is she going to jeopardize something she wants that much for a little playingaround money she doesnt gamble she doesnt do drugs doesnt sleep with the boss if she needs flash shes got the templeton pool to play in but she doesnt she puts in sixtyhour weeks at bittle and builds up her client list that tells me shes hardworking and ambitious you might have indicated to her that you believed her its not my job to soothe anxious souls and ive got my reasons for keeping her on the hot seat hard evidence is what makes or breaks a case in the real world and gathering hard evidence takes time now i appreciate you coming by with this he handed byron the experts report if it helps you can tell ms powell that the department has no plans to charge her with anything thats not enough byron said as he rose its a start ive got seventyfive thousand to track down mr de witt then well finish it it seemed he would have to be satisfied with that byron slipped the report back in his pocket then eyed kusack you never believed she was guilty i go into an investigation with an open mind maybe she did it maybe she didnt after i took her statement i knew she didnt its the nose byron smiled curiously she didnt smell guilty laughing kusack stood stretched theres that you could say ive got a nose for guilt i meant her nose im sorry byron shook his head youve lost me anybody who dives headfirst into third and busts their nose to stretch a double has guts and style somebody who wants to win that bad doesnt steal stealings too easy and this kind of stealings too ordinary sliding into third byron murmured grinning foolishly so thats how she did it i never asked her because kusack was grinning back byron offered a hand thanks for your time detective the crowd was thinning out by the time byron arrived at pretenses three hours late he thought with a wince the auction was obviously over and only those lingering over their drinks or conversations were left the fragrance of night jasmine blooming on the veranda mixed with the scents of perfume and wine he spotted margo first flirting with her husband even as he hurried toward her he was scanning for kate margo im sorry im so late you should be she touched pouty lips to his you completely missed the bidding now youll have to come in next week and buy something very very expensive its the least i can do still you look successful when you bother to look at me she thought smothering a grin at the way he kept searching the room we raised just over fifteen thousand for wednesdays child nothing makes me happier than raising money to help handicapped children josh wrapped his arms around her from the back placed their joint hands protectively over her belly it rippled under them thrillingly shes trying not to look too gleeful over the number of requests to hold merchandise its a charity event she said primly then laughed and boy are we going to clean up next week in fact kates in the office logging in all the holds ill go let her know im here actually i he broke off torn josh was her lawyer after all no i have to tell her first dont go anywhere he started across the room just as kate swung through the office door there you are she beamed at him i thought you must have gotten stuck in la you didnt have to she stopped because he was staring at her as if hed had a lobotomy on the trip home what is it he managed to close his mouth get his lungs working again okay who are you and what have you done with katherine powell boy a guy doesnt see you for a few hours and oh her face lit up and she tried a sophisticated turn i forgot margo did it what do you think he turned first to margo god bless you he said fervently then took kates hand what do i think i think my heart stopped he kissed her fingers then wanting more her mouth wow a little surprised by the dizzying depth of the kiss she took a cautious step back look what a little goop on the face and a pushup bra gets you his gaze shifted down is that whats under there youre not going to believe whats under here how long is it going to take for me to find out amused by his reaction she toyed with his tie well big guy if you play your cards right we can damn he grabbed her hands its amazing how a sexy woman can shut a mans mind down i have news for you fine if youd rather discuss current events than my underwear dont distract me ive just come from seeing detective kusack its why im so late you went to see him the excited flush drained out of her cheeks he called you in im sorry byron theres no reason for you to be involved no he gave her a little shake be quiet i went to see him because i finally got the report ive been waiting for i had the documents marty bittle gave me sent to a handwriting expert that josh recommended handwriting expert but you never told me josh never said anything before her eyes could heat he hurried on we wanted to wait until we had some results and now we do they were forgeries kate copies of your signature copies her hands began to tremble in his he can prove it hes one of the most respected people in his field in the country but we didnt need him kusack had already verified the signatures he knows theyre forgeries he doesnt consider you a suspect kate apparently he never really did he believed me he got his experts report shortly before i got mine hes going to take the information and his progress report to bittle in the morning i cant take it in thats all right he pressed his lips to her brow take your time you believed me she said shakily from the first day on the cliffs you didnt even know me but you believed me yes i did he kissed her again and smiled it must be that nose whose nose ill explain later come on we have to fill josh in okay byron she squeezed his arm you went to see kusack before you came here was that what youd call a white knight sort of thing sounds like a trick question he thought it could be construed in that manner i thought so listen i wouldnt want you to make it a habit but thanks grateful and touched she pressed her lips to his thank you very much youre welcome because he didnt want her eyes swimming but laughing he traced a fingertip over her beautifully bared shoulder does that mean i get to see your underwear chapter sixteen contents prev next kate had a longstanding concept of what sunday mornings were for they were for sleep throughout college she had used them for extra study time or to finish up papers and projects but once she entered the real world she designated that time for indulgence byron had a different agenda youve got to resist both ways he told her mentally isolate the muscle youre working on right here he pressed his fingers to her triceps as she lifted and lowered the fivepound weight over her head behind her back dont flop your arm he ordered youre pulling it up and pushing it down through mud mud right she tried to envision a pool of thick oozing mud instead of a nice soft bed with cool sheets and why am i doing this because its good for you good for me she muttered and watched herself in the mirror she had thought she would feel ridiculous in the little sports bra and snug bike pants but it wasnt really so bad besides she got to look at him too a wellbuilt man in a tank top and sweat shorts wasnt hard on the eyes at all now stretch dont forget the stretch go to the set of concentration curls remember yeah yeah yeah she sat on the bench frowned at the weight she lifted and lowered and tried to imagine her biceps growing goodbye onehundredandtwopound weakling she thought hello buff and when were finished here youre going to make french toast right that was the deal ive got me a personal trainer and a chef she flashed him a smile pretty cool youre a lucky woman katherine other arm now concentrate he moved her through flys and dead lifts hammer lifts and extensions though hed completed his sunday routine before hauling her out of bed theyd both worked up a nice sweat by the time he proclaimed her finished so im going to be buff huh he grinned rubbing her shoulders massaging his way down her arms sure you are kid well put you in one of those little bikinis oil you up and shoot you into competition in your dreams not my dreams he said sincerely believe me ive discovered this latent desire for skinny women in fact its starting to stir right now is that so she didnt object when his hands moved around her back and down to cup her bottom im afraid it is hmm his fingers roamed clutched this reminds me tomorrow we work on the lower body i hate those squats thats because you dont have my vantage point his gaze shifted to the mirror behind her and he watched his hands take possession watched her move against him saw her shiver when he lowered his mouth to that wonderful curve of neck and shoulder it was almost ridiculous the way he wanted her the way the need would rise up time after time again and again like breathing he thought nibbling his way up to her ear like life i think we should finish off your morning routine with a little aerobics she managed a sound between a groan and a sigh not the nordictrack byron im begging you i had something else in mind his busy mouth skimmed over her cheek i think youll like it oh she got the idea when his hand moved up to palm her breast you did say that for overall training aerobics is essential just put yourself in my hands i was hoping youd say that she gave so easily he thought so eagerly the way her mouth moved on his the mating of tongues the press of bodies all of his old fantasies about the woman of his dreams had faded and shifted and reemerged as her only her an image of her flickered into his mind the way shed looked the night before in that slim shoulderbaring dress all that smooth skin those surprising curves that wide wet mouth and beneath the dress had been a wanton fantasy of black lace the sight of her had been staggering and so unexpected so impractical for his practical kate it was a side of her he had loved exploring knowing she had been exploring it as well had been brutally erotic she was just as appealing to him now in damp workout gear that he could hastily peel off both of them were naked to the waist when they tumbled to the mat she laughed rolling with him as they tugged at those last barriers it was wonderful wasnt it to feel so unbound so completely liberated shed stopped questioning how it was he knew just where just how to touch her as if hed always known and his body was so strong so hard it was like making love with a dream rolling on top of him she poured the sheer joy of it into a kiss yes touch me she thought and taste here and here let me again always again she thought as her heart pounded and her blood swam over and over moment to moment he could fill her with so many clashing sensations the wave of heat the chill of anticipation a shiver of greed the warmth of giving she wanted to hold him forever to steep herself in him lose herself and so she took him inside here trembling to a gasp at that bright instant of joining she arched back savoring tormenting herself with the power groaning at the texture of his hands that slicked up her to torture her aching breasts she held them there her tensed fingers gripping as she began to move it staggered him the look of her the dark cap of hair framed her glowing face breath heaved and hitched through her parted lips that long swans neck was bowed back the does eyes closed sunlight poured in over her so bright so full they might have been outdoors in some verdant meadow he could see her there a hotblooded titania lusty and sleek he wanted her to feed herself feed herself to satiation but she increased her rhythm driving him with her her moans and cries swarmed into his blood until they were thrust for desperate thrust he exploded beneath her into her with one long glorying sigh she slid down and crushed her mouth to his she sang in the shower this was unusual even when she was alone kate was well aware that she did not have a voice like a bell as they lathered and soaped he joined in for a miserably offkey if heartfelt version of proud mary ike and tina had nothing on us she decided as she toweled her hair not a thing except maybe talent byron wrapped a towel around his hips rubbed his face and prepared to shave youre the first woman ive showered with who sings as badly as i do she straightened watched him lather up oh really just how many women might that be the mind boggles he grinned at her enjoying the laser gleam in her eyes and a true gentleman never keeps score she watched him swipe the razor through lather leaving a smooth clean path it occurred to her shed never actually watched a man shave before unless she included josh and a brother didnt count but she refused to be distracted by the interesting male ritual instead she smiled sweetly and looked over his shoulder into the foggy mirror why dont you let me do that for you darling he lifted an eyebrow do i look stupid enough to put a sharp instrument in your hands he rinsed the blade i dont think so coward you betcha she snorted nipped his shoulder with her teeth then headed toward the bedroom to dress kate he waited until shed turned aimed that smug look in his direction theres only one woman now he watched her quick almost shy smile spread before she slipped out the door thoughtfully byron stroked off lather and stubble the room was full of mist and heat and their mixed scents shed hung her towel neatly and efficiently to dry the little jar she used to moisturize her face sat on the counter shed forgotten to use it she hadnt forgotten to put her workout clothes in the hamper or to replace the cap on the toothpaste no she would never overlook any practical detail it was the extras she forgot particularly when they applied to herself she wouldnt let herself browse through a shop dreaming and buy something foolish for herself she wouldnt forget to turn off the lights or to give a faucet an extra twist to prevent a drip her bills would always be paid on time but stopping to eat lunch would slip her mind when it was crowded with other details she didnt have a clue that she needed him byron smiled as he lowered his head to rinse off the excess lather nor did she know what hed just discovered he no longer thought he might be falling in love with her he knew that she with all her contrasts and complexities her strengths and weaknesses was the only woman he would ever love he dried his face slapped on aftershave and decided this might be the perfect time to tell her he stepped into the bedroom she was standing beside the bed in black leggings and an old yankees sweatshirt see this she demanded shaking a mangled rawhide bone at him yes i do it was in my shoe how my shoe escaped the same treatment im not sure she tossed the bone to byron then scooped her hands through her hair to check for dryness it was nip that i am sure of tuck has much better manners last week it was that fish head he found on the beach he has to be disciplined byron hes very unruly now kate is that any way to talk about our child she sighed put her hands on her hips and waited ill talk to him but im sure if you considered the psychology of it youd agree that he puts things in your shoe as a token of his great affection and that includes the time he peed in it well im sure that was just a mistake he rubbed a hand over his mouth too wise to let the grin show and it was outside you took them off to walk on the beach and youre not buying it i dont think youd find it so amusing if he was using your shoes for his depository as if on cue there came the sound of frantic barking of growing canine bodies thudding ill deal with them kate stated youre too soft yeah and who bought them collars with their names on them he muttered what nothing retreating byron opened his drawer for underwear ill be down in a minute to make french toast she reminded him and rushed down to quiet the dogs okay guys kill the racket keep it up and theres not going to be any walk on the beach and nobodys going to play sock with either of you they rushed up and bumped against her two alarmingly growing masses of fur and feet even as she started to ruffle them they raced toward the front door and set up a fresh din you know you go out the back way she began then the idiotic door chimes sounded it seemed byron had decided they were whimsical and had kept them oh ridiculously pleased she beamed at the dogs pretty cool guys you were sounding the alarm listen if its anybody selling anything i want you to do this look look bare your teeth she demonstrated but they only thumped each other with their wagging tails and offered canine grins well work on it she decided and opened the door her bright mood plummeted mr bittle automatically she grabbed collars to prevent the dogs from leaping joyfully on the new humans detective im sorry to disturb you on sunday kate bittle eyed the dogs warily detective kusack indicated that he intended to speak with you today and i asked to come along your lawyer said i would find you here kusack put in youre free to call him of course if you want him here i thought i was told i was no longer a suspect im here to apologize bittle kept his solemn eyes on hers may we come in yes of course nip tuck no jumping nice dogs kusack held out a beefy hand and it was duly sniffed and licked got me an old heinz hound shes getting up in years now please sit down ill just put them out that task gave her time to compose herself when the dogs were racing maniacally over the yard she turned back would you like some coffee theres no need for you to trouble bittle began but kusack leaned back in the ancient recliner and said if youre making it anyway ill make it byron volunteered as he came down the stairs oh byron relief rippled through her you know detective kusack detective mr de witt and this is lawrence bittle of bittle and associates byron said coolly how do you do ill say ive done better bittle accepted the formal handshake tommys mentioned you we had an early round of golf this morning ill put the coffee on he sent a look to kusack that said as clearly as words that anything of import would wait until he came back nice place here kusack said casually kate stood where she was twisting her fingers together its coming along byron takes his time he just settled on it a couple of months ago hes ah having some things sent out from atlanta thats where hes from atlanta stop babbling kate she ordered herself couldnt and hes looking for things out here furniture and things hell of a spot kusack settled into the recliner thinking it was a chair that knew how to welcome a man house just down the road has a putting green right on the front lawn he shook his head guy can walk right out his front door and sink a few used to drive the kids down here they got a kick out of the seals yes theyre wonderful gnawing her lip she glanced toward the kitchen sometimes you can hear them barking detective kusack are you here to question me ive got some questions he sniffed the air nothing like the smell of coffee brewing is there even the poison down at the station house smells like heaven before you taste it why dont you sit down ms powell ill tell you again you can lawyer yourself up but youre not going to need mr templeton for what we have to talk about all right but shed reserve judgment on calling josh she was not going to be lulled by small talk and paternal smiles what do you want mr de witt snowed you the report from his handwriting expert yes last night she sat on the arm of the couch it was the best she could do it said the signatures were copies someone duplicated my signature on the altered forms used my signature my clients my reputation she rose again when byron came in with a tray im sorry she said quickly for the trouble here dont be ridiculous he slid easily into the wellmannered host how do you take your coffee mr bittle just cream thank you detective the way it comes out of the pot he sampled the brew byron offered him now were talking coffee i was about to go over the progress of the investigation with ms powell im explaining that our conclusions jibe with those of your independent expert at this point indications are that she was set up to take the heat if the discrepancies were discovered were looking into other areas you mean other people kate said struggling not to clatter her cup in her saucer im saying my investigation is moving along id like to ask you if you have any idea who would focus on you as a scapegoat there are a lot of accounts in the firm only those under your hand were touched if someone did this to damage me i dont have a clue maybe you were just convenient the charges against your father made you prime maybe gave someone an idea no one knew i only found out myself shortly before the suspension interesting and how did you find out absently she rubbed a finger over her temple as she explained you have words with anybody a tiff a personality clash maybe i didnt have a fight with anyone not everyone at the firm is a close friend and confidant but we work well together no grudge matches petty grievances nothing out of the ordinary she set her coffee aside nearly untasted nancy in billing and i squared off over a misplaced invoice during the april crunch tempers are high then i think i snapped at bill feinstein for taking half my computer paper instead of going into stock himself she smiled a little he stuck three cases of it in my office to get back at me for that ms newman doesnt like me but she doesnt like anyone but mr bittle senior bittle stared into his coffee ms newman is efficient and a bit territorial he winced as kusack busily made notes shes worked for me for twenty years i didnt mean she would do something like this horrified kate sprang up i didnt mean that at all i wouldnt accuse anyone you might as well say amanda devin did it she guards her lone female partner status like a hawk watching for vultures or or mike lloyd in the mail room because he cant afford to go to college full time or stu cominsky because i wouldnt go out with him roger thornhill because i did lloyd and cominsky and thornhill kusack muttered as he wrote and kate stopped her pacing you write whatever you want to write in that little book of yours but im not going to go around casting blame she lifted her chin set it i know how it feels ms powell watching her kusack tapped his stubby pencil against his knee this is a police investigation youre involved every member of your former firm is going to be considered its a long process with your cooperation it can be shortened i dont know anything she said stubbornly i dont know anyone who needed money that badly or who would choose to implicate me in a crime i do know ive already paid all i intend to pay for something i didnt do if you want to ruin someone elses life detective youll have to do it without me i appreciate your position ms powell youre insulted and i cant blame you you do your job do whats expected of you and go the extra mile you see what youve been aiming for swing just into reach then you get kicked in the teeth thats a nice and very accurate summary if i knew who did the kicking id be the first to tell you but im not going to put someone whose only crime was to irritate me into the position ive been in think about it he suggested youve got a good brain once you set your mind to figuring it out i have a hunch youll come up with something the detective rose and bittle followed his lead saying before we go kate id like another moment of your time in private if theres no objection all right i she glanced at byron perhaps youd like to see the view detective byron gestured then led the way to the deck doors did i hear you say you had a dog old sadie ugly as homemade sin but sweet as they come his voice faded away as byron closed the doors an apology isnt enough bittle began without preamble is far from enough im trying to be fair and understand the position you were in mr bittle its difficult you watched me grow up you know my family you should have known me youre quite right he looked very old very old and very tired ive damaged my friendship with your uncle a friendship that is very important to me uncle tommy doesnt hold grudges no but i hurt one of his children and that isnt easy for either of us to forget i can tell you for what its worth that none of us initially believed you would do anything criminal we needed an explanation and your reaction to the questions was well damning understandable now under the circumstances but then you didnt know about my father then did you no we learned about it later there was a copy of a newspaper article in your office oh as simple as that she thought and as stupid she must have missed one when shed stuffed them into her briefcase i see that made it all look worse it clouded the issue i should tell you that when detective kusack contacted me i was immensely relieved and not terribly surprised i could never reconcile the woman i knew with one who would cheat but you reconciled it enough to suspend me she said and heard the brittleness of her own voice yes however much i regretted it and however much i regret it now i had no choice i have called each of the partners and relayed this new information were meeting in an hour to discuss it and to discuss the fact that we have an embezzler in our employ he paused a moment gathering his thoughts youre very young it would be difficult for you to understand the dreams of a lifetime and the way they change at my age you have to be very careful very selective about dreams you begin to become aware that each one may be your last the firm has been mine for most of my life ive nurtured it sweated over it brought my children into it he smiled a little an accounting firm doesnt seem like something anyone would dream over i understand she wanted to touch his arm but couldnt i thought you might its reputation is my reputation having it damaged in this way makes me realize how fragile even such a prosaic dream can be she couldnt help but bend its a good firm mr bittle you made something solid there the people who work for you work for you because you treat them well because you make them part of the whole that isnt really prosaic id like you to consider coming back i realize that you may feel uncomfortable doing so until after this matter is fully resolved however bittle and associates would be very fortunate to have you back on board as a full partner when she didnt speak he took a step toward her kate i dont know whether this will make matters worse or better between us but i want you to know that this offer had already been discussed and voted on prior to this this nightmare you were unanimously approved she had to ease herself back down on the arm of the chair you were going to make me a partner marty nominated you i hope youre aware that you always had his complete trust and support amanda seconded your nomination ah i believe that was why she was so harsh when she believed you had taken the money from escrow youd earned the offer kate i hope once youve had time to think it over youll accept it it was difficult to deal with despair and elation at once not long before she would have leapt at such an offer seized it hugged it to her she opened her mouth certain that acceptance would pop out i do need some time she heard her own words with a kind of vague surprise i have to think it through of course you do please before you consider going elsewhere give us a chance to negotiate yes i will she held out a hand just as byron and the detective returned thank you for coming to see me she was still dazed when she led bittle and detective kusak out said her goodbyes in silence she walked back into the house with byron stood staring at nothing well he prompted he offered me a partnership she said each word slowly unsure whether she was savoring them or weighing them not just to make up for all this theyd already voted on it before everything got screwed up hes willing to negotiate my terms byron angled his head why arent you smiling huh she blinked stared at him then burst into laughter a partnership she threw her arms around his neck and let him swing her byron i cant tell you what this means to me im too dazzled to tell myself its like its like being cut from the minors then being signed to bat cleanup for the yankees the braves he corrected home team loyal to the last congratulations i think we should have mimosas with that french toast lets she kissed him hard and go light on the oj a dollop for color he assured her as they walked into the kitchen arm in arm he released her to get champagne out of the refrigerator well arent you going to pick up the phone she opened the glassfronted cabinet that held his wine glasses the phone to call your family uhuh this is too big for the phone as soon as we eat she grinned foolishly at the pop of the cork im going to templeton house this requires the personal touch its the perfect way to send aunt susie and uncle tommy back to france the minute hed finished pouring she lifted her glass heres to the irs he hissed through his teeth do we have to okay what the hell heres to me she drank twirled once then drank again youll come with me wont you well get mrs williamson to make one of her incredible dinners well take the dogs too we can what are you looking at you i like seeing you happy get that french toast going and youll see me ecstatic im starving give the master room please he took out eggs and milk why dont we swing by your apartment and pick up a few more of your things we can extend our celebration by having you stay another night okay she was too high to think of objecting though it broke her unspoken rule of staying more than two nights running ill get it she said when the phone rang you keep cooking and use lots of cinnamon hello laura hi i was just thinking about you grinning she swung over to nip at byrons ear as he whisked we were going to come over later and invite ourselves to dinner i have some news that i what she fell into silence and the hand shed lifted to mess with byrons hair dropped back to her side when at the yes oh god oh god okay well be right there were on our way its margo she said fumbling to disconnect the portable phone josh took her to the hospital the baby i dont know i just dont know its too early for the baby she had pain and some bleeding oh god byron come on he clasped the hand that reached for his lets go chapter seventeen contents prev next she was grateful that it was byron behind the wheel no matter how she ordered herself to be calm she knew her hands would have trembled flashes of margo ran through her head there were images of them as children sitting on the cliffs tossing flowers out to the sea and seraphina margo parading around the bedroom in her first bra smug and curvy while kate and laura looked on in flatchested envy margo curling kates hair for the junior prom then slipping a condom into kates bag just in case margo on her first visit home after running off to hollywood to become a star so polished and beautiful margo in paris after shed nagged kate to come over and see the world as it was meant to be margo at templeton house always back to templeton house in despair after her world had crumbled in fury when one of her friends was hurt the determination and glassy bravado as shed fought to rebuild her life as a bride walking down the aisle to josh so outrageously lovely in miles of white satin and french lace weeping as she rushed into the shop to announce she didnt have the flu but was pregnant weeping again when she felt the baby quicken and cooing over the tiny clothes her mother was already sewing showing off her bulging belly beaming when it rippled with a kick margo always so passionate so impulsive and so thrilled with the idea of having a baby the baby kate squeezed her eyes tight oh god the baby she doesnt want to know if its a girl or a boy kate murmured she said they want to be surprised they have names picked out suzanna if its a girl for aunt susie and annie and john thomas if its a boy for margos father and uncle tommy oh byron what if dont think about what ifs just hold on he took his hand off the gearshift long enough to squeeze hers im trying just as she tried to block the shudder when he pulled into the parking lot in front of the tall white building lets hurry she was quaking when they reached the door byron pulled her back studied her face i can go and find out whats going on you dont have to go in yes i do i can handle it i know you can he linked his fingers with hers margo was in the maternity wing as she hurried down the corridor kate blocked out the sounds and smells of hospital at least this wing had familiar and good memories lauras babies the rush and thrill of being a part of those births soothed away the worst edge of panic urged kate to remember what it was like to watch life fight its way into existence and to tell herself that this place was one of birth not death the first face she saw was lauras ive been watching for you laura wrapped her arms around kate in relief everybodys here in the waiting room josh is with margo whats going on is she all right the baby everythings all right as far as we know laura led her toward the waiting area and struggled to maintain the pretense of calm apparently she went into premature labor and she was hemorrhaging oh my god theyve stopped the bleeding theyve stopped it laura took a slow breath to steady herself but her eyes mirrored her inner fears annie was just in to see her she says margos holding her own theyre trying to stabilize her stop the labor its too early isnt it shes only in her seventh month kate stepped into the waiting area saw worried faces and ruthlessly smothered her own fears annie kate caught both the womans hands in hers shell be all right you know how strong and stubborn she is she looked so small in the bed in there anns voice broke like a little girl shes too pale they should do something for her shes too pale annie we need coffee susan slid an arm around her shoulders why dont you help me get some after stroking a hand down kates arm she led annie away susie will take care of her thomas murmured he often thought there was too little for a man to do at such a time and too much for him to imagine now sit down katie girl youre too pale yourself i want to see her the walls were closing in already thick with the scent of fear that meant hospital to her uncle tommy youll make them let me see her of course i will he kissed her cheek then shook his head at his daughter no you stay here ill check on the girls while im at it though you should know theyll be fine down in day care theyre worried ali especially she adores margo ill tend to them im leaving all my women in your hands byron ill take care of them sit down he murmured and nudged both of them to a couch ill help your mother and ann with the coffee he saw their hands link before he turned away can you tell me what happened kate asked josh called from his car phone he didnt want to take time to call an ambulance he was trying to sound calm but i could tell he was panicked he said shed been feeling tired and a little achy after last night when they got up this morning she wasnt feeling well complained of back pain shes been working too hard all that prep for the auction we should have postponed it this year i should have pulled more weight kate thought everything was fine at her last checkup laura put in rubbing her brow but you may be right she said she was going to take a shower then she started shouting for him she was bleeding and having contractions by the time we got here theyd admitted her i havent seen her yet theyll let us see her damn right they will laura took the coffee byron offered remembering to thank him the waitings hell he sat beside kate it always is my sister meg had a bad time with her first thirtyhour labor which translates to the rest of your life when youre pacing just talk he ordered himself just talk and give them something else to focus on abigail was a hefty nine pounds and meg swore shed never have another went on to have two more it was so easy for me laura murmured nine hours for ali only five for kayla they just sort of slid out selective memory kate corrected i distinctly remember you breaking all the bones in my hand while we were in the birthing room that was ali and with kayla you she sprang to her feet when a nurse stopped in the doorway she stepped over the coffee table prepped for battle we want to see margo templeton now so ive been informed the nurse said dryly mrs templeton would like to see you youll have to keep it short this way please she led the way down a wide corridor kate blocked out the hospital sound of crepesoled shoes slapping on linoleum there were so many doors she thought white doors all closed so many people inside them beds with curtains around them machines beeped and hissed inside tubes and needles doctors with sad tired eyes who came to tell you your parents had died gone away left you alone kate laura soothed the hand that gripped hers im okay she ordered herself to stay in the now and relaxed her grip dont worry the nurse opened the door and there was the room it was designed to be comforting cheerful a room to welcome new life a rocking chair warm ivory walls with dark trim thriving plants and the quiet strains of a chopin sonata were all pieces of the serene whole but the machine was there beeping and the rolling stool that doctors used and the bed with its guarded sides and stiff white sheets margo lay in it glassily pale her glorious hair pulled back a few loose tendrils curled damply around her face the bag hanging from the iv stand beside the bed dripped clear liquid down a tube and into her she had one hand pressed protectively to her belly the other in joshs there you are margos lips curved as she gave her husbands hand a reassuring squeeze take a break josh go ahead she rubbed their joined hands over her cheek this is girl talk he hesitated obviously torn between doing what she wanted and being more than a step away from her ill be right outside he lowered his head to kiss her and his hand brushed over the bulge of her belly dont forget your breathing ive been breathing for years ive almost got it down pat now go on out and pace like an expectant father well make her behave laura assured him she sat on the edge of the bed and patted his thigh ill be right outside he repeated and waited until he was in the hall to rub unsteady hands over his face hes scared margo murmured you hardly ever see josh scared but its going to be all right of course it is laura agreed and glanced at the fetal monitor that beeped away the babys heartbeats no i mean it im not messing this up my timings off thats all she looked at kate i guess this is the first time in my life ive been early for anything oh i dont know striving for the same light tone kate eased down on the side of the bed opposite from laura you developed early margo snorted true oh here comes one she said in a shaky voice and began to breathe slowly through the contraction instinctively kate took her hand and breathed through it with her theyre very mild margo managed theres something in there thats supposed to be slowing them down she flicked a glance toward the iv theyd hoped to stop them altogether but it looks like the kid wants out seven weeks too early oh god she squeezed her eyes shut fear circled back no matter how hard she focused on willing it away i should have taken more naps i should have stayed off my feet more i stop that kate snapped this is no time to feel sorry for yourself actually labors the perfect time for selfpity remembering her own laura stroked margos belly to bring comfort but not for blame youve taken good care of yourself and the baby milked it for all it was worth kate arched a brow how many times did i have to run up and down the stairs at the shop because you were pregnant and i wasnt she wanted to weep promised herself a nice long crying jag later and those cravings in the afternoons so i had to go over to fishermans wharf and get you frozen strawberry yogurt with chocolate sauce do you think i bought that you bought the yogurt margo pointed out actually i wouldnt mind having some now forget it you can chew your chipped ice im going to do this right margo took a deep breath i know the doctors worried josh is worried and mum but im going to do this right you know i can of course you can laura murmured this hospital has one of the best birthing wings in the country they take marvelous care of preemies i was on the committee that helped raise funds for new equipment remember who can remember all the committees you were on kate commented youll do fine margo nobody focuses on what they want and how to get it better than you i want this baby i thought i could will the labor away but well apparently the kid takes after me already its going to be today her lips trembled again its so small and tough kate added yeah margo managed a genuine smile tough the doctors still hoping they can stop the labor but its not going to happen i know its today you understand she asked laura absolutely and hes being snotty about delivery just josh i wanted you to be there both of you i just had this image of a big noisy bawdy event well have one after kate leaned down to kiss her cheek thats a promise okay okay margo closed her eyes and dealt with the next contraction shes strong laura said to kate as they walked back down the corridor i know but i dont like to see her scared if the drip doesnt stop labor shell be too busy to be scared much longer all we can do is wait wait they did as one hour passed into two restless kate paced the room walked out to badger the nurses drank too much coffee eat byron ordered and handed her a sandwich what is it any time a sandwich comes out of a vending machine you dont ask what it is you just eat it okay she took a bite thought it might have something to do with chicken salad its taking so long barely three hours he corrected miracles take time i guess considering it necessary fuel she took another bite of the sandwich we should be in there with her it would be better if we were with her its hard to wait harder for some he combed his fingers through her hair we could take a walk outside get you out of here for a while no im okay she damn well would be its easier concentrating on margo than thinking about where i am phobias are so human dumb she decided it was a horrible night in my life the worst ill ever have to go through i imagine but it was twenty years ago it was yesterday if she let her mind drift anyway i handled the hospital both times laura had kids maybe that was easier because i was in on it and labor really keeps you busy but this is the same thing i want to be here linking his fingers with hers he tugged her into the moment you pulling for a boy or a girl i hadnt thought of it how how big does a baby have to be to have a good shot itll be beautiful he said sliding over her question think of the gene pool its coming from a lot of times you think a baby could get lucky and get the best features of his parents you know his mothers eyes his fathers chin whatever this one strikes gold anywhere he turns going to end up being spoiled rotten are you kidding you should see the nursery margo and josh put together id like to live there she laughed and barely noticed hed handed her tea rather than coffee they bought this incredible antique cradle and this oldfashioned english pram they found in bath we were going to have the baby shower next week at templeton house all that loot she trailed off youll have to make it an afterthebirth shower what did you get its silly she turned the cup around and around in her hands trying not to cry or scream or simply bolt up and break into the birthing room margos got this thing for italian designers especially armani they have this junior line its ridiculous you bought the baby an armani he burst out laughing roaring all the harder when she flushed its a joke she insisted just a joke but she found herself smiling i guess the first time the kid spits up on it the jokes on me youre incredibly sweet he cupped her face in his hands and kissed her incredibly its only money comforted she leaned her head against his shoulder and watched her family laura had come back from checking on the girls and was sitting with ann her aunt and uncle were standing at the window uncle tommys arm was around her aunts shoulders there was a television bolted to the wall the sunday news on cnn rolled by reporting on a world that had nothing to do with the room where people waited others came and went bringing with them frissons of worry anticipation excitement she heard the hollow echoes of the pa system the brisk efficient footsteps of nurses and occasional laughter she saw a young man leading his enormously pregnant wife down the hall rubbing her back with intense concentration as she took slow measured steps laura always liked to walk during labor kate murmured hmm margo and i would take turns walking with her rubbing her back breathing with her what about her husband right kate made a derisive sound eyed laura to make certain she was out of earshot he didnt have time for the lamaze route didnt consider it necessary i was her coach for both girls with margo pinchhitting i thought margo was living in europe during those years yeah but she came back for the births kayla was a few days early and margo was on assignment the plan had been for her to spend the last week with laura at templeton house but when she called from the plane laura had just gone into labor margo ended up coming to the hospital straight from the airport we were with her she said fiercely right there with her and ridgeway breezed in after everyone was all cleaned up and tidy made what im sure he considered a manful attempt to conceal his disappointment that the babies didnt have penises then gave laura some elaborate gift and left creep ive never met him byron mused i cant say id formed a favorable opinion of him from reports normally i prefer to form my own opinion on a firsthand basis he was silent for a moment but i think i can make an exception in this case and just despise him good call shes well rid of him as soon as she stops feeling guilty for being glad shes rid of him shell be fine oh god why is it taking so long i cant stand it she sprang to her feet theyve got to tell us something we cant just sit here a nurse in green scrubs stepped into the doorway then perhaps youd all like to take a little walk margo ann choked out as she got to her feet mrs templeton is doing just fine and mr templeton is floating somewhere in the vicinity of cloud nine as for baby templeton i think youd like to see for yourselves come with me please the baby ann reached out found susans hand shes had the baby do you think its all right do you think its healthy lets go see come on grandma susan murmured as she walked ann out im scared trembling as she followed kate gripped byrons hand the nurse was smiling wasnt she she wouldnt have been smiling if something was really wrong you can tell by their eyes you can tell if you look in their eyes she said margo was fine didnt she say margo was fine thats exactly what she said theyll let you see for yourself soon and look at this they approached a glass door behind it josh stood the grin on his face breaking records in his arms was a small bundle with a golden sprinkle of hair topped with a bright blue bow its a boy thomass voice broke as he pressed a hand to the glass look at our grandson susie five pounds josh mouthed gingerly tilting his son for his family to view five full pounds ten fingers ten toes five full pounds he lowered his head to touch his lips to the babys cheek hes so tiny with her eyes swimming kate wrapped her arms around laura hes so beautiful john thomas templeton laura let her own tears fall welcome home they cooed at him objecting noisily when a nurse came to take him away when josh came through the door they fell on him as villagers might fall on a conquering hero five pounds he said again burrowing his face in his mothers hair did you hear that hes five pounds even they said that was really good he has all the right working parts theyre going to check him out some more because he didnt cook enough but he looked done to me byron put in have a cigar daddy jesus josh stared at the cigar byron handed him daddy oh im supposed to be passing out the cigars handling details is part of my job description grandma byron handed one to ann who delighted everyone by popping it into her mouth margo josh laura took his hand how is she amazing shes the most amazing woman he came out wailing did i tell you laughing he lifted laura off her feet kissed her he couldnt seem to get the words out fast enough just howling and the minute he did margo started to laugh she was exhausted and we were both scared bloodless then he just slid out baffled he clasped his hands together and stared at them its the most incredible thing you cant imagine well you can but you had to be there hes crying and margos laughing and the doctors says well it looks like theres nothing wrong with his pipes nothing wrong with his pipes josh repeated his voice hitching nothing wrong with him of course not thomas closed josh in a bear hug hes a templeton not that were not glad to see you kate brushed the hair back from joshs face but when are they going to let us in to see margo i dont know in a minute i guess she had the nurse get her purse his grin broke out fresh she wanted to fix her makeup typical kate turned and threw her arms around byron thats just typical chapter eighteen contents prev next the week following the appearance of j t templeton was hectic and complicated lauras schedule didnt allow for more than a few hours at the shop with margo involved with her new son kate was left to deal with the results of a successful reception early delivery had thrown their vague plans for interviewing and hiring a parttime clerk out the window kate was on her own she opened the shop every day learned to control her impulses to hurry browsers along though she would never understand the appeal of dawdling in a store she told herself to appreciate that others enjoyed it she studied the inventory lists and tried to recognize the more esoteric items in pretenses stock but why anyone would feel the need to own a designer pillbox with pearl inlay remained beyond her simple honesty was sometimes taken for a credit sometimes an insult for every woman who appreciated being told an outfit didnt suit her there were two who bristled at the information she persevered by remembering that for at least one hour every day she could close herself in the back office and be alone blissfully alone with her ledgers they didnt talk back the customer is always right kate muttered to herself the customer is always right even when the customer is an asshole she marched out of the wardrobe room where one particular customer had just informed her that the donna karan was mislabeled it couldnt possibly be a size ten as it was too snug at the hips too snug at the hips my butt the old bat couldnt get one thigh in a size ten if she greased it with motor oil miss oh miss another customer snapped her fingers like a diner signaling a particularly slow waitress to bring more wine kate gritted her teeth into a smile yes maam can i help you i want to see this bracelet the victorian slide no no i said the victorian slide not the gold cuff sorry kate tried again following the direction of the womans pointing finger its charming isnt it fussy and foolish would you like to try it on how much is it theres a tag right on it isnt there still smiling kate turned the tag around read off the price and what are those stones oh shit shed studied hadnt she i believe theres garnet and carnelian and what was that yellow one topaz amber citrine citrine she hazarded because it sounded more victorian to her as the customer studied the bracelet kate scanned the shop just her luck she thought it was packed and laura was gone for the day she had three hours to go and in three hours she judged that what was left of her mind would resemble a mass of cold rice the sound of the door jangling made her want to whimper when she saw who breezed in she wanted to scream candy litchfield her longstanding enemy candy litchfield whose bouncy stride and perky looks tumbling red hair and perfect nose hid the heart of a spider and shed brought pals kate noted as her heart sank perfectly groomed cannyeyed society matrons in italian shoes i never find anything i like in here candy announced in her bright and farreaching voice but millicent told me shed noticed a perfume atomizer that might fit in with my collection of course they overprice everything she strolled through envy packed solidly in ill will can i show you something else kate said to the customer who was now studying candy as carefully as the bracelet no she hesitated but avarice won over and she took out her credit card would you gift wrap it please its for my daughters birthday of course she boxed and wrapped rang up and bagged all the while keeping a weather eye on candys progress two customers left without a purchase but kate refused to give candys viciously criticizing tongue credit for it feeling like gary cooper at the end of high noon she stepped out from behind the counter to face them alone what do you want candy im browsing in a public retail facility she smiled thinly and exuded a notsosubtle whiff of opium i believe youre supposed to offer me a glass of rather inferior champagne isnt that store policy help yourself i was told by a friend there was a perfume bottle that i might like to have candy cast an eye over the displays her gaze latched on to a gorgeous design in the shape of a womans body beautifully fashioned in frosted rose glass she would have revealed her own age before she would have shown a flicker of interest i cant imagine what she was thinking of she drawled she probably mistook your taste kate smiled that is she mistook you for having any hows the pool boy these days candy who had a reputation for enjoying very young men in between husbands bristled how does it feel to be a shop clerk i heard you were fired stealing clients funds kate how ordinary someone must have pruned your grapevine prematurely candy cane youre way behind am i she filled a glass to the rim with champagne am i really everyone knows that with the templeton influence behind you all your petty crimes will be brushed aside like your fathers were her smile sharpened when she saw that shaft strike home but then only fools would have you handling their accounts now she sipped delicately where theres smoke after all youre so lucky to have rich friends wholl throw you crumbs but then you always were always wanted to be a templeton didnt you kate said sweetly but josh never looked twice in your direction we used to laugh about it margo and laura and i why dont you finish your champagne and go diddle your pool boy candy youre really wasting your time here candys skin darkened but she kept her voice even her approach had been to divide and conquer shed never been able to score any real points when kate had margo or laura around but alone and this time she had more ammunition ive heard youre seeing quite a bit of byron de witt and that hes seeing quite a bit of you im so flattered youve taken an interest in my sex life candy ill let you know when we release the video a smart ambitious man like byron would be very aware of the advantages of developing a relationship with the templeton ward imagine how high up he can climb using you as a springboard kates face went blank pleasing candy enormously candy sipped more wine her eyes alive with malice as she studied kate over the rim the malice blurred into shock as kate threw back her head and laughed god you really are an idiot weak with laughter kate took a few steps to the side so she could support herself against the counter to think we just thought you were a mean little snake all this time youve just been stupid do you actually believe a man like byron needs to use anybody because her ribs were beginning to ache she took several deep breaths something in candys eyes tipped her off oh i get it i get it he didnt look twice at you either did he you bitch candy hissed she slammed down her glass before stalking over to kate you couldnt get a man on your own if you danced naked in front of a marine band everyone knows why hes sleeping with you everyone can think what they want ill just enjoy it peter says hes an ambitious corporate shill now kates interest peaked peter does does he the templetons booted peter out because laura whined about the divorce they were so concerned with protecting their darling daughter they ignored the fact that peter is an excellent hotelier all the years he worked for them helped build the templeton chain into what it is today oh please peter never built anything but his own ego hell use his talents to open his own hotel soon with templeton money kate commented thinking about laura and the girls how ironic laura wanted the divorce peter was entitled to financial compensation youd know all about making a profit out of marriage terminations kate decided candys visit wasnt such a pain in the butt after all not when it brought along such interesting news going to use some of your alimony to invest in ridgeways hotel my accountant who isnt a thief considers it a smart investment her lips curved again i believe ill enjoy being in the hotel business well youve spent a lot of time in them on the hourly plan how droll you are hold on to that sense of humor kate youll need it candys smile was still there but her teeth were set byron de witt will make use of you until he achieves the position he wants then he wont need you anymore then i guess id better enjoy the ride she angled her head so youve set your sights on peter ridgeway thats just fascinating weve run into each other in palm springs a number of times and have discovered many mutual interests she smoothed her hair be sure to tell laura hes looking extremely well extremely ill do that kate said as candy headed for the door and ill give byron your best no on second thought ill give him mine she snickered turning when the customer nearest the counter cleared her throat the womans eyes darted from the door to kate bright and wary as a birds ah show me these evening bags if you dont mind sure kate beamed at her for some reason candys visit had brightened her mood id love to have you shopped with us before yes actually i have kate took three ridiculously fussy jeweled bags from the shelf we value your business arent these just fabulous and then she said how lucky i was to have rich friends throwing me crumbs kate sniffed a homebaked chocolate chip cookie into her mouth so thanks since i suppose youre one of my rich friends what an ass from her position on the patio chaise margo stretched up her arms she hit me with the business about my father margo lowered her arms again slowly im sorry damn it kate i knew id get smacked with it sooner or later i just hate that it was her of all people i hate more that she could see shed jabbed me i wish it didnt matter margo everything about the people we love matters im sorry i wasnt there her eyes narrowed in thought im really overdue for a manicure i think candys day for the salon is wednesday wont it be fun to bump into her well able to picture the event and the outcome kate chuckled give yourself a couple weeks to get back in shape champ then you can take her on i knew id feel better if i came here to wallow remember that the next time youve got something eating away at your insides never going to let me forget that are you kate muttered i said i was wrong not to tell you and laura i was stupid after youve said it at regular intervals for the next year or two well forget all about it i have such understanding friends christ these are criminal kate mumbled through another cookie it must be great having annie here baking and fussing it really is i never would have believed we could live under the same roof again even for the short term it was awfully sweet of laura to insist that mum stay here for a couple of weeks speaking of laura kate had made a point of dropping by margos after work knowing that laura would be too busy for an earlyevening visit candy mentioned peter so it was the way she mentioned him first she was on me and byron excuse me margo indulged in a cookie herself in what way well she said how hes a corporate shill and hes using me to earn points with the templetons you know like he brings me to orgasm and they give him another promotion thats pathetic she narrowed her eyes at kates face you didnt buy that no she shook her head quickly no i might have if it had been anyone other than byron it was a pretty clever chain to pull but hes just not made that way i laughed at her good for you what does that have to do with peter apparently thats where she got the idea at least partially it sounds to me as if theyve gotten close jesus what a frightening thought she shuddered dramatically two creeps in a pod she wanted to make sure i mentioned it to laura i dont know if i should let it alone margo said immediately laura doesnt need that if she hears it she hears it besides with candys track record its probably already fizzled i was leaning that way kate toyed with the rest of her cappuccino studied the view its so beautiful here i never really told you what a terrific job youve done putting the place together making it like home it is home it was straight off margo smiled i owe that to you youre the one who told me about the place it seemed right for you you and josh do you think you can tell sometimes if a place is where you want to be i know it it was templeton house for me i was too young to remember anything before we came there but it was home always my flat in milan when margo broke off kate shifted uncomfortably im sorry didnt mean to stir up old memories its all right i loved that flat everything about it i was home there too it was right for me at the time she shrugged her shoulders if things had stayed as they were it would be right for me still but they didnt i didnt then there was the shop she smiled and sat up straighter remember how i was so dazzled by that big empty building while you and laura rolled your eyes and wondered if you should cart me off it smelled of stale marijuana and spiderwebs and i loved it i knew i could make something there and i did her eyes glowed as she looked out to the cliffs maybe childbirth has made me philosophical but its not hard for me to say i needed to make something there and i wouldnt have without you and laura let me be sappy for a minute she ordered when kate grimaced im entitled ive started to think that things move in a circle if you let them were together on this through varying circumstances but were together we always have been it matters yes it matters kate rose wandered to the edge of the patio where the ground spread green and bloomed with colorful blossoms the autumn sky was still brilliantly blue ranging out to the rocking sea and beyond this was a home she thought not hers though she felt at home here as she did at templeton house it worried her that shed fallen in love with the bent cyprus the blooming vines and wood and glass of a house on seventeen mile that wasnt her own it was always templeton house for me she said putting an image of the towers and stone over the image of multilevel decks and wide windows the view from my bedroom the way it smelled after the floors were polished i never felt that way about my apartment in town it was just a convenient place to stay are you going to keep it puzzled kate turned back of course why wouldnt i i thought since you were staying at byrons im not staying there kate said quickly not living there i just sleep over sometimes thats entirely different if you want it to be margo tilted her head what worries you about him kate nothing exactly blowing out a breath she came back and sat i was going to ask you figuring youd be the expert on such matters margo waited tapped her fingers on the arms of the chaise well okay im working up to it she braced looked margo dead in the eye so that she could detect any flicker can you become addicted to sex damn straight you can margo said without a single flicker if you do it right the comers of her lips turned up id bet byron does it very right rake in your winnings kate said dryly and youre complaining no not complaining im asking ive just never look its not like i havent had sex before i just never had such an appetite for it as i seem to now with him she rolled her own eyes chuckled at herself christ margo five minutes with him and i want to bite him and since the taste suits you whats the problem because i wondered if you could get too dependent on certain aspects on great sex yeah all right on really great sex then people change and move on sometimes they do she thought of herself and of josh smiled sometimes they dont sometimes they do kate repeated candy got me thinking oh please damn it kate you said you didnt buy that shit she was spewing about him using me absolutely not it just made me think about our relationship if it is a relationship we dont have anything in common really but well sex with a long sigh margo leaned back helped herself to another cookie what do you do when youre not busy pounding each other into puddles of passion very funny we do stuff such as i dont know listen to music you like the same music sure who doesnt like rock and roll sometimes we watch movies hes got this incredible collection of old black and whites oh you mean the old movies you like hmm she shrugged we walk on the beach or he whips me through a workout hes tough about that more than pleased she flexed her biceps ive got definition hmm i guess you never talk though sure we talk about work family food hes got this thing about nutrition always serious huh no i mean we have a good time we laugh a lot and we play with the dogs or he works on one of his cars and i watch you know stuff let me see if i have this straight you like the same music the same kind of movies which translates into being entertained together you enjoy walking on the beach pumping iron share an affection for a pair of mongrel dogs margo shook her head i can see the problem other than sex you might as well be a couple of strangers dump him now kate before it gets ugly i should have known youd make a joke out of it youre the joke listen to yourself youve got a terrific man a wonderful satisfying relationship that includes great sex and mutual interests and youre sitting there looking for hitches well if you find them before they happen you can work around them it isnt an audit kate its a love affair relax and enjoy it i am mostly nearly she shrugged again ive just got a lot on my mind and she thought it might be time to bring up the fact that shed been offered a partnership at bittle theres some ah adjustments coming up she began but was interrupted as ann came out carrying the baby the little man woke up hungry ive changed him ann said cooing as she carried him toward margos open arms yes i did changed him and put on one of his fancy suits theres a lad theres a darling oh isnt he gorgeous margo cuddled him and smelling mother j t sent up a call for dinner hes more beautiful every time i look at him just like a man cant wait for a woman to open her blouse there you are sweetie he settled happily at her breast his small fists kneading his newborn blue eyes intent on hers hes gained four ounces she told kate at the rate hes going hell be ready for heavyweight status in another week charmed kate shifted to the edge of the chaise to stroke his downy head he has your eyes and joshs ears god he smells so good she drew in the powdery milky scent of baby and decided to talk business another time i get to hold him when youre done youll stay for dinner miss kate ann put her hands behind her back to end her struggle not to adjust the way margo was holding the precious boy mr josh has a late meeting at the hotel and youll keep us company then you can hold our baby as long as you want well kate traced a fingertip over the curve of j ts cheek since youve twisted my arm the bay suite of templetoh monterey was elegantly appointed blacklacquered tables held huge porcelain urns filled with exotic blooms a curved settee in icy blue brocade was sprinkled with pillows that picked up the tones of a floorspanning oriental rug the drapes on both sets of wide glass doors were open to invite in the glorious bleeding colors as the sun slowly sank into the sea the table in the dining area was conference size graced with highbacked ornately carved chairs with tapestried seats dinner was served on bonewhite china accented with a fume blanc from the templeton vineyards the meeting might have been held at templeton house but both thomas and susan considered that to be lauras home this as pleasant as it was was business if theres a weakness in the beverly hills location its in room service byron glanced at the notes beside his plate the complaints run to the usual the amount of time for delivery mixup in orders the kitchen runs well as a whole your chef there is temperamental susan suggested with a smile actually i was going to say frightening i know he scared me maybe it was being ordered out by a very large man with a thick brooklyn accent and a cleaver but there was a moment did you leave thomas wanted to know i reasoned with him from a safe distance and told him quite sincerely that he made the best coquilles st jacques it had ever been my privilege to taste that goes a long way with max josh commented as i recall the line chefs there work like machines they appear to theyre terrified of him grinning byron sampled his tarragon chicken the problem doesnt seem to be in the preparation but in the servers naturally there are certain hours when both the kitchen and the servers are backed up but the room service staff has become undeniably lax suggestions id recommend transferring helen pringle to the beverly hills location if shes agreeable in a managerial position shes experienced and efficient wed miss her here of course but i believe she would eliminate the problem in la and shed certainly be my first choice for a promotion josh thomas turned to his son for verification agreed she has an excellent record as an assistant manager make her the offer susan picked up her wine with the appropriate increase in salary and benefits fine i think that closes beverly hills byron skimmed down his notes san francisco had been dealt with and tabled san diego required a personal spot check but posed no immediate need for discussion ah there is a little matter here at the flagship byron scratched his cheek maintenance would like new vending machines thomas raised a brow as he finished off his salmon maintenance came to you about vending machines there was a problem with the plumbing on the sixth floor sabotage by a toddler who decided to drown his power rangers in the toilet hell of a mess i went down to soothe the parents and ended up sending them down to the pool while he helped the mechanic stem the flood but that was beside the point i supervised the disgorging so to speak and the matter of vending machines came up they want their junk food back it seems candy bars and chips were ditched a couple of years ago and replaced with apples and fatfree cookies believe me i got an earful about corporate interference in personal choice that would be ridgeway josh decided susan made a dismissive sound but held a napkin to her lips to disguise her grin she had an image of byron elegant in a suit and polished shoes wading through water and listening to a mechanics gripes about snacks recommendation keep them happy byron shrugged let them eat milky ways agreed thomas said and is that the biggest staff problem here at templeton monterey just the usual hitches nothing that isnt typical daytoday there was the dead woman in josh grimaced i hate when that happens heart attack died in her sleep she was eightyfive led a full life gave the maid a hell of a start how long did it take you to calm her down susan asked after we caught her she went screaming down the hall about an hour thomas topped off the wine lifted his glass its a relief for susie and me to know that california is in good hands some people believe that running a hotel means sitting up in the fancy office and pushing paper and people around now tommy susan patted his arm peters no longer our problem we can hate him for strictly personal reasons now she beamed at byron but i agree well go back to france at the end of the week knowing things here are well looked after she tilted her head professionally and personally i appreciate that our kates looking very happy thomas began very healthy and fit are you making plans uhoh here it comes with a grin josh leaned back shook his head sorry by im just going to sit here and watch you twist in the wind its a reasonable question thomas insisted i know what the mans prospects are obviously i want to know what his intentions are tommy susan said patiently kates a grown woman shes my girl his face clouded as he pushed his plate aside i let laura rush off her own way and look what that got her im not going to hurt her byron said he wasnt as offended as some might have expected by the probing after all hed been raised in the old school where family interest and interference went hand in hand shes very important to me important thomas tossed back a good nights sleep is important susan sighed eat your dessert thomas you know how you love tiramisu working for templeton doesnt require you to answer personal questions byron just ignore him im not asking as his employer im asking as kates father then ill answer you in that spirit byron agreed shes become a major part of my life and my intentions are to marry her since he hadnt fully understood that himself until this moment byron fell silent and frowned into his glass well then pleased thomas slapped his palm on the table itll be news to her byron muttered then let out a breath id appreciate it if youd let me deal with your kate in my own way i havent quite worked it out ill have him out of your way in a few days susan assured byron six thousand miles thomas forked up creamy cake but ill be back he warned and shot byron a wide grin he was a detail man after all byron reminded himself when he let himself into his house he knew how to handle sensitive problems surely he could handle something as basic as a proposal of marriage to the woman he loved she wouldnt want anything flowery he decided kate wouldnt go for the downononeknee routine thank god shed prefer the direct the simple it was all in the approach he concluded and tugged off his tie he wouldnt put it as a question phrasing something as will you opened up too much leeway for the answer to be no better to make it a statement being certain to keep it short of a demand because it was kate after all and it would be wise because it was kate to have at the ready a list of rational reasons why it would be sensible he only wished he could think of a single one hed pulled off his shoes before he realized something was wrong it took him another minute to pinpoint it it was the quiet the dogs always set up a greeting din when he pulled into the drive but there was no barking when he raced to the deck door wrenched it open in panic he saw that there were no dogs he called whistled hurried down the steps to check the fence that kept them safely in the backyard his frantic mind whirled with the possibility of dognappers newspaper articles about stolen pets sold for experiments the first happy bark weakened his knees theyd gotten through the safety gate he thought as he strode toward the beach steps that was all somehow theyd gotten through and gone for a run on their own hed have to give them a good talkingto they topped the stairs at a run tails waving flags of devoted joy they leapt on him licking and wriggling with the trembling delight they displayed whether hed been gone for hours or had simply run to the store for milk youre grounded he informed them both of you havent i told you to stay in the yard well you can just forget gnawing on those ham bones i got from the hotel kitchen no dont try to make up he said laughing when they held up paws for shaking you guys are in the doghouse for real well thatll teach them kate climbed the last step and stood smiling at him in the moonlight but i have to take the heat on this one i asked them to escort me down to the beach and being wellbred gentlemen they could hardly refuse i was worried about them he managed he couldnt seem to stop staring at her she was standing there windblown slightly breathless from the climb just there as if hed wished it im sorry we should have left you a note i didnt expect to see you tonight i know feeling awkward now as she always did after following an impulse she tucked her hands in her pockets i went by margos after i closed the shop had dinner and played with the baby hes gained four ounces i know josh told me he has pictures about six dozen i got to see videos i loved it anyway i started to head back to my apartment her apartment she thought dull empty meaningless and i ended up here instead i hope you dont mind do i mind he wrapped his arms around her slowly drew her close against him gradually for three humming heartbeats his eyes stayed on hers his mouth brushed hers retreated brushed again shifted angles then his lips covered hers heated hers parted hers soft and deep and welcoming the kiss shimmered through her her hands stayed in her pockets too limp to move the muscles in her thighs went lax her knees weak when he drew away she could have sworn she saw stars dazzling her own eyes well she began but he was kissing her again in that same drugging devastating delicious way it was as if they had forever to simply be there caught in soft sea breezes and quiet passion she gulped in air when his mouth lifted his eyes were so close so clear she could see herself trapped in them it jolted her back a step made her fumble for a casual smile id have to say at a guess you dont mind i want you here he took her hands brought her palms one at a time to his lips and watched her i want you he could see that she was struggling to recover to plant her feet back on the ground he didnt intend to let her come inside he murmured drawing her with him ill show you chapter nineteen contents prev next days later she was still there byrons idea of a break from weight training was a threemile jog on the beach it was difficult for a woman whose idea of a morning start had always been two very hot very strong cups of coffee to adjust to the concept of running at dawn kate told herself it was the experience that mattered and more important the waffles hed promised her if she stuck it out so you like she puffed huffed and tried to concentrate on her pace really enjoy this its addictive byron assured her he was going at a snails pace to bring her along gradually and admiring the way her legs looked in baggy shorts youll see no way only sinful stuff is addictive coffee cigarettes chocolate sex good stuff never becomes addictive sex is good stuff its good but sinful sinful in a good way she watched the dogs race into the surf and shake themselves so that little bullets of water flew and sparkled in the strengthening sun she supposed there was something to be said for dawn after all the light was achingly beautiful and the smells so fresh so renewed they seemed unreal the air was just cool enough to be bracing she had to admit her muscles felt loose oiled in a way as if her body was becoming a welltuned machine it made her feel foolish to realize shed accepted feeling unwell for so long simply because shed found it too much trouble to change where did you run in atlanta no beaches there weve got parks indoor tracks when the weathers bad do you miss it bits and pieces magnolia trees the sound of slow voices my family ive never lived anywhere but here never wanted to i liked going to school back east seeing snow frost on the windows the way the leaves look in new england in october but i always wanted to be here she saw the beach steps in the distance her aching calves all but applauded margos lived lots of places and lauras done much more traveling than i have someplace youd like to see no not really well bora bora bora bora i did this report on it in high school you know a geography report it seemed so cool one of those places i told myself id go when i took a real vacation just a hangoutanddonothing vacation oh thank goodness she breathed and sank to the sand in front of the beach steps i made it and youre going to cramp up if you dont keep moving unsympathetically he hauled her to her feet just walk youve got to cool down why havent you gone to bora bora she walked for three paces then bent over at the waist and breathed come on byron real people dont just go to bora bora its one of those daydreams do you think jogging can dislocate internal organs no i was pretty sure i could hear my ovaries rattling he paled a bit please he handed her the bottle of water hed screwed into the sand at the base of the stairs he whistled for the dogs before starting up the steps with her normally id just be getting up now stumbling into the kitchen where my timed coffee machine would be finishing up its last few drips leave the house at eight twentyfive hit the office at eight fortyfive have the coffee machine there brewing away and be at my desk with the first cup by eight fiftyfive eat the first roll of antacids by nine fiftyfive it wasnt quite that bad she fell silent as they crossed from steps to lawn toward the house the dogs winged through the gate streaking toward their bowls in anticipation of breakfast i havent had a chance to tell margo and laura about going back to bittle byron hefted the twentyfivepound bag of dog food out of the pantry havent had a chance all right havent found the right way she shifted as the nuggets clattered into plastic i feel like im letting them down i know thats not right i know they wont feel that way theyd understand this is right for me byron replaced the bag signaling the dogs to chow down is it of course it is she brushed back her hair what a thing to say its what i studied for worked for its what ive always wanted all right then he gave her a friendly pat on the rump and headed in what do you mean by that all right then she rushed in behind him scowling its a partnership with all the bells and whistles ive earned it absolutely as a matter of habit he started upstairs toward the shower kate followed at his heels well i have that whole business about the altered documents is just about cleared up in any case im clear the rest is detective kusacks problem and the firms problem ill have more control over whats done after im a partner are you worried about it about what he tugged off his shortsleeved sweatshirt flung it toward the hamper about clearing up the escrow discrepancies of course i am why havent you pursued it well i she broke off as he flicked on the shower and stepped inside ive been busy theres not a hell of a lot i could do in any case and with margo being pregnant and the auction and laura tossing me all these details about this holiday fashion show she wants i havent had time okay he said agreeably that doesnt mean it doesnt matter disgusted she stripped and joined him under the spray it just means ive had other priorities it all came to a head a couple of weeks ago the forgeries the offer the baby it didnt seem fair to tell margo and laura id have to cut back at the shop just when margo had to cut back herself and until i do and im back at bittle i dont see what i can do about finding out who tried to screw me and the firm but once im there you can bet your ass im going to find out who set me up that makes sense of course it makes sense irritated for no reason she could name she stuck her head under the spray just like it makes sense for me to accept the offer its the most practical course youre right its definitely the most practical pretenses is an investment bittle is your career thats right instead of being soothed by his agreement she bristled so what are we arguing about i dont have a clue he gave her an absent kiss on the shoulder and stepped out to dry off ill get breakfast going he announced and chuckled his way down the stairs she was he thought as easy to see through as a chainlink fence kate worked with laura shoulder to shoulder throughout the morning she told herself the minute they had a real break in traffic she would sit laura down and explain about her plans she would of course continue to take care of the books a few evenings a week the occasional sunday that would be enough for her to run pretenses finances naturally she would be very busy as a partner at bittle but she would also be in a position to delegate a great deal of the grunt work that she had been accustomed to handling herself she would have more leeway more freedom and of course more clout her schedule would be crammed but she was used to that working at the shop had certainly kept her busy but it had also given her large chunks of free time that werent necessary she told herself she would be glad to have her hours prioritized again that was her way and she would be thrilled not to have to chitchat with strangers not to be asked to give fashion opinions or have a say in giftgiving decisions what a relief it would be to settle back at her computer and not have to speak to a soul for hours on end my sisters going to be thrilled with that a customer said as kate carefully removed the tag from a coral cashmere tunic i hope she is oh she will be this is her favorite shop and mine too the woman beamed at the varied selections shed placed on the counter i dont know how i managed before you opened up look at the wonderful dent ive made in my christmas shopping getting an early start kate commented and blinked her self back into focus id say everyones going to be happy my mother would never buy herself something as frivolous as this the woman trailed a finger over the delicate lines of a crystal pegasus thats what gifts are for and where else but here could i find an antique pocket watch for my father cashmere for my sister sapphire studs for my daughter a crystal flying horse for my mother and a pair of navy suede ferragamo pumps for me only at pretenses kate said her own spirits lifted by the womans exuberant good nature the customer laughed and stepped back you have the most wonderful place here if you could giftbox everything but the shoes i think ill take one more turn around in case i missed something i have to have take your time smiling to herself kate began to box the selections she caught herself humming as she settled the pocket watch in a bed of cotton well what was wrong with humming there was nothing wrong with enjoying your work even though it wasnt your chosen field being temporary it was like playing at a job she glanced up as laura came down the winding stairs from the second floor chatting with a customer i know margo picked this up on a buying trip to london last year mrs quint oh call me patsy please i shop here so often i feel like were old friends and this is just what i was looking for she gloated over the cherry slanttop writing box laura set on the counter but then i always find what im looking for here thats why im here so often she laughed at herself then caught sight of the crystal horse oh how wonderful how charming someone beat me to it i did the first customer straightened from her survey of jeweled compacts and smiled hes beautiful isnt he gorgeous tell me you have something else like him she begged laura i think we have a winged dragon baccarat that we havent shelved yet kate in inventory priced but not tagged in the storeroom ill find it as soon as im done here no ill find it i hope if you dont mind waiting a minute not at all you know even my husband likes to shop here patsy confided to kate when laura slipped into the back no small accomplishment that since getting him to stop for a can of peas is a major feat of course i think he likes to come in and look at the pretty girls were here to serve kate affixed a gold seal to the tissue shed wrapped over the cashmere this compact here the first customer tapped on the glass the heartshaped one i think my sisterinlaw would love it just let me get it out for you while the two customers chatted about the compact kate boxed the horse a fresh discussion broke out when laura brought out the dragon when the door opened everyone sighed oh what a gorgeous baby patsy pressed her hands together under her chin why hes an absolute angel he is isnt he margo shifted the baby carrier to show off her son hes seventeen days old business ground to a halt as it was necessary to admire his fingers his nose to comment on how bright and alert his eyes were by the time kate brought the cradle out of the back room and john thomas was settled in it the women had bonded over the baby you should have called me if you wanted to get out for a little while laura scolded id have picked you up mum dropped me off she had some marketing she wanted to do i think her plan is to stock my kitchen so that if were locked in for a year well have provisions margo settled in a chair with the cradle at her side god ive missed this place so hows business the pair who just left kate began pouring tea on their way to lunch yes they became fast friends about fifteen minutes ago over mythical glass animals it was kind of fun to watch this is the first time the shops been empty since we opened this morning laura added were getting a lot of those people who always have their holiday shopping done by thanksgiving and to think how i used to hate them margo sighed i checked with my doctor he says if i keep it to mostly sitting behind the counter i can start coming in a few hours a day starting next week theres no need to rush kate objected were handling it i dont like you handling it without me i can bring j t with me babies mist shoppers brains i thought you were going to interview nannies we are pouting a little margo bent over her son adjusted his blanket soon she doesnt want to share laura murmured i know how it feels when ali was born i she broke off as a trio of fresh customers came in ill take them kate volunteered you two indulge yourself in mommy talk for the next twenty minutes she showed one customer every diamond earring in stock while the second poked through the bricabrac and the third cooed over a napping jt she helped serve tea saved a frantic husband with a lastminute anniversary gift and rehung the castoffs left in the wardrobe room shaking her head at the way some people treated silk she stepped out again new customers were browsing amid a hum of female voices someone had switched on an art deco lamp to test the effect and smooth golden light shimmered in the corner margo was laughing with a customer laura was stretching on her toes to reach a box for a purchase and the baby slept it was a wonderful place she thought suddenly it was a magical little treasure chest filled with the sublime and the foolish crafted she realized by thethree of them from desperation from practicality and most of all from friendship how odd that she had ever considered it a business to be measured in profit and loss overhead and expenditure and odder still that she hadnt realized until this moment how happy she was to be a part of something so risky so ridiculous so entertaining she walked to laura i have an appointment id forgotten about she said quickly can you handle things here until i get back it should only take an hour or so sure but i wont be long she grabbed her purse from behind the counter before laura could ask any questions see you later she called out and bolted wheres she going margo demanded i dont know just out for a little while concerned laura stared through the glass after kate i hope shes all right she wasnt sure that she was it was a test kate told herself going back to bittle gauging her feelings her reaction would be a test the lobby was familiar even comforting with its quiet colors and nononsense furniture chrome and leather efficient and easily cleaned made up the small sitting area where stacks of money time and newsweek were handy for the clients perusal the main receptionist offered kate a quick and slightly embarrassed smile she took the steps as was her habit and passed through the first floor no nonsense here either she mused clerks and computer operators went about their business busy as bees and just as focused on the task at hand one of the mailroom clerks pushed his cart along passing out the afternoon deliveries someones fax was clicking on the second floor the hum of business continued account executives plowed through the daily routine in their own offices the phones were active reminding her that it was after all the middle of the last quarter of the year clients were beginning to call for advice on how to squeeze in more deductions how to defer income until the next tax year how much they might need to contribute to their keoghs or iras of course she thought twice as many would wait until the last week of december and call in a panic it kept accounting interesting she stopped at her old office no one had claimed it she mused her computer and phone sat on the desk but otherwise it was bare the fax machine was silent but she could remember the way it had beeped and clicked along the blinds were closed on the window behind the desk shed often left them that way herself she realized working in artificial light never taking notice of the view the shelf was a handy stretch away from the desk and would have held her research books tax manuals supplies no tchotchkes she thought no distractions and she decided with an inner sigh no style just another bee in the hive good god she was boring kate she turned shaking off the moment of selfpity hello roger what are you doing taking a good look in the mirror she gestured toward her empty office no ones using it no his smile was a little weak as he glanced in theres talk about hiring a new associate theres a lot of talk he added looking back at her face is there she said coolly and im just surprised to see you here that cops been around a lot that doesnt worry me roger i didnt do anything to be worried about no of course you didnt i never believed it i know you too well he glanced over his shoulder the movement jerky and ripe with nerves bittle senior called a full staff meeting last week made the announcement that youd been cleared of any implication now everybodys looking at everybody else wondering thats not surprising is it curious she studied his face still only one person should be worrying as well as wondering dont you think roger the finger pointed at you he said who knows who it might point to next i think detective kusack knows how to do his job then theres the fbi what do you mean the fbi tampering with tax forms is a federal offense nobody tampered with the forms filed with the irs nobody fucked with the government just with me and a few clients you bastard his head snapped back as if shed slapped him what the hell are you talking about youre sweating you know i dont believe ive ever seen you sweat before not in bed not when you told me one of my top accounts was transferring to you but youre sweating now when she started to pass him he grabbed her arm dont be ridiculous are you actually accusing me of doctoring files you son of a bitch you knew where i kept all my records you knew just how to pull it off and point the finger at me you found out about my father too didnt you fury was pouring through her hot blood and you had the nerve to come on to me again after what youd done i couldnt figure out why you were suddenly interested in me again just another way to cover your ass you dont know what youre talking about yeah he was sweating she noted scared scared as a fucking rabbit caught in oncoming headlights she hoped to god he suffered take your hand off me roger and do it now he only tightened his grip leaned closer no way you can prove any of this if you try to put this off on me youre going to look like a fool i dumped you i got that account because im better im more innovative i work harder you got that account because you slept with a lonely vulnerable woman like you never slept with a client he said in a furious undertone no i never did and you took the money because you were greedy because it was easy and youd found a way to set me up im warning you kate if you go to bittle and try to put me on the hot seat ill what she tossed back her eyes alight with eager challenge exactly what is there a problem here newman glided down the hall in her eerily silent way her mouth was pursed as usual in disapproval kate sent her a feral smile i dont believe there is she jerked her arm out of his loosened grip is there roger i believe mr bittles expecting me ms newman i called in on the car phone hell see you now your phones ringing mr thornhill if youll come with me ms powell newman glanced over her shoulder once measuring roger as he stood grimfaced in the hall then looked down when kate rubbed her aching arm are you all right im fine she drew in a breath as newman opened the door to bittles office thank you kate bittle rose from behind his desk held out a hand in welcome im very glad you called he closed both hands around hers very glad thank you for seeing me please sit what can we get you nothing im fine ms newman inform the partners that kate is here no please thats not necessary id like to speak just with you as you wish thatll be all ms newman he took the chair beside kate rather than the one behind his desk i wish i could tell you about the progress on the investigation but detective kusack asks more questions than he answers im not here about that she thought of roger no she wouldnt point the finger not yet she would let him stew and sweat and she would find a way to prove what hed done then shed watch him fry i came about your offer good pleased he sat back folded his hands were very anxious to have you back were all agreed that the partners could use some fresh young blood its too easy for a firm such as this to become stodgy it isnt stodgy mr bittle this is a good firm ive just started to realize how much i benefited from my years here without any idea of what she was going to say she too folded her hands in her lap first i want to say that ive thought about what happened a great deal and come to the conclusion that under the circumstances you did what you had to do what i would have done in your position i appreciate that kate very much appreciate it my mistake was in not facing it and maybe im starting to give myself a break about that too i cant always handle things by myself i dont always have all the answers she let out a little breath that was a tough one to admit mr bittle i had one goal when i got my mba that was to work my way up in this firm to a partnership working for you was one of the best experiences of my life i knew that if i made it here if i met your standards and became a partner it meant i was the best it was very important to me to be the best this firm has never had an associate with a finer work ethic while i realize the timing of our offer might worry you ill assure you again that our regret for your involvement in this police matter has nothing whatever to do with the terms of partnership i know that it means a great deal to me to know that she opened her mouth acceptance hovering on her tongue then shook her head im sorry mr bittle i cant come back here kate he reached out to take her hand again believe me when i say i understand your discomfort i expect that youd be reluctant to accept until this matter is completely cleared up were certainly willing to give you time its not a matter of time or maybe it is ive had time to readjust reevaluate for the past few months ive deviated from the path i set for myself when i was still in high school i like it mr bittle no ones more surprised than i am that im happy running a secondhand shop on cannery row but i am and im not willing to give it up he sat back tapping his fingertips together as he did when he faced a knotty problem let me talk to you a moment as an old friend someone whos known you most of your life of course youre goaloriented kate youve put all your time and effort into achieving success in your chosen field a field i might add that youre eminently suited for now perhaps youve needed a break we all do from time to time he spread his fingers tapped them together again but to lose sight of that goal to settle in a position youre not only overqualified for but unsuited for is a waste of time and talent any adequate bookkeeper could handle the daily finances of a shop and a highschool girl can ring up sales youre right delighted to hear it all put into logical unemotional terms she smiled at him youre completely right mr bittle well then kate if youd like a few more days to sort out your thoughts no ive got them sorted ive told myself basically the same thing youve just said to me what im doing makes absolutely no sense its illogical irrational and emotional its probably a mistake too but i have to make it you see its our shop margos and lauras and mine its our dream chapter twenty contents prev next she copped a bottle of champagne from the shop then decided to go one better and attempt to cook a meal she had a tacit agreement with byron that he would cook and she would wash up as he was lightyears ahead of her in culinary skills but since this was to be a celebration of a new stage of her life she wanted to give it a shot shed always considered cooking a kind of mathematical skill she could handle the formulas like calculus calculate the answer but she didnt particularly enjoy the process wrapped in a bib apron her sleeves rolled up past the elbows she lined up her ingredients like elements in a physics lab first the antipasto she decided and warily eyed the mushrooms shed washed it couldnt be easy to stuff them with cheese but the recipe claimed it could be done she removed the stems and chopped them fine as directed following the steps she cooked them with the green onions and garlic and found herself smiling at the scent by the time shed finished with the bread crumbs and cheese and spices she was enthralled with herself it wasnt long before she was happily smearing the stuffing mixture into the caps then popping them into the oven there were cucumbers to marinate peppers to slice tomatoes to deal with oh right and the olives she fought with the lid on a jar of plump black olives cursing it as the oven timer beeped out came the mushrooms she was in control she told herself as she sucked on the thumb shed brushed against the hot baking dish it was just a matter of efficiency what the hell came next she sliced cheese struggled over the perfect consistency for the basil and olive oil she wanted for the bread she intended to serve an emergency call to mrs williamson the cook at templeton house calmed her down enough that she could arrange the antipasto meticulously on a platter where the hell was byron she wondered and nibbled her nails over the recipe for pasta con pesto coarsely chopped basil leaves she read what the devil did coarsely chopped mean exactly and why the hell did you have to grate parmesan when anybody with half a brain could buy a nice can of it in the market and where was she going to find pine nuts she found them in a labeled canister in his cupboard she should have known he would have them the man had everything that had to do with eating preparing to eat and serving eats the carefully measured ingredients went into the blender deciding that a little prayer couldnt hurt she closed one eye sent it up and hit the switch everything whirled satisfactorily smug now kate put water on to boil for the pasta and set the table excuse me byron said from the kitchen doorway i seem to have walked into the wrong house very funny the dogs who had been keeping her company and keeping an eye out for scraps dashed to greet him since hed followed his nose and his curiosity straight into the kitchen he still had his briefcase with him he set it aside now to pet the dogs and grin foolishly at kate you dont cook dont doesnt mean cant anxious for feedback she took a mushroom off the platter and popped it into his mouth well its good good she arched a brow just good surprisingly good he ventured youre wearing an apron of course im wearing an apron im not getting splatters all over me you look so domestic he slid his hands over her shoulders kissed her hello i like it dont get used to it this is pretty much a oneshot deal she went to the refrigerator to take out the champagne i remember when josh went through this phase and wanted to marry donna reed donna reed after opening the door to let the dogs streak out byron settled on a stool well she did look pretty hot in those aprons now that i think about it he got over it and decided hed rather go for miss february with a quick efficient twist she popped the cork of course he always wanted margo anyway donna and miss d cup were just distractions she took flutes out of the cabinet and turned back with a wicked grin now if i have the line right i say and how was your day dear it was good this is better he took the glass shed filled for him toasted her whats the occasion im glad you realize there has to be one for me to go through this mess she blew out a breath as she looked around the kitchen no matter that shed tried to be careful there was a hell of a cleanup in store why do you do it you know cook i enjoy it youre a sick man byron your waters boiling donna oh right she picked up the clear canister of pasta frowned at it you take this stuff out of the box and put it in here okay for aesthetics i guess but how am i supposed to know how much is ten ounces estimate i know that goes against the grain for you but we all have to live dangerously now and again he watched her worry over it started to tell her she was putting in too much then shrugged it was her dinner after all in any case he found himself easily distracted by the way the neat bow of the apron strings accented her tidy little butt just how would it look if she was naked under that sturdy white apron at his laugh she glanced around what nothing he drank more wine just an unexpected and slightly embarrassing fantasy it passed mostly why dont you tell me what happened to set you off on this domestic campaign ill tell you i was shit i forgot the bread her brow furrowed as she slid the pan into the oven adjusted the heat and timer theres no way you can hold a conversation and deal with all the details of a meal in progress why dont you put on some music light the candles do that kind of stuff while i finish this all right he rose started out turned back katherine about that little fantasy amused at himself he shook his head maybe well try it later too preoccupied to pay attention she waved him away and got back to business she thought shed managed very well when they were settled at the table scents wafting candles flickering and otis redding crooning on the stereo i could handle doing this she decided after shed sampled and approved the pasta about once a year its fabulous really and very much appreciated its quite a feeling coming home to a pretty woman and a homecooked meal i had some excess energy she broke bread offered him half i thought about just dragging you up to the bedroom when you walked in then i figured that could wait until after dinner anyway i was hungry my appetites definitely improved in the last few months so has your stress level he commented youve stopped popping aspirin and antacids like candy it was true she admitted she had and she certainly felt better than she remembered feeling in years well ive done something today that is going to either keep me on that same route or send me back to the pharmacy she took a hard look at the bubbles in her wine swallowed some i turned down the partnership did you he laid a hand over hers toyed with her fingers are you okay with that i think so out of curiosity she said you dont sound very surprised i didnt know i was going to turn it down until i was sitting in mr bittles office maybe your head didnt know it but your gut did or your heart youve wrapped yourself up in pretenses kate its yours why would you give it up to be a part of something someone else had built because its what ive always wanted always aimed for a bit unsure of him she shrugged her shoulders it turned out it was enough just to know i was good enough its a little scary changing directions this way its not that radical a change he corrected youre partners in a business in charge of accounts my degree all that education you dont really believe thats wasted do you its part of who you are kate youre just using it in a different way i just couldnt go back to that office to that life she decided it all seemed so rigid margo was in the shop today with the baby people were fussing over him and margo was sitting there with the cradle beside her and laura had to look for this winged dragon and i boxed a pocket watch and put away shoes embarrassed she trailed off im babbling i never babble its all right i get the drift youre having fun working there being part of it youre enjoying the surprises of something you helped create i never liked surprises i always wanted to know the when where and how so i could be prepared you make mistakes if you arent prepared and i hate making mistakes are you doing something that feels right to you it looks that way well then he lifted his glass touched it to hers go for it wait until i tell margo and laura the idea of it made her laugh margo was gone when i got back and laura had to run pick up the girls so i didnt have the chance of course were going to have to make some changes its ridiculous not to have a regular posted schedule of our work hours and the pricing system needs to be completely overhauled the new software ive just installed will completely streamline our she caught herself and found him grinning at her you cant change overnight you shouldnt change at all thats the kind of thing they need you for play to your strengths kid which apparently include italian cooking this pesto is terrific really she sampled more herself it is kind of good well maybe i could throw something together on special occasions you wont get an argument from me thoughtfully he twirled pasta on his fork speaking of special occasions now that youre going to continue to be selfemployed you should be able to flex your schedule a bit for a variety of reasons im not going to be able to get back to atlanta for christmas so im making plans to take a few days for the trip over thanksgiving thats nice she refused to acknowledge the thud of dis appointment im sure your family will be happy to have you even for a few days id like you to come with me what her fork paused halfway to her mouth id like you to come to atlanta with me for thanksgiving and meet my family i i cant i cant just fly across the country like that theres not enough time to you have the best part of a month to arrange your schedule atlantas not bora bora kate its georgia i know where atlanta is she said testily look besides the time factor thanksgivings a family holiday you dont just bring someone and dump them on your family on thanksgiving youre not someone he said quietly oh it was panic in her eyes all right he could read it perfectly though it irritated him he determined to follow through its traditional where i come from to invite the woman whos important to you to meet your family to have them meet her particularly if its the woman youre in love with and want to marry she jerked back as if scalded nearly knocking over the chair as she sprang to her feet wait a minute hold it whoa where did that come from i cook one stupid meal and you get delusions of grandeur i love you kate i want to marry you it would mean a great deal to me if youd spend a few days with my family im sure margo and laura would be willing to adjust the work schedule to accommodate a short trip over the holiday it took several tries before the sounds coming out of her mouth could be fashioned into words how can you sit there like that and calmly talk about scheduling in the same breath as marriage have you gone insane i thought youd appreciate the practicality not sure who was irritating him more himself or kate he topped off his wine well i dont so just stop it i dont know where you got this brainstorm about marriage but i wouldnt call it a brainstorm he said contemplating his glass ive given it quite a bit of thought oh have you have you really temper began to bubble beneath panic preferring it kate let it spew thats how you work isnt it thats how byron de witt works in his quiet thoughtful patient way i see it all now she fumed storming around the center island i cant believe i didnt see it all along how clever you are byron how canny how fucking devious youve just been reeling me in havent you taking over step by little step youre going to need to explain that for me what have i taken over exactly me and dont think i cant see it all perfectly now first it was sex its hard to think rationally when youre nothing more than one big throbbing gland he might have laughed but instead carefully chose an olive as i recall the sex was as much your idea as mine more actually in the beginning dont try to confuse the issue she spat out slamming her hands on the counter far be it from me to confuse the issue with facts keep going then it was the letsgetkatehealthy campaign hospitals damn doctors medicine i suppose it would be confusing the issue again to point out that you had an ulcer i was handling it i could have gotten myself to the doctor just fine on my own then youre cooking and feeding me all this healthy stuff youve got to have a decent breakfast kate you really should cut back on the coffee a little and before i know it im eating regular meals and exercising byron ran his tongue around his teeth stared down at his plate im so ashamed setting this diabolical trap for you its unforgivable dont you get glib with me buster you bought puppies you tuned up my car he rubbed his hands over his face before he rose now i got the dogs and fixed your car in order to blind you to my evil plot kate youre making a fool of yourself i am not i know perfectly well when im making a fool of myself and im not you set everything up in clever little stages until im practically living here honey he said with a mix of affection and exasperation you are living here see she threw up her hands im living with you without even realizing it im cooking meals for gods sake ive never cooked for a man in my entire life havent you touched he moved forward reached for her dont you do that still blazing she retreated behind the island youve got a hell of a nerve confusing things like this i told you you werent my type that it wasnt going to work his patience straining he rocked back on his heels the hell with types it has been working and youre perfectly aware of just how well it works with us i love you and if you werent so damn pigheaded youd admit that you love me dont you assume my feelings de witt fine then im in love with you deal with it i dont have to deal with it you have to deal with it and as far as your halfassed proposal of marriage i didnt propose marriage he said coolly i told you i want you to marry me i didnt ask you just what are you afraid of kate that im a replay of that jerk thornhill who used you until something more appetizing came along she went cold just how do you know about roger youve been poking around in my business havent you and why am i not surprised it was no use biting his tongue now better he thought to play it out when someone is as important to me as you are her business is important to me her welfare is important to me so i made it my business to find out you mentioned his name to kusack ive kept in touch with kusack youve kept in touch with kusack she repeated you know it was roger who set me up he nodded and apparently so do you i just figured it out this afternoon but at a guess id say youve known a bit longer and didnt find it necessary to mention it to me the trail led back to him a personal clash between the two of you access to your office he made phone calls to new hampshire around the time you were told about your father how do you know about the phone calls joshs investigator accessed the information joshs investigator she repeated so josh knows too but still no one thought it necessary to pass any of this handy information along to me it wasnt passed to you because youd have stormed right up into thornhills face and blasted him the way byron admitted hed wanted to take thornhills face apart with his fists we didnt want him tipped off before the investigation is complete you didnt want she shot back too bad because ive already blasted him and ruined your neat plans you had no right to work around me to take over my life i have every right to do whatever i can to protect you and to help you and thats what ive done thats what im going to continue to do whether i like it or not essentially im not roger thornhill im not and ive never used you for anything no youre not a user byron do you know what you are youre a handler thats what you do you handle people its what makes you so good at your job that patience that charm that skill at easing people onto your side of an issue without them ever really seeing theyve been maneuvered well heres a flash for you i will not be handled i sure as hell wont be maneuvered into marriage just a damn minute he shifted to block her path before she could storm out when he closed his fingers around her arm she yelped afraid that hed misjudged his strength in temper he jerked back holding her arm much more gently but the bruises he saw on her arm were already formed the haze that smothered his brain was dark and ugly what the hell is this he demanded her heart thudded hard into her throat as his eyes snapped to hers let go of me who put these marks on you her chin angled in defense the fury hardening his eyes was as lethal as the slice of a wellhoned sword ive seen your white knight routine already byron im not interested in a reprise who touched you he said spacing each word carefully someone else who couldnt take no for an answer she snapped she regretted the words bitterly before they were fully formed but it was too late his eyes went carefully blank smoothly he stepped out of her path youre mistaken his voice was cool and calm and deliberate i can take no for an answer and since that seems to be the case we dont seem to have anything left to discuss ill apologize for that she felt the heat of shame burning her cheeks it was uncalled for but i dont appreciate your interference in my business or your assumption that id just fall into your plans understood hurt was a rusty ball of heat in his gut as i said that seems to end it its clear you were right from the beginning we want different things and this isnt going to work he walked over to the table more to distance himself from her than because he wanted the wine he picked up and drank you can get your things now or at your convenience i she stared at him stunned that he could close the door between them so neatly i dont i cant im going she managed and fled he listened for the slam of the door then sat as carefully as an old man he put his head back closed his eyes it was a wonder he thought that she could assume he was such a brilliant strategist when a blind man on a galloping horse could see just how badly hed bungled it she went home of course where else did you go when you were wounded the scene she burst in on in the parlor was so cheerful so familial so much what she had just been offered and refused that she wanted to scream josh sat in the wing chair near the fire the pretty lights from the flickering flames playing over him and his sleeping son laura her younger daughter at her feet poured coffee into pretty china cups margo snuggled on the end of the couch with ali so they could pore over a fashion magazine together kate laura glanced up with a welcoming smile youre just in time for coffee i bribed josh to bring the baby over with one of mrs williamsons honeyglazed hams he might have left a few scraps margo added if youre hungry i only had seconds you had seconds twice uncle josh kayla pointed out and got up as she had every few minutes to peek at the baby stool pigeon he tweaked her nose aunt kates mad ali straightened up on the couch in anticipation youre mad at somebody arent you aunt kate your face is red so it is margo drawled when she took a closer look and i think i hear her teeth grinding out kate pointed a finger at josh you and i were going to go round later but right now go away and take your testosterone with you i never go anywhere without it he said easily and im comfortable right here i dont want to see a man if i do see a man in the next sixty seconds ill have to kill him with my bare hands he sniffed feigning insult but he rose im taking jt into the library for port and cigars were going to talk about sports and power tools can i come uncle josh of course he gave kayla his free hand im no sexist bedtime in thirty minutes kayla laura called out ali why dont you go keep uncle josh company until bedtime i want to stay here she poked out her bottom lip and folded her arms over her chest i dont have to leave just because aunt kates going to shout and swear im not a baby let her stay kate made a grand sweeping gesture with her arms she cant learn too early what men are really like yes she can laura corrected allison go into the library with your uncle or go upstairs and have your bath i always have to do what you say i hate it ali stormed out stomping up the stairs to sulk alone well that was pleasant laura murmured and wondered yet again what had happened to her sweet compliant ali what cheerful note would you like to add to that kate men are pigs she grabbed a cup of coffee and downed it like whiskey chapter twentyone contents prev and your point is margo said after a long moment what do we need them for anyway what possible purpose do they have other than procreation and with advances in technology well be taking care of that in a lab soon very pleasant laura decided and poured another cup perhaps we dont need them for sex but i still depend on them for largeinsect disposal speak for yourself margo put it id rather kill spiders than give up sex what crime did byron commit kate or do we get to guess the sneak the conniving son of a bitch i cant believe i was idiot enough to fall into a relationship with a man like that you never really know a person do you never really know whats behind their beady little eyes kate what did he do whatever it is im sure its not as bad as you think as kate tore off her coat lauras gaze settled on the bruises she was on her feet in a blink dear god kate did he hit you what oh she dismissed the bruises with a wave of the hand no of course he didnt hit me i got this bumping into something warped at bittle byron wouldnt hit a woman its too direct an approach for someone like him well what for christs sake did he do margo demanded ill tell you what he did ill tell you what he did she repeated as she stormed around the room he asked me to marry him when this was met with silence she whirled did you hear what i said he asked me to marry him laura considered and he has what a closet full of the heads of his former wives you are not listening to me you are not getting it struggling for calm kate breathed deep pushed at her hair okay he cooks pushes vitamins on me gets me working out he gets my juices all stirred up so im ready to fall onto any handy surface and have incredible sex he goes to see kusack hes been working with josh behind my back tries to get all the worry out of my life he sees to it that i have a closet so that i can just start leaving my clothes over there of course hes bought that house she continued pacing and those damn dogs that anyone with half a heart would fall for my car hasnt run better since the day i drove it off the lot and regularly so you hardly notice he brings flowers home not flowers margo pressed a hand to her breast good god the man is a fiend he must be stopped just shut up margo i know youre not on my side youre never on my side certain of lauras loyalty kate dropped down on her knees in front of her clutched her hands he asked me to go with him to atlanta over thanksgiving and meet his parents he says he loves me and wants me to marry him darling all sympathy laura pressed kates hands i can see that youve been through an ordeal tonight obviously the man is deranged im sure josh can arrange to have him committed stunned kate yanked her hands away you have to be on my side she insisted you want me to feel sorry for you the flash of anger in lauras eyes had kate blinking no yes i no i just want you to understand ill tell you what i understand you have a man who loves you a good considerate thoughtful man whos willing to share the burdens of living as well as the pleasures with you who wants you who cares enough to make an effort to make you happy to make your life run a little more smoothly one who wants you in bed and out one who cares enough to want you to meet his family because he loves them and wants to show you off to them and thats not good enough for you no i didnt say that its just she got to her feet staggered by the heat i didnt plan thats your problem laura small delicateboned and furious rose as well it has to be in tidy order in kates plan well lifes messy i know i meant riding on a fury and frustration she herself hadnt guessed at laura barreled over kates protest and if you dont think yours is adequate try mine try having nothing and her voice was bitter an empty marriage a man who wanted your name more than you and didnt even pretend otherwise after he had you try coming home every night knowing theres not going to be anyone there to hold you that all the problems that need fixing come to you that you have no one to lean on and having your daughter blame you for not being good enough to keep her father under the same roof she stalked over to stare at the crackling flames of the fire while her friends watched in silence try feeling unloved unwanted and crawling into bed every night wondering how youre going to make it work how you can possibly make it right again then come crying to me im sorry kate murmured laura im so sorry no exhausted and ashamed laura moved away from kates comforting hand and sat again no im sorry i dont know where that came from she leaned her head back against the cushion a moment her eyes shut as the last of the temper drained away yes i do maybe im jealous she opened her eyes again and managed a smile or maybe i just think youre stupid i should have moved back in here after peter left kate began i should have realized how much you were dealing with alone oh stop its not about me im just a little raw laura rubbed her aching temples that wasnt the first goround ali and i had today it makes me edgy i can move in now kate sat down beside laura not that youre not welcome laura told her but youre not moving in blocked that escape route margo murmured im not looking for escape kate struggled to get a grip on her tumbling emotions i could help with the girls share the expenses no this is my life laura grimaced such as it is you have your own if you dont love byron thats one thing you cant tailor your feelings to suit him are you kidding margo reached for the coffeepot shes been crosseyed over him for months so what emotions arent any guarantee when it comes to something as big as marriage they werent enough for laura kate sighed shrugged im sorry but they werent no they werent if you want guarantees send in your warranty card when you buy a toaster okay youre right but thats not the whole point cant you see he was playing me hes been handling me all through this relationship margo made a low feline sound being handled by a strong gorgeous man poor you you know very well what i mean youd never let josh push all the buttons make all the moves im telling you that byron has a way of undermining things so that im sliding along in the direction hes chosen before i realize it so change directions if you dont like the destination margo suggested he called me a detour once remembering kate scowled he said he liked taking long interesting detours i actually thought it was sort of charming why dont you go back and talk this out with him instead of arguing laura tilted her head well able to imagine the scene that had taken place in byrons kitchen hes probably feeling just as unhappy and frustrated as you are i cant kate shook her head he told me to pick up my things at my convenience ouch margo looked at kate with genuine sympathy now in that polite mannerly tone of his exactly its the worst besides i dont know what id say to him i dont know what i want at a loss she buried her face in her hands i keep thinking i know what i want then it shifts on me im tired its too hard to think rationally when im tired then talk to him tomorrow youll stay here tonight laura rose i have to put the girls to bed shes made me so ashamed kate murmured when she was alone with margo i know margo slid closer at least all she made me feel was like killing peter ridgeway if he ever shows his sorry face around here i didnt realize she was still so hurt so unhappy shell be all right margo patted kates knee well see to it im ah not going to go into another accounting firm of course youre not everybody seems to know what im going to do before i do kate griped bittle offered me a partnership congratulations i turned him down this afternoon my my margos milliondollar smile flashed havent we had a busy day and roger thornhill is the embezzler what margos cup clinked into its saucer that slimy weasel who twotimed you with your own client the very same it pleased kate to see that she could say something that got a rise out of margo it was the way he acted when i ran into him at bittle today hes smart enough to have figured out how to siphon funds and i was his main competition for the partner slot he gets a little playing money and screws me at the same time youve been to kusack with this no apparently byron the cop and your husband whom i will deal with shortly already knew and left you in the dark understanding perfectly margo pulled kate to her feet occasionally men have to be reminded that they are no longer hunting out of caves fighting dragons or blazing trails west while we huddle around the fire ill help you remind josh at nine fortyfive the next morning kate opened the till at pretenses she would run the shop alone that morning she took some pride in her competence laura was at her office at the hotel and margo remained on maternity leave she decided to relish these last few minutes before she unlocked the door turned the sign to open shed brought her own cds margo preferred classical kate preferred the classics the beatles the stones cream after putting the music on she went into the powder room filled the copper watering can she was going to enjoy the pleasant little duties of nurturing an elegant business she told herself she was not going to think about byron de witt he was in the penthouse suite by now probably in some meeting or on a conference call he might be glancing over an itinerary for a trip to san francisco didnt he say he had to fly up didnt matter she reminded herself and stepped out on the veranda to water the tubs of pansies and impatiens he could fly anywhere he wanted to the moon for that matter her interest in his affairs was over finished a closed book she had her life to worry about didnt she after all she was beginning a whole new phase a new career with a new goal to aim for she had dozens of ideas to improve and expand the shop floating around in her head once margo was back in gear they would have a meeting an efficiency meeting then there was the fashion show right around the corner the advertising had to be placed they needed to discuss other promotions for the holidays what they needed was a regular weekly brainstorming and progress meeting she would set it up fix it into the schedule you couldnt run a successful business without regular structured meetings you couldnt run a life without structure without specific plans and goals why the hell couldnt he see that she had specific plans and goals how could he have thrown marriage at her knocking down all of her carefully placed pins you didnt marry someone youd known barely a full year there were stages to a relationship careful cautious and sensible stages maybe just maybe after two years after youd worked out the kinks in the relationship after you fully understood each others faults and foibles and had learned to accept them or compromise on them you began to discuss the possibility of marriage you had to outline what you wanted out of marriage assign roles and duties who handled the marketing who paid the bills who took out the trash for gods sake marriage was a business a partnership a fullscale commitment sensible people didnt just jump into it without first finetuning the details and what about children it was obvious who had the children if there were going to be children but what about assignment of responsibilities diapers and laundry feedings and doctors appointments if you didnt nail down the details of responsibilities you had nothing but chaos and a baby needing to be taken care of by a responsible adult a baby oh god what would it be like to have a baby she didnt know anything about having a baby think of all the books she would have to read all the mistakes she was bound to make there were so many things you had to have for a baby strollers and car seats and cribs and all those adorable little clothes she thought dreamily youre drowning those pansies ms powell she jerked back slopping water on her shoes she stared blankly at kusack while her mind whirled she had just all but named a baby she hadnt conceived with a man she didnt intend to conceive it with daydreaming his lips curved in that now familiar paternal fashion no i she wasnt a daydreamer she was a thinker a doer ive got a lot on my mind bet you do thought id catch you before you opened up do you mind if we go inside no of course not still fumbling she set the watering can down and opened the door its just me today my partners are arent here i wanted to talk to you alone i didnt mean to spook you ms powell no thats all right her speeding heart seemed to have settled back to a reasonable rate what can i do for you detective actually i just came by to catch you up on the progress of the investigation i figured after the trouble you went through you deserve to know how it panned out well that makes one of you she murmured your boyfriend nudged me toward roger thornhill hes not my boyfriend kate said quickly then set her teeth if youre referring to mr de witt i am he smiled a bit sheepishly and tugged on his ear i never know how to refer to these kinds of things anyway mr de witt nudged me toward thornhill fact is i was already looking in that direction you dont look shocked speechless by the news he commented i figured it out yesterday she shrugged her shoulders discovering it simply didnt matter any longer thought you would thornhills got a little gambling problem gamblings one of the best reasons to need quick money roger gambles that did shock her you mean he bets on horse races that sort of thing he bets on wall street ms powell and hes been losing steady for the past couple of years overplayed his hand so to speak and lost his ante then there was his personal relationship with you then add in the information about your father and the fact that he was the one who found the newspaper article in your office and passed it to bittle really she nodded i didnt know that a little too pat to my way of thinking connections usually arent coincidences in my line of work you had a little runin with him yesterday at bittle and how do you know about that ms newman shes got good eyes and ears and a sharp nose he grinned i asked her to report any unusual incident officewise shes another who didnt like the way thornhill smelled so to speak and she stood by you from the start excuse me kate tapped her ear as though her hearing had gone suddenly off newman stood by me first interview i had with her on this business she said if i was looking in your direction i was looking in the wrong one she said katherine powell wouldnt steal so much as a paper clip i see i always thought she disliked me i dont know whether she likes you or not but she respects you are you going to bring roger in for questioning then already have i had to move a little quicker after i learned youd had a faceoff with him so i paid him a little visit last night he was already packed and on his way to the airport youre kidding no maam had reservations for a flight to rio hes been living on the edge since you were cleared whatever you said to him at the office yesterday broke his nerve he lawyered himself pretty quick but we figure to cut a deal by the end of the day they call this sort of thing a victimless crime i guess thats a misnomer this time around i dont feel like a victim kate murmured i dont know what i feel well id feel right pissed if youll pardon my french but he shrugged his shoulders his careers in the toilet and hes going to be paying off fines and his lawyer for a long time to come and the federal government is going to have him as their guest for a while hell go to prison as her father would have gone to prison she thought for a mistake an error in judgment a moment of greed like i said were cutting a deal but i dont see him walking away without doing some time you know the way things work today you could sue him yourself defamation of character emotional pain and suffering all that your lawyer would tell you im not interested in suing roger im interested in turning the page i figured that he smiled at her again youre a nice woman ms powell its been a pleasure meeting you even under the circumstances she thought about it i suppose i have to say the same detective kusack even under the circumstances he stepped toward the door stopped its about opening time isnt it she glanced at her watch just about i wonder he tugged on his ear again my wifes got this birthday coming up tomorrow actually detective kusack she beamed at him youve come to the right place kate told herself she felt wonderful revived all of her troubles were behind her she was starting the next phase of her life there was no reason to be nervous about going to byrons it was the middle of the day lunchtime he wouldnt be home she would simply pick up her things as hed requested and thereby close that chapter cleanly she would not regret it was fun while it lasted nothing lasted forever all good things came to an end and if another cliche popped into her mind she would scream she pulled into his driveway the key she had meticulously removed from her own ring was in her pocket but when she reached in to pull it out she found herself holding seraphinas coin baffled she stared at it she would have sworn shed put that in the top drawer of her jewelry box she turned it in her hand the sun caught the edge and shot out dazzling light that was why her eyes watered she told herself it was the reflection off the gold and shed taken off her sunglasses it wasnt because she felt a sudden wrenching connection to that young girl standing on the cliff ready to throw her life away kate powell was not throwing her life away she told herself firmly she was facing it only the weak tossed away hope she had years of happiness left in her life years and she was not going to stand here and cry over some old coin and a misty legend this was reality she blinked back tears her reality and she knew exactly what she was doing she found the key replaced the coin in her pocket but it was harder than shed imagined to use the key knowing it would be the last time it was just a house she thought there was no reason for her to love it no reason to feel this aching sense of welcome when she opened the door there was no reason at all for her to walk to the glass doors and want to weep because the pups were napping in the sunshine and geraniums were blooming in gray stone pots wind chimes of copper and brass sang in the breeze from the sea shells that she had gathered with byron from the beach were arranged in a widemouthed glass bowl on the redwood table it was so perfect she realized so simply perfect that was why she wanted to weep when the dogs heads popped up in unison and they scrambled up to bark and race she realized she hadnt heard the car but they had they reacted just that way whenever they recognized the sound of byrons return home jolted with panic she turned around and faced the door as he came in im sorry she said immediately i didnt realize youd be home early i dont suppose you did but hed known thanks to lauras call that she would be there i came to get my things i i thought it best to come by when you were at work so it would be less awkward its awkward now he stepped toward her eyes narrowed youve been crying no not really it was her fingers slid into her pocket touched the coin it was something else entirely and then i guess it was the dogs they looked so sweet sleeping in the yard they were at the door now tails waving furiously ill miss them sit down no i really cant i want to get back to the shop and and i do want to apologize byron for shouting at you the way i did i really am sorry for that and id hate to think we couldnt at least be civil she closed her eyes on her own absurdity this is very awkward he wanted to touch her badly wanted to touch her but he knew his own limitations if he so much as brushed his hand over that short cap of hair he would want to touch more have to touch more until he was holding her against him and begging then lets try being civil if you wont sit well stand there are a few things id like to say he watched her open her eyes saw the wariness in them what the hell did she see when she looked at him he wondered why couldnt he tell im going to apologize as well i handled things badly last night and at the risk of getting kicked in the teeth again i admit that you werent that far off the mark in some of your lets call them observations about my character he walked to the doors jingling the change in his pocket the dogs still hopeful sat sentry on the other side of the glass i do plan things out we have that in common i admit i eased you into living here it seemed to me that it would help both of us get used to it because i wanted you here when he turned back to her she struggled for a reply but found none i wanted to take care of you you see vulnerability as a weakness i see it as a soft appealing side of a strong intelligent and resilient woman its in my nature to protect to fix or at least try to fix whats wrong i cant change that for you i dont want you to change byron but i cant change either im always going to resist being guided along however well intentioned it might be and when i see someone i love stressed out to the point of illness taken advantage of hurt im going to do whatever it takes to turn it around and when i want something when i know its right im going to work toward making it happen i love you kate her heart swam into her eyes filled them i dont know how to handle this i dont know what to do i cant figure it out ive figured it out you know every once in a while it doesnt hurt to let someone else figure it out maybe i dont know but there were points in all of this i had to come to myself i didnt even realize some of them theyve arrested roger i know of course you do she tried to laugh then turned away when kusack came by and told me i wasnt sure how i felt at first relieved vindicated but there was more i thought of my father hed have gone to jail just as roger will go its the same crime the same punishment theyre both thieves kate no let me finish its taken me so long to get here my father made a mistake a criminal mistake as much as it hurts me to know that i also know that he never tried to shift the blame implicate anyone else he wasnt like roger he would have faced what hed done and he would have paid for it i realized today that that made all the difference i can live with that and forgive and remember what he was to me for the first eight years of my life he was my father and he loved me youre a beautiful woman katherine she shook her head brushed away tears i had to get that out it seems i can always pull out whats inside me and hand it to you it worries me how easy it is to do that you worry too much lets see if i can help there well try a simple logic test im thirtyfive years old ive never been married never been engaged never formally lived with a woman before why i dont know she dragged her hands through her hair fighting to use intellect over emotion as she turned back to him there could be a dozen reasons you resisted commitment you were too busy sampling southern delights you were too focused on your career it could have been any of those he agreed but ill tell you what it comes down to i dont like to make mistakes any more than you do im sure there are other women i could be happy with build a decent life with but that isnt enough i waited because i had this image this dream about the woman id share my life with youre not going to tell me i was that image because i know very well i wasnt she stared blankly at the handkerchief he offered what youre crying again when she snatched it away and mopped at her face he continued some of us are more flexible in our dreams and can even enjoy when they take a dif ferent shape look at me kate he said gently and drew her gaze to his ive been waiting for you thats not fair she pressed crossed hands to her swelling heart as she backed away its not fair to say things like that to me we said civil we didnt say anything about fair i dont want to feel this way i dont want to hurt this way why wont you just let me think think about this he did touch her now drawing her in until their faces were close i love you and kissed her i want to spend my life with you i want to take care of you and be taken care of im not the kind of woman people say those things to she thumped her hand on his chest why cant you see that hed have to make sure she got used to hearing those things coming from him his lips curved as he ran his hands up her back noi see it she jerked back out of reach i can actually see that look come into your eyes kate needs to be soothed and stroked and eased into it well its not going to work its just not going to work ive just got things sorted out she fumed stalking around the room ive got the shop isnt it enough of a shock to deal with that i love being there how am i supposed to suddenly adjust to all of this there arent any rules to being in love oh i figured that out all right tossing and turning all night because youd told me to pick up my things at my convenience she spun back and seared him with a look oh that was low yes it was he grinned at her now delighted with the image of her spending as miserable a night as he had im pleased to see it hit the mark you hurt me last night see thats just what happens when you get tangled up in love you hurt each other i didnt ask to be in love with you did i i didnt plan it and now i cant bear the idea of being without you of not sitting at the table in the morning watching you cook breakfast or listening to you tell me to concentrate when youve got me lifting those damn weights walking on the beach with you and those mangy dogs and i want a baby stunned he waited a beat now you see you see what youve done she sank onto the couch and buried her face in her hands listen to what im saying im a mess im insane im in love with you i know all that kate he sat beside her pulled her into his lap it suits me just fine what if it doesnt suit me i could really screw this up thats okay he kissed her cheek nuzzled her head on his shoulder im good at fixing things why dont we look at the big picture and work on the details as we go along she sighed closed her eyes and felt blissfully at home maybe youll be the one to screw it up then youll be there to put everything back in place i depend on you you those words the look in his eyes that showed he meant them were more powerful to her than any declaration of love i want you to i need to know you do and
