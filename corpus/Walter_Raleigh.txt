the book robert louis stevenson when a popular writer dies the question it has become the fashion with a nervous generation to ask is the question will he live there was no idler question none more hopelessly impossible and unprofitable to answer it is one of the many vanities of criticism to promise immortality to the authors that it praises to patronise a writer with the assurance that our greatgrandchildren whose time and tastes are thus frivolously mortgaged will read his works with delight but there is no antidote against the opium of time which temporally considereth all things our fathers find their graves in our short memories and sadly tell us how we may be buried in our survivors let us make sure that our sons will care for homer before we pledge a more distant generation to a newer cult nevertheless without handling the prickly question of literary immortality it is easy to recognise that the literary reputation of robert louis stevenson is made of good stuff his fame has spread as lasting fame is wont to do from the few to the many fifteen years ago his essays and fanciful books of travel were treasured by a small and discerning company of admirers long before he chanced to fell the british public with treasure island and dr jekyll and mr hyde he had shown himself a delicate marksman and although large editions are nothing standard editions richly furnished and complete are worthy of remark stevenson is one of the very few authors in our literary history who have been honoured during their lifetime by the appearance of such an edition the best of his public it would seem do not only wish to read his works but to possess them and all of them at the cost of many pounds in library form it would be easy to mention more voluminous and more popular authors than stevenson whose publishers could not find five subscribers for an adventure like this he has made a brave beginning in that race against time which all must lose it is not in the least necessary after all to fortify ourselves with the presumed consent of our poor descendants who may have a world of other business to attend to in order to establish stevenson in the position of a great writer let us leave that foolish trick to the politicians who never claim that they are right merely that they will win at the next elections literary criticism has standards other than the suffrage it is possible enough to say something of the literary quality of a work that appeared yesterday stevenson himself was singularly free from the vanity of fame the best artist he says truly is not the man who fixes his eye on posterity but the one who loves the practice of his art he loved if ever man did the practice of his art and those who find meat and drink in the delight of watching and appreciating the skilful practice of the literary art will abandon themselves to the enjoyment of his masterstrokes without teasing their unborn and possibly illiterate posterity to answer solemn questions will a book live will a cricket match live perhaps not and yet both be fine achievements it is not easy to estimate the loss to letters by his early death in the dedication of prince otto he says well we will not give in that we are finally beaten i still mean to get my health again i still purpose by hook or crook this book or the next to launch a masterpiece it would be a churlish or a very dainty critic who should deny that he has launched masterpieces but whether he ever launched his masterpiece is an open question of the story that he was writing just before his death he is reported to have said that the goodness of it frightened him a goodness that frightened him will surely not be visible like banquos ghost to only one pair of eyes his greatest was perhaps yet to come had dryden died at his age we should have had none of the great satires had scott died at his age we should have had no waverley novels dying at the height of his power and in the full tide of thought and activity he seems almost to have fulfilled the aspiration and unconscious prophecy of one of the early essays does not life go down with a better grace foaming in full body over a precipice than miserably straggling to an end in sandy deltas when the greeks made their fine saying that those whom the gods love die young i cannot help believing that they had this sort of death also in their eye for surely at whatever age it overtake the man this is to die young death has not been suffered to take so much as an illusion from his heart in the hotfit of life a tiptoe on the highest point of being he passes at a bound on to the other side the noise of the mallet and chisel is scarcely quenched the trumpets are hardly done blowing when trailing with him clouds of glory this happy starred fullblooded spirit shoots into the spiritual land but we on this side are the poorer by how much we can never know what strengthens the conviction that he might yet have surpassed himself and dwarfed his own best work is certainly no immaturity for the flavour of wisdom and old experience hangs about his earliest writings but a vague sense awakened by that brilliant series of books so diverse in theme so slight often in structure and occasions so gaily executed that here was a finished literary craftsman who had served his period of apprenticeship and was playing with his tools the pleasure of wielding the graven tool the itch of craftsmanship was strong upon him and many of the works he has left are the overflow of a laughing energy arabesques carved on the rock in the artists painless hours all art it is true is play of a sort the sportimpulse to translate a german phrase is deep at the root of the artists power sophocles shakespeare moliere and goethe in a very profound sense make game of life but to make game of life was to each of these the very loftiest and most imperative employ to be found for him on this planet to hold the mirror up to nature so that for the first time she may see herself to be a candleholder and look on at the pageantry which but for the candleholder would huddle along in the undistinguishable blackness filled them with the pride of place stevenson had the sportimpulse at the depths of his nature but he also had perhaps he had inherited an instinct for work in more blockish material for lighthouse building and ironfounding in a letter to a young artist contributed to a magazine years ago he compares the artist in paint or in words to the keeper of a booth at the worlds fair dependent for his bread on his success in amusing others in his volume of poems he almost apologises for his excellence in literature say not of me that weakly i declined the labours of my sires and fled the sea the towers we founded and the lamps we lit to play at home with paper like a child but rather say in the afternoon of time a strenuous family dusted from its hands the sand of granite and beholding far along the sounding coasts its pyramids and tall memorials catch the dying sun smiled wellcontent and to this childish task around the fire addressed its evening hours some of his works are no doubt best described as papergames in the wrong box for instance there is something very like the card game commonly called old maid the odd card is a superfluous corpse and each dismayed recipient in turn assumes a disguise and a pseudonym and bravely passes on that uncomfortable inheritance it is an admirable farce hardly touched with grimness unshaken by the breath of reality full of fantastic character the strange funeral procession is attended by shouts of glee at each of its stages and finally melts into space but when all is said it is not with work of this kind that olympus is stormed art must be brought closer into relation with life these airy and delightful freaks of fancy must be subdued to a serious scheme if they are to serve as credentials for a seat among the immortals the decorative painter whose pencil runs so freely in limning these halfhuman processions of outlined fauns and woodnymphs is asked at last to paint an easel picture stevenson is best where he shows most restraint and his peculiarly rich fancy which ran riot at the suggestion of every passing whim gave him what many a modern writer sadly lacks plenty to restrain an exuberant field for selfdenial here was an opportunity for art and labour the luxuriance of the virgin forests of the west may be clipped and pruned for a lifetime with no fear of reducing them to the trim similitude of a dutch garden his bountiful and generous nature could profit by a spell of training that would emaciate a poorer stock from the first his delight in earth and the earthborn was keen and multiform his zest in life put a spirit of youth in everything that heavy saturn laughd and leapd with him and his fancy light and quick as a childs made of the world around him an enchanted pleasance the realism as it is called that deals only with the banalities and squalors of life and weaves into the mesh of its story no character but would make you yawn if you passed ten minutes with him in a railwaycarriage might well take a lesson from this man if it had the brains picture to yourself it is not hard an average suburb of london the long rows of identical bilious brick houses with the inevitable lace curtains a symbol merely of the will and power to wash the awful nondescript object generally under glass in the front window the shrine of the unknown god of art the sombre invariable citizen whose garb gives no suggestion of his occupation or his tastes a person it would seem only by courtesy the pianoorgan the music of the day and the hideous voice of the vendor of halfpenny papers the music of the night could anything be less promising than such a row of houses for the theatre of romance set a realist to walk down one of these streets he will inquire about milkbills and servants wages latchkeys and sunday avocations and come back with a tale of small meannesses and petty respectabilities written in the approved modern fashion yet stevenson it seems likely could not pass along such a line of brick bandboxes without having his pulses set athrobbing by the imaginative possibilities of the place of his own lieutenant brackenbury rich he says the succession of faces in the lamplight stirred the lieutenants imagination and it seemed to him as if he could walk for ever in that stimulating city atmosphere and surrounded by the mystery of four million private lives he glanced at the houses and marvelled what was passing behind those warmly lighted windows he looked into face after face and saw them each intent upon some unknown interest criminal or kindly it was that same evening that prince florizels friend under the name of mr morris was giving a party in one of the houses of west kensington in one at least of the houses of that brick wilderness human spirits were being tested as on an anvil and most of them tossed aside so also in the rajahs diamond it was a quiet suburban garden that witnessed the sudden apparition of mr harry hartley and his treasures precipitated over the wall it was in the same garden that the rev simon rolles suddenly to his own surprise became a thief a monotony of bad building is no doubt a bad thing but it cannot paralyse the activities or frustrate the agonies of the mind of man to a man with stevensons live and searching imagination every work of human hands became vocal with possible associations buildings positively chattered to him the little inn at queensferry which even for scott had meant only mutton and currant jelly with cranberries vera weel preserved gave him the cardinal incident of kidnapped how should the world ever seem dull or sordid to one whom a railwaystation would take into its confidence to whom the very flagstones of the pavement told their story in whose mind the effect of night of any flowing water of lighted cities of the peep of day of ships of the open ocean called up an army of anonymous desires and pleasures to have the goldentongued romance with serene lute for a mistress and familiar is to be fortified against the assaults of tedium his attitude towards the surprising and momentous gifts of life was one prolonged passion of praise and joy there is none of his books that reads like the meditations of an invalid he has the readiest sympathy for all exhibitions of impulsive energy his heart goes out to a sailor and leaps into ecstasy over a generous adventurer or buccaneer of one of his earlier books he says from the negative point of view i flatter myself this volume has a certain stamp although it runs to considerably upwards of two hundred pages it contains not a single reference to the imbecility of gods universe nor so much as a single hint that i could have made a better one myself and this was an omission that he never remedied in his later works indeed his zest in life whether lived in the back gardens of a town or on the high seas was so great that it seems probable the writer would have been lost had the man been dowered with better health whereas my birth and spirit rather took the way that takes the town thou didst betray me to a lingring book and wrap me in a gown says george herbert who in his earlier ambitions would fain have ruffled it with the best at the court of king james but from stevenson although not only the town but oceans and continents beckoned him to deeds no such wail escaped his indomitable cheerfulness was never embarked in the cockboat of his own prosperity a high and simple courage shines through all his writings it is supposed to be a normal human feeling for those who are hale to sympathize with others who are in pain stevenson reversed the position and there is no braver spectacle in literature than to see him not asking others to lower their voices in his sickroom but raising his own voice that he may make them feel at ease and avoid imposing his misfortunes on their notice once when i was groaning aloud with physical pain he says in the essay on childs play a young gentleman came into the room and nonchalantly inquired if i had seen his bow and arrow he made no account of my groans which he accepted as he had to accept so much else as a piece of the inexplicable conduct of his elders and like a wise young gentleman he would waste no wonder on the subject was there ever a passage like this the sympathy of the writer is wholly with the child and the childs absolute indifference to his own sufferings it might have been safely predicted that this man should he ever attain to pathos would be free from the facile maudlin pathos of the hired sentimentalist and so also with what dr johnson has called metaphysical distresses it is striking enough to observe how differently the quiet monasteries of the carthusian and trappist brotherhoods affected matthew arnold and robert louis stevenson in his well known elegiac stanzas matthew arnold likens his own state to that of the monks wandering between two worlds one dead the other powerless to be born with nowhere yet to rest my head like these on earth i wait forlorn their faith my tears the world deride i come to shed them at their side to stevenson on the other hand our lady of the snows is a mistaken divinity and the place a monument of chilly error for once in a way he takes it on himself to be a preacher his temperament gives voice in a creed and ye o brethren what if god when from heavens top he spies abroad and sees on this tormented stage the noble war of mankind rage what if his vivifying eye o monks should pass your corner by for still the lord is lord of might in deeds in deeds he takes delight the plough the spear the laden barks the field the founded city marks he marks the smiler of the streets the singer upon garden seats he sees the climber in the rocks to him the shepherd folds his flocks for those he loves that underprop with daily virtues heavens top and bear the falling sky with ease unfrowning caryatides those he approves that ply the trade that rock the child that wed the maid that with weak virtues weaker hands sow gladness on the peopled lands and still with laughter song and shout spin the great wheel of earth about but ye o ye who linger still here in your fortress on the hill with placid face with tranquil breath the unsought volunteers of death our cheerful general on high with careless looks may pass you by and the fact of death which has damped and darkened the writings of so many minor poets does not cast a pallor on his conviction life is of value only because it can be spent or given and the love of god coveted the position and assumed mortality if a man treasure and hug his life one thing only is certain that he will be robbed some day and cut the pitiable and futile figure of one who has been saving candleends in a house that is on fire better than this to have a foolish spendthrift blaze and the loving cup going round stevenson speaks almost with a personal envy of the conduct of the four marines of the wager there was no room for them in the boat and they were left on a desert island to a certain death they were soldiers they said and knew well enough it was their business to die and as their comrades pulled away they stood upon the beach gave three cheers and cried god bless the king now one or two of those who were in the boat escaped against all likelihood to tell the story that was a great thing for us even when life is extorted it may be given nobly with ceremony and courtesy so strong was stevensons admiration for heroic graces like these that in the requiem that appears in his poems he speaks of an ordinary death as of a hearty exploit and draws his figures from lives of adventure and toil under the wide and starry sky dig the grave and let me lie glad did i live and gladly die and i laid me down with a will this be the verse you grave for me here he lies where he longed to be home is the sailor home from the sea and the hunter home from the hill this man should surely have been honoured with the pomp and colour and music of a soldiers funeral the most remarkable feature of the work he has left is its singular combination of style and romance it has so happened and the accident has gained almost the strength of a tradition that the most assiduous followers of romance have been careless stylists they have trusted to the efficacy of their situation and incident and have too often cared little about the manner of its presentation by an odd piece of irony style has been left to the cultivation of those who have little or nothing to tell sir walter scott himself with all his splendid romantic and tragic gifts often in stevensons perfectly just phrase fobs us off with languid and inarticulate twaddle he wrote carelessly and genially and then breakfasted and began the business of the day but stevenson who had romance tingling in every vein of his body set himself laboriously and patiently to train his other faculty the faculty of style i style let no one say that reading and writing comes by nature unless he is prepared to be classed with the foolish burgess who said it first a poet is born not made so is every man but he is born raw stevensons life was a grave devotion to the education of himself in the art of writing the lyf so short the craft so long to lerne thassay so hard so sharp the conquering those who deny the necessity or decry the utility of such an education are generally deficient in a sense of what makes good literature they are worddeaf as others are colourblind all writing is a kind of wordweaving a skilful writer will make a splendid tissue out of the diverse fibres of words but to care for words to select them judiciously and lovingly is not in the least essential to all writing all speaking for the sad fact is this that most of us do our thinking our writing and our speaking in phrases not in words the work of a feeble writer is always a patchwork of phrases some of them borrowed from the imperial texture of shakespeare and milton others picked up from the rags in the street we make our very kettleholders of pieces of a kings carpet how many overworn quotations from shakespeare suddenly leap into meaning and brightness when they are seen in their context the cry is still they come more honoured in the breach than the observance the sight of these phrases in the splendour of their dramatic context in macbeth and hamlet casts shame upon their daily degraded employments but the man of affairs has neither the time to fashion his speech nor the knowledge to choose his words so he borrows his sentences ready made and applies them in rough haste to purposes that they do not exactly fit such a man inevitably repeats like the cuckoo monotonous catchwords and lays his eggs of thought in the material that has been woven into consistency by others it is a matter of natural taste developed and strengthened by continual practice to avoid being the unwitting slave of phrases the artist in words on the other hand although he is a lover of fine phrases in his wordweaving experiments uses no shoddy but cultivates his senses of touch and sight until he can combine the raw fibres in novel and bewitching patterns to this end he must have two things a fine sense in the first place of the sound value meaning and associations of individual words and next a sense of harmony proportion and effect in their combination it is amazing what nobility a mere truism is often found to possess when it is clad with a garment thus woven stevenson had both these sensitive capabilities in a very high decree his careful choice of epithet and name have even been criticised as lending to some of his narrativewriting an excessive air of deliberation his daintiness of diction is best seen in his earlier work thereafter his writing became more vigorous and direct fitter for its later uses but never unillumined by felicities that cause a thrill of pleasure to the reader of the value of words he had the acutest appreciation virginibus puerisque his first book of essays is crowded with happy hits and subtle implications conveyed in a single word we have all heard he says in one of these of cities in south america built upon the side of fiery mountains and how even in this tremendous neighbourhood the inhabitants are not a jot more impressed by the solemnity of mortal conditions than if they were delving gardens in the greenest corner of england you can feel the ground shake and see the volcano tower above you at that word tremendous neighbourhood something of the same double reference to the original and acquired meanings of a word is to be found in such a phrase as sedate electrician for one who in a back office wields all the lights of a city or in that description of one drawing near to death who is spoken of as groping already with his hands on the face of the impassable the likeness of this last word to a very different word impassive is made to do good literary service in suggesting the sphinxlike image of death sometimes as here this subtle sense of double meanings almost leads to punning in across the plains stevenson narrates how a bet was transacted at a railwaystation and subsequently he supposes liquidated at the bar this is perhaps an instance of the excess of a virtue but it is an excess to be found plentifully in the works of milton his loving regard for words bears good fruit in his later and more stirring works he has a quick ear and appreciation for live phrases on the lips of tramps beachcombers or americans in the beach of falesa the seacaptain who introduces the new trader to the south pacific island where the scene of the story is laid gives a brief description of the fate of the last dealer in copra it may serve as a single illustration of volumes of racy humorous and imaginative slang do you catch a bit of white there to the eastard the captain continued thats your house when old adams saw it he took and shook me by the hand ive dropped into a soft thing here says he so you have says i poor johnny i never saw him again but the once and the next time we came round there he was dead and buried i took and put up a bit of stick to him john adams obit eighteen and sixtyeight go thou and do likewise i missed that man i never could see much harm in johnny what did he die of i inquired some kind of sickness says the captain it appears it took him sudden seems he got up in the night and filled up on pain killer and kennedys discovery no go he was booked beyond kennedy then he had tried to open a case of gin no go again not strong enough poor john there is a world of abrupt homely talk like this to be found in the speech of captain nares and of jim pinkerton in the wrecker and a wealth of scottish dialect similar in effect in kidnapped catriona and many other stories it was a delicate ear and a sense trained by practice that picked up these vivid turns of speech some of them perhaps heard only once and a mind given to dwell on words that remembered them for years and brought them out when occasion arose but the praise of stevensons style cannot be exhausted in a description of his use of individual words or his memory of individual phrases his mastery of syntax the orderly and emphatic arrangement of words in sentences a branch of art so seldom mastered was even greater and here he could owe no great debt to his romantic predecessors in prose dumas it is true is a master of narrative but he wrote in french and a style will hardly bear expatriation scotts sentences are many of them shambling knockkneed giants stevenson harked further back for his models and fed his style on the most vigorous of the prose writers of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries the golden age of english prose what english those fellows wrote says fitzgerald in one of his letters i cannot read the modern mechanique after them and he quotes a passage from harringtons oceana this freeborn nation lives not upon the dole or bounty of one man but distributing her annual magistracies and honours with her own hand is herself king people it was from writers of harringtons time and later that stevenson learned something of his craft bunyan and defoe should be particularly mentioned and that later excellent worthy captain charles johnson who compiled the evermemorable lives of pirates and highwaymen mr george meredith is the chief of those very few modern writers whose influence may be detected in his style however it was made and whencesoever the material or suggestion borrowed he came by a very admirable instrument for the telling of stories those touches of archaism that are so frequent with him the slightly unusual phrasing or unexpected inversion of the order of words show a mind alert in its expression and give the sting of novelty even to the commonplaces of narrative or conversation a nimble literary tact will work its will on the phrases of current smalltalk remoulding them nearer to the hearts desire transforming them to its own stamp this was what stevenson did and the very conversations that pass between his characters have an air of distinction that is all his own his books are full of brilliant talk talk real and convincing enough in its purport and setting but purged of the languors and fatuities of actual commonplace conversation it is an enjoyment like that to be obtained from a brilliant exhibition of fencing clean and dexterous to assist at the talking bouts of david balfour and miss grant captain nares and mr dodd alexander mackellar and the master of ballantrae prince otto and sir john crabtree or those wholly admirable pieces of special pleading to be found in a lodging for the night and the sire de maletroits door but people do not talk like this in actual life tis true tis pity and pity tis tis true they do not in actual life conversation is generally so smeared and blurred with stupidities so invaded and dominated by the spirit of dulness so liable to swoon into meaninglessness that to turn to stevensons books is like an escape into mountain air from the stagnant vapours of a morass the exact reproduction of conversation as it occurs in life can only be undertaken by one whose natural dulness feels itself incommoded by wit and fancy as by a grit in the eye conversation is often no more than a nervous habit of body like twiddling the thumbs and to record each particular remark is as much as to describe each particular twiddle or in its more intellectual uses when speech is employed for instance to conceal our thoughts how often is it a world too wide for the shrunken nudity of the thought it is meant to veil and thrown over it formless flabby and black like a tarpaulin it is pleasant to see thought and feeling dressed for once in the trim bright raiment stevenson devises for them there is an indescribable air of distinction which is and is not one and the same thing with style breathing from all his works even when he is least inspired his bearing and gait could never be mistaken for another mans all that he writes is removed by the width of the spheres from the possibility of commonplace and he avoids most of the snares and pitfalls of genius with noble and unconscious skill if he ever fell into one of these which may perhaps be doubted it was through too implicit a confidence in the powers of style his open letter to the rev dr hyde in vindication of father damien is perhaps his only literary mistake it is a matchless piece of scorn and invective not inferior in skill to anything he ever wrote but that it was well done is no proof that it should have been done at all i remember uzzah and am afraid said the wise erasmus when he was urged to undertake the defence of holy church it is not every one who is permitted to support the ark of the covenant and the only disquietude suggested by stevensons letter is a doubt whether he really has a claim to be father damiens defender whether father damien had need of the assistance of a literary freelance the saint who was bitten in the hand by a serpent shook it off into the fire and stood unharmed as it was in the mediterranean so it was also in the pacific and there is something officious in the intrusion of a spectator something irrelevant in the plentiful pronouns of the first person singular to be found sprinkled over stevensons letter the curse spoken in eden upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life surely covered by anticipation the case of the rev dr hyde ii romance the faculty of romance the greatest of the gifts showered on stevensons cradle by the fairies will suffer no course of development the most that can be done with it is to preserve it on from childhood unblemished and undiminished it is of a piece with stevensons romantic ability that his own childhood never ended he could pass back into that airy world without an effort in his stories his imagination worked on the old lines but it became conscious of its working and the highest note of these stories is not drama nor character but romance in one of his essays he defines the highest achievement of romance to be the embodiment of character thought or emotion in some act or attitude that shall be remarkably striking to the minds eye his essay on victor hugo shows how keenly conscious he was that narrative romance can catch and embody emotions and effects that are for ever out of the reach of the drama proper and of the essay or homily just as they are out of the reach of sculpture and painting now it is precisely in these effects that the chief excellence of romance resides it was the discovery of a world of these effects insusceptible of treatment by the drama neglected entirely by the characternovel which constituted the romantic revival of the end of last century the artistic result of a romance says stevenson what is left upon the memory by any powerful and artistic novel is something so complicated and refined that it is difficult to put a name upon it and yet something as simple as nature the fact is that art is working far ahead of language as well as of science realizing for us by all manner of suggestions and exaggerations effects for which as yet we have no direct name for the reason that these effects do not enter very largely into the necessities of life hence alone is that suspicion of vagueness that often hangs about the purpose of a romance it is clear enough to us in thought but we are not used to consider anything clear until we are able to formulate it in words and analytical language has not been sufficiently shaped to that end he goes on to point out that there is an epical value about every great romance an underlying idea not presentable always in abstract or critical terms in the stories of such masters of pure romance as victor hugo and nathaniel hawthorne the progress of romance in the present century has consisted chiefly in the discovery of new exercises of imagination and new subtle effects in story fielding as stevenson says did not understand that the nature of a landscape or the spirit of the times could count for anything in a story all his actions consist of a few simple personal elements with scott vague influences that qualify a mans personality begin to make a large claim the individual characters begin to occupy a comparatively small proportion of that canvas on which armies manoeuvre and great hills pile themselves upon each others shoulders and the achievements of the great masters since scott hugo dumas hawthorne to name only those in stevensons direct line of ancestry have added new realms to the domain of romance what are the indescribable effects that romance casting far beyond problems of character and conduct seeks to realise what is the nature of the great informing underlying idea that animates a truly great romance the bride of lammermoor monte cristo les miserables the scarlet letter the master of ballantrae these questions can only be answered by deforming the impression given by each of these works to present it in the choplogic language of philosophy but an approach to an answer may be made by illustration in his american notebooks nathaniel hawthorne used to jot down subjects for stories as they struck him his successive entries are like the souls of stories awaiting embodiment which many of them never received they bring us very near to the workings of the mind of a great master here are some of them a sketch to be given of a modern reformer a type of the extreme doctrines on the subject of slaves cold water and the like he goes about the streets haranguing most eloquently and is on the point of making many converts when his labours are suddenly interrupted by the appearance of the keeper of a madhouse whence he has escaped much may be made of this idea the scene of a story or sketch to be laid within the light of a street lantern the time when the lamp is near going out and the catastrophe to be simultaneous with the last flickering gleam a person to be writing a tale and to find it shapes itself against his intentions that the characters act otherwise than he thought and a catastrophe comes which he strives in vain to avert it might shadow forth his own fate he having made himself one of the personages two persons to be expecting some occurrence and watching for the two principal actors in it and to find that the occurrence is even then passing and that they themselves are the two actors a satire on ambition and fame from a statue of snow hawthorne used this idea in one of his sketches a moral philosopher to buy a slave or otherwise get possession of a human being and to use him for the sake of experiment by trying the operation of a certain vice on him m bourget the french romancer has made use of this idea in his novel called le disciple only it is not a slave but a young girl whom he pretends to love that is the subject of the moral philosophers experiment and a noisy war has been waged round the book in france hawthorne would plainly have seized the romantic essence of the idea and would have avoided the boneyard of problem morality a story the principal personage of which shall seem always on the point of entering on the scene but shall never appear this is the device that gives fascination to the figures of richelieu in marion delorme and of captain flint in treasure island the majesty of death to be exemplified in a beggar who after being seen humble and cringing in the streets of a city for many years at length by some means or other gets admittance into a rich mans mansion and there dies assuming state and striking awe into the breasts of those who had looked down upon him these are all excellent instances of the sort of idea that gives life to a romance of acts or attitudes that stamp themselves upon the minds eye some of them appeal chiefly to the minds eye others are of value chiefly as symbols but for the most part the romantic kernel of a story is neither pure picture nor pure allegory it can neither be painted nor moralised it makes its most irresistible appeal neither to the eye that searches for form and colour nor to the reason that seeks for abstract truth but to the blood to all that dim instinct of danger mystery and sympathy in things that is mans oldest inheritance to the superstitions of the heart romance vindicates the supernatural against science and rescues it from the palsied tutelage of morality stevensons work is a gallery of romantic effects that haunt the memory some of these are directly pictorial the fight in the roundhouse on board the brig covenant the duel between the two brothers of ballantrae in the island of light thrown up by the candles from that abyss of windless night the flight of the princess seraphina through the dark mazes of the wood all these although they carry with them subtleties beyond the painters art yet have something of picture in them but others make entrance to the corridors of the mind by blind and secret ways and there awaken the echoes of primaeval fear the cry of the parrot pieces of eight the tapping of the stick of the blind pirate pew as he draws near the innparlour and the similar effects of inexplicable terror wrought by the introduction of the blind catechist in kidnapped and of the disguise of a blind leper in the black arrow are beyond the reach of any but the literary form of romantic art the last appearance of pew in the play of admiral guinea written in collaboration with mr w e henley is perhaps the masterpiece of all the scenes of terror the blind ruffians scream of panic fear when he puts his groping hand into the burning flame of the candle in the room where he believed that he was unseen and so realises that his every movement is being silently watched is indeed the horrors come alive the animating principle or idea of stevensons longer stories is never to be found in their plot which is generally built carelessly and disjointedly enough around the central romantic situation or conception the main situation in the wrecker is a splendid product of romantic aspiration but the structure of the story is incoherent and ineffective so that some of the best passages in the book the scenes in paris for instance have no business there at all the story in kidnapped and catriona wanders on in a single thread like the pageant of a dream and the reader feels and sympathises with the authors obvious difficulty in leading it back to the scene of the trial and execution of james stewart the master of ballantrae is stamped with a magnificent unity of conception but the story illuminates that conception by a series of scattered episodes that lurid embodiment of fascinating evil part vampire part mephistopheles whose grand manner and heroic abilities might have made him a great and good man but for the malady of not wanting is the light and meaning of the whole book innocent and benevolent lives are thrown in his way that he may mock or distort or shatter them stevenson never came nearer than in this character to the sublime of power but an informing principle of unity is more readily to be apprehended in the shorter stories and it is a unity not so much of plot as of impression and atmosphere his islands whether situated in the pacific or off the coast of scotland have each of them a climate of its own and the character of the place seems to impose itself on the incidents that occur dictating subordination or contrast the events that happen within the limits of one of these magic isles could in every case be cut off from the rest of the story and framed as a separate work of art the long starvation of david balfour on the island of earraid the sharks of crime and monsters of blasphemy that break the peace of the shining tropical lagoons in treasure island and the ebb tide the captivity on the bass rock in catriona the supernatural terrors that hover and mutter over the island of the merry men these imaginations are plainly generated by the scenery against which they are thrown each is in some sort the genius of the place it inhabits in his search for the treasures of romance stevenson adventured freely enough into the realm of the supernatural when he is handling the superstitions of the scottish people he allows his humorous enjoyment of their extravagance to peep out from behind the solemn dialect in which they are dressed the brief tale of thrawn janet and black andys story of tod lapraik in catriona are grotesque imaginations of the school of tam o shanter rather than of the school of shakespeare who deals in no comedy ghosts they are turniplanterns swayed by a laughing urchin proud of the fears he can awaken even the strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde and the story of the bottle imp are manufactured bogeys that work on the nerves and not on the heart whatever may be said by those who insist on seeing allegory in what is only dreamfantasy the supernatural must be rooted deeper than these in life and experience if it is to reach an imposing stature the true ghost is the shadow of a man and stevenson shows a sense of this in two of his very finest stories the exquisite idyll of will o the mill and the grim history of markheim each of these stories is the work of a poet by no means of a goblinfancier the personification of death is as old as poetry it is wrought with moving gentleness in that last scene in the arbour of wills inn the wafted scent of the heliotropes which had never been planted in the garden since marjorys death the light in the room that had been hers prelude the arrival at the gate of the strangers carriage with the black pine tops standing above it like plumes and will o the mill makes the acquaintance of his physician and friend and goes at last upon his travels in the other story markheim meets with his own double in the house of the dealer in curiosities whom he has murdered it is not such a double as rossetti prayed for to the god of sleep ah might i by thy good grace groping in the windy stair darkness and the breath of space like loud waters everywhere meeting mine own image there face to face send it from that place to her but a cleareyed critic of the murderer not unfriendly who lays bare before him his motives and history at the close of that wonderful conversation one of the most brilliant of its authors achievements markheim gives himself into the hands of the police these two stories when compared with the others serve to show how stevensons imagination quickened and strengthened when it played full upon life for his best romantic effects like all great romance are illuminative of life and no mere idle games iii morality his genius like the genius of nathaniel hawthorne was doubly rich in the spirit of romance and in a wise and beautiful morality but the irresponsible caprices of his narrative fancy prevented his tales from being the appropriate vehicles of his morality he has left no work unless the two short stories mentioned above be regarded as exceptions in which romance and morality are welded into a single perfect whole nothing that can be put beside the scarlet letter or the marble faun for deep insight and magic fancy joined in one hence his essays containing as they do the gist of his reflective wisdom are ranked by some critics above his stories a novel cannot of course be moral as an action is moral there is no question in art of police regulations or conformity to established codes but rather of insight both deep and wide polygamy and monogamy suttee thuggism and cannibalism are all acceptable to the romancer whose business is with the heart of a man in all times and places he is not bound to display allegiance to particular moral laws of the kind that can be broken he is bound to show his consciousness of that wider moral order which can no more be broken by crime than the law of gravitation can be broken by the fall of china the morality without which life would be impossible the relations namely of human beings to each other the feelings habits and thoughts that are the web of society for the appreciation of morality in this wider sense high gifts of imagination are necessary shakespeare could never have drawn macbeth and thereby made apparent the awfulness of murder without some sympathy for the murderer the sympathy of intelligence these gifts of imagination and sympathy belong to stevenson in a very high degree in all his romances there are gleams from time to time of wise and subtle reflection upon life from the eternal side of things which shine the more luminously that they spring from the events and situations with no suspicion of homily in the black arrow dick shelton begs from the duke of gloucester the life of the old shipmaster arblaster whose ship he had taken and accidentally wrecked earlier in the story the duke of gloucester who in his own words loves not mercy nor mercy mongers yields the favour reluctantly then dick turns to arblaster come said dick a life is a life old shrew and it is more than ships or liquor say you forgive me for if your life is worth nothing to you it hath cost me the beginnings of my fortune come i have paid for it dearly be not so churlish an i had my ship said arblaster i would a been forth and safe on the high seas i and my man tom but ye took my ship gossip and im a beggar and for my man tom a knave fellow in russet shot him down murrain quoth he and spake never again murrain was the last of his words and the poor spirit of him passed a will never sail no more will my tom dick was seized with unavailing penitence and pity he sought to take the skippers hand but arblaster avoided his touch nay said he let be y have played the devil with me and let that content you the words died in richards throat he saw through tears the poor old man bemused with liquor and sorrow go shambling away with bowed head across the snow and the unnoticed dog whimpering at his heels and for the first time began to understand the desperate game that we play in life and how a thing once done is not to be changed or remedied by any penitence a similar wisdom that goes to the heart of things is found on the lips of the spiritual visitant in markheim murder is to me no special category replied the other all sins are murder even as all life is war i behold your race like starving mariners on a raft plucking crusts out of the hands of famine and feeding on each others lives i follow sins beyond the moment of their acting i find in all that the last consequence is death and to my eyes the pretty maid who thwarts her mother with such taking graces on a question of a ball drips no less visibly with human gore than such a murderer as yourself the wide outlook on humanity that expresses itself in passages like these is combined in stevenson with a vivid interest in and quick appreciation of character the variety of the characters that he has essayed to draw is enormous and his successes for the purposes of his stories are many yet with all this the number of lifelike portraits true to a hair that are to be found in his works is very small indeed in the golden glow of romance character is always subject to be idealised it is the effect of character seen at particular angles and in special lights natural or artificial that stevenson paints he does not attempt to analyse the complexity of its elements but boldly projects into it certain principles and works from those it has often been said of scott that he could not draw a lady who was young and beautiful the glamour of chivalry blinded him he lowered his eyes and described his emotions and aspirations something of the same disability afflicted stevenson in the presence of a ruffian he loved heroic vice only less than he loved heroic virtue and was always ready to idealise his villains to make of them men who like the master of ballantrae lived for an idea even the low and lesser villainy of israel hands in the great scene where he climbs the mast to murder the hero of treasure island breathes out its soul in a creed for thirty years he said ive sailed the seas and seen good and bad better and worse provisions running out knives going and what not well now i tell you i never seen good come o goodness yet him as strikes first is my fancy dead men dont bite thems my views amen so be it john silver that memorable pirate with a face like a ham and an eye like a fragment of glass stuck into it leads a career of wholehearted crime that can only be described as sparkling his unalloyed maleficence is adorned with a thousand graces of manner into the dark and fetid marsh that is an evil heart where low forms of sentiency are hardly distinguishable from the all pervading mud stevenson never peered unless it were in the study of huish in the ebb tide of his women let women speak they are traditionally accredited with an intuition of one anothers hearts although why if woman was created for man as the scriptures assure us the impression that she makes on him should not count for as much as the impression she makes on some other woman is a question that cries for solution perhaps the answer is that disinterested curiosity which is one means of approach to the knowledge of character although only one is a rare attitude for man to assume towards the other sex stevensons curiosity was late in awaking the heroine of the black arrow is dressed in boys clothes throughout the course of the story and the novelist thus saved the trouble of describing the demeanour of a girl mrs henry in the master of ballantrae is a charming veiled figure drawn in the shadow miss barbara grant and catriona in the continuation of kidnapped are real enough to have made many suitors for their respective hands among male readers of the book but that is nothing reply the critics of the other party a walking doll will find suitors the question must stand over until some definite principles of criticism have been discovered to guide us among these perilous passes one character must never be passed over in an estimate of stevensons work the hero of his longest work is not david balfour in whom the pawky lowland lad proud and precise but a very pretty gentleman is transfigured at times by traits that he catches as narrator of the story from its author himself but alan breek stewart is a greater creation and a fine instance of that wider morality that can seize by sympathy the soul of a wild highland clansman impetuous insolent unquenchable a condoner of murder for them that havenae dipped their hands in any little difficulty should be very mindful of the case of them that have a confirmed gambler as quarrelsome as a turkeycock and as vain and sensitive as a child alan breek is one of the most lovable characters in all literature and his penetration a great part of which he learned to take his own account of it by driving cattle through a throng lowland country with the black soldiers at his tail blossoms into the most delightful reflections upon men and things the highest ambitions of a novelist are not easily attainable to combine incident character and romance in a uniform whole to alternate telling dramatic situation with effects of poetry and suggestion to breathe into the entire conception a profound wisdom construct it with absolute unity and express it in perfect style this thing has never yet been done a great part of stevensons subtle wisdom of life finds its readiest outlet in his essays in these whatever their occasion he shows himself the clearesteyed critic of human life never the dupe of the phrases and pretences the theories and conventions that distort the vision of most writers and thinkers he has an unerring instinct for realities and brushes aside all else with rapid grace in his lately published amateur emigrant he describes one of his fellow passengers to america in truth it was not whisky that had ruined him he was ruined long before for all good human purposes but conversation his eyes were sealed by a cheap schoolbook materialism he could see nothing in the world but money and steam engines he did not know what you meant by the word happiness he had forgotten the simple emotions of childhood and perhaps never encountered the delights of youth he believed in production that useful figment of economy as if it had been real like laughter and production without prejudice to liquor was his god and guide this sense of the realities of the world laughter happiness the simple emotions of childhood and others makes stevenson an admirable critic of those social pretences that ape the native qualities of the heart the criticism on organised philanthropy contained in the essay on beggars is not exhaustive it is expressed paradoxically but is it untrue we should wipe two words from our vocabulary gratitude and charity in real life help is given out of friendship or it is not valued it is received from the hand of friendship or it is resented we are all too proud to take a naked gift we must seem to pay it if in nothing else then with the delights of our society here then is the pitiful fix of the rich man here is that needles eye in which he stuck already in the days of christ and still sticks today firmer if possible than ever that he has the money and lacks the love which should make his money acceptable here and now just as of old in palestine he has the rich to dinner it is with the rich that he takes his pleasure and when his turn comes to be charitable he looks in vain for a recipient his friends are not poor they do not want the poor are not his friends they will not take to whom is he to give where to find note this phrase the deserving poor charity is what they call centralised offices are hired societies founded with secretaries paid or unpaid the hunt of the deserving poor goes merrily forward i think it will take a more than merely human secretary to disinter that character what a class that is to be in want from no fault of its own and yet greedily eager to receive from strangers and to be quite respectable and at the same time quite devoid of selfrespect and play the most delicate part of friendship and yet never be seen and wear the form of man and yet fly in the face of all the laws of human nature and all this in the hope of getting a bellygod burgess through a needles eye oh let him stick by all means and let his polity tumble in the dust and let his epitaph and all his literature of which my own works begin to form no inconsiderable part be abolished even from the history of man for a fool of this monstrosity of dulness there can be no salvation and the fool who looked for the elixir of life was an angel of reason to the fool who looks for the deserving poor an equal sense of the realities of life and death gives the force of a natural law to the pathos of old mortality that essay in which stevenson pays passionate tribute to the memory of his early friend who had gone to ruin with a kingly abandon like one who condescended but once ruined with the lights all out he fought as for a kingdom the whole description down to the marvellous quotation from bunyan that closes it is one of the sovereign passages of modern literature the pathos of it is pure and elemental like the rush of a cleansing wind or the onset of the legions commanded by the mighty mahmud allahbreathing lord that all the misbelieving and black horde of fears and sorrows that infest the soul scatters before him with his whirlwind sword lastly to bring to an end this imperfect review of the works of a writer who has left none greater behind him stevenson excels at what is perhaps the most delicate of literary tasks and the utmost test where it is successfully encountered of nobility the practice namely of selfrevelation and selfdelineation to talk much about oneself with detail composure and ease with no shadow of hypocrisy and no whiff or taint of indecent familiarity no puling and no posing the shores of the sea of literature are strewn with the wrecks and forlorn properties of those who have adventured on this dangerous attempt but a criticism of stevenson is happy in this that from the writer it can pass with perfect trust and perfect fluency to the man he shares with goldsmith and montaigne his own favourite the happy privilege of making lovers among his readers to be the most beloved of english writers what a title that is for a man says thackeray of goldsmith in such matters a dispute for preeminence in the captivation of hearts would be unseemly it is enough to say that stevenson too has his lovers among those who have accompanied him on his inland voyage or through the fastnesses of the cevennes in the wake of modestine he is loved by those that never saw his face and one who has sealed that dizzy height of ambition may well be content without the impertinent assurance that when the japanese have taken london and revised the contents of the british museum the yellow scribes whom they shall set to produce a new edition of the biographie universelle will include in their entries the following item stevenson r l a prolific writer of stories among the aborigines flourished before the coming of the japanese his works are lost
