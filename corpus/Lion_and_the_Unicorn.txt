 the lion and the unicorn by richard harding davis in memory of many hot days and some hot corners this book is dedicated to ltcol arthur h lee ra british military attache with the united states army contents the lion and the unicorn on the fever ship the man with one talent the vagrant the last ride together the lion and the unicorn prentiss had a long lease on the house and because it stood in jermyn street the upper floors were as a matter of course turned into lodgings for single gentlemen and because prentiss was a florist to the queen he placed a lion and unicorn over his flowershop just in front of the middle window on the first floor by stretching a little each of them could see into the window just beyond him and could hear all that was said inside and such things as they saw and heard during the reign of captain carrington who moved in at the same time they did by day the table in the centre of the room was covered with maps and the captain sat with a box of pins with differentcolored flags wrapped around them and amused himself by sticking them in the maps and measuring the spaces in between swearing meanwhile to himself it was a selfish amusement but it appeared to be the captains only intellectual pursuit for at night the maps were rolled up and a green cloth was spread across the table and there was much company and popping of sodabottles and little heaps of gold and silver were moved this way and that across the cloth the smoke drifted out of the open windows and the laughter of the captains guests rang out loudly in the empty street so that the policeman halted and raised his eyes reprovingly to the lighted windows and cabmen drew up beneath them and lay in wait dozing on their folded arms for the captains guests to depart the lion and the unicorn were rather ashamed of the scandal of it and they were glad when one day the captain went away with his tin boxes and guncases piled high on a fourwheeler prentiss stood on the sidewalk and said i wish you good luck sir and the captain said im coming back a major prentiss but he never came back and one day the lion remembered the day very well for on that same day the newsboys ran up and down jermyn street shouting out the news of a orrible disaster to the british arms it was then that a young lady came to the door in a hansom and prentiss went out to meet her and led her upstairs they heard him unlock the captains door and say this is his room miss and after he had gone they watched her standing quite still by the centre table she stood there for a very long time looking slowly about her and then she took a photograph of the captain from the frame on the mantel and slipped it into her pocket and when she went out again her veil was down and she was crying she must have given prentiss as much as a sovereign for he called her your ladyship which he never did under a sovereign and she drove off and they never saw her again either nor could they hear the address she gave the cabman but it was somewhere up st johns wood way after that the rooms were empty for some months and the lion and the unicorn were forced to amuse themselves with the beautiful ladies and smartlooking men who came to prentiss to buy flowers and buttonholes and the little round baskets of strawberries and even the peaches at three shillings each which looked so tempting as they lay in the window wrapped up in cottonwool like jewels of great price then philip carroll the american gentleman came and they heard prentiss telling him that those rooms had always let for five guineas a week which they knew was not true but they also knew that in the economy of nations there must always be a higher price for the rich american or else why was he given that strange accent except to betray him into the hands of the london shopkeeper and the london cabby the american walked to the window toward the west which was the window nearest the lion and looked out into the graveyard of st jamess church that stretched between their street and piccadilly youre lucky in having a bit of green to look out on he said to prentiss ill take these rooms at five guineas thats more than theyre worth you know but as i know it too your conscience neednt trouble you then his eyes fell on the lion and he nodded to him gravely how do you do he said im coming to live with you for a little time i have read about you and your friends over there it is a hazard of new fortunes with me your majesty so be kind to me and if i win i will put a new coat of paint on your shield and gild you all over again prentiss smiled obsequiously at the americans pleasantry but the new lodger only stared at him he seemed a social gentleman said the unicorn that night when the lion and he were talking it over now the captain the whole time he was here never gave us so much as a look this one says he has read of us and why not growled the lion i hope prentiss heard what he said of our needing a new layer of gilt its disgraceful you can see that lion over scarletts the butcher as far as regent street and scarlett is only one of salisburys creations he received his letterspatent only two years back we date from palmerston the lodger came up the street just at that moment and stopped and looked up at the lion and the unicorn from the sidewalk before he opened the door with his nightkey they heard him enter the room and feel on the mantel for his pipe and a moment later he appeared at the lions window and leaned on the sill looking down into the street below and blowing whiffs of smoke up into the warm nightair it was a night in june and the pavements were dry under foot and the streets were filled with welldressed people going home from the play and with groups of men in black and white making their way to supper at the clubs hansoms of inkyblack with shining lamps inside and out dashed noiselessly past on mysterious errands chasing close on each others heels on a mad race each to its separate goal from the cross streets rose the noises of early night the rumble of the buses the creaking of their brakes as they unlocked the cries of the extras and the merging of thousands of human voices in a dull murmur the great world of london was closing its shutters for the night and putting out the lights and the new lodger from across the sea listened to it with his heart beating quickly and laughed to stifle the touch of fear and homesickness that rose in him i have seen a great play tonight he said to the lion nobly played by great players what will they care for my poor wares i see that i have been overbold but we cannot go back now not yet he knocked the ashes out of his pipe and nodded goodnight to the great world beyond his window what fortunes lie with ye ye lights of london town he quoted smiling and they heard him close the door of his bedroom and lock it for the night the next morning he bought many geraniums from prentiss and placed them along the broad cornice that stretched across the front of the house over the shop window the flowers made a band of scarlet on either side of the lion as brilliant as a tommys jacket i am trying to propitiate the british lion by placing flowers before his altar the american said that morning to a visitor the british public you mean said the visitor they are each likely to tear you to pieces yes i have heard that the pit on the first night of a bad play is something awful hazarded the american wait and see said the visitor thank you said the american meekly every one who came to the first floor front talked about a play it seemed to be something of great moment to the american it was only a bundle of leaves printed in red and black inks and bound in brown paper covers there were two of them and the american called them by different names one was his comedy and one was his tragedy they are both likely to be tragedies the lion heard one of the visitors say to another as they drove away together our young friend takes it too seriously the american spent most of his time by his desk at the window writing on little blue pads and tearing up what he wrote or in reading over one of the plays to himself in a loud voice in time the number of his visitors increased and to some of these he would read his play and after they had left him he was either depressed and silent or excited and jubilant the lion could always tell when he was happy because then he would go to the side table and pour himself out a drink and say heres to me but when he was depressed he would stand holding the glass in his hand and finally pour the liquor back into the bottle again and say whats the use of that after he had been in london a month he wrote less and was more frequently abroad sallying forth in beautiful raiment and coming home by daylight and he gave suppers too but they were less noisy than the captains had been and the women who came to them were much more beautiful and their voices when they spoke were sweet and low sometimes one of the women sang and the men sat in silence while the people in the street below stopped to listen and would say why that is soandso singing and the lion and the unicorn wondered how they could know who it was when they could not see her the lodgers visitors came to see him at all hours they seemed to regard his rooms as a club where they could always come for a bite to eat or to write notes and others treated it like a lawyers office and asked advice on all manner of strange subjects sometimes the visitor wanted to know whether the american thought she ought to take l a week and go on tour or stay in town and try to live on l or whether she should paint landscapes that would not sell or racehorses that would or whether reggie really loved her and whether she really loved reggie or whether the new part in the piece at the court was better than the old part at terrys and wasnt she getting too old to play ingenues anyway the lodger seemed to be a general adviser and smoked and listened with grave consideration and the unicorn thought his judgment was most sympathetic and sensible of all the beautiful ladies who came to call on the lodger the one the unicorn liked the best was the one who wanted to know whether she loved reggie and whether reggie loved her she discussed this so interestingly while she consumed tea and thin slices of bread that the unicorn almost lost his balance in leaning forward to listen her name was marion cavendish and it was written over many photographs which stood in silver frames in the lodgers rooms she used to make the tea herself while the lodger sat and smoked and she had a fascinating way of doubling the thin slices of bread into long strips and nibbling at them like a mouse at a piece of cheese she had wonderful little teeth and cupidsbow lips and she had a fashion of lifting her veil only high enough for one to see the two cupidbow lips when she did that the american used to laugh at nothing apparently and say oh i guess reggie loves you well enough but do i love reggie she would ask sadly with her teacup held poised in air i am sure i hope not the lodger would reply and she would put down the veil quickly as one would drop a curtain over a beautiful picture and rise with great dignity and say if you talk like that i shall not come again she was sure that if she could only get some work to do her head would be filledwith more important matters than whether reggie loved her or not but the managers seem inclined to cut their cavendish very fine just at present she said if i dont get a part soon she announced i shall ask mitchell to put me down on the list for recitations at evening parties that seems a desperate revenge said the american and besides i dont want you to get a part because some one might be idiotic enough to take my comedy and if he should you must play nancy i would not ask for any salary if i could play nancy miss cavendish answered they spoke of a great many things but their talk always ended by her saying that there must be some one with sufficient sense to see that his play was a great play and by his saying that none but she must play nancy the lion preferred the tall girl with masses and folds of brown hair who came from america to paint miniatures of the british aristocracy her name was helen cabot and he liked her because she was so brave and fearless and so determined to be independent of every one even of the lodger especially of the lodger who it appeared had known her very well at home the lodger they gathered did not wish her to be independent of him and the two americans had many arguments and disputes about it but she always said it does no good philip it only hurts us both when you talk so i care for nothing and for no one but my art and poor as it is it means everything to me and you do not and of course the man i am to marry must then carroll would talk walking up and down and looking very fierce and determined and telling her how he loved her in such a way that it made her look even more proud and beautiful and she would say more gently it is very fine to think that any one can care for like that and very helpful but unless i cared in the same way it would be wicked of me to marry you and besides she would add very quickly to prevent his speaking again i dont want to marry you or anybody and i never shall i want to be free and to succeed in my work just as you want to succeed in your work so please never speak of this again when she went away the lodger used to sit smoking in the big armchair and beat the arms with his hands and he would pace up and down the room while his work would lie untouched and his engagements pass forgotten summer came and london was deserted dull and dusty but the lodger stayed on in jermyn street helen cabot had departed on a round of visits to country houses in scotland where as she wrote him she was painting miniatures of her hosts and studying the game of golf miss cavendish divided her days between the river and one of the west end theatres she was playing a small part in a farcecomedy one day she came up from cookham earlier than usual looking very beautiful in a white boating frock and a straw hat with a leander ribbon her hands and arms were hard with dragging a punting pole and she was sunburnt and happy and hungry for tea why dont you come down to cookham and get out of this heat miss cavendish asked you need it you look ill id like to but i cant said carroll the fact is i paid in advance for these rooms and if i lived anywhere else id be losing five guineas a week on them miss cavendish regarded him severely she had never quite mastered his american humor but five guineas why thats nothing to you she said something in the lodgers face made her pause you dont mean yes i do said the lodger smiling you see i started in to lay siege to london without sufficient ammunition london is a large town and it didnt fall as quickly as i thought it would so i am economizing mr lockharts coffee rooms and i are no longer strangers miss cavendish put down her cup of tea untasted and leaned toward him are you in earnest she asked for how long oh for the last month replied the lodger they are not at all bad clean and wholesome and all that but the suppers you gave us and this she cried suddenly waving her hands over the pretty teathings and the cake and muffins my friends at least said carroll need not go to lockharts and the savoy asked miss cavendish mournfully shaking her head a dream of the past said carroll waving his pipe through the smoke gattis yes on special occasions but for necessity the chancellors where one gets a piece of the prime roast beef of old england from chicago and potatoes for ninepence a pot of bitter twopencehalfpenny and a penny for the waiter its most amusing on the whole i am learning a little about london and some things about myself they are both most interesting subjects well i dont like it miss cavendish declared helplessly when i think of those suppers and the flowers i feel i feel like a robber dont begged carroll i am really the most happy of men that is as the chap says in the play i would be if i wasnt so damned miserable but i owe no man a penny and i have assets i have l to last me through the winter and two marvellous plays and i love next to yourself the most wonderful woman god ever made thats enough but i thought you made such a lot of money by writing asked miss cavendish i do that is i could answered carroll if i wrote the things that sell but i keep on writing plays that wont and such plays exclaimed marion warmly and to think that they are going begging she continued indignantly i cant imagine what the managers do want i know what they dont want said the american miss cavendish drummed impatiently on the teatray i wish you wouldnt be so abject about it she said if i were a man id make them take those plays how asked the american with a gun well id keep at it until they read them declared marion id sit on their front steps all night and id follow them in cabs and id lie in wait for them at the stagedoor id just make them take them carroll sighed and stared at the ceiling i guess ill give up and go home he said oh yes do run away before you are beaten said miss cavendish scornfully why you cant go now everybody will be back in town soon and there are a lot of new plays coming on and some of them are sure to be failures and thats our chance you rush in with your piece and somebody may take it sooner than close the theatre im thinking of closing the theatre myself said carroll whats the use of my hanging on here he exclaimed it distresses helen to know i am in london feeling about her as i do and the lord only knows how it distresses me and maybe if i went away he said consciously she might miss me she might see the difference miss cavendish held herself erect and pressed her lips together with a severe smile if helen cabot doesnt see the difference between you and the other men she knows now she said i doubt if she ever will besides she continued and then hesitated well go on urged carroll well i was only going to say she explained that leaving the girl alone never did the man any good unless he left her alone willingly if shes sure he still cares its just the same to her where he is he might as well stay on in london as go to south africa it wont help him any the difference comes when she finds he has stopped caring why look at reggie he tried that he went away for ever so long but he kept writing me from wherever he went so that he was perfectly miserable and i went on enjoying myself then when he came back he tried going about with his old friends again he used to come to the theatre with them oh with such nice girls but he always stood in the back of the box and yawned and scowled so i knew and anyway hed always spoil it all by leaving them and waiting at the stage entrance for me but one day he got tired of the way i treated him and went off on a bicycle tour with lady hackshers girls and some men from his regiment and he was gone three weeks and never sent me even a line and i got so scared i couldnt sleep and i stood it for three days more and then i wired him to come back or id jump off london bridge and he came back that very night from edinburgh on the express and i was so glad to see him that i got confused and in the general excitement i promised to marry him so thats how it was with us yes said the american without enthusiasm but then i still care and helen knows i care doesnt she ever fancy that you might care for some one else you have a lot of friends you know yes but she knows they are just that friends said the american miss cavendish stood up to go and arranged her veil before the mirror above the fireplace i come here very often to tea she said its very kind of you said carroll he was at the open window looking down into the street for a cab well no one knows i am engaged to reggie continued miss cavendish except you and reggie and he isnt so sure she doesnt know it well said carroll miss cavendish smiled a mischievous kindly smile at him from the mirror well she repeated mockingly carroll stared at her and laughed after a pause he said its like a plot in a comedy but im afraid im too serious for playacting yes it is serious said miss cavendish she seated herself again and regarded the american thoughtfully you are too good a man to be treated the way that girl is treating you and no one knows it better than she does shell change in time but just now she thinks she wants to be independent shes in love with this picturepainting idea and with the people she meets its all new to her the fuss they make over her and the titles and the way she is asked about we know she cant paint we know they only give her commissions because shes so young and pretty and american she amuses them thats all well that cannot last shell find it out shes too clever a girl and she is too fine a girl to be content with that long then then shell come back to you she feels now that she has both you and the others and shes making you wait so wait and be cheerful shes worth waiting for shes young thats all shell see the difference in time but in the meanwhile it would hurry matters a bit if she thought she had to choose between the new friends and you she could still keep her friends and marry me said carroll i have told her that a hundred times she could still paint miniatures and marry me but she wont marry me she wont marry you because she knows she can whenever she wants to cried marion cant you see that but if she thought you were going to marry some one else now she would be the first to congratulate me said carroll he rose and walked to the fireplace where he leaned with his arm on the mantel there was a photograph of helen cabot near his hand and he turned this toward him and stood for some time staring at it my dear marion he said at last ive known helen ever since she was as young as that every year ive loved her more and found new things in her to care for now i love her more than any other man ever loved any other woman miss cavendish shook her head sympathetically yes i know she said thats the way reggie loves me too carroll went on as though he had not heard her theres a bench in st jamess park he said where we used to sit when she first came here when she didnt know so many people we used to go there in the morning and throw penny buns to the ducks thats been my amusement this summer since youve all been away sitting on that bench feeding penny buns to the silly ducks especially the black one the one she used to like best and i make pilgrimages to all the other places we ever visited together and try to pretend she is with me and i support the crossing sweeper at lansdowne passage because she once said she felt sorry for him i do all the other absurd things that a man in love tortures himself by doing but to what end she knows how i care and yet she wont see why we cant go on being friends as we once were whats the use of it all she is young i tell you repeated miss cavendish and shes too sure of you youve told her you care now try making her think you dont care carroll shook his head impatiently i will not stoop to such tricks and pretence marion he cried impatiently all i have is my love for her if i have to cheat and to trap her into caring the whole thing would be degraded miss cavendish shrugged her shoulders and walked to the door such amateurs she exclaimed and banged the door after her carroll never quite knew how he had come to make a confidante of miss cavendish helen and he had met her when they first arrived in london and as she had acted for a season in the united states she adopted the two americans and told helen where to go for boots and hats and advised carroll about placing his plays helen soon made other friends and deserted the artists with whom her work had first thrown her she seemed to prefer the society of the people who bought her paintings and who admired and made much of the painter as she was very beautiful and at an age when she enjoyed everything in life keenly and eagerly to give her pleasure was in itself a distinct pleasure and the worldly tired people she met were considering their own entertainment quite as much as hers when they asked her to their dinners and dances or to spend a week with them in the country in her way she was as independent as was carroll in his and as she was not in love as he was her life was not narrowed down to but one ideal but she was not so young as to consider herself infallible and she had one excellent friend on whom she was dependent for advice and to whose directions she submitted implicitly this was lady gower the only person to whom helen had spoken of carroll and of his great feeling for her lady gower immediately after her marriage had been a conspicuous and brilliant figure in that set in london which works eighteen hours a day to keep itself amused but after the death of her husband she had disappeared into the country as completely as though she had entered a convent and after several years had then reentered the world as a professional philanthropist her name was now associated entirely with womens leagues with committees that presented petitions to parliament and with public meetings at which she spoke with marvellous ease and effect her old friends said she had taken up this new pose as an outlet for her nervous energies and as an effort to forget the man who alone had made life serious to her others knew her as an earnest woman acting honestly for what she thought was right her success all admitted was due to her knowledge of the world and to her sense of humor which taught her with whom to use her wealth and position and when to demand what she wanted solely on the ground that the cause was just she had taken more than a fancy for helen and the position of the beautiful motherless girl had appealed to her as one filled with dangers when she grew to know helen better she recognized that these fears were quite unnecessary and as she saw more of her she learned to care for her deeply helen had told her much of carroll and of his double purpose in coming to london of his brilliant work and his lack of success in having it recognized and of his great and loyal devotion to her and of his lack of success not in having that recognized but in her own inability to return it helen was proud that she had been able to make carroll care for her as he did and that there was anything about her which could inspire a man whom she admired so much to believe in her so absolutely and for so long a time but what convinced her that the outcome for which he hoped was impossible was the very fact that she could admire him and see how fine and unselfish his love for her was and yet remain untouched by it she had been telling lady gower one day of the care he had taken of her ever since she was fourteen years of age and had quoted some of the friendly and loverlike acts he had performed in her service until one day they had both found out that his attitude of the elder brother was no longer possible and that he loved her in the old and only way lady gower looked at her rather doubtfully and smiled i wish you would bring him to see me helen she said i think i should like your friend very much from what you tell me of him i doubt if you will find many such men waiting for you in this country our men marry for reasons of property or they love blindly and are exacting and selfish before and after they are married i know because so many women came to me when my husband was alive to ask how it was that i continued so happy in my married life but i dont want to marry any one helen remonstrated gently american girls are not always thinking only of getting married what i meant was this said lady gower that in my experience i have heard of but few men who care in the way this young man seems to care for you you say you do not love him but if he had wanted to gain my interest he could not have pleaded his cause better than you have done he seems to see your faults and yet love you still in spite of them or on account of them and i like the things he does for you i like for instance his sending you the book of the moment every week for two years that shows a most unswerving spirit of devotion and the story of the broken bridge in the woods is a wonderful story if i were a young girl i could love a man for that alone it was a beautiful thing to do helen sat with her chin on her hands deeply considering this new point of view i thought it very foolish of him she confessed questioningly to take such a risk for such a little thing lady gower smiled down at her from the height of her many years wait she said dryly you are very young now and very rich every one is crowding to give you pleasure to show his admiration you are a very fortunate girl but later these things which some man has done because he loved you and which you call foolish will grow large in your life and shine out strongly and when you are discouraged and alone you will take them out and the memory of them will make you proud and happy they are the honors which women wear in secret helen came back to town in september and for the first few days was so occupied in refurnishing her studio and in visiting the shops that she neglected to send carroll word of her return when she found that a whole week had passed without her having made any effort to see him and appreciated how the fact would hurt her friend she was filled with remorse and drove at once in great haste to jermyn street to announce her return in person on the way she decided that she would soften the blow of her week of neglect by asking him to take her out to luncheon this privilege she had once or twice accorded him and she felt that the pleasure these excursions gave carroll were worth the consternation they caused to lady gower the servant was uncertain whether mr carroll was at home or not but helen was too intent upon making restitution to wait for the fact to be determined and running up the stairs knocked sharply at the door of his study a voice bade her come in and she entered radiant and smiling her welcome but carroll was not there to receive it and instead marion cavendish looked up at her from his desk where she was busily writing helen paused with a surprised laugh but marion sprang up and hailed her gladly they met half way across the room and kissed each other with the most friendly feeling philip was out marion said and she had just stepped in for a moment to write him a note if helen would excuse her she would finish it as she was late for rehearsal but she asked over her shoulder with great interest if helen had passed a pleasant summer she thought she had never seen her looking so well helen thought miss cavendish herself was looking very well also but marion said no that she was too sunburnt she would not be able to wear a dinnerdress for a month there was a pause while marions quill scratched violently across carrolls notepaper helen felt that in some way she was being treated as an intruder or worse as a guest she did not sit down it seemed impossible to do so but she moved uncertainly about the room she noted that there were many changes it seemed more bare and empty her picture was still on the writingdesk but there were at least six new photographs of marion marion herself had brought them to the room that morning and had carefully arranged them in conspicuous places but helen could not know that she thought there was an unnecessary amount of writing scribbled over the face of each marion addressed her letter and wrote immediate across the envelope and placed it before the clock on the mantelshelf you will find philip looking very badly she said as she pulled on her gloves he has been in town all summer working very hard he has had no holiday at all i dont think hes well i have been a great deal worried about him she added her face was bent over the buttons of her glove and when she raised her blue eyes to helen they were filled with serious concern really helen stammered i i didnt know in his letters he seemed very cheerful marion shook her head and turned and stood looking thoughtfully out of the window hes in a very hard place she began abruptly and then stopped as though she had thought better of what she intended to say helen tried to ask her to go on but could not bring herself to do so she wanted to get away i tell him he ought to leave london marion began again he needs a change and a rest i should think he might helen agreed after three months of this heat he wrote me he intended going to herne bay or over to ostend yes he had meant to go marion answered she spoke with the air of one who possessed the most intimate knowledge of carrolls movements and plans and change of plans but he couldnt she added he couldnt afford it helen she said turning to the other girl dramatically do you know i believe that philip is very poor miss cabot exclaimed incredulously poor she laughed why what do you mean i mean that he has no money marion answered sharply these rooms represent nothing he only keeps them on because he paid for them in advance hes been living on three shillings a day thats poor for him he takes his meals at cabmens shelters and at lockharts and hes been doing so for a month helen recalled with a guilty thrill the receipt of certain boxes of la france roses cut long in the american fashion which had arrived within the last month at various country houses she felt indignant at herself and miserable her indignation was largely due to the recollection that she had given these flowers to her hostess to decorate the dinnertable she hated to ask this girl of things which she should have known better than any one else but she forced herself to do it she felt she must know certainly and at once how do you know this she asked are you sure there is no mistake he told me himself said marion when he talked of letting the plays go and returning to america he said he must go back that his money was gone he is gone to america helen said blankly no he wanted to go but i wouldnt let him marion went on i told him that some one might take his play any day and this third one he has written the one he finished this summer in town is the best of all i think its a lovestory its quite beautiful she turned and arranged her veil at the glass and as she did so her eyes fell on the photographs of herself scattered over the mantelpiece and she smiled slightly but helen did not see her she was sitting down now pulling at the books on the table she was confused and disturbed by emotions which were quite strange to her and when marion bade her goodby she hardly noticed her departure what impressed her most of all in what marion had told her was she was surprised to find that philip was going away that she herself had frequently urged him to do so for his own peace of mind seemed now of no consequence now that he seriously contemplated it she recognized that his absence meant to her a change in everything she felt for the first time the peculiar place he held in her life even if she had seen him but seldom the fact that he was within call had been more of a comfort and a necessity to her than she understood that he was poor concerned her chiefly because she knew that although this condition could only be but temporary it would distress him not to have his friends around him and to entertain them as he had been used to do she wondered eagerly if she might offer to help him but a second thought assured her that for a man that sort of help from a woman was impossible she resented the fact that marion was deep in his confidence that it was marion who had told her of his changed condition and of his plans it annoyed her so acutely that she could not remain in the room where she had seen her so complacently in possession and after leaving a brief note for philip she went away she stopped a hansom at the door and told the man to drive along the embankment she wanted to be quite alone and she felt she could see no one until she had thought it all out and had analyzed the new feelings so for several hours she drove slowly up and down sunk far back in the cushions of the cab and staring with unseeing eyes at the white enamelled tariff and the black dashboard she assured herself that she was not jealous of marion because in order to be jealous she first would have to care for philip in the very way she could not bring herself to do she decided that his interest in marion hurt her because it showed that philip was not capable of remaining true to the one ideal of his life she was sure that this explained her feelings she was disappointed that he had not kept up to his own standard that he was weak enough to turn aside from it for the first pretty pair of eyes but she was too honest and too just to accept that diagnosis of her feelings as final she knew there had been many pairs of eyes in america and in london and that though philip had seen them he had not answered them when they spoke no she confessed frankly she was hurt with herself for neglecting her old friend so selfishly and for so long a time his love gave him claims on her consideration at least and she had forgotten that and him and had run after strange gods and allowed others to come in and take her place and to give him the sympathy and help which she should have been the first to offer and which would have counted more when coming from her than from any one else she determined to make amends at once for her thoughtlessness and selfishness and her brain was pleasantly occupied with plans and acts of kindness it was a new entertainment and she found she delighted in it she directed the cabman to go to solomonss and from there sent philip a bunch of flowers and a line saying that on the following day she was coming to take tea with him she had a guilty feeling that he might consider her friendly advances more seriously than she meant them but it was her pleasure to be reckless her feelings were running riotously and the sensation was so new that she refused to be circumspect or to consider consequences who could tell she asked herself with a quick frightened gasp but that after all it might be that she was learning to care from solomonss she bade the man drive to the shop in cranbourne street where she was accustomed to purchase the materials she used in painting and fate which uses strange agents to work out its ends so directed it that the cabman stopped a few doors below this shop and opposite one where jewelry and other personal effects were bought and sold at any other time or had she been in any other mood what followed might not have occurred but fate in the person of the cabman arranged it so that the hour and the opportunity came together there were some old mezzotints in the window of the loan shop a string of coins and medals a row of new french posters and far down to the front a tray filled with gold and silver cigarettecases and watches and rings it occurred to helen who was still bent on making restitution for her neglect that a cigarettecase would be more appropriate for a man than flowers and more lasting and she scanned the contents of the window with the eye of one who now saw in everything only something which might give philip pleasure the two objects of value in the tray upon which her eyes first fell were the gold sealring with which philip had sealed his letters to her and lying next to it his gold watch there was something almost human in the way the ring and watch spoke to her from the past in the way they appealed to her to rescue them from the surroundings to which they had been abandoned she did not know what she meant to do with them nor how she could return them to philip but there was no question of doubt in her manner as she swept with a rush into the shop there was no attempt either at bargaining in the way in which she pointed out to the young woman behind the counter the particular ring and watch she wanted they had not been left as collateral the young woman said they had been sold outright then any one can buy them helen asked eagerly they are for sale to the public to any one the young woman made note of the customers eagerness but with an unmoved countenance yes miss they are for sale the ring is four pounds and the watch twentyfive twentynine pounds helen gasped that was more money than she had in the world but the fact did not distress her for she had a true artistic disregard for ready money and the absence of it had never disturbed her but now it assumed a sudden and alarming value she had ten pounds in her purse and ten pounds at her studio these were just enough to pay for a quarters rent and the rates and there was a hat and cloak in bond street which she certainly must have her only assets consisted of the possibility that some one might soon order a miniature and to her mind that was sufficient some one always had ordered a miniature and there was no reasonable doubt but that some one would do it again for a moment she questioned if it would not be sufficient if she bought the ring and allowed the watch to remain but she recognized that the ring meant more to her than the watch while the latter as an old heirloom which had been passed down to him from a greatgrandfather meant more to philip it was for philip she was doing this she reminded herself she stood holding his possessions one in each hand and looking at the young woman blankly she had no doubt in her mind that at least part of the money he had received for them had paid for the flowers he had sent to her in scotland the certainty of this left her no choice she laid the ring and watch down and pulled the only ring she possessed from her own finger it was a gift from lady gower she had no doubt that it was of great value can you lend me some money on that she asked it was the first time she had conducted a business transaction of this nature and she felt as though she were engaging in a burglary we dont lend money miss the girl said we buy outright i can give you twentyeight shillings for this she added twentyeight shillings helen gasped why it is worth oh ever so much more than that that is all it is worth to us the girl answered she regarded the ring indifferently and laid it away from her on the counter the action was final helens hands rose slowly to her breast where a pretty watch dangled from a bowknot of crushed diamonds it was her only possession and she was very fond of it it also was the gift of one of the several great ladies who had adopted her since her residence in london helen had painted a miniature of this particular great lady which had looked so beautiful that the pleasure which the original of the portrait derived from the thought that she still really looked as she did in the miniature was worth more to her than many diamonds but it was different with helen and no one could count what it cost her to tear away her one proud possession what will you give me for this she asked defiantly the girls eyes showed greater interest i can give you twenty pounds for that she said take it please helen begged as though she feared if she kept it a moment longer she might not be able to make the sacrifice that will be enough now she went on taking out her tenpound note she put lady gowers ring back upon her finger and picked up philips ring and watch with the pleasure of one who has come into a great fortune she turned back at the door oh she stammered in case any one should inquire you are not to say who bought these no miss certainly not said the woman helen gave the direction to the cabman and closing the doors of the hansom sat looking down at the watch and the ring as they lay in her lap the thought that they had been his most valued possessions which he had abandoned forever and that they were now entirely hers to do with as she liked filled her with most intense delight and pleasure she took up the heavy gold ring and placed it on the little finger of her left hand it was much too large and she removed it and balanced it for a moment doubtfully in the palm of her right hand she was smiling and her face was lit with shy and tender thoughts she cast a quick glance to the left and right as though fearful that people passing in the street would observe her and then slipped the ring over the fourth finger of her left hand she gazed at it with a guilty smile and then covering it hastily with her other hand leaned back clasping it closely and sat frowning far out before her with puzzled eyes to carroll all roads led past helens studio and during the summer while she had been absent in scotland it was one of his sad pleasures to make a pilgrimage to her street and to pause opposite the house and look up at the empty windows of her rooms it was during this daily exercise that he learned through the arrival of her luggage of her return to london and when day followed day without her having shown any desire to see him or to tell him of her return he denounced himself most bitterly as a fatuous fool at the end of the week he sat down and considered his case quite calmly for three years he had loved this girl deeply and tenderly he had been lover brother friend and guardian during that time even though she had accepted him in every capacity except as that of the prospective husband she had never given him any real affection nor sympathy nor help all she had done for him had been done without her knowledge or intent to know her to love her and to scheme to give her pleasure had been its own reward and the only one for the last few months he had been living like a crossingsweeper in order to be able to stay in london until she came back to it and that he might still send her the gifts he had always laid on her altar he had not seen her in three months three months that had been to him a blank except for his work which like all else that he did was inspired and carried on for her now at last she had returned and had shown that even as a friend he was of so little account in her thoughts of so little consequence in her life that after this long absence she had no desire to learn of his welfare or to see him she did not even give him the chance to see her and so placing these facts before him for the first time since he had loved her he considered what was due to himself was it good enough he asked was it just that he should continue to wear out his soul and body for this girl who did not want what he had to give who treated him less considerately than a man whom she met for the first time at dinner he felt he had reached the breakingpoint that the time had come when he must consider what he owed to himself there could never be any other woman save helen but as it was not to be helen he could no longer with selfrespect continue to proffer his love only to see it slighted and neglected he was humble enough concerning himself but of his love he was very proud other men could give her more in wealth or position but no one could ever love her as he did he that hath more let him give he had often quoted to her defiantly as though he were challenging the world and now he felt he must evolve a makeshift world of his own a world in which she was not his only spring of acts he must begin all over again and keep his love secret and sacred until she understood it and wanted it and if she should never want it he would at least have saved it from many rebuffs and insults with this determination strong in him the note helen had left for him after her talk with marion and the flowers and the note with them saying she was coming to take tea on the morrow failed to move him except to make him more bitter he saw in them only a tardy recognition of her neglect an effort to make up to him for thoughtlessness which from her hurt him worse than studied slight a new regime had begun and he was determined to establish it firmly and to make it impossible for himself to retreat from it and in the note in which he thanked helen for the flowers and welcomed her to tea he declared his ultimatum you know how terribly i feel he wrote i dont have to tell you that but i cannot always go on dragging out my love and holding it up to excite your pity as beggars show their sores i cannot always go on praying before your altar cutting myself with knives and calling upon you to listen to me you know that there is no one else but you and that there never can be any one but you and that nothing is changed except that after this i am not going to urge and torment you i shall wait as i have always waited only now i shall wait in silence you know just how little in one way i have to offer you and you know just how much i have in love to offer you it is now for you to speak some day or never but you will have to speak first you will never hear a word of love from me again why should you you know it is always waiting for you but if you should ever want it you must come to me and take off your hat and put it on my table and say philip i have come to stay whether you can ever do that or not can make no difference in my love for you i shall love you always as no man has ever loved a woman in this world but it is you who must speak first for me the rest is silence the following morning as helen was leaving the house she found this letter lying on the halltable and ran back with it to her rooms a week before she would have let it lie on the table and read it on her return she was conscious that this was what she would have done and it pleased her to find that what concerned philip was now to her the thing of greatest interest she was pleased with her own eagerness her own happiness was a welcome sign and she was proud and glad that she was learning to care she read the letter with an anxious pride and pleasure in each word that was entirely new philips recriminations did not hurt her they were the sign that he cared nor did his determination not to speak of his love to her hurt her for she believed him when he said that he would always care she read the letter twice and then sat for some time considering the kind of letter philip would have written had he known her secret had he known that the ring he had abandoned was now upon her finger she rose and crossing to a desk placed the letter in a drawer and then took it out again and reread the last page when she had finished it she was smiling for a moment she stood irresolute and then moving slowly toward the centretable cast a guilty look about her and raising her hands lifted her veil and half withdrew the pins that fastened her hat philip she began in a frightened whisper i have i have come to the sentence ended in a cry of protest and she rushed across the room as though she were running from herself she was blushing violently never she cried as she pulled open the door i could never do it never the following afternoon when helen was to come to tea carroll decided that he would receive her with all the old friendliness but that he must be careful to subdue all emotion he was really deeply hurt at her treatment and had it not been that she came on her own invitation he would not of his own accord have sought to see her in consequence he rather welcomed than otherwise the arrival of marion cavendish who came a halfhour before helen was expected and who followed a hasty knock with a precipitate entrance sit down she commanded breathlessly and listen ive been at rehearsal all day or id have been here before you were awake she seated herself nervously and nodded her head at carroll in an excited and mysterious manner what is it he asked have you and reggie listen marion repeated our fortunes are made that is whats the matter and ive made them if you took half the interest in your work i do youd have made yours long ago last night she began impressively i went to a large supper at the savoy and i sat next to charley wimpole he came in late after everybody had finished and i attacked him while he was eating his supper he said he had been rehearsing caste after the performance that theyve put it on as a stopgap on account of the failure of the triflers and that he knew revivals were of no use that he would give any sum for a good modern comedy that was my cue and i told him i knew of a better comedy than any he had produced at his theatre in five years and that it was going begging he laughed and asked where was he to find this wonderful comedy and i said its been in your safe for the last two months and you havent read it he said indeed how do you know that and i said because if youd read it it wouldnt be in your safe but on your stage so he asked me what the play was about and i told him the plot and what sort of a part his was and some of his scenes and he began to take notice he forgot his supper and very soon he grew so interested that he turned his chair round and kept eying my suppercard to find out who i was and at last remembered seeing me in the new boy and a rotten part it was too but he remembered it and he told me to go on and tell him more about your play so i recited it bit by bit and he laughed in all the right places and got very much excited and said finally that he would read it the first thing this morning marion paused breathlessly oh yes and he wrote your address on his cuff she added with the air of delivering a complete and convincing climax carroll stared at her and pulled excitedly on his pipe oh marion he gasped suppose he should he wont though he added but eying her eagerly and inviting contradiction he will she answered stoutly if he reads it the other managers read it carroll suggested doubtfully yes but what do they know marion returned loftily he knows charles wimpole is the only intelligent actormanager in london there was a sharp knock at the door which marion in her excitement had left ajar and prentiss threw it wide open with an impressive sweep as though he were announcing royalty mr charles wimpole he said the actormanager stopped in the doorway bowing gracefully his hat held before him and his hand on his stick as though it were resting on a foil he had the face and carriage of a gallant of the days of congreve and he wore his modern frockcoat with as much distinction as if it were of silk and lace he was evidently amused i couldnt help overhearing the last line he said smiling it gives me a good entrance marion gazed at him blankly oh she gasped we we were just talking about you if you hadnt mentioned my name the actor said i should never have guessed it and this is mr carroll i hope the great man was rather pleased with the situation as he read it it struck him as possessing strong dramatic possibilities carroll was the struggling author on the verge of starvation marion his sweetheart flying to him gave him hope and he was the good fairy arriving in the nick of time to set everything right and to make the young people happy and prosperous he rather fancied himself in the part of the good fairy and as he seated himself he bowed to them both in a manner which was charmingly inclusive and confidential miss cavendish i imagine has already warned you that you might expect a visit from me he said tentatively carroll nodded he was too much concerned to interrupt then i need only tell you wimpole continued that i got up at an absurd hour this morning to read your play that i did read it that i like it immensely and that if we can come to terms i shall produce it i shall produce it at once within a fortnight or three weeks carroll was staring at him intently and continued doing so after wimpole had finished speaking the actor felt he had somehow missed his point or that carroll could not have understood him and repeated i say i shall put it in rehearsal at once carroll rose abruptly and pushed back his chair i should be very glad he murmured and strode over to the window where he stood with his back turned to his guests wimpole looked after him with a kindly smile and nodded his head appreciatively he had produced even a greater effect than his lines seemed to warrant when he spoke again it was quite simply and sincerely and though he spoke for carrolls benefit he addressed himself to marion you were quite right last night he said it is a most charming piece of work i am really extremely grateful to you for bringing it to my notice he rose and going to carroll put his hand on his shoulder my boy he said i congratulate you i should like to be your age and to have written that play come to my theatre tomorrow and we will talk terms talk it over first with your friends so that i shant rob you do you think you would prefer a lump sum now and so be done with it altogether or trust that the royalties may royalties prompted marion in an eager aside the men laughed quite right wimpole assented goodhumoredly its a poor sportsman who doesnt back his own horse well then until tomorrow but carroll began one moment please i havent thanked you my dear boy cried wimpole waving him away with his stick it is i who have to thank you and and there is a condition carroll said which goes with the play it is that miss cavendish is to have the part of nancy wimpole looked serious and considered for a moment nancy he said the girl who interferes a very good part i have cast miss maddox for it in my mind but of course if the author insists marion with her elbows on the table clasped her hands appealingly before her oh mr wimpole she cried you owe me that at least carroll leaned over and took both of marions hands in one of his its all right he said the author insists wimpole waved his stick again as though it were the magic wand of the good fairy you shall have it he said i recall your performance in the new boy with pleasure i take the play and miss cavendish shall be cast for nancy we shall begin rehearsals at once i hope you are a quick study im letterperfect now laughed marion wimpole turned at the door and nodded to them they were both so young so eager and so jubilant that he felt strangely old and out of it goodby then he said goodby sir they both chorussed and marion cried after him and thank you a thousand times he turned again and looked back at them but in their rejoicing they had already forgotten him bless you my children he said smiling as he was about to close the door a young girl came down the passage toward it and as she was apparently going to carrolls rooms the actor left the door open behind him neither marion nor carroll had noticed his final exit they were both gazing at each other as though could they find speech they would ask if it were true its come at last marion philip said with an uncertain voice i could weep cried marion philip she exclaimed i would rather see that play succeed than any play ever written and i would rather play that part in it than oh philip she ended im so proud of you and rising she threw her arms about his neck and sobbed on his shoulder carroll raised one of her hands and kissed the tips of her fingers gently i owe it to you marion he said all to you this was the tableau that was presented through the open door to miss helen cabot hurrying on her errand of restitution and goodwill and with philips ring and watch clasped in her hand they had not heard her nor did they see her at the door so she drew back quickly and ran along the passage and down the stairs into the street she did not need now to analyze her feelings they were only too evident for she could translate what she had just seen as meaning only one thing that she had considered philips love so lightly that she had not felt it passing away from her until her neglect had killed it until it was too late and now that it was too late she felt that without it her life could not go on she tried to assure herself that only the fact that she had lost it made it seem invaluable but this thought did not comfort her she was not deceived by it she knew that at last she cared for him deeply and entirely in her distress she blamed herself bitterly but she also blamed philip no less bitterly for having failed to wait for her he might have known that i must love him in time she repeated to herself again and again she was so unhappy that her letter congratulating philip on his good fortune in having his comedy accepted seemed to him cold and unfeeling and as his success meant for him only what it meant to her he was hurt and grievously disappointed he accordingly turned the more readily to marion whose interests and enthusiasm at the rehearsals of the piece seemed in contrast most friendly and unselfish he could not help but compare the attitude of the two girls at this time when the failure or success of his best work was still undecided he felt that as helen took so little interest in his success he could not dare to trouble her with his anxieties concerning it and she attributed his silence to his preoccupation and interest in marion so the two grew apart each misunderstanding the other and each troubled in spirit at the others indifference the first night of the play justified all that marion and wimpole had claimed for it and was a great personal triumph for the new playwright the audience was the typical firstnight audience of the class which charles wimpole always commanded it was brilliant intelligent and smart and it came prepared to be pleased from one of the upper stageboxes helen and lady gower watched the successful progress of the play with an anxiety almost as keen as that of the author to helen it seemed as though the giving of these lines to the public these lines which he had so often read to her and altered to her liking was a desecration it seemed as though she were losing him indeed as though he now belonged to these strange people all of whom were laughing and applauding his words from the german princess in the royal box to the straightbacked tommy in the pit instead of the painted scene before her she saw the birchtrees by the river at home where he had first read her the speech to which they were now listening so intensely the speech in which the hero tells the girl he loves her she remembered that at the time she had thought how wonderful it would be if some day some one made such a speech to her not philip but a man she loved and now if philip would only make that speech to her now he came out at last with wimpole leading him and bowed across a glaring barrier of lights at a misty but vociferous audience that was shouting the generous english bravo and standing up to applaud he raised his eyes to the box where helen sat and saw her staring down at the tumult with her hands clasped under her chin her face was colorless but lit with the excitement of the moment and he saw that she was crying lady gower from behind her was clapping her hands delightedly but my dear helen she remonstrated breathlessly you never told me he was so goodlooking yes said helen rising abruptly he is very goodlooking she crossed the box to where her cloak was hanging but instead of taking it down buried her face in its folds my dear child cried lady gower in dismay what is it the excitement has been too much for you no i am just happy sobbed helen i am just happy for him we will go and tell him so then said lady gower i am sure he would like to hear it from you tonight philip was standing in the centre of the stage surrounded by many pretty ladies and elderly men wimpole was hovering over him as though he had claims upon him by the right of discovery but when philip saw helen he pushed his way toward her eagerly and took her hand in both of his i am so glad phil she said she felt it all so deeply that she was afraid to say more but that meant so much to her that she was sure he would understand he had planned it very differently for a year he had dreamed that on the first night of his play there would be a supper and that he would rise and drink her health and tell his friends and the world that she was the woman he loved and that she had agreed to marry him and that at last he was able through the success of his play to make her his wife and now they met in a crowd to shake hands and she went her way with one of her grand ladies and he was left among a group of chattering strangers the great english playwright took him by the hand and in the hearing of all praised him gracefully and kindly it did not matter to philip whether the older playwright believed what he said or not he knew it was generously meant i envy you this the great man was saying dont lose any of it stay and listen to all they have to say you will never live through the first night of your first play but once yes i hear them said philip nervously they are all too kind but i dont hear the voice i have been listening for he added in a whisper the older man pressed his hand again quickly my dear boy he said i am sorry thank you philip answered within a week he had forgotten the great mans fine words of praise but the clasp of his hand he cherished always helen met marion as she was leaving the stage door and stopped to congratulate her on her success in the new part marion was radiant to helen she seemed obstreperously happy and jubilant and marion helen began bravely i also want to congratulate you on something else you you neither of you have told me yet she stammered but i am such an old friend of both that i will not be kept out of the secret at these words marions air of triumphant gayety vanished she regarded helens troubled eyes closely and kindly what secret helen she asked i came to the door of philips room the other day when you did not know i was there helen answered and i could not help seeing how matters were and i do congratulate you both and wish you oh such happiness without a word marion dragged her back down the passage to her dressingroom and closed the door now tell me what you mean she said i am sorry if i discovered anything you didnt want known yet said helen but the door was open mr wimpole had just left you and had not shut it and i could not help seeing marion interrupted her with an eager exclamation of enlightenment oh you were there then she cried and you she asked eagerly you thought phil cared for me that we are engaged and it hurt you you are sorry tell me she demanded are you sorry helen drew back and stretched out her hand toward the door how can you she exclaimed indignantly you have no right marion stood between her and the door i have every right she said to help my friends and i want to help you and philip and indeed i do hope you are sorry i hope you are miserable and im glad you saw me kiss him that was the first and the last time and i did it because i was happy and glad for him and because i love him too but not in the least in the way he loves you no one ever loved any one as he loves you and its time you found it out and if i have helped to make you find it out im glad and i dont care how much i hurt you marion exclaimed helen what does it mean do you mean that you are not engaged that certainly not marion answered i am going to marry reggie it is you that philip loves and i am very sorry for you that you dont love him helen clasped marions hands in both of hers but marion she cried i do oh i do there was a thick yellow fog the next morning and with it rain and a sticky depressing dampness which crept through the windowpanes and which neither a fire nor blazing gasjets could overcome philip stood in front of the fireplace with the morning papers piled high on the centretable and scattered over the room about him he had read them all and he knew now what it was to wake up famous but he could not taste it now that it had come it meant nothing and that it was so complete a triumph only made it the harder in his most optimistic dreams he had never imagined success so satisfying as the reality had proved to be but in his dreams helen had always held the chief part and without her success seemed only to mock him he wanted to lay it all before her to say if you are pleased i am happy if you are satisfied then i am content it was done for you and i am wholly yours and all that i do is yours and as though in answer to his thoughts there was an instant knock at the door and helen entered the room and stood smiling at him across the table her eyes were lit with excitement and spoke with many emotions and her cheeks were brilliant with color he had never seen her look more beautiful why helen he exclaimed how good of you to come is there anything wrong is anything the matter she tried to speak but faltered and smiled at him appealingly what is it he asked in great concern helen drew in her breath quickly and at the same moment motioned him away and he stepped back and stood watching her in much perplexity with her eyes fixed on his she raised her hands to her head and her fingers fumbled with the knot of her veil she pulled it loose and then with a sudden courage lifted her hat proudly as though it were a coronet and placed it between them on his table philip she stammered with the tears in her voice and eyes if you will let me i have come to stay the table was no longer between them he caught her in his arms and kissed her face and her uncovered head again and again from outside the rain beat drearily and the fog rolled through the street but inside before the fire the two young people sat close together asking eager questions or sitting in silence staring at the flames with wondering happy eyes the lion and the unicorn saw them only once again it was a month later when they stopped in front of the shop in a fourwheeler with their baggage mixed on top of it and steamerlabels pasted over every trunk and oh prentiss carroll called from the cabwindow i came near forgetting i promised to gild the lion and the unicorn if i won out in london so have it done please and send the bill to me for ive won out all right and then he shut the door of the cab and they drove away forever nice gal that growled the lion i always liked her i am glad theyve settled it at last the unicorn sighed sentimentally the other ones worth two of her he said on the fever ship there were four rails around the ships sides the three lower ones of iron and the one on top of wood and as he looked between them from the canvas cot he recognized them as the prisonbars which held him in outside his prison lay a stretch of blinding blue water which ended in a line of breakers and a yellow coast with ragged palms beyond that again rose a range of mountainpeaks and stuck upon the loftiest peak of all a tiny blockhouse it rested on the brow of the mountain against the naked sky as impudently as a crackerbox set upon the dome of a great cathedral as the transport rode on her anchorchains the iron bars around her sides rose and sank and divided the landscape with parallel lines from his cot the officer followed this phenomenon with severe painstaking interest sometimes the wooden rail swept up to the very blockhouse itself and for a second of time blotted it from sight and again it sank to the level of the line of breakers and wiped them out of the picture as though they were a line of chalk the soldier on the cot promised himself that the next swell of the sea would send the lowest rail climbing to the very top of the palmtrees or even higher to the base of the mountains and when it failed to reach even the palmtrees he felt a distinct sense of ill use of having been wronged by some one there was no other reason for submitting to this existence save these tricks upon the wearisome glaring landscape and now whoever it was who was working them did not seem to be making this effort to entertain him with any heartiness it was most cruel indeed he decided hotly it was not to be endured he would bear it no longer he would make his escape but he knew that this move which could be conceived in a moments desperation could only be carried to success with great strategy secrecy and careful cunning so he fell back upon his pillow and closed his eyes as though he were asleep and then opening them again turned cautiously and spied upon his keeper as usual his keeper sat at the foot of the cot turning the pages of a huge paper filled with pictures of the war printed in daubs of tawdry colors his keeper was a hardfaced boy without human pity or consideration a very devil of obstinacy and fiendish cruelty to make it worse the fiend was a person without a collar in a suit of soiled khaki with a curious red cross bound by a safetypin to his left arm he was intent upon the paper in his hands he was holding it between his eyes and his prisoner his vigilance had relaxed and the moment seemed propitious with a sudden plunge of arms and legs the prisoner swept the bed sheet from him and sprang at the wooden rail and grasped the iron stanchion beside it he had his knee pressed against the top bar and his bare toes on the iron rail beneath it below him the blue water waited for him it was cool and dark and gentle and deep it would certainly put out the fire in his bones he thought it might even shut out the glare of the sun which scorched his eyeballs but as he balanced for the leap a swift weakness and nausea swept over him a weight seized upon his body and limbs he could not lift the lower foot from the iron rail and he swayed dizzily and trembled he trembled he who had raced his men and beaten them up the hot hill to the trenches of san juan but now he was a baby in the hands of a giant who caught him by the wrist and with an iron arm clasped him around his waist and pulled him down and shouted brutally help some of youse quick hes at it again i cant hold him more giants grasped him by the arms and by the legs one of them took the hand that clung to the stanchion in both of his and pulled back the fingers one by one saying easy now lieutenant easy the ragged palms and the sea and blockhouse were swallowed up in a black fog and his body touched the canvas cot again with a sense of homecoming and relief and rest he wondered how he could have cared to escape from it he found it so good to be back again that for a long time he wept quite happily until the fiery pillow was moist and cool the world outside of the iron bars was like a scene in a theatre set for some great event but the actors were never ready he remembered confusedly a play he had once witnessed before that same scene indeed he believed he had played some small part in it but he remembered it dimly and all trace of the men who had appeared with him in it was gone he had reasoned it out that they were up there behind the range of mountains because great heavy wagons and ambulances and cannon were emptied from the ships at the wharf above and were drawn away in long lines behind the ragged palms moving always toward the passes between the peaks at times he was disturbed by the thought that he should be up and after them that some tradition of duty made his presence with them imperative there was much to be done back of the mountains some event of momentous import was being carried forward there in which he held a part but the doubt soon passed from him and he was content to lie and watch the iron bars rising and falling between the blockhouse and the white surf if they had been only humanely kind his lot would have been bearable but they starved him and held him down when he wished to rise and they would not put out the fire in the pillow which they might easily have done by the simple expedient of throwing it over the ships side into the sea he himself had done this twice but the keeper had immediately brought a fresh pillow already heated for the torture and forced it under his head his pleasures were very simple and so few that he could not understand why they robbed him of them so jealously one was to watch a green cluster of bananas that hung above him from the awning twirling on a string he could count as many of them as five before the bunch turned and swung lazily back again when he could count as high as twelve sometimes when the ship rolled heavily he could count to twenty it was a most fascinating game and contented him for many hours but when they found this out they sent for the cook to come and cut them down and the cook carried them away to his galley then one day a man came out from the shore swimming through the blue water with great splashes he was a most charming man who spluttered and dove and twisted and lay on his back and kicked his legs in an excess of content and delight it was a real pleasure to watch him not for days had anything so amusing appeared on the other side of the prisonbars but as soon as the keeper saw that the man in the water was amusing his prisoner he leaned over the ships side and shouted saay you dont you know theres sharks in there and the swimming man said the h ll there is and raced back to the shore like a porpoise with great lashing of the water and ran up the beach halfway to the palms before he was satisfied to stop then the prisoner wept again it was so disappointing life was robbed of everything now he remembered that in a previous existence soldiers who cried were laughed at and mocked but that was so far away and it was such an absurd superstition that he had no patience with it for what could be more comforting to a man when he is treated cruelly than to cry it was so obvious an exercise and when one is so feeble that one cannot vault a fourrailed barrier it is something to feel that at least one is strong enough to cry he escaped occasionally traversing space with marvellous rapidity and to great distances but never to any successful purpose and his flight inevitably ended in ignominious recapture and a sudden awakening in bed at these moments the familiar and hated palms the peaks and the blockhouse were more hideous in their reality than the most terrifying of his nightmares these excursions afield were always predatory he went forth always to seek food with all the beautiful world from which to elect and choose he sought out only those places where eating was studied and elevated to an art these visits were much more vivid in their detail than any he had ever before made to these same resorts they invariably began in a carriage which carried him swiftly over smooth asphalt one route brought him across a great and beautiful square radiating with rows and rows of flickering lights two fountains splashed in the centre of the square and six women of stone guarded its approaches one of the women was hung with wreaths of mourning ahead of him the late twilight darkened behind a great arch which seemed to rise on the horizon of the world a great window into the heavens beyond at either side strings of white and colored globes hung among the trees and the sound of music came joyfully from theatres in the open air he knew the restaurant under the trees to which he was now hastening and the fountain beside it and the very sparrows balancing on the fountains edge he knew every waiter at each of the tables he felt again the gravel crunching under his feet he saw the maitre dhotel coming forward smiling to receive his command and the waiter in the green apron bowing at his elbow deferential and important presenting the list of wines but his adventure never passed that point for he was captured again and once more bound to his cot with a close burning sheet or else he drove more sedately through the london streets in the late evening twilight leaning expectantly across the doors of the hansom and pulling carefully at his white gloves other hansoms flashed past him the occupant of each with his mind fixed on one idea dinner he was one of a million of people who were about to dine or who had dined or who were deep in dining he was so famished so weak for food of any quality that the galloping horse in the hansom seemed to crawl the lights of the embankment passed like the lamps of a railroad station as seen from the window of an express and while his mind was still torn between the choice of a thin or thick soup or an immediate attack upon cold beef he was at the door and the chasseur touched his cap and the little chasseur put the wicker guard over the hansoms wheel as he jumped out he said give him halfacrown and the driver called after him thank you sir it was a beautiful world this world outside of the iron bars every one in it contributed to his pleasure and to his comfort in this world he was not starved nor manhandled he thought of this joyfully as he leaped up the stairs where young men with grave faces and with their hands held negligently behind their backs bowed to him in polite surprise at his speed but they had not been starved on condensed milk he threw his coat and hat at one of them and came down the hall fearfully and quite weak with dread lest it should not be real his voice was shaking when he asked ellis if he had reserved a table the place was all so real it must be true this time the way ellis turned and ran his finger down the list showed it was real because ellis always did that even when he knew there would not be an empty table for an hour the room was crowded with beautiful women under the light of the red shades they looked kind and approachable and there was food on every table and iced drinks in silver buckets it was with the joy of great relief that he heard ellis say to his underling numero cinq sur la terrace un couvert it was real at last outside the thames lay a great gray shadow the lights of the embankment flashed and twinkled across it the tower of the house of commons rose against the sky and here inside the waiter was hurrying toward him carrying a smoking plate of rich soup with a pungent intoxicating odor and then the ragged palms the glaring sun the immovable peaks and the white surf stood again before him the iron rails swept up and sank again the fever sucked at his bones and the pillow scorched his cheek one morning for a brief moment he came back to real life again and lay quite still seeing everything about him with clear eyes and for the first time as though he had but just that instant been lifted over the ships side his keeper glancing up found the prisoners eyes considering him curiously and recognized the change the instinct of discipline brought him to his feet with his fingers at his sides is the lieutenant feeling better the lieutenant surveyed him gravely you are one of our hospital stewards yes lieutenant why arnt you with the regiment i was wounded too sir i got it same time you did lieutenant am i wounded of course i remember is this a hospital ship the steward shrugged his shoulders shes one of the transports they have turned her over to the fever cases the lieutenant opened his lips to ask another question but his own body answered that one and for a moment he lay silent do they know up north that i that im all right oh yes the papers had it in there was pictures of the lieutenant in some of them then ive been ill some time oh about eight days the soldier moved uneasily and the nurse in him became uppermost i guess the lieutenant hadnt better talk any more he said it was his voice now which held authority the lieutenant looked out at the palms and the silent gloomy mountains and the empty coastline where the same wave was rising and falling with weary persistence eight days he said his eyes shut quickly as though with a sudden touch of pain he turned his head and sought for the figure at the foot of the cot already the figure had grown faint and was receding and swaying has any one written or cabled the lieutenant spoke hurriedly he was fearful lest the figure should disappear altogether before he could obtain his answer has any one come why they couldnt get here lieutenant not yet the voice came very faintly you go to sleep now and ill run and fetch some letters and telegrams when you wake up may be ill have a lot for you but the lieutenant caught the nurse by the wrist and crushed his hand in his own thin fingers they were hot and left the stewards skin wet with perspiration the lieutenant laughed gayly you see doctor he said briskly that you cant kill me i cant die ive got to live you understand because sir she said she would come she said if i was wounded or if i was ill she would come to me she didnt care what people thought she would come any way and nurse me well she will come so doctor old man he plucked at the stewards sleeve and stroked his hand eagerly old man he began again beseechingly youll not let me die until she comes will you what no i know i wont die nothing made by man can kill me no not until she comes then after that eight days shell be here soon any moment what you think so too dont you surely yes any moment yes ill go to sleep now and when you see her rowing out from shore you wake me youll know her you cant make a mistake she is like no there is no one like her but you cant make a mistake that day strange figures began to mount the sides of the ship and to occupy its every turn and angle of space some of them fell on their knees and slapped the bare deck with their hands and laughed and cried out thank god ill see gods country again some of them were regulars bound in bandages some were volunteers dirty and holloweyed with long beards on boys faces some came on crutches others with their arms around the shoulders of their comrades staring ahead of them with a fixed smile their lips drawn back and their teeth protruding at every second step they stumbled and the face of each was swept by swift ripples of pain they lay on cots so close together that the nurses could not walk between them they lay on the wet decks in the scuppers and along the transoms and hatches they were like shipwrecked mariners clinging to a raft and they asked nothing more than that the ships bow be turned toward home once satisfied as to that they relaxed into a state of selfpity and miserable oblivion to their environment from which hunger nor nausea nor aching bones could shake them the hospital steward touched the lieutenant lightly on the shoulder we are going north sir he said the transports ordered north to new york with these volunteers and the sick and wounded do you hear me sir the lieutenant opened his eyes has she come he asked gee exclaimed the hospital steward he glanced impatiently at the blue mountains and the yellow coast from which the transport was drawing rapidly away well i cant see her coming just now he said but she will he added you let me know at once when she comes why certnly of course said the steward three trained nurses came over the side just before the transport started north one was a large motherlylooking woman with a german accent she had been a trained nurse first in berlin and later in the london hospital in whitechapel and at bellevue the nurse was dressed in white and wore a little silver medal at her throat and she was strong enough to lift a volunteer out of his cot and hold him easily in her arms while one of the convalescents pulled his cot out of the rain some of the men called her nurse others who wore scapulars around their necks called her sister and the officers of the medical staff addressed her as miss bergen miss bergen halted beside the cot of the lieutenant and asked is this the fever case you spoke about doctor the one you want moved to the officers ward she slipped her hand up under his sleeve and felt his wrist his pulse is very high she said to the steward when did you take his temperature she drew a little morocco case from her pocket and from that took a clinical thermometer which she shook up and down eying the patient meanwhile with a calm impersonal scrutiny the lieutenant raised his head and stared up at the white figure beside his cot his eyes opened and then shut quickly with a startled look in which doubt struggled with wonderful happiness his hand stole out fearfully and warily until it touched her apron and then finding it was real he clutched it desperately and twisting his face and body toward her pulled her down clasping her hands in both of his and pressing them close to his face and eyes and lips he put them from him for an instant and looked at her through his tears sweetheart he whispered sweetheart i knew youd come as the nurse knelt on the deck beside him her thermometer slipped from her fingers and broke and she gave an exclamation of annoyance the young doctor picked up the pieces and tossed them overboard neither of them spoke but they smiled appreciatively the lieutenant was looking at the nurse with the wonder and hope and hunger of soul in his eyes with which a dying man looks at the cross the priest holds up before him what he saw where the german nurse was kneeling was a tall fair girl with great bands and masses of hair with a head rising like a lily from a firm white throat set on broad shoulders above a straight back and sloping breast a tall beautiful creature halfgirl halfwoman who looked back at him shyly but steadily listen he said the voice of the sick man was so sure and so sane that the young doctor started and moved nearer to the head of the cot listen dearest the lieutenant whispered i wanted to tell you before i came south but i did not dare and then i was afraid something might happen to me and i could never tell you and you would never know so i wrote it to you in the will i made at baiquiri the night before the landing if you hadnt come now you would have learned it in that way you would have read there that there never was any one but you the rest were all dream people foolish silly mad there is no one else in the world but you you have been the only thing in life that has counted i thought i might do something down here that would make you care but i got shot going up a hill and after that i wasnt able to do anything it was very hot and the hills were on fire and they took me prisoner and kept me tied down here burning on these coals i cant live much longer but now that i have told you i can have peace they tried to kill me before you came but they didnt know i loved you they didnt know that men who love you cant die they tried to starve my love for you to burn it out of me they tried to reach it with their knives but my love for you is my soul and they cant kill a mans soul dear heart i have lived because you lived now that you know now that you understand what does it matter miss bergen shook her head with great vigor nonsense she said cheerfully you are not going to die as soon as we move you out of this rain and some food cook good god cried the young doctor savagely do you want to kill him when she spoke the patient had thrown his arms heavily across his face and had fallen back lying rigid on the pillow the doctor led the way across the prostrate bodies apologizing as he went i am sorry i spoke so quickly he said but he thought you were real i mean he thought you were some one he really knew he was just delirious said the german nurse calmly the doctor mixed himself a scotch and soda and drank it with a single gesture ugh he said to the wardroom i feel as though id been opening another mans letters the transport drove through the empty seas with heavy clumsy upheavals rolling like a buoy having been originally intended for the freightcarrying trade she had no sympathy with hearts that beat for a sight of their native land or for lives that counted their remaining minutes by the throbbing of her engines occasionally without apparent reason she was thrown violently from her course but it was invariably the case that when her stern went to starboard something splashed in the water on her port side and drifted past her until when it had cleared the blades of her propeller a voice cried out and she was swung back on her homebound track again the lieutenant missed the familiar palms and the tiny blockhouse and seeing nothing beyond the iron rails but great wastes of gray water he decided he was on board a prisonship or that he had been strapped to a raft and cast adrift people came for hours at a time and stood at the foot of his cot and talked with him and he to them people he had loved and people he had long forgotten some of whom he had thought were dead one of them he could have sworn he had seen buried in a deep trench and covered with branches of palmetto he had heard the bugler with tears choking him sound taps and with his own hand he had placed the dead mans campaign hat on the mound of fresh earth above the grave yet here he was still alive and he came with other men of his troop to speak to him but when he reached out to them they were gone the real and the unreal the dead and the living and even she disappeared whenever he tried to take her hand and sometimes the hospital steward drove her away did that young lady say when she was coming back again he asked the steward the young lady what young lady asked the steward wearily the one who has been sitting there he answered he pointed with his gaunt hand at the man in the next cot oh that young lady yes shes coming back shes just gone below to fetch you some hardtack the young volunteer in the next cot whined grievously that crazy man gives me the creeps he groaned hes always waking me up and looking at me as though he was going to eat me shut your head said the steward hes a better man crazy than youll ever be with the little sense youve got and he has two mauser holes in him crazy eh its a damned good thing for you that there was about four thousand of us regulars just as crazy as him or youd never seen the top of the hill one morning there was a great commotion on deck and all the convalescents balanced themselves on the rail shivering in their pajamas and pointed one way the transport was moving swiftly and smoothly through water as flat as a lake and making a great noise with her steamwhistle the noise was echoed by many more steamwhistles and the ghosts of outbound ships and tugs and excursion steamers ran past her out of the mist and disappeared saluting joyously all of the excursion steamers had a heavy list to the side nearest the transport and the ghosts on them crowded to that rail and waved handkerchiefs and cheered the fog lifted suddenly and between the iron rails the lieutenant saw high green hills on either side of a great harbor houses and trees and thousands of masts swept past like a panorama and beyond was a mirage of three cities with curling smokewreaths and skyreaching buildings and a great swinging bridge and a giant statue of a woman waving a welcome home the lieutenant surveyed the spectacle with cynical disbelief he was far too wise and far too cunning to be bewitched by it in his heart he pitied the men about him who laughed wildly and shouted and climbed recklessly to the rails and ratlines he had been deceived too often not to know that it was not real he knew from cruel experience that in a few moments the tall buildings would crumble away the thousands of columns of white smoke that flashed like snow in the sun the busy shrieking tugboats and the great statue would vanish into the sea leaving it gray and bare he closed his eyes and shut the vision out it was so beautiful that it tempted him but he would not be mocked and he buried his face in his hands they were carrying the farce too far he thought it was really too absurd for now they were at a wharf which was so real that had he not known by previous suffering he would have been utterly deceived by it and there were great crowds of smiling cheering people and a waiting guard of honor in fresh uniforms and rows of police pushing the people this way and that and these men about him were taking it all quite seriously and making ready to disembark carrying their blanketrolls and rifles with them a band was playing joyously and the man in the next cot who was being lifted to a stretcher said theres the governor and his staff thats him in the high hat it was really very well done the customhouse and the elevated railroad and castle garden were as like to life as a photograph and the crowd was as well handled as a mob in a play his heart ached for it so that he could not bear the pain and he turned his back on it it was cruel to keep it up so long his keeper lifted him in his arms and pulled him into a dirty uniform which had belonged apparently to a much larger man a man who had been killed probably for there were darkbrown marks of blood on the tunic and breeches when he tried to stand on his feet castle garden and the battery disappeared in a black cloud of night just as he knew they would but when he opened his eyes from the stretcher they had returned again it was a most remarkably vivid vision they kept it up so well now the young doctor and the hospital steward were pretending to carry him down a gangplank and into an open space and he saw quite close to him a long line of policemen and behind them thousands of faces some of them womens faces women who pointed at him and then shook their heads and cried and pressed their hands to their cheeks still looking at him he wondered why they cried he did not know them nor did they know him no one knew him these people were only ghosts there was a quick parting in the crowd a man he had once known shoved two of the policemen to one side and he heard a girls voice speaking his name like a sob and she came running out across the open space and fell on her knees beside the stretcher and bent down over him and he was clasped in two young firm arms of course it is not real of course it is not she he assured himself because she would not do such a thing before all these people she would not do it but he trembled and his heart throbbed so cruelly that he could not bear the pain she was pretending to cry they wired us you had started for tampa on the hospital ship she was saying and aunt and i went all the way there before we heard you had been sent north we have been on the cars a week that is why i missed you do you understand it was not my fault i tried to come indeed i tried to come she turned her head and looked up fearfully at the young doctor tell me why does he look at me like that she asked he doesnt know me is he very ill tell me the truth she drew in her breath quickly of course you will tell me the truth when she asked the question he felt her arms draw tight about his shoulders it was as though she was holding him to herself and from some one who had reached out for him in his trouble he turned to his old friend and keeper his voice was hoarse and very low is this the same young lady who was on the transport the one you used to drive away in his embarrassment the hospital steward blushed under his tan and stammered of course its the same young lady the doctor answered briskly and i wont let them drive her away he turned to her smiling gravely i think his condition has ceased to be dangerous madam he said people who in a former existence had been his friends and her brother gathered about his stretcher and bore him through the crowd and lifted him into a carriage filled with cushions among which he sank lower and lower then she sat beside him and he heard her brother say to the coachman home and drive slowly and keep on the asphalt the carriage moved forward and she put her arm about him and his head fell on her shoulder and neither of them spoke the vision had lasted so long now that he was torn with the joy that after all it might be real but he could not bear the awakening if it were not so he raised his head fearfully and looked up into the beautiful eyes above him his brows were knit and he struggled with a great doubt and an awful joy dearest he said is it real is it real she repeated even as a dream it was so wonderfully beautiful that he was satisfied if it could only continue so if but for a little while do you think he begged again trembling that it is going to last much longer she smiled and bending her head slowly kissed him it is going to last always she said the man with one talent the massmeeting in the madison square garden which was to help set cuba free was finished and the people were pushing their way out of the overheated building into the snow and sleet of the streets they had been greatly stirred and the spell of the last speaker still hung so heavily upon them that as they pressed down the long corridor they were still speaking loudly in his praise a young man moved eagerly amongst them and pushed his way to wherever a voice was raised above the rest he strained forward listening openly as though he tried to judge the effect of the meeting by the verdict of those about him but the words he overheard seemed to clash with what he wished them to be and the eager look on his face changed to one of doubt and of grave disappointment when he had reached the sidewalk he stopped and stood looking back alternately into the lighted hall and at the hurrying crowds which were dispersing rapidly he made a movement as though he would recall them as though he felt they were still unconvinced as though there was much still left unsaid a fat stranger halted at his elbow to light his cigar and glancing up nodded his head approvingly fine speaker senator stanton aint he he said the young man answered eagerly yes he assented he is a great orator but how could he help but speak well with such a subject oh you ought to have heard him last november at tammany hall the fat stranger answered he wasnt quite up to himself tonight he wasnt so interested those cubans are foreigners you see but you ought to heard him last st patricks day on home rule for ireland then he was talking that speech made him a united states senator i guess i dont just see how he expects to win out on this cuba game the cubans havent got no votes the young man opened his eyes in some bewilderment he speaks for the good of cuba for the sake of humanity he ventured what inquired the fat stranger oh yes of course well i must be getting on goodnight sir the stranger moved on his way but the young man still lingered uncertainly in the snowswept corridor shivering violently with the cold and stamping his feet for greater comfort his face was burned to a deep red which seemed to have come from some long exposure to a tropical sun but which held no sign of health his cheeks were hollow and his eyes were lighted with the fire of fever and from time to time he was shaken by violent bursts of coughing which caused him to reach toward one of the pillars for support as the last of the lights went out in the garden the speaker of the evening and three of his friends came laughing and talking down the long corridor senator stanton was a conspicuous figure at any time and even in those places where his portraits had not penetrated he was at once recognized as a personage something in his erect carriage and an unusual grace of movement and the power and success in his face made men turn to look at him he had been told that he resembled the early portraits of henry clay and he had never quite forgotten the coincidence the senator was wrapping the collar of his fur coat around his throat and puffing contentedly at a fresh cigar and as he passed the night watchman and the ushers bowed to the great man and stood looking after him with the halfhumorous halfenvious deference that the american voter pays to the successful politician at the sidewalk the policemen hurried to open the door of his carriage and in their eagerness made a double line through which he passed nodding to them gravely the young man who had stood so long in waiting pushed his way through the line to his side senator stanton he began timidly might i speak to you a moment my name is arkwright i am just back from cuba and i want to thank you for your speech i am an american and i thank god that i am since you are too sir no one has said anything since the war began that compares with what you said tonight you put it nobly and i know for ive been there for three years only i cant make other people understand it and i am thankful that some one can youll forgive my stopping you sir but i wanted to thank you i feel it very much senator stantons friends had already seated themselves in his carriage and were looking out of the door and smiling with mock patience but the senator made no move to follow them though they were his admirers they were sometimes skeptical and he was not sorry that they should hear this uninvited tribute so he made a pretence of buttoning his long coat about him and nodded encouragingly to arkwright to continue im glad you liked it sir he said with the pleasant gracious smile that had won him a friend wherever it had won him a vote it is very satisfactory to know from one who is well informed on the subject that what i have said is correct the situation there is truly terrible you have just returned you say where were you in havana no in the other provinces sir arkwright answered i have been all over the island i am a civil engineer the truth has not been half told about cuba i assure you sir it is massacre there not war it is partly so through ignorance but nevertheless it is massacre and what makes it worse is that it is the massacre of the innocents that is what i liked best of what you said in that great speech the part about the women and children he reached out his hands detainingly and then drew back as though in apology for having already kept the great man so long waiting in the cold i wish i could tell you some of the terrible things i have seen he began again eagerly as stanton made no movement to depart they are much worse than those you instanced tonight and you could make so much better use of them than any one else i have seen starving women nursing dead babies and sometimes starving babies sucking their dead mothers breasts i have seen men cut down in the open roads and while digging in the fields and two hundred women imprisoned in one room without food and eaten with smallpox and huts burned while the people in them slept the young man had been speaking impetuously but he stopped as suddenly for the senator was not listening to him he had lowered his eyes and was looking with a glance of mingled fascination and disgust at arkwrights hands in his earnestness the young man had stretched them out and as they showed behind the line of his ragged sleeves the others could see even in the blurred light and falling snow that the wrists of each hand were gashed and cut in darkbrown lines like the skin of a mulatto and in places were a raw red where the fresh skin had but just closed over the young man paused and stood shivering still holding his hands out rigidly before him the senator raised his eyes slowly and drew away what is that he said in a low voice pointing with a gloved finger at the black lines on the wrists a sergeant in the group of policemen who had closed around the speakers answered him promptly from his profound fund of professional knowledge thats handcuffs senator he said importantly and glanced at stanton as though to signify that at a word from him he would take this suspicious character into custody the young man pulled the frayed cuffs of his shirt over his wrists and tucked his hands which the cold had frozen into an ashy blue under his armpits to warm them no they dont use handcuffs in the field he said in the same low eager tone they use ropes and leather thongs they fastened me behind a horse and when he stumbled going down the trail it jerked me forward and the cords would tighten and tear the flesh but they have had a long time to heal now i have been eight months in prison the young men at the carriage window had ceased smiling and were listening intently one of them stepped out and stood beside the carriage door looking down at the shivering figure before him with a close and curious scrutiny eight months in prison echoed the police sergeant with a note of triumph what did i tell you hold your tongue said the young man at the carriage door there was silence for a moment while the men looked at the senator as though waiting for him to speak where were you in prison mr arkwright he asked first in the calaboose at santa clara for two months and then in cabanas the cubans who were taken when i was were shot by the fusillade on different days during this last month two of them the ezetas were father and son and the volunteer band played all the time the execution was going on so that the other prisoners might not hear them cry cuba libre when the order came to fire but we heard them the senator shivered slightly and pulled his fur collar up farther around his face id like to talk with you he said if you have nothing to do tomorrow id like to go into this thing thoroughly congress must be made to take some action the young man clasped his hands eagerly ah mr stanton if you would he cried if you would only give me an hour i could tell you so much that you could use and you can believe what i say sir it is not necessary to lie god knows the truth is bad enough i can give you names and dates for everything i say or i can do better than that sir i can take you there yourself in three months i can show you all you need to see without danger to you in any way and they would not know me now that i have grown a beard and i am a skeleton to what i was i can speak the language well and i know just what you should see and then you could come back as one speaking with authority and not have to say i have read or have been told but you can say these are the things i have seen and you could free cuba the senator coughed and put the question aside for the moment with a wave of the hand that held his cigar we will talk of that tomorrow also come to lunch with me at one my apartments are in the berkeley on fifth avenue but arent you afraid to go back there he asked curiously i should think youd had enough of it and youve got a touch of fever havent you he leaned forward and peered into the others eyes it is only the prison fever the young man answered food and this cold will drive that out of me and i must go back there is so much to do there he added ah if i could tell them as you can tell them what i feel here he struck his chest sharply with his hand and on the instant fell into a fit of coughing so violent that the young man at the carriage door caught him around the waist and one of the policemen supported him from the other side you need a doctor said the senator kindly ill ask mine to have a look at you dont forget then at one oclock tomorrow we will go into this thing thoroughly he shook arkwright warmly by the hand and stooping stepped into the carriage the young man who had stood at the door followed him and crowded back luxuriously against the cushions the footman swung himself up beside the driver and said uptown delmonicos as he wrapped the fur rug around his legs and with a salute from the policemen and a scraping of hoofs on the slippery asphalt the great man was gone that poor fellow needs a doctor he said as the carriage rolled up the avenue and he needs an overcoat and he needs food he needs about almost everything by the looks of him but the voice of the young man in the corner of the carriage objected drowsily on the contrary he said it seemed to me that he had the one thing needful by one oclock of the day following senator stanton having read the reports of his speech in the morning papers punctuated with cheers tremendous enthusiasm and more cheers was still in a willing frame of mind toward cuba and her selfappointed envoy young mr arkwright over night he had had doubts but that the young mans enthusiasm would bore him on the morrow but mr arkwright when he appeared developed on the contrary a practical turn of mind which rendered his suggestions both flattering and feasible he was still terribly in earnest but he was clever enough or serious enough to see that the motives which appealed to him might not have sufficient force to move a successful statesman into action so he placed before the senator only those arguments and reasons which he guessed were the best adapted to secure his interest and his help his proposal as he set it forth was simplicity itself here is a map of the island he said on it i have marked the places you can visit in safety and where you will meet the people you ought to see if you leave new york at midnight you can reach tampa on the second day from tampa we cross in another day to havana there you can visit the americans imprisoned in morro and cabanas and in the streets you can see the starving pacificos from havana i shall take you by rail to jucaro matanzas santa clara and cienfuegos you will not be able to see the insurgents in the fields it is not necessary that you should but you can visit one of the sugar plantations and some of the insurgent chiefs will run the forts by night and come in to talk with you i will show you burning fields and houses and starving men and women by the thousands and men and women dying of fevers you can see cuban prisoners shot by a firing squad and you can note how these rebels meet death you can see all this in three weeks and be back in new york in a month as any one can see it who wishes to learn the truth why english members of parliament go all the way to india and british columbia to inform themselves about those countries they travel thousands of miles but only one member of either of our houses of congress has taken the trouble to cross these eighty miles of water that lie between us and cuba you can either go quietly and incognito as it were or you can advertise the fact of your going which would be better and from the moment you start the interest in your visit will grow and increase until there will be no topic discussed in any of our papers except yourself and what you are doing and what you mean to do by the time you return the people will be waiting ready and eager to hear whatever you may have to say your word will be the last word for them it is not as though you were some demagogue seeking notoriety or a hotel piazza correspondent at key west or jacksonville you are the only statesman we have the only orator americans will listen to and i tell you that when you come before them and bring home to them as only you can the horrors of this war you will be the only man in this country you will be the patrick henry of cuba you can go down to history as the man who added the most beautiful island in the seas to the territory of the united states who saved thousands of innocent children and women and who dared to do what no other politician has dared to do to go and see for himself and to come back and speak the truth it only means a month out of your life a months trouble and discomfort but with no risk what is a month out of a lifetime when that month means immortality to you and life to thousands in a month you would make a half dozen afterdinner speeches and cause your friends to laugh and applaud why not wring their hearts instead and hold this thing up before them as it is and shake it in their faces show it to them in all its horror bleeding diseased and naked an offence to our humanity and to our prated love of liberty and to our god the young man threw himself eagerly forward and beat the map with his open palm but the senator sat apparently unmoved gazing thoughtfully into the open fire and shook his head while the luncheon was in progress the young gentleman who the night before had left the carriage and stood at arkwrights side had entered the room and was listening intently he had invited himself to some fresh coffee and had then relapsed into an attentive silence following what the others said with an amused and interested countenance stanton had introduced him as mr livingstone and appeared to take it for granted that arkwright would know who he was he seemed to regard him with a certain deference which arkwright judged was due to some fixed position the young man held either of social or of political value i do not know said stanton with consideration that i am prepared to advocate the annexation of the island it is a serious problem i am not urging that arkwright interrupted anxiously the cubans themselves do not agree as to that and in any event it is an afterthought our object now should be to prevent further bloodshed if you see a man beating a boy to death you first save the boys life and decide afterward where he is to go to school if there were any one else senator arkwright continued earnestly i would not trouble you but we all know your strength in this country you are independent and fearless and men of both parties listen to you surely god has given you this great gift of oratory if you will forgive my speaking so to use only in a great cause a grand organ in a cathedral is placed there to lift mens thoughts to high resolves and purposes not to make people dance a street organ can do that now here is a cause worthy of your great talents worthy of a daniel webster of a henry clay the senator frowned at the fire and shook his head doubtfully if they knew what i was down there for he asked wouldnt they put me in prison too arkwright laughed incredulously certainly not he said you would go there as a private citizen as a tourist to look on and observe spain is not seeking complications of that sort she has troubles enough without imprisoning united states senators yes but these fevers now persisted stanton theyre no respecter of persons i imagine a united states senator is not above smallpox or cholera arkwright shook his head impatiently and sighed it is difficult to make it clear to one who has not been there he said these people and soldiers are dying of fever because they are forced to live like pigs and they are already sick with starvation a healthy man like yourself would be in no more danger than you would be in walking through the wards of a new york hospital senator stanton turned in his armchair and held up his hand impressively if i were to tell them the things you have told me he said warningly if i were to say i have seen such things american property in flames american interests ruined and that five times as many women and children have died of fever and starvation in three months in cuba as the sultan has massacred in armenia in three years it would mean war with spain well said arkwright stanton shrugged his shoulders and sank back again in his chair it would either mean war arkwright went on or it might mean the sending of the red cross army to cuba it went to constantinople five thousand miles away to help the armenian christians why has it waited three years to go eighty miles to feed and clothe the cuban women and children it is like sending help to a hungry peasant in russia while a man dies on your doorstep well said the senator rising i will let you know tomorrow if it is the right thing to do and if i can do it of course it must be done we start from tampa you say i know the presidents of all of those roads and theyll probably give me a private car for the trip down shall we take any newspaper men with us or shall i wait until i get back and be interviewed what do you think i would wait until my return arkwright answered his eyes glowing with the hope the senators words had inspired and then speak to a massmeeting here and in boston and in chicago three speeches will be enough before you have finished your last one the american warships will be in the harbor of havana ah youth youth said the senator smiling gravely it is no light responsibility to urge a country into war it is no light responsibility arkwright answered to know you have the chance to save the lives of thousands of little children and helpless women and to let the chance pass quite so that is quite true said the senator well goodmorning i shall let you know tomorrow young livingstone went down in the elevator with arkwright and when they had reached the sidewalk stood regarding him for a moment in silence you mustnt count too much on stanton you know he said kindly he has a way of disappointing people ah he can never disappoint me arkwright answered confidently no matter how much i expected besides i have already heard him speak i dont mean that i dont mean he is disappointing as a speaker stanton is a great orator i think most of those southerners are and hes the only real orator i ever heard but what i mean is that he doesnt go into things impulsively he first considers himself and then he considers every other side of the question before he commits himself to it before he launches out on a popular wave he tries to find out where it is going to land him he likes the sort of popular wave that carries him along with it where every one can see him he doesnt fancy being hurled up on the beach with his mouth full of sand you are saying that he is selfish selfseeking arkwright demanded with a challenge in his voice i thought you were his friend yes he is selfish and yes i am his friend the young man answered smiling at least he seems willing to be mine i am saying nothing against him that i have not said to him if youll come back with me up the elevator ill tell him hes a selfseeker and selfish and with no thought above his own interests he wont mind hed say i cannot comprehend his motives why youve only to look at his record when the venezuelan message came out he attacked the president and declared he was trying to make political capital and to drag us into war and that what we wanted was arbitration but when the president brought out the arbitration treaty he attacked that too in the senate and destroyed it why not because he had convictions but because the president had refused a foreign appointment to a friend of his in the south he has been a free silver man for the last ten years he comes from a free silver state and the members of the legislature that elected him were all for silver but this last election his wall street friends got hold of him and worked on his feelings and he repudiated his party his state and his constituents and came out for gold well but surely arkwright objected that took courage to own that for ten years you had been wrong and to come out for the right at the last livingstone stared and shrugged his shoulders its all a question of motives he said indifferently i dont want to shatter your idol i only want to save you from counting too much on him when arkwright called on the morrow senator stanton was not at home and the day following he was busy and could give him only a brief interview there were previous engagements and other difficulties in the way of his going which he had not foreseen he said and he feared he should have to postpone his visit to cuba indefinitely he asked if mr arkwright would be so kind as to call again within a week he would then be better able to give him a definite answer arkwright left the apartment with a sensation of such keen disappointment that it turned him ill and dizzy he felt that the great purpose of his life was being played with and put aside but he had not selfish resentment on his own account he was only the more determined to persevere he considered new arguments and framed new appeals and one moment blamed himself bitterly for having foolishly discouraged the statesman by too vivid pictures of the horrors he might encounter and the next questioned if he had not been too practical and so failed because he had not made the terrible need of immediate help his sole argument every hour wasted in delay meant as he knew the sacrifice of many lives and there were other more sordid and more practical reasons for speedy action for his supply of money was running low and there was now barely enough remaining to carry him through the month of travel he had planned to take at stantons side what would happen to him when that momentous trip was over was of no consequence he would have done the work as far as his small share in it lay he would have set in motion a great power that was to move congress and the people of the united states to action if he could but do that what became of him counted for nothing but at the end of the week his fears and misgivings were scattered gloriously and a single line from the senator set his heart leaping and brought him to his knees in gratitude and thanksgiving on returning one afternoon to the mean lodging into which he had moved to save his money he found a telegram from stanton and he tore it open trembling between hope and fear have arranged to leave for tampa with you monday at midnight it read call for me at ten oclock same evening stanton arkwright read the message three times there was a heavy suffocating pressure at his heart as though it had ceased beating he sank back limply upon the edge of his bed and clutching the piece of paper in his two hands spoke the words aloud triumphantly as though to assure himself that they were true then a flood of unspeakable relief of happiness and gratitude swept over him and he turned and slipped to the floor burying his face in the pillow and wept out his thanks upon his knees a man so deeply immersed in public affairs as was stanton and with such a multiplicity of personal interests could not prepare to absent himself for a month without his intention becoming known and on the day when he was to start for tampa the morning newspapers proclaimed the fact that he was about to visit cuba they gave to his mission all the importance and display that arkwright had foretold some of the newspapers stated that he was going as a special commissioner of the president to study and report others that he was acting in behalf of the cuban legation in washington and had plenipotentiary powers opposition organs suggested that he was acting in the interests of the sugar trust and his own particular organ declared that it was his intention to free cuba at the risk of his own freedom safety and even life the spanish minister in washington sent a cable for publication to madrid stating that a distinguished american statesman was about to visit cuba to investigate and later to deny the truth of the disgraceful libels published concerning the spanish officials on the island by the papers of the united states at the same time he cabled in cipher to the captaingeneral in havana to see that the distinguished statesman was closely spied upon from the moment of his arrival until his departure and to place on the suspect list all americans and cubans who ventured to give him any information the afternoon papers enlarged on the importance of the visit and on the good that would surely come of it they told that senator stanton had refused to be interviewed or to disclose the object of his journey but it was enough they said that some one in authority was at last to seek out the truth and added that no one would be listened to with greater respect than would the southern senator on this all the editorial writers were agreed the day passed drearily for arkwright early in the morning he packed his valise and paid his landlord and for the remainder of the day walked the streets or sat in the hotel corridor waiting impatiently for each fresh edition of the papers in them he read the signs of the great upheaval of popular feeling that was to restore peace and health and plenty to the island for which he had given his last three years of energy and life he was trembling with excitement as well as with the cold when at ten oclock precisely he stood at senator stantons door he had forgotten to eat his dinner and the warmth of the dimly lit hall and the odor of rich food which was wafted from an inner room touched his senses with tantalizing comfort the senator says you are to come this way sir the servant directed he took arkwrights valise from his hand and parted the heavy curtains that hid the diningroom and arkwright stepped in between them and then stopped in some embarrassment he found himself in the presence of a number of gentlemen seated at a long dinnertable who turned their heads as he entered and peered at him through the smoke that floated in light layers above the white cloth the dinner had been served but the senators guests still sat with their chairs pushed back from a table lighted by candles under yellow shades and covered with beautiful flowers and with bottles of varied sizes in stands of quaint and intricate design senator stantons tall figure showed dimly through the smoke and his deep voice hailed arkwright cheerily from the farther end of the room this way mr arkwright he said i have a chair waiting for you here he grasped arkwrights hand warmly and pulled him into the vacant place at his side an elderly gentleman on arkwrights other side moved to make more room for him and shoved a liqueur glass toward him with a friendly nod and pointed at an open box of cigars he was a finelooking man and arkwright noticed that he was regarding him with a glance of the keenest interest all of those at the table were men of twice arkwrights age except livingstone whom he recognized and who nodded to him pleasantly and at the same time gave an order to a servant pointing at arkwright as he did so some of the gentlemen wore their business suits and one opposite arkwright was still in his overcoat and held his hat in his hand these latter seemed to have arrived after the dinner had begun for they formed a second line back of those who had places at the table they all seemed to know one another and were talking with much vivacity and interest stanton did not attempt to introduce arkwright to his guests individually but said gentlemen this is mr arkwright of whom i have been telling you the young gentleman who has done such magnificent work for the cause of cuba those who caught arkwrights eye nodded to him and others raised their glasses at him but with a smile that he could not understand it was as though they all knew something concerning him of which he was ignorant he noted that the faces of some were strangely familiar and he decided that he must have seen their portraits in the public prints after he had introduced arkwright the senator drew his chair slightly away from him and turned in what seemed embarrassment to the man on his other side the elderly gentleman next to arkwright filled his glass a servant placed a small cup of coffee at his elbow and he lit a cigar and looked about him you must find this weather very trying after the tropics his neighbor said arkwright assented cordially the brandy was flowing through his veins and warming him he forgot that he was hungry and the kind interested glances of those about him set him at his ease it was a propitious start he thought a pleasant leavetaking for the senator and himself full of good will and good wishes he turned toward stanton and waited until he had ceased speaking the papers have begun well havent they he asked eagerly he had spoken in a low voice almost in a whisper but those about the table seemed to have heard him for there was silence instantly and when he glanced up he saw the eyes of all turned upon him and he noticed on their faces the same smile he had seen there when he entered yes stanton answered constrainedly yes i he lowered his voice but the silence still continued stanton had his eyes fixed on the table but now he frowned and half rose from his chair i want to speak with you arkwright he said suppose we go into the next room ill be back in a moment he added nodding to the others but the man on his right removed his cigar from his lips and said in an undertone no sit down stay where you are and the elderly gentleman at arkwrights side laid his hand detainingly on his arm oh you wont take mr arkwright away from us stanton he asked smiling stanton shrugged his shoulders and sat down again and there was a moments pause it was broken by the man in the overcoat who laughed hes paying you a compliment mr arkwright he said he pointed with his cigar to the gentleman at arkwrights side i dont understand arkwright answered doubtfully its a compliment to your eloquence hes afraid to leave you alone with the senator livingstones been telling us that you are a better talker than stanton arkwright turned a troubled countenance toward the men about the table and then toward livingstone but that young man had his eyes fixed gravely on the glasses before him and did not raise them arkwright felt a sudden unreasonable fear of the circle of strongfeatured serene and confident men about him they seemed to be making him the subject of a jest to be enjoying something among themselves of which he was in ignorance but which concerned him closely he turned a white face toward stanton you dont mean he began piteously that that you are not going is that it tell me is that what you wanted to say stanton shifted in his chair and muttered some words between his lips then turned toward arkwright and spoke quite clearly and distinctly i am very sorry mr arkwright he said but i am afraid ill have to disappoint you reasons i cannot now explain have arisen which make my going impossible quite impossible he added firmly not only now but later he went on quickly as arkwright was about to interrupt him arkwright made no second attempt to speak he felt the muscles of his face working and the tears coming to his eyes and to hide his weakness he twisted in his chair and sat staring ahead of him with his back turned to the table he heard livingstones voice break the silence with some hurried question and immediately his embarrassment was hidden in a murmur of answers and the moving of glasses as the men shifted in their chairs and the laughter and talk went on as briskly as before arkwright saw a sideboard before him and a servant arranging some silver on one of the shelves he watched the man do this with a concentrated interest as though the dull numbed feeling in his brain caught at the trifle in order to put off as long as possible the consideration of the truth and then beyond the sideboard and the tapestry on the wall above it he saw the sun shining down upon the island of cuba he saw the royal palms waving and bending the dusty columns of spanish infantry crawling along the white roads and leaving blazing huts and smoking canefields in their wake he saw skeletons of men and women seeking for food among the refuse of the street he heard the order given to the firing squad the splash of the bullets as they scattered the plaster on the prison wall and he saw a kneeling figure pitch forward on its face with a useless bandage tied across its sightless eyes senator stanton brought him back with a sharp shake of the shoulder he had also turned his back on the others and was leaning forward with his elbows on his knees he spoke rapidly and in a voice only slightly raised above a whisper i am more than sorry arkwright he said earnestly you mustnt blame me altogether i have had a hard time of it this afternoon i wanted to go i really wanted to go the thing appealed to me it touched me it seemed as if i owed it to myself to do it but they were too many for me he added with a backward toss of his head toward the men around his table if the papers had not told on me i could have got well away he went on in an eager tone but as soon as they read of it they came here straight from their offices you know who they are dont you he asked and even in his earnestness there was an added touch of importance in his tone as he spoke the name of his partys leader of men who stood prominently in wall street and who were at the head of great trusts you see how it is he said with a shrug of his shoulders they have enormous interests at stake they said i would drag them into war that i would disturb values that the business interests of the country would suffer im under obligations to most of them they have advised me in financial matters and they threatened they threatened to make it unpleasant for me his voice hardened and he drew in his breath quickly and laughed you wouldnt understand if i were to tell you its rather involved and after all they may be right agitation may be bad for the country and your party leader after all is your party leader isnt he and if he says no what are you to do my sympathies are just as keen for these poor women and children as ever but as these men say charity begins at home and we mustnt do anything to bring on war prices again or to send stocks tumbling about our heads must we he leaned back in his chair again and sighed sympathy is an expensive luxury i find he added arkwright rose stiffly and pushed stanton away from him with his hand he moved like a man coming out of a dream dont talk to me like that he said in a low voice the noise about the table ended on the instant but arkwright did not notice that it had ceased you know i dont understand that he went on what does it matter to me he put his hand up to the side of his face and held it there looking down at stanton he had the dull heavy look in his eyes of a man who has just come through an operation under some heavy drug wall street trusts party leaders he repeated what are they to me the words dont reach me they have lost their meaning it is a language i have forgotten thank god he added he turned and moved his eyes around the table scanning the faces of the men before him yes you are twelve to one he said at last still speaking dully and in a low voice as though he were talking to himself you have won a noble victory gentlemen i congratulate you but i do not blame you we are all selfish and selfseeking i thought i was working only for cuba but i was working for myself just as you are i wanted to feel that it was i who had helped to bring relief to that plaguespot that it was through my efforts the help had come yes if he had done as i asked i suppose i would have taken the credit he swayed slightly and to steady himself caught at the back of his chair but at the same moment his eyes glowed fiercely and he held himself erect again he pointed with his finger at the circle of great men who sat looking up at him in curious silence you are like a ring of gamblers around a gaming table he cried wildly who see nothing but the green cloth and the wheel and the piles of money before them who forget in watching the money rise and fall that outside the sun is shining that human beings are sick and suffering that men are giving their lives for an idea for a sentiment for a flag you are the moneychangers in the temple of this great republic and the day will come i pray to god when you will be scourged and driven out with whips do you think you can form combines and deals that will cheat you into heaven can your trusts save your souls is wall street the strait and narrow road to salvation the men about the table leaned back and stared at arkwright in as great amazement as though he had violently attempted an assault upon their pockets or had suddenly gone mad in their presence some of them frowned and others appeared not to have heard and others smiled grimly and waited for him to continue as though they were spectators at a play the political leader broke the silence with a low aside to stanton does the gentleman belong to the salvation army he asked arkwright whirled about and turned upon him fiercely old gods give way to new gods he cried here is your brother i am speaking for him do you ever think of him how dare you sneer at me he cried you can crack your whip over that mans head and turn him from what in his heart and conscience he knows is right you can crack your whip over the men who call themselves freeborn american citizens and who have made you their boss sneer at them if you like but you have no collar on my neck if you are a leader why dont you lead your people to what is good and noble why do you stop this man in the work god sent him here to do you would make a party hack of him a political prostitute something lower than the woman who walks the streets she sells her body this man is selling his soul he turned trembling and quivering and shook his finger above the upturned face of the senator what have you done with your talents stanton he cried what have you done with your talents the man in the overcoat struck the table before him with his fist so that the glasses rang by god he laughed i call him a better speaker than stanton livingstones right he is better than stanton but he lacks stantons knack of making himself popular he added he looked around the table inviting approbation with a smile but no one noticed him nor spoke to break the silence arkwright heard the words dully and felt that he was being mocked he covered his face with his hands and stood breathing brokenly his body was still trembling with an excitement he could not master stanton rose from his chair and shook him by the shoulder are you mad arkwright he cried you have no right to insult my guests or me be calm control yourself what does it matter what i say arkwright went on desperately i am mad yes that is it i am mad they have won and i have lost and it drove me beside myself i counted on you i knew that no one else could let my people go but ill not trouble you again i wish you goodnight sir and goodbye if i have been unjust you must forget it he turned sharply but stanton placed a detaining hand on his shoulder wait he commanded querulously where are you going will you still arkwright bowed his head yes he answered i have but just time now to catch our train my train i mean he looked up at stanton and taking his hand in both of his drew the man toward him all the wildness and intolerance in his manner had passed and as he raised his eyes they were full of a firm resolve come he said simply there is yet time leave these people behind you what can you answer when they ask what have you done with your talents good god arkwright the senator exclaimed angrily pulling his hand away dont talk like a hymnbook and dont make another scene what you ask is impossible tell me what i can do to help you in any other way and come repeated the young man firmly the world may judge you by what you do tonight stanton looked at the boy for a brief moment with a strained and eager scrutiny and then turned away abruptly and shook his head in silence and arkwright passed around the table and on out of the room a month later as the southern senator was passing through the readingroom of the union club livingstone beckoned to him and handing him an afternoon paper pointed at a paragraph in silence the paragraph was dated sagua la grande and read the body of henry arkwright an american civil engineer was brought into sagua today by a spanish column it was found lying in a road three miles beyond the line of forts arkwright was surprised by a guerilla force while attempting to make his way to the insurgent camp and on resisting was shot the body has been handed over to the american consul for interment it is badly mutilated stanton lowered the paper and stood staring out of the window at the falling snow and the cheery lights and bustling energy of the avenue poor fellow he said he wanted so much to help them and he didnt accomplish anything did he livingstone stared at the older man and laughed shortly well i dont know he said he died some of us only live the vagrant his excellency sir charles greville k c m g governor of the windless islands stood upon the veranda of government house surveying the new day with critical and searching eyes sir charles had been so long absolute monarch of the windless isles that he had assumed unconsciously a mental attitude of suzerainty over even the glittering waters of the caribbean sea and the coral reefs under the waters and the rainbow skies that floated above them but on this particular morning not even the critical eye of the governor could distinguish a single flaw in the tropical landscape before him the lawn at his feet ran down to meet the dazzling waters of the bay the blue waters of the bay ran to meet a great stretch of absinthe green the green joined a fairy sky of pink and gold and saffron islands of coral floated on the sea of absinthe and derelict clouds of motherofpearl swung low above them starting from nowhere and going nowhere but drifting beautifully like giant soapbubbles of light and color where the lawn touched the waters of the bay the cocoanutpalms reached their crooked lengths far up into the sunshine and as the seabreeze stirred their fronds they filled the hot air with whispers and murmurs like the fluttering of many fans nature smiled boldly upon the governor confident in her bountiful beauty as though she said surely you cannot but be pleased with me today and as though in answer the critical and searching glance of sir charles relaxed the crunching of the gravel and the rattle of the sentrys musket at salute recalled him to his high office and to the duties of the morning he waved his hand and as though it were a wand the sentry moved again making his way to the kitchengarden and so around government house and back to the lawntennis court maintaining in his solitary pilgrimage the dignity of her majestys representative as well as her majestys power over the windless isles the governor smiled slightly with the ease of mind of one who finds all things good supreme authority surroundings of endless beauty the respectful even humble deference of his inferiors and never even an occasional visit from a superior had in four years lowered him into a bed of ease and selfsatisfaction he was cut off from the world and yet of it each month there came via jamaica the three weeks old copy of the weekly times he subscribed to mudies colonial library and from the states he had imported an american lawnmower the mechanism of which no one as yet understood within his own borders he had created a healthy orderly seaport out of what had been a sink of fever and a refuge for all the neerdowells and fugitive revolutionists of central america he knew as he sat each evening on his veranda looking across the bay that in the world beyond the pink and gold sunset men were still panting struggling and starving crises were rising and passing strikes and panics wars and the rumors of wars swept from continent to continent a plague crept through india a filibuster with five hundred men at his back crossed an imaginary line and stirred the world from cape town to london emperors were crowned the good queen celebrated the longest reign and a captain of artillery imprisoned in a swampy island in the south atlantic caused two hemispheres to clamor for his rescue and lit a race war that stretched from algiers to the boulevards and yet at the windless isles all these happenings seemed to sir charles like the mornings memory of a dream for these things never crossed the ring of the coral reefs he saw them only as pictures in an illustrated paper a month old and he was pleased to find that this was so he was sufficient to himself with his own responsibilities and social duties and public works he was a man in authority who said to others come and go under him were commissioners and under the commissioners district inspectors and boards of education and of highways for the better health of the colony he had planted trees that sucked the malaria from the air for its better morals he had substituted as a sunday amusement cricketmatches for cockfights and to keep it at peace he had created a local constabulary of native negroes and had dressed them in the castoff uniforms of london policemen his handiwork was everywhere and his interest was all sunk in his handiwork the days passed gorgeous with sunshine the nights breathed with beauty it was an existence of leisurely occupation and one that promised no change and he was content as it was thursday the council met that morning and some questions of moment to the colony were to be brought up for consideration the question of the dogtax was one which perplexed sir charles most particularly the two councillors elected by the people and the three appointed by the crown had disagreed as to this tax of the five hundred british subjects at the seaport all but ten were owners of dogs and it had occurred to sassoon the chemist that a tax of halfacrown a year on each of these dogs would meet the expense of extending the oystershell road to the new cricketgrounds to this snellgrove who held the contract for the narrowgauge railroad agreed but the three crown councillors opposed the tax vigorously on the ground that as scavengers alone the dogs were a boon to the colony and should be encouraged the fact that each of these gentlemen owned not only one but several dogs of high pedigree made their position one of great delicacy there was no way by which the governor could test the popular will in the matter except through his secretary mr clarges who at the cricketmatch between the local eleven and the officers and crew of h m s partridge had been informed by the other owners of several foxterriers that in their opinion the tax was a piece of condemned tommyrot from this the governor judged that it would not prove a popular measure as he paced the veranda drawing deliberately on his cigar and considering to which party he should give the weight of his final support his thoughts were disturbed by the approach of a stranger who advanced along the gravel walk guarded on either side by one of the local constabulary the stranger was young and of poor appearance his bare feet were bound in a pair of the rope sandals worn by the natives his clothing was of torn and soiled drill and he fanned his face nonchalantly with a sombrero of battered and shapeless felt sir charles halted in his walk and holding his cigar behind his back addressed himself to the sergeant a vagrant he asked the words seemed to bear some amusing significance to the stranger for his face lit instantly with a sweet and charming smile and while he turned to hear the sergeants reply he regarded him with a kindly and affectionate interest yes your excellency the governor turned to the prisoner do you know the law of this colony regarding vagrants i do not the young man answered his tone was politely curious and suggested that he would like to be further informed as to the local peculiarities of a foreign country after two weeks residence the governor recited impressively all ablebodied persons who will not work are put to work or deported have you made any effort to find work again the young man smiled charmingly he shook his head and laughed oh dear no he said the laugh struck the governor as impertinent then you must leave by the next mailsteamer if you have any money to pay your passage or if you have no money you must go to work on the roads have you any money if i had i wouldnt be a vagrant the young man answered his voice was low and singularly sweet it seemed to suit the indolence of his attitude and the lazy inconsequent smile i called on our consular agent here he continued leisurely to write a letter home for money but he was disgracefully drunk so i used his official notepaper to write to the state department about him instead the governors deepest interest was aroused the american consular agent was one of the severest trials he was forced to endure you are not a british subject then ah i see and er your representative was unable to assist you he was drunk the young man repeated placidly he has been drunk ever since i have been here particularly in the mornings he halted as though the subject had lost interest for him and gazed pleasantly at the sunny bay and up at the moving palms then said the governor as though he had not been interrupted as you have no means of support you will help support the colony until you can earn money to leave it that will do sergeant the young man placed his hat upon his head and turned to move away but at the first step he swayed suddenly and caught at the negros shoulder clasping his other hand across his eyes the sergeant held him by the waist and looked up at the governor with some embarrassment the young gentleman has not been well sir charles he said apologetically the stranger straightened himself up and smiled vaguely im all right he murmured suns too hot sit down said the governor he observed the stranger more closely he noticed now that beneath the tan his face was delicate and finely cut and that his yellow hair clung closely to a wellformed head he seems faint has he had anything to eat asked the governor the sergeant grinned guiltily yes sir charles weve been feeding him at the barracks its fever sir sir charles was not unacquainted with fallen gentlemen beachcombers remittance men and vagrants who had known better days and there had been something winning in this vagrants smile and moreover he had reported that thorn in his flesh the consular agent to the proper authorities he conceived an interest in a young man who though with naked feet did not hesitate to correspond with his minister of foreign affairs how long have you been ill he asked the young man looked up from where he had sunk on the steps and roused himself with a shrug it doesnt matter he said ive had a touch of chagres ever since i was on the isthmus i was at work there on the railroad did you come here from colon no i worked up the pacific side i was clerking with rossner brothers at amapala for a while because i speak a little german and then i footed it over to puerto cortez and got a job with the lottery people they gave me twenty dollars a month gold for rolling the tickets and i put it all in the drawing and won as much as ten he laughed and sitting erect drew from his pocket a roll of thin green papers these are for the next drawing he said have some he added he held them towards the negro sergeant who under the eye of the governor resisted and then spread the tickets on his knee like a hand at cards i stand to win a lot with these he said with a cheerful sigh you see until the lists published im prospectively worth twenty thousand dollars and he added i break stones in the sun he rose unsteadily and saluted the governor with a nod goodmorning sir he said and thank you wait sir charles commanded a new form of punishment had suggested itself in which justice was tempered with mercy can you work one of your american lawnmowers he asked the young man laughed delightedly i never tried he said but ive seen it done if youve been ill it would be murder to put you on the shell road the governors dignity relaxed into a smile i dont desire international complications he said sergeant take this him to the kitchen and tell corporal mallon to give him that american lawnmowing machine possibly he may understand its mechanism mallon only cuts holes in the turf with it and he waved his hand in dismissal and as the three men moved away he buried himself again in the perplexities of the dogtax ten minutes later the deliberations of the council were disturbed by a loud and persistent rattle like the whir of a maxim gun which proved on investigation to arise from the american lawnmower the vagrant was propelling it triumphantly across the lawn and gazing down at it with the same fond pride with which a nursemaid leans over the perambulator to observe her lusty and gurgling charge the councillors had departed sir charles was thinking of breakfast the maximlike lawnmower still irritated the silent hush of midday when from the waters of the inner harbor there came suddenly the sharp report of a saluting gun and the rush of falling anchorchains there was still a week to pass before the mailsteamer should arrive and h m s partridge had departed for nassau besides these ships no other vessel had skirted the buoys of the bay in eight long smiling months mr clarges the secretary with an effort to appear calm and the orderly suffocated with the news entered through separate doors at the same instant the secretary filed his report first a yachts just anchored in the bay sir charles he said the orderlys face fell he looked aggrieved an american yacht he corrected and much larger than the partridge continued the secretary the orderly took a hasty glance back over his shoulder she has her launch lowered already sir he said outside the whir of the lawnmower continued undisturbed sir charles reached for his marineglass and the three men hurried to the veranda it looks like a manofwar said sir charles no he added adjusting the binocular shes a yacht she flies the new york yacht club pennant now shes showing the owners absent pennant he must have left in the launch hes coming ashore now he seems in a bit of a hurry growled mr clarges those americans always murmured sir charles from behind the binocular he did not quite know that he enjoyed this sudden onslaught upon the privacy of his harbor and port it was in itself annoying and he was further annoyed to find that it could in the least degree disturb his poise the launch was growing instantly larger like an express train approaching a station at full speed her flags flew out as flat as pieces of painted tin her bits of brasswork flashed like fire already the ends of the wharves were white with groups of natives you might think he was going to ram the town suggested the secretary oh i say he exclaimed in remonstrance hes making in for your private wharf the governor was rearranging the focus of the glass with nervous fingers i believe he said no yes upon my word there are there are ladies in that launch ladies sir the secretary threw a hasty glance at the binocular but it was in immediate use the clatter of the lawnmower ceased suddenly and the relief of its silence caused the governor to lower his eyes he saw the lawnmower lying prostrate on the grass the vagrant had vanished there was a sharp tinkle of bells and the launch slipped up to the wharf and halted as softly as a bicycle a man in a yachtingsuit jumped from her and making some laughing speech to the two women in the stern walked briskly across the lawn taking a letter from his pocket as he came sir charles awaited him gravely the occupants of the launch had seen him and it was too late to retreat sir charles greville i believe said the yachtsman he bowed and ran lightly up the steps i am mr robert collier from new york he said i have a letter to you from your ambassador at washington if youll pardon me ill present it in person i had meant to leave it but seeing you he paused and gave the letter in his hand to sir charles who waved him towards his library sir charles scowled at the letter through his monocle and then shook hands with his visitor i am very glad to see you mr collier he said he says here you are preparing a book on our colonies in the west indies he tapped the letter with his monocle i am sure i shall be most happy to assist you with any information in my power well i am writing a book yes mr collier observed doubtfully but its a logbook this trip i am on pleasure bent and i also wish to consult with you on a personal matter however that can wait he glanced out of the windows to where the launch lay in the sun my wife came ashore with me sir charles he said so that in case there was a lady greville mrs collier could call on her and we could ask if you would waive etiquette and do us the honor to dine with us tonight on the yacht that is if you are not engaged sir charles smiled there is no lady greville he said and i personally do not think i am engaged elsewhere he paused in thought as though to make quite sure he was not no he added i have no other engagement i will come with pleasure sir charles rose and clapped his hands for the orderly possibly the ladies will come up to the veranda he asked i cannot allow them to remain at the end of my wharf he turned and gave directions to the orderly to bring limes and bottles of soda and ice and led the way across the lawn mrs collier and her friend had not explored the grounds of government house for over ten minutes before sir charles felt that many years ago he had personally arranged their visit that he had known them for even a longer time and that now that they had finally arrived they must never depart to them there was apparently nothing on his domain which did not thrill with delightful interest they were as eager as two children at a pantomime and as unconscious as a rule sir charles had found it rather difficult to meet the women of his colony on a path which they were capable of treading intelligently in fairness to them he had always sought out some topic in which they could take an equal part something connected with the conduct of children or the better ventilation of the new schoolhouse and chapel but these newcomers did not require him to select topics of conversation they did not even wait for him to finish those which he himself introduced they flitted from one end of the garden to the other with the eagerness of two midshipmen on shore leave and they found something to enjoy in what seemed to the governor the most commonplace of things the zouave uniform of the sentry the old spanish cannon converted into peaceful gateposts the aviary with its screaming paroquets the botanical station and even the icemachine were all objects of delight on the other hand the interior of the famous palace which had been sent out complete from london and which was wont to fill the wives of the colonials with awe or to reduce them to whispers for some reason failed of its effect but they said they loved the large gold v rs on the back of the councillors chairs and they exclaimed aloud over the red leather despatchboxes and the great seal of the colony and the mysterious envelopes marked on her majestys service isnt it too exciting florence demanded mrs collier this is the table where sir charles sits and writes letters on her majestys service and presses these buttons and warships spring up in perfect shoals oh robert she sighed i do wish you had been a governor the young lady called florence stood looking down into the great armchair in front of the governors table may i she asked she slid fearlessly in between the oak arms of the chair and smiled about her afterwards sir charles remembered her as she appeared at that moment with the red leather of the chair behind her with her gloved hands resting on the carved oak and her head on one side smiling up at him she gazed with large eyes at the blue linen envelopes the stiff documents in red tape the tray of black sand and the goosequill pens i am now the countess zika she announced no i am diana of the crossways and i mean to discover a state secret and sell it to the daily telegraph sir charles she demanded if i press this electric button is war declared anywhere or what happens that second button said sir charles after deliberate scrutiny is the one which communicates with the pantry the governor would not consider their returning to the yacht for luncheon you might decide to steam away as suddenly as you came he said gallantly and i cannot take that chance this is bachelors hall so you must pardon my people if things do not go very smoothly he himself led them to the great guestchamber where there had not been a guest for many years and he noticed as though for the first time that the halls through which they passed were bare and that the floor was littered with unpacked boxes and guncases he also observed for the first time that maps of the colony with the coffeeplantations and mahogany belt marked in different inks were not perhaps so decorative as pictures and mirrors and family portraits and he could have wished that the native servants had not stared so admiringly at the guests nor directed each other in such aggressive whispers on those other occasions when the wives of the councillors came to the semiannual dinners the native servants had seemed adequate to all that was required of them he recollected with a flush that in the town these semiannual dinners were described as banquets he wondered if to these visitors from the outside world it was all equally provincial but their enjoyment was apparently unfeigned and generous it was evident that they had known each other for many years yet they received every remark that any of them made as though it had been pronounced by a new and interesting acquaintance sir charles found it rather difficult to keep up with the talk across the table they changed the subject so rapidly and they half spoke of so many things without waiting to explain he could not at once grasp the fact that people who had no other position in the world save that of observers were speaking so authoritatively of public men and public measures he found to his delight that for the first time in several years he was not presiding at his own table and that his guests seemed to feel no awe of him whats the use of a yacht nowadays collier was saying whats the use of a yacht when you can go to sleep in a wagonlit at the gare du nord and wake up at vladivostok and look at the time it saves eleven days to gib six to port said and fifteen to colombo there you are only halfway around and youre already sixteen days behind the man in the wagonlit but nobody wants to go to vladivostok said miss cameron or anywhere else in a wagonlit but with a yacht you can explore outoftheway places and you meet new and interesting people we wouldnt have met sir charles if we had waited for a wagonlit she bowed her head to the governor and he smiled with gratitude he had lost mr collier somewhere in the indian ocean and he was glad she had brought them back to the windless isles once more and again i repeat that the answer to that is why not said the march hare remarked mr collier determinedly the answer as an answer did not strike sir charles as a very good one but the ladies seemed to comprehend for miss cameron said did i tell you about meeting him at oxford just a few months before his death at a childrens teaparty he was so sweet and understanding with them two women tried to lionize him and he ran away and played with the children i was more glad to meet him than any one i can think of not as a personage you know but because i felt grateful to him yes that way distinctly said mrs collier i should have felt that way towards mrs ewing more than any one else i know jackanapes remarked collier shortly a brutal assault upon the feelings i say some one else said it before you robert mrs collier commented calmly perhaps sir charles met him at apia they all turned and looked at him he wished he could say he had met him at apia he did not quite see how they had made their way from a childrens tea party at oxford to the south pacific islands but he was anxious to join in somewhere with a clever observation but they never seemed to settle in one place sufficiently long for him to recollect what he knew of it he hoped they would get around to the west coast of africa in time he had been governor of sierra leone for five years his success that night at dinner on the yacht was far better the others seemed a little tired after the hours of sightseeing to which he had treated them and they were content to listen in the absence of mr clarges who knew them word by word he felt free to tell his three stories of life at sierra leone he took his time in the telling and could congratulate himself that his efforts had never been more keenly appreciated he felt that he was holding his own the night was still and warm and while the men lingered below at the table the two women mounted to the deck and watched the lights of the town as they vanished one by one and left the moon in unchallenged possession of the harbor for a long time miss cameron stood silent looking out across the bay at the shore and the hills beyond a fish splashed near them and the sound of oars rose from the mist that floated above the water until they were muffled in the distance the palms along the shore glistened like silver and overhead the southern cross shone white against a sky of purple the silence deepened and continued for so long a time that mrs collier felt its significance and waited for the girl to end it miss cameron raised her eyes to the stars and frowned i am not surprised that he is content to stay here she said are you it is so beautiful so wonderfully beautiful for a moment mrs collier made no answer two years is a long time florence she said and he is all i have he is not only my only brother he is the only living soul who is related to me that makes it harder the girl seemed to find some implied reproach in the speech for she turned and looked at her friend closely do you feel it is my fault alice she asked the older woman shook her head how could it be your fault she answered if you couldnt love him enough to marry him you couldnt thats all but that is no reason why he should have hidden himself from all of us even if he could not stand being near you caring as he did he need not have treated me so we have done all we can do and robert has been more than fine about it he and his agents have written to every consul and business house in central america and i dont believe there is a city that he hasnt visited he has sent him money and letters to every bank and to every postoffice the girl raised her head quickly but he never calls for either mrs collier continued for i know that if he had read my letters he would have come home the girl lifted her head as though she were about to speak and then turned and walked slowly away after a few moments she returned and stood with her hands resting on the rail looking down into the water i wrote him two letters she said in the silence of the night her voice was unusually clear and distinct i you make me wonder if they ever reached him mrs collier with her eyes fixed upon the girl rose slowly from her chair and came towards her she reached out her hand and touched miss cameron on the arm florence she said in a whisper have you the girl raised her head slowly and lowered it again yes she answered i told him to come back to come back to me alice she cried i i begged him to come back she tossed her hands apart and again walked rapidly away leaving the older woman standing motionless a moment later when sir charles and mr collier stepped out upon the deck they discovered the two women standing close together two white ghostly figures in the moonlight and as they advanced towards them they saw mrs collier take the girl for an instant in her arms sir charles was asking miss cameron how long she thought an immigrant should be made to work for his freehold allotment when mr collier and his wife rose at the same moment and departed on separate errands they met most mysteriously in the shadow of the wheelhouse what is it is anything wrong with florence collier asked anxiously not homesick is she mrs collier put her hands on her husbands shoulders and shook her head wrong no thank heaven its as right as right can be she cried shes written to him to come back but hes never answered and so and now its all right mr collier gazed blankly at his wifes upturned face well i dont see that he remonstrated whats the use of her being in love with him now when he cant be found what why didnt she love him two years ago when he was where you could get at him at her house for instance he was there most of his time she would have saved a lot of trouble however he added energetically this makes it absolutely necessary to find that young man and bring him to his senses well search this place for the next few days and then well try the mainland again i think ill offer a reward for him and have it printed in spanish and paste it up in all the plazas we might add a line in english she has changed her mind that would bring him home wouldnt it dont be unfeeling robert said mrs collier her husband raised his eyes appealingly and addressed himself to the moon i ask you now he complained is that fair to a man who has spent six months on muleback trying to round up a prodigal brotherinlaw that same evening after the ladies had gone below mr collier asked sir charles to assist him in his search for his wifes brother and sir charles heartily promised his most active cooperation there were several americans at work in the interior he said as overseers on the coffeeplantations it was possible that the runaway might be among them it was only that morning sir charles remembered that an american had been at work repairing his lawnmower as he considerately expressed it he would send for him on the morrow but on the morrow the slave of the lawnmower was reported on the list of prisoners as missing and corporal mallon was grieved but refused to consider himself responsible sir charles himself had allowed the vagrant unusual freedom and the vagrant had taken advantage of it and probably escaped to the hills or up the river to the logwood camp telegraph a description of him to inspector garrett sir charles directed and to the heads of all up stations and when he returns bring him to me so great was his zeal that sir charles further offered to join mr collier in his search among the outlying plantations but mr collier preferred to work alone he accordingly set out at once armed with letters to the different district inspectors and in his absence delegated to sir charles the pleasant duty of caring for the wants of miss cameron and his wife sir charles regarded the latter as deserving of all sympathy for mr collier in his efforts to conceal the fact from the governor that florence cameron was responsible or in any way concerned in the disappearance of the missing man had been too mysterious sir charles was convinced that the fugitive had swindled his brotherinlaw and stolen his sisters jewels the days which followed were to the governor days and nights of strange discoveries he recognized that the missionaries from the great outside world had invaded his shores and disturbed his gods and temples their religion of progress and activity filled him with doubt and unrest in this century mr collier had declared nothing can stand still its the same with a corporation or a country or a man we must either march ahead or fall out we cant mark time what exactly certainly not sir charles had answered but in his heart he knew that he himself had been marking time under these soft tropical skies while the world was pushing forward the thought had not disturbed him before now he felt guilty he conceived a sudden intolerance if not contempt for the little village of whitewashed houses for the rafts of mahogany and of logwood that bumped against the pierheads for the sacks of coffee piled high like barricades under the corrugated zinc sheds along the wharf each season it had been his pride to note the increase in these exports the development of the resources of his colony had been a work in which he had felt that the colonial secretary took an immediate interest he had believed that he was one of the important wheels of the machinery which moved the british empire and now in a day he was undeceived it was forced upon him that to the eyes of the outside world he was only a greengrocer operating on a large scale he provided the british public with coffee for its breakfast with drugs for its stomach and with strange woods for its diningroom furniture and walkingsticks he combated this ignominious characterization of his position indignantly the new arrivals certainly gave him no hint that they considered him so lightly this thought greatly comforted him for he felt that in some way he was summoning to his aid all of his assets and resources to meet an expert and final valuation as he ranged them before him he was disturbed and happy to find that the value he placed upon them was the value they would have in the eyes of a young girl not a girl of the shy motherobeying manworshipping english type but a girl such as miss cameron seemed to be a girl who could understand what you were trying to say before you said it who could take an interest in rates of exchange and preside at a dinner table who was charmingly feminine and clever and who was respectful of herself and of others in fact he decided with a flush that miss cameron herself was the young girl he had in his mind why not he asked the question came to him in his room the sixth night of their visit and he strode over to the long pierglass and stood studying himself critically for the first time in years he was still a finelooking wellkept man his hair was thin but that fact did not show and his waist was lost but riding and tennis would set that right he had means outside of his official salary and there was the title such as it was lady greville the wife of the birthday knight sounded as well as lady greville the marchioness and americans cared for these things he doubted whether this particular american would do so but he was adding up all he had to offer and that was one of the assets he was sure she would not be content to remain mistress of the windless isles nor indeed did he longer care to be master there now that he had inhaled this quick stirring breath from the outer world he would resign and return and mix with the world again he would enter parliament a man so well acquainted as himself with the gold coast of africa and with the trade of the west indies must always be of value in the lower house this value would be recognized no doubt and he would become at first an undersecretary for the colonies and then in time colonial secretary and a cabinet minister she would like that he thought and after that place had been reached all things were possible for years he had not dreamed such dreams not since he had been a clerk in the foreign office they seemed just as possible now as they had seemed real then and just as near he felt it was all absolutely in his own hands he descended to the diningroom with the air of a man who already felt the cares of high responsibility upon his shoulders his head was erect and his chest thrown forward he was ten years younger his manner was alert assured and gracious as he passed through the halls he was impatient of the familiar settings of government house they seemed to him like the furnishings of a hotel where he had paid his bill and where his luggage was lying strapped for departure in the hallway in his library he saw on his table a number of papers lying open waiting for his signature the dogtax among the others he smiled to remember how important it had seemed to him in the past in that past of indolence and easy content now he was on fire to put this rekindled ambition to work to tell the woman who had lighted it that it was all from her and for her that without her he had existed that now he had begun to live they had never found him so delighfulsic as he appeared that night he was like a man on the eve of a holiday he made a jest of his past efforts he made them see as he now saw it for the first time that side of the life of the windless isles which was narrow and petty even ridiculous he talked of big men in a big way he criticised and expounded and advanced his own theories of government and the proper control of an empire collier who had returned from his unsuccessful search of the plantations shook his head its a pity you are not in london now he said sincerely they need some one there who has been on the spot they cant direct the colonies from what they know of them in whitehall sir charles fingered the dinner cloth nervously and when he spoke fixed his eyes anxiously upon miss cameron do you know he said i have been thinking of doing that very thing of resigning my post here and going back entering parliament and all the rest of it his declaration met with a unanimous chorus of delight miss cameron nodded her head with eager approval yes if i were a man that is where i should wish to be she said at the heart of it why whatever you say in the house of commons is heard all over the world the next morning sir charles felt the blood tingle in his pulses he had not been so stirred in years her words ran to his head like wine mr collier raised his glass heres to our next meeting he said on the terrace of the house of commons but miss cameron interrupted no to the colonial secretary she amended oh yes they assented rising and so drank his health smiling down upon him with kind friendly glances and goodwill to the colonial secretary they said sir charles clasped the arms of his chair tightly with his hands his eyes were half closed and his lips pressed into a grim confident smile he felt that a single word from her would make all that they suggested possible if she cared for such things they were hers he had them to give they were ready lying at her feet he knew that the power had always been with him lying dormant in his heart and brain it had only waited for the touch of the princess to wake it into life the american visitors were to sail for the mainland the next day but he had come to know them so well in the brief period of their visit that he felt he dared speak to her that same night at least he could give her some word that would keep him in her mind until they met again in london or until she had considered her answer he could not expect her to answer at once she could take much time what else had he to do now but to wait for her answer it was now all that made life collier and his wife had left the veranda and had crossed the lawn towards the waters edge the moonlight fell full upon them with all the splendor of the tropics and lit the night with a brilliant dazzling radiance from where miss cameron sat on the veranda in the shadow sir charles could see only the white outline of her figure and the indolent movement of her fan collier had left his wife and was returning slowly towards the step sir charles felt that if he meant to speak he must speak now and quickly he rose and placed himself beside her in the shadow and the girl turned her head inquiringly and looked up at him but on the instant the hush of the night was broken by a sharp challenge and the sound of mens voices raised in anger there was the noise of a struggle on the gravel and from the corner of the house the two sentries came running dragging between them a slight figure that fought and wrestled to be free sir charles exclaimed with indignant impatience and turning strode quickly to the head of the steps what does this mean he demanded what are you doing with that man why did you bring him here as the soldiers straightened to attention their prisoner ceased to struggle and stood with his head bent on his chest his sombrero was pulled down low across his forehead he was crawling through the bushes sir charles the soldier panted watching that gentleman sir he nodded over his shoulder towards collier i challenged and he jumped to run and we collared him he resisted sir charles the mind of the governor was concerned with other matters than trespassers well take him to the barracks then he said report to me in the morning that will do the prisoner wheeled eagerly without further show of resistance and the soldiers closed in on him on either side but as the three men moved away together their faces which had been in shadow were now turned towards mr collier who was advancing leisurely and with silent footsteps across the grass he met them face to face and as he did so the prisoner sprang back and threw out his arms in front of him with the gesture of a man who entreats silence mr collier halted as though struck to stone and the two men confronted each other without moving good god mr collier whispered he turned stiffly and slowly as though in a trance and beckoned to his wife who had followed him alice he called he stepped backwards towards her and taking her hand in one of his drew her towards the prisoner here he is he said they heard her cry henry with the fierceness of a call for help and saw her rush forward and stumble into the arms of the prisoner and their two heads were bent close together collier ran up the steps and explained breathlessly and now he gasped in conclusion whats to be done whats he arrested for is it bailable what good heavens exclaimed sir charles miserably it is my fault entirely i assure you i had no idea how could i but i should have known i should have guessed it he dismissed the sentries with a gesture that will do he said return to your posts mr collier laughed with relief then it is not serious he asked he he had no money that was all exclaimed sir charles serious certainly not upon my word im sorry the young man had released himself from his sisters embrace and was coming towards them and sir charles eager to redeem himself advanced hurriedly to greet him but the young man did not see him he was looking past him up the steps to where miss cameron stood in the shadow sir charles hesitated and drew back the young man stopped at the foot of the steps and stood with his head raised staring up at the white figure of the girl who came slowly forward it was forced upon sir charles that in spite of the fact that the young man before them had but just then been rescued from arrest that in spite of his mean garments and ragged sandals something about him the glamour that surrounds the prodigal or possibly the moonlight gave him an air of great dignity and distinction as miss cameron descended the stairs sir charles recognized for the first time that the young man was remarkably handsome and he resented it it hurt him as did also the prodigals youth and his assured bearing he felt a sudden sinking fear a weakening of all his vital forces and he drew in his breath slowly and deeply but no one noticed him they were looking at the tall figure of the prodigal standing with his hat at his hip and his head thrown back holding the girl with his eyes collier touched sir charles on the arm and nodded his head towards the library come he whispered let us old people leave them together theyve a good deal to say sir charles obeyed in silence and crossing the library to the great oak chair seated himself and leaned wearily on the table before him he picked up one of the goose quills and began separating it into little pieces mr collier was pacing up and down biting excitedly on the end of his cigar well this has certainly been a great night he said and it is all due to you sir charles all due to you yes they have you to thank for it they said sir charles he knew that it had to come he wanted the man to strike quickly they yes florence cameron and henry mr collier answered henry went away because she wouldnt marry him she didnt care for him then but afterwards she cared now theyre reunited and so theyre happy and my wife is more than happy and i wont have to bother any more and its all right and all through you i am glad said sir charles there was a long pause which the men each deep in his own thoughts did not notice you will be leaving now i suppose sir charles asked he was looking down examining the broken pen in his hand mr collier stopped in his walk and considered yes i suppose they will want to get back he said i shall be sorry myself and you what will you do sir charles started slightly he had not yet thought what he would do his eyes wandered over the neglected work which had accumulated on the desk before him only an hour before he had thought of it as petty and little as something unworthy of his energy since that time what change had taken place in him for him everything had changed he answered but in him there had been no change and if this thing which the girl had brought into his life had meant the best in life it must always mean that she had been an inspiration she must remain his spring of action was he a slave he asked himself that he should rebel was he a boy that he could turn his love to aught but the best account he must remember her not as the woman who had crushed his spirit but as she who had helped him who had lifted him up to something better and finer he would make sacrifice in her name it would be in her name that he would rise to high places and accomplish much good she would not know this but he would know he rose and brushed the papers away from him with an impatient sweep of the hand i shall follow out the plan of which i spoke at dinner he answered i shall resign here and return home and enter parliament mr collier laughed admiringly i love the way you english take your share of public life he said the way you spend yourselves for your country and give your brains your lives everything you have all for the empire through the open window sir charles saw miss cameron half hidden by the vines of the veranda the moonlight falling about her transformed her into a figure which was ideal mysterious and elusive like a woman in a dream he shook his head wearily for the empire he asked the last ride together a sketch containing three points of view what the poet laureate wrote there are girls in the gold reef city there are mothers and children too and they cry hurry up for pity so what can a brave man do i suppose we were wrong were mad men still i think at the judgment day when god sifts the good from the bad men therell be something more to say what more the lord chief justice found to say in this case we know the immediate consequence of your crime it has been the loss of human life it has been the disturbance of public peace it has been the creation of a certain sense of distrust of public professions and of public faith the sentence of this court therefore is that as to you leander starr jameson you be confined for a period of fifteen months without hard labor that you sir john willoughby have ten months imprisonment and that you etc etc london times july th what the hon reggie blake thought about it h m holloway prison july th i am going to keep a diary while i am in prison that is if they will let me i never kept one before because i hadnt the time when i was home on leave there was too much going on to bother about it and when i was up country i always came back after a days riding so tired that i was too sleepy to write anything and now that i have the time i wont have anything to write about i fancy that more things happened to me today than are likely to happen again for the next eight months so i will make this day take up as much room in the diary as it can i am writing this on the back of the paper the warder uses for his official reports while he is hunting up cells to put us in we came down on him rather unexpectedly and he is nervous of course i had prepared myself for this after a fashion but now i see that somehow i never really did think i would be in here and all my friends outside and everything going on just the same as though i wasnt alive somewhere its like telling yourself that your horse cant possibly pull off a race so that you wont mind so much if he doesnt but you always feel just as bad when he comes in a loser a man cant fool himself into thinking one way when he is hoping the other but i am glad it is over and settled it was a great bore not knowing your luck and having the thing hanging over your head every morning when you woke up indeed it was quite a relief when the counsel got all through arguing over those proclamations and the chief justice summed up but i nearly went to sleep when i found he was going all over it again to the jury i didnt understand about those proclamations myself and ill lay a fiver the jury didnt either the colonel said he didnt i couldnt keep my mind on what russell was explaining about and i got to thinking how much old justice hawkins looked like the counsel in alice in wonderland when they tried the knave of spades for stealing the tarts he had just the same sort of a beak and the same sort of a wig and i wondered why he had his wig powdered and the others didnt pollocks wig had a hole in the top you could see it when he bent over to take notes he was always taking notes i dont believe he understood about those proclamations either he never seemed to listen anyway the chief justice certainly didnt love us very much thats sure and he wasnt going to let anybody else love us either i felt quite the christian martyr when sir edward was speaking in defence he made it sound as though we were all a lot of adelphi heroes and ought to be promoted and have medals but when lord russell started in to read the riot act at us i began to believe that hanging was too good for me im sure i never knew i was disturbing the peace of nations it seems like such a large order for a subaltern but the worst was when they made us stand up before all those people to be sentenced i must say i felt shaky about the knees then not because i was afraid of what was coming but because it was the first time i had ever been pointed out before people and made to feel ashamed and having those girls there too looking at one that wasnt just fair to us it made me feel about ten years old and i remembered how the head master used to call me to his desk and say blake senior two pages of horace and keep in bounds for a week and then i heard our names and the months and my name and eight months imprisonment and there was a bustle and murmur and the tipstaves cried order in the court and the judges stood up and shook out their big red skirts as though they were shaking off the contamination of our presence and rustled away and i sat down wondering how long eight months was and wishing theyd given me as much as they gave jameson they put us in a room together then and our counsel said how sorry they were and shook hands and went off to dinner and left us i thought they might have waited with us and been a little late for dinner just that once but no one waited except a lot of costers outside whom we did not know it was eight oclock and still quite light when we came out and there was a line of fourwheelers and a hansom ready for us id been hoping they would take us out by the strand entrance just because id like to have seen it again but they marched us instead through the main quadrangle a beastly gloomy courtyard that echoed and out into carey street such a dirty gloomy street the costers and clerks set up a sort of a cheer when we came out and one of them cried god bless you sir to the doctor but i was sorry they cheered it seemed like kicking against the umpires decision the colonel and i got into a hansom together and we trotted off into chancery lane and turned into holborn most of the shops were closed and the streets looked empty but there was a lighted clockface over mooneys publichouse and the hands stood at a quarter past eight i didnt know where holloway was and was hoping they would have to take us through some decent streets to reach it but we didnt see a part of the city that meant anything to me or that i would choose to travel through again neither of us talked and i imagined that the people in the streets knew we were going to prison and i kept my eyes on the enamel card on the back of the apron i suppose i read twowheeled hackney carriage if hired and discharged within the fourmile limit s at least a hundred times i got more sensible after a bit and when we had turned into grays inn road i looked up and saw a tram in front of us with holloway road and kings x painted on the steps and the colonel saw it about the same time i fancy for we each looked at the other and the colonel raised his eyebrows it showed us that at least the cabman knew where we were going they might have taken us for a turn through the west end first i think the colonel said id like to have had a look around wouldnt you this isnt a cheerful neighborhood is it there were a lot of children playing in st andrews gardens and a crowd of them ran out just as we passed shrieking and laughing over nothing the way kiddies do and that was about the only pleasant sight in the ride i had quite a turn when we came to the new hospital just beyond for i thought it was holloway and it came over me what eight months in such a place meant i believe if i hadnt pulled myself up sharp id have jumped out into the street and run away it didnt last more than a few seconds but i dont want any more like them i was afraid afraid theres no use pretending it was anything else i was in a dumb silly funk and i turned sick inside and shook as i have seen a horse shake when he shies at nothing and sweats and trembles down his sides during those few seconds it seemed to be more than i could stand i felt sure that i couldnt do it that id go mad if they tried to force me the idea was so terrible of not being master over your own legs and arms to have your flesh and blood and what brains god gave you buried alive in stone walls as though they were in a safe with a timelock on the door set for eight months ahead theres nothing to be afraid of in a stone wall really but its the idea of the thing of not being free to move about especially to a chap that has always lived in the open as i have and has had men under him it was no wonder i was in a funk for a minute ill bet a fiver the others were too if theyll only own up to it i dont mean for long but just when the idea first laid hold of them anyway it was a good lesson to me and if i catch myself thinking of it again ill whistle or talk to myself out loud and think of something cheerful and i dont mean to be one of those chaps who spends his time in jail counting the stones in his cell or training spiders or measuring how many of his steps make a mile for madness lies that way i mean to sit tight and think of all the good times ive had and go over them in my mind very slowly so as to make them last longer and remember who was there and what we said and the jokes and all that ill go over houseparties i have been on and the times ive had in the riviera and scouting parties dr jim led up country when we were taking matabele land they say that if youre good here they give you things to read after a month or two and then i can read up all those instructive books that a fellow never does read until hes laid up in bed but thats crowding ahead a bit i must keep to what happened today we struck york road at the back of the great western terminus and i half hoped we might see some chap we knew coming or going away i would like to have waved my hand to him it would have been fun to have seen his surprise the next morning when he read in the paper that he had been bowing to jailbirds and then i would like to have cheated the tipstaves out of just one more friendly goodby i wanted to say goodby to somebody but i really couldnt feel sorry to see the last of any one of those we passed in the streets they were such a dirty unhappylooking lot and the railroad wall ran on forever apparently and we might have been in a foreign country for all we knew of it there were just sooty gray brick tenements and gasworks on one side and the railroad cutting on the other and semaphores and telegraph wires overhead and smoke and grime everywhere it looked exactly like the sort of street that should lead to a prison and it seemed a pity to take a smart hansom and a good cob into it it was just a bit different from our last ride together when we rode through the night from krugersdorp with hundreds of horses hoofs pounding on the soft veldt behind us and the carbines clanking against the stirrups as they swung on the sling belts we were being hunted then harassed on either side scurrying for our lives like the derby dog in a racetrack when every one hoots him and no man steps out to help we were sick for sleep sick for food lashed by the rain and we knew that we were beaten but we were free still and under open skies with the derricks of the rand rising like gallows on our left and johannesburg only fifteen miles away
