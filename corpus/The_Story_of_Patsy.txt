virtue kindles at the touch of joy carlotty griggs being a butterfly paulinas goodmornings to johnny cass vii patsy finds his three lost years he sat silently by the window tail piece chapter i the silver street kindergarten it makes a heavenwide difference whether the soul of the child is regarded as a piece of blank paper to be written upon or as a living power to be quickened by sympathy to be educated by truth it had been a long wearisome day at the free kindergarten and i was alone in the silent deserted room gone were all the little heads yellow and black curly and smooth the dancing restless curious eyes the too mischievous naughty eager hands and noisy feet the merry voices that had made the great room human but now left it quiet and empty eighty pairs of tiny boots had clattered down the stairs eighty baby woes had been relieved eighty little torn coats pulled on with patient hands eighty shabby little hats not one with a strawberry mark to distinguish it from any other had been distributed with infinite discrimination among their possessors numberless sloppy kisses had been pressed upon a willing cheek or hand and another day was over no not quite over after all a murderous yell from below brought me to my feet and i flew like an anxious hen to my brood one small quarrel in the hall very small but it must be inquired into on the way to the greater one mercedes mcgafferty had taunted jenny crawhall with being irish the fact that she herself had been born in cork about three years previous did not trouble her in the least jenny in a voice choked with sobs and with the stamp of a tiny foot was announcing hotly that she was not irish no sech a thing she was plesberterian i was not quite clear whether this was a theological or racial controversy but i settled it speedily and they ran off together hand in hand i hastened to the steps the yells had come from joe guinee and mike higgins who were fighting for the possession of a banana a banana too that should have been fought for if at all many days before a banana better suited in its respectable old age to peaceful consumption than the fortunes of war my unexpected apparition had such an effect that i might have been an avenging angel the boys dropped the banana simultaneously and it fell to the steps quite exhausted in such a condition that whoever proved to be in the right would get but little enjoyment from it o my boys my boys i exclaimed did you forget so soon what shall we do must miss kate follow you everywhere if that is the only way in which you can be good we might as well give up trying must i watch you to the corner every day no matter how tired i am two grimy little shirt bosoms heaved with shame and anger two pairs of eyes hid themselves under protecting lids two pairs of moist and stained hands sought the shelter of charitable pockets then the cause of war was declared by mike sulkily joe guinee hooked my bernanner i never said joe hotly i swapped with him fr a peach n he et the peach at noontime n then wouldnt gimme no bernanner the peach warnt no good mike interpolated swiftly seeing my expression it warnt no good miss kate when i come to eat it i had ter chuck half of it away nd then joe guinee went t my lunch bucket and hooked my bernanner i sat down on the top step motioned the culprits to do likewise and then began dispensing justice tempered with mercy for the twentyfifth time that day mike you say joe took your banana yes m he hooked it same thing you have your words and i have mine and ive told you before that mine mean just as much and sound a little better but i thought that you changed that banana for a peach and ate the peach i did then why wasnt that banana joes you had taken his peach he hadnt oughter hooked took it out o my bucket no and you ought not to have put it into your bucket he hooked took what warnt his you kept what wasnt yours how do you expect to have a good fruit store either of you by and by and have people buy your things if you havent any idea of making a good square trade do try to be honest and if you make an exchange stick to it fighting over a thing never makes it any better look at that banana is it any good to either of you now pause the still small voice was busy but no sound was heard save the distant whistle of the janitor i could bring another one to joe tomorrer said mike looking at his ragged boot and scratching it along the edge of the step i dont want yer to f the peach was sour n you had ter chuck it away responded joe amiably yes i think he ought to bring the banana he made the trade with his eyes open and the peach didnt look sour for i saw you squeezing it when you ought to have been singing your morning hymn i thought you would get into trouble with it then now is it all right mike thats good and joe dont go poking into other peoples lunch baskets if you hadnt done that you silly boy i philosophized whimsically for my own edification you would have been a victim but you descended to the level of your adversary and you are now simply another little rascal we walked down the quiet narrow street to the corner a proceeding i had intended to omit that day as it was always as exciting as an afternoon tea and i did not feel equal to the social chats that would be pressed upon me by the neighborhood ladies one of my good policemen was there as usual and saluted me profoundly he had carried the last baby over the crossing and guided all the venturesome small boys through the maze of trucks and horsecars a difficult and thankless task as they absolutely courted decapitation it being an unwritten law of conduct that each boy should weave his way through the horses legs if practicable and if not should see how near he could come to grazing the wheels exactly at twelve oclock and again at two each day in rain or sunshine a couple of huge fatherly persons in brass buttons appeared on that corner and assisted us in getting our youngsters into streets of safety nobody had ever asked them to come their chief had not detailed them for that special duty and i could never have been bold enough to suggest that a guardian of the peace with an immaculate uniform should carry to and fro a crowd of small urchins with dusty boots and sticky hands but everybody loved that silver street corner where the quiet little street met the larger noisy one not a horsecar driver but looked at his brake and glanced up the street before he took his car across the truckmen all drove slowly calling hi there genially to any youngster within half a block and it was a pleasant scene enough to one who had a part in it who was able to care for simple people who could be glad to see them happy sorry to see them sad and willing to live among them a part of each day and bring a little sunshine and hope into their lives good afternoon mr donohue all safely across all safe miss sorry you troubled to come down miss i can be depended on for this corner miss an ye niver need bother yerself about the childern after yeve once turned em loose miss an might i be so bold seein as how i might not have a better chance would ye be so kind as to favor me with yer last name miss the truth bein that ivery one calls ye miss kate an the policemen of this ward is gettin up rather a chice thing in christmas cards to presint to ye come christmas because if yell excuse the liberty miss they do regard you as belongin to the special police i laughed thanked him for the intended honor which had been mentioned to me before and gave him my card not without a spasm of terror lest the entire police force should invade my dwelling the baker lady across the street caught my eye smiled and sent over a hot bun in a brown paper bag the grocery lady called over in a clear ringing tone would you be so kind m as to step inside on your way ome and fetch enry a bit of work m enry as the ooping cough m and i dont know owever im goin to keep im at ome another day m he pines for school so i give a nod which means certainly mrs weiss appeared at her window above the grocery with a cloth wound about her head appeared and then vanished mysteriously very well mr weiss you know what to expect i gave you fair warning last time and i shall be as good as my word good heavens is that it cant be yes it is a new mcdonald baby at the saloon door and there was such a superfluity of the mcdonald clan before one more wretched little human soul precipitated without a welcome into such a family circle as that it set me thinking as i walked slowly back and toiled up the steps i suppose most people would call this a hard and monotonous life i mused there is an eternal regularity in the succession of amusing and heartbreaking incidents but it is not monotonous for i am too close to all the problems that bother this workaday world so close that they touch me on every side no missionary can come so near to these people i am so close that i can feel the daily throb of their need and they can feel the throb of my sympathy oh it is work fit for a saviour of men and what what can i do with it i sank into my small rockingchair and clasping my arms over my head bent it upon the table and closed my eyes the dazzling california sunshine streamed in at the western windows touched the goldfish globes with rosy glory glittered on the brass birdcages flung a splendid halo round the meek head of the madonna above my table and poured a flood of grateful heat over my shoulders the clatter of a tin pail outside the door the uncertain turning of a knob by a hand too small to grasp it i forgitted my lunch bucket n had to come back five blocks goodby miss kate kiss goodby little man run along another step and a curly little red head pushes itself apologetically through the open door you never dave me back my string and buzzer miss kate here it is leave it at home tomorrow if you can dear will you silence again this time continued and profound mrs weiss was evidently not coming today to ask me if she should give blow for blow in her next connubial fracas i was thankful to be spared until the morrow when i should perhaps have greater strength to attack mr weiss and see what i could do for mrs pulaskis dropsy and find a mourning bonnet and shawl for the gabilondos funeral and clothes for the new higgins twins oh mrs higgins would not one have sufficed you the events of the day march through my tired brain so tired so tired and just a bit discouraged and sad too had i been patient enough with the children had i forgiven cheerfully enough the seventy times seven sins of omission and commission had i poured out the love bountiful disinterested longsuffering of which god shows us the measure and fullness had i but the sun dropped lower and lower behind the dull brown hills and exhausted nature found a momentary forgetfulness in sleep chapter ii patsy comes to call when aither bairnies are hushed to their hame by aunty or cousin or frecky granddame wha stands last and lanely an naebody carin tis the puir doited loonie the mitherless bairn suddenly i was awakened by a subdued and apologetic cough starting from my nap i sat bolt upright in astonishment for quietly ensconced in a small red chair by my table and sitting still as a mouse was the weirdest apparition ever seen in human form a boy seeming how many years old shall i say for in some ways he might have been a century old when he was born looking in fact as if he had never been young and would never grow older he had a shrunken somewhat deformed body a curious melancholy face and such a head of dustcolored hair that he might have been shocked for a doormat the sole redeemers of the countenance were two big pathetic soft dark eyes so appealing that one could hardly meet their glance without feeling instinctively in ones pocket for a biscuit or a tencent piece but such a face he had apparently made an attempt at a toilet without the aid of a mirror for there was a clean circle like a racetrack round his nose which member reared its crest untouched and grimy from the centre like a sort of judges stand while the dusky rim outside represented the space for audience seats i gazed at this astonishing diagram of a countenance for a minute spellbound thinking it resembled nothing so much as a geological map marked with coal deposits and as for his clothes his jacket was ragged and arbitrarily docked at the waist while one of his trouserslegs was slit up at the side and flapped hither and thither when he moved like a lugsail in a calm well sir said i at length waking up to my duties as hostess did you come to see me yes i did let me think i dont seem to remember i am so sleepy are you one of my little friends no i

good time and youll try to do a few things to please me wont you patsy looked embarrassed ate his bit of bun in silence and after twirling his hatcrown for a few seconds hitched out of the door with a backward glance and muttered remark which must have been intended for farewell chapter iii two prentice hands at philanthropy with aching hands and bleeding feet we dig and heap lay stone on stone we bear the burden and the heat of the long day and wish t were done not till the hours of light return all we have built do we discern patsy had scarcely gone when the door opened again the least bit and a sunny face looked in that of my friend and helper not gone yet kate no but i thought i sent you away long ago yes i know but ive been to see danny kerns mother there is nothing to be done we must do our best and leave it there was that a boy i met on the stairs yes that is he is a boy in the sense that he is not a girl oh helen such a story we must take him she sank helplessly on one of the childrens tables now my dear guide philosopher and friend did you happen to notice my babies this morning they were legion our mothers must have heard that the flower mission intended giving us some thanksgiving dinners for there were our five inevitable little catspaws the identical five that applied just before the christmas tree disappeared in vacation turned up the day before we went to the mechanics fair were lost to sight the day after presented themselves previous to the woodwards garden expedition and then went into retirement till today where am i going to sit another child pray they were two in a seat and a dozen on the floor this morning it isnt fair to them in one sense for they dont get half enough attention you are right dear work half done is worse than wasted but it isnt fair to this child to leave him where he is oh i know i feel fridayish to tell the truth i shall love humanity again by monday have we money for more chairs or benches certainly not youll have to print an appeal for chairs and the children may wear out the floor sitting on it before the right people read it yes and oh helen a printed appeal is such a dead thing after all if i could only fix on a printed page danny kerns smile when he conquered his temper yesterday put into type that hand clasp of mrs finnigans that sent such a thrill of promise to our hearts show a subscriber mrs guinees quivering lips when she thanked us for the change in joe why we shouldnt need money very long that is true what a week we have had kate like a little piece of the millennium you must not be disappointed if next week isnt as good that could hardly be lets see mrs daniels began it on monday morning didnt she by giving the caps for the boys yes groaned helen dismally a generous but misguided benefactress fortythree caps precisely alike save as to size what scenes of carnage we shall witness when we distribute them three times a day we must remedy that by sewing labels into the crowns each marked with the childs name in indelible ink exactly what a charming task i shall have to write my cherubs names i suppose most of them will take a yard of tape apiece i already recall paulina strozynski mercedes mcgafferty and sigismund braunschweiger and i maria virginia de rejas perkins halfdan christiansen and americo vespucci garibaldi this is our greatest misfortune since the donation of the thirtyseven little red plaid shawls well goodnight by the way whats his name patsy dennis i shall take him ill tell you more on monday please step into gilberts and buy a comfortable little caneseated armchair larger than these and ask one of your good samaritans to make a soft cushion for it well give him the table that we had made for johnny cass poor johnny i am sorry he has a successor so soon in five minutes i was taking my homeward walk mind and heart full of my elfish visitor with his strange and ancient thoughts his sharp speeches and queer fancies would he ever come back or would one of those terrible spasms end his life before i was permitted to help and ease his crooked body or pour a bit of motherlove into his starved little heart illustration miss helen chapter iv behind the scenes some children are like little human scrawlbooks blotted all over with the sins and mistakes of their ancestors monday morning came as mornings do come bringing to the overworked body and mind a certain languor difficult to shake off as i walked down the dirty little street with its rows of oldclothes shops saloons and secondhandfurniture stores i called several of my laggards and gave them a friendly warning quarter of nine mrs finnigan bless me soul darlin well i will hurry up my childern that i will but the baby was that bad with whoopincough last night that i never got three winks meself darlin all right never mind the apron let jimmy walk on with me and i will give him one at school jimmy trots proudly at my side munching a bit of bakers pie and carrying my basket i drop into mrs powers suite of apartments in rosalie alley and find lafayette powers still in bed his twelveyearold sister and guardian hildegarde has overslept as usual and breakfast is not in sight mrs powers goes to a dingy office up town at eight oclock her present mission in life being the healing of the nations by means of mental science it is her fourth vocation in two years the previous ones being tissuepaper flowers lustre painting and the agency for a highclass stocking supporter i scold hildegarde roundly and she scrambles sleepily about the room to find a note that mrs powers has left for me i rejoin my court in the street and open the letter with anticipation miss kate dear maddam you complane of lafayettes never getting to school till eleven oclock it is not my affare as hildegarde has full charge of him and i never intefear but i would sujjest that if you beleeve in him he will do better your unbeleef sapps his will powers you have only reprooved him for being late why not incurrage him say by paying him cents a morning for a wile to get amung his little maits on the stroak of nine declare for good and good will work for you is one of our sayings i have not time to treet lafayette myself my busness being so engroassing but if you would take a few minites each night and deny fear along the avanues you could heel him say there is no time in the infinnit over and over before you go to sleep this will lift fear off of lafayette fear of being late and he will get there in time yours for good mrs powers mental heeler oh what a naughty ignorant amusing hypocritical pathetic world it is i tuck the note in my pocket to brighten the day for helen and we pass on as we progress we gather into our train levi jacob david moses elias and the other prophets and patriarchs who belong to our band we hasten the steps of the infant garibaldi who is devouring refuse fruit from his mothers store and stop finally to pluck a small dennis kearney from the coalhod where he has been put for safekeeping the day has really begun and with its first service the hands grow willing and the heart is filled with sunshine as the boys at my side prattle together of the percession and the sojers they saw yesterday i wish longingly that i could be transported with my tiny hosts to the sunny quiet country on this clear lovely morning illustration the boys at my side prattle together i think of my own joyous childhood spent in the sweet companionship of fishes brooks and butterflies birds crickets grasshoppers whispering trees and fragrant wild flowers and the thousand and one playfellows of nature which the good god has placed within reach of the happy country children i think of the shining eyes of my little lucys and bridgets and rachels could i turn them loose in a field of golden buttercups and daisies with sweet wild strawberries hidden at their roots of the merry glee of my dear boisterous little prophets and patriots if i could set them catching tadpoles in a clear wayside pool or hunting hens nests in the alder bushes behind the barn or pulling yellow cow lilies in the pond or wading for catoninetails with their ragged little trousers tucked above their knees and oh hardest of all to bear i think of our poor little invalids so young to struggle with languor and pain just to imagine the joy of my poor lame boys and my weary pale and peevish children so different from the brighteyed applecheeked darlings of welltodo parents mere babies who from morning till night seldom or never know what it is to cuddle down warmly into the natural rest of a mothers loving bosom monday morning came and went monday afternoon also it was now two oclock and to my surprise and disappointment patsy had not appeared the new chair with its pretty red cushion stood expectant but empty helen had put a coat of shellac on poor johnny casss table freshened up its squared top with new lines of red paint and placed a little silver vase of flowers on it our lady bountiful had come in to pay for the chair and see the boy but alas there was no boy to see the children were all ready for him they knew that he was a sick boy like johnny cass tired and not able to run and jump and that they must be good to him as they had been to johnny this was the idea of the majority but i do not deny that there was a small minority which professed no interest and promised no virtue our four walls contained a miniature world a world with its best foot forward too but it was not heaven at quarter past two i went into helens little room where she was drawing exquisite illustrations on a blackboard for next days morning talk helen the children say that a family of kennetts live at anna street and i am going to see why patsy didnt come oh yes i know that there are boys enough without running after them but we must have this particular boy whether he wants to come or not for he is sui generis he shall sit on that cushion and sew a fine seam and feast upon strawberries sugar and cream i think a taste for martyrdom is just as difficult to eradicate from the system as a taste for blood helen remarked whimsically very well run on and ill receive in your absence i could say with antony lend me your ears for i shall need them have you any commands just a few please tell paulina strozynskis big brother that he must call for her earlier and not leave her sitting on the steps so long tell mrs hickok that if she sends us another child whom she knows to be down with the chickenpox we wont take in her two youngest when theyre old enough dont give mrs slamberg any aprons she returned the little undershirts and drawers that i sent her by julie and said if it was all the same to me shed rather have something that would make a little more show and oh yes do see if you can find jacob shubeners hat he is crying down in the yard and doesnt dare go home without it very well four cases strozynski steps cruelty hickok chickenpox ingratitude slamberg aprons vanity shubener hat carelessness oh that i could fasten jacobs hat to his ear by a steel chain has he looked in the sink yes ashbarrel certainly up in the peppertree of course then some one has chucked it into the next yard and the janitor will have to climb the fence at his age oh if i could eliminate the irregular verb to chuck from the vocabulary of this school i could make out of the broken sounds of life a song and out of life itself a melody and she flew downstairs like a breeze to find the patient mr bowker mr bowker was a nice little man who had not all his wits about him but whose heart was quite intact and who swept with energy and washed windows with assiduity he belonged to the salvation army and the most striking articles of his attire when sweeping were a flamecolored flannel shirt and a shiny black hat with prepare to meet thy god on the front in large silver letters the combination of color was indescribably pictorial and as lurid and suggestive as an oldfashioned orthodox sermon as i went through the lower hall i found mr bowker assisting helen to search the coalbin dont smile she cried punch says sometimes the least likeliest place is more likelier than the most likeliest and sure enough here is the hat i should have been named deborah or miriam not helen and she hurried to dry the tears of the weeping jacob illustration here is the hat chapter v i seek patsy and meet the duchess of anna street tis pride rank pride and haughtiness of soul i make my way through the streets drinking in the glorious air breathing the perfume of the countless fruit stands and the fragrances that floated out from the open doors of the little flower stores in every block till i left all that was pleasant behind me and turned into anna street i soon found number a dirty tumbledown onestory hovel the blinds tied together with selvedges of red flannel and a rickety bell that gave a certain style to the door though it had long ceased to ring a knock brought a blackhaired beetlebrowed person to the window does mrs kennett live here no she dont i live here oh then you are not mrs kennett wall i ruther guess not this in a tone of such royal superiority and disdain that i saw in an instant i had mistaken blue blood for red i must have been misinformed then this is number cant yer see it on the door yes meekly i thought perhaps anna street had been numbered over what made yer think mis kennett lived here a little girl brought me her name written on a card mrs kennett anna street there triumphantly i might a knowed that woman d play some common trick like that now do you want ter know where mis kennett rely doos live wall she lives in the rear her numbers n i vow she gits more credit o livin in the front house n i do n i pay four dollars more rent ever see her i thought not i guess f you hed you wouldnt think of her livin in a house like this excuse me i didnt expect to make any trouble oh ive nothin agin you but just let me ketch her puttin on airs n pertendin to live like her betters thats all shes done it before but i couldnt never ketch her at it the idee of her keepin up a house like this and with a superb sniff like that of a battlehorse she disappeared from the front window of her ancestral mansion and sought one at the back which might command a view of my meeting with her rival i slid meekly through a side gate every picket of which was decorated with a small child stumbled up a dark narrow passage and found myself in a square sort of court out of which rose the rear houses so objectionable to my duchess in the front row it was not plain sailing by any means owing to the collection of tin cans and bottles through which i had to pick my way but i climbed some frail wooden steps and stood at length on the landing of number the door was open and there sat patsy minding the kennett baby a dull little lump of humanity whose brain registered impressions so slowly that it would play all day long with an old shoe without exhausting its possibilities patsy himself was dirtier than ever and much more sullen and gloomy the traces of tears on his cheeks made my heart leap into my throat oh patsy i exclaimed i am so glad to find you we expected you all day and were afraid you werent well not a word of response we have a chair all ready for you it is standing right under one of the plantshelves and there are three roses in bloom today still not a word and i had to tell the dog story without you the effect of this simple statement was very different from what i had anticipated i thought i knew what a child was likely to do under every conceivable set of circumstances but patsy was destined to be more than once a revelation to me he dashed a book of colored advertisements that he held into the farthest corner of the room threw himself on the floor at full length and beat it with his hands while he burst into a passion of tears there there he cried between his sobs i told em youd tell it i told em youd tell it i told em youd but oh i thought maybe you wouldnt his wails brought mrs kennett from a back piazza where she was washing are you the teacher o the kids guards m yes it did not strike me at the time in my anxiety what a sympathetic rendering of the german word this was but we afterwards found that kindergarten

children have gone and you and i will be alone with the sunshine and the birds and the fishes as we were the other day and i will tell you the dog story just as i told it to the other children this morning he got up slowly rubbed his tattered sleeve across his wet cheek and looked at me searchingly to see if i might be trusted then he limped to the sink treated his face and hands to a hasty but energetic scrub seized his fragment of a hat gave his brief trousers a hitch which had the air of being the last exquisite touch to a faultless toilet and sat down on the landing to mend his twine shoelace who is your neighbor in number mrs kennett i asked as i rose to go i went there to find you did you indeed m well i hope she treated you civil m though it dont be much in her line shes a mis mooney m i know her but she dont know me anny more sence shes riz in the wurrld she moved out of this house whin i moved into it but none of us ladies here is good enough for her to sociate with now m

place good day m i carved my way through the tin cans and bottles again under the haughty eye of my duchess of the fishcart and in a few minutes patsy and i were again in silver street when we entered the room he looked about with an expression of entire content its all here he said with a sigh as if he had feared to find it a dream the chair with its red cushion pleased him greatly then after a few moments talk to make him feel a little at home we drew up to the picture and i took his cleanest hand in mine and told him the story of victor the brave st bernard dog it was an experience never to be repeated and never to be forgotten illustration the story of victor as you sit at twilight in the sweet safe corner of the household fire the sound of the raindrops on the windowpane mingling with the laughing treble of childish voices in some distant room you see certain pictures in the dying flame pictures unspeakably precious to every one who has lived or loved or suffered i have my memorypictures too and from the fairest frame of all shines patsys radiant face as it looked into mine long ago when i told him the story of victor chapter vi a little hoodlums virtue kindles at the touch of joy if you make children happy now you will make them happy twenty years hence by the memory of it the next morning when i reached the little tin shop on the corner a blessed trystingplace forever sacred where the children waited for me in sunshine rain wind and storm unless forbidden there on the step sat faithful patsy with a clean and shining morning face all glowing with anticipation how well i remember my poor lads first day where should i seat him there was an empty space beside little mike higgins but mikes character obtained from a fond and candid parent had been to the effect that he was in heaven any time if he could jest lay a boy out flat and there was a place by moses but he was very much of a fop just then owing to a new secondhand coat and might make scathing allusions to patsys abbreviated swallowtail but a pull at my skirt and a whisper from the boy decided me please cant i set aside o you miss kate but patsy the fun of it is i never do sit why i thought teachers never done nothin but set you dont know much about little boys and girls thats sure well suppose you put your chair in front and close to me here is maggie bruce on one side she is a real little kindergarten mother and will show you just how to do everything wont you maggie we had our morning hymn and our familiar talk in which we always outlined the policy of the new day for the children were apt to be angelic and receptive at nine oclock in the morning the unwillingness of the spirit and weakness of the flesh seldom overtaking them till an hour or so later it chanced to be a beautiful day for helen and i were both happy and well our volunteer helpers were daily growing more zealous and efficient and there was no tragedy in the immediate foreground in one of the morning songs when paulina went into the circle and threw goodmorning kisses to the rest she wafted a dozen of them to the ceiling a proceeding i could not understand why did you throw so many of your kisses up in the air dear i asked as she ran back to my side them was goodmornings to johnny cass so t he wouldnt feel lonesome she explained and the tender bit of remembrance was followed out by the children for days afterward was it not enough to put us in a gentle humor patsy was not equal to the marching when later on the lilliputian army formed itself in line and kept step to the music of a lively tune and he was far too shy on the first day to join in the play though he watched the game of the butterfly with intense interest from his nook by the piano after the tiny worm had wriggled itself realistically into a cocoon it went to sleep and after a moment of dramatic silence the little one chosen for the butterfly would separate herself from the still cocoon and fly about the circle sipping mimic honey from the childflowers to see carlotty griggs being a butterfly with utter intensity of joy and singleness of purpose was a sight to be remembered for carlotty was a pickaninny four years old and blacker than the ace of spades her purple calico dress pink apron and twenty little woolly braids tied with bits of yellow ribbon made her the most tropical of butterflies and the children having a strong sense of color and hardly any sense of humor were always entirely carried away by her antics illustration carlotty griggs being a butterfly carlotty had huge feet indeed carlotty toed in for that matter but her face shone with delight her eyes glistened and so did her teeth and when she waved her ebony hands and flitted among the children she did it as airily as any real butterfly that ever danced over a field of clover blossoms and if patsys joy was great in the play it was greater still in the work that came afterward when helen gave him a scarlet and gold mat to weave his fingers trembled with eagerness and the expression of his face caused that impulsive young person to fly to my side and whisper oh why should one ever want to be an angel when one can be a kindergartner from this time on patsy was the first to come in the morning and the last to leave at night he took the whole institution under his guardianship and had a watchful eye for everybody and everything belonging to it he soon learned the family history of every child in the school and those family histories i assure you were of an exciting nature but so great were patsys prudence and his idea of the proprieties that he never divulged his knowledge till we were alone then his tongue would be loosed and he would break into his halfchildlike halfancient and reflective conversation he had a stormy temper which however he was fast learning to control and he was not always kind and gentle with his little playfellows for he had been raised in a hard school and the giving and taking of blows was a natural matter to him the only feasible manner of settling a misunderstanding his conduct to me however was touching in its devotion and perfect obedience and from the first hour he was my poor little knight sans peur et sans reproche meanwhile though not perfect he was greatly changed for the better we had given him a neat little coat and trousers his hair was short and smooth and his great dark eyes shone with unutterable content he was never joyous born under a cloud he had lived in its shadow and sorrow too early borne had left its indelible impress to be removed only by that undisturbed vision of the fathers face which is joy unutterable but for the first time in his life he was at peace the duchess of anna street had moved into a house a trifle better suited to her exalted station in life one where the view was better and the society worthy of a fishpeddlers family accordingly we transferred the kennetts into number an honor which they took calmly at first on account of the odor of fish that pervaded the apartments the three and four year old kennetts were now members of our flock the dull baby was cared for daily by the infant shelter and mrs kennett went out washing while her spouse upheld the cause of labor by attending sandlot meetings in the afternoon and marching in the evening so in the rainy winter afternoons when the other children had gone patsy and i stayed together and arranged the next days occupations slang was being gradually eliminated from his conversation but it is no small task to correct nine years of bad grammar and i never succeeded in doing it alas the time was all too short it was patsy who sorted the wools and threaded the needles and set right the sewingcards of the babies and only the initiated can comprehend the labyrinthine maze into which an energetic threeyearold can transform a bit of sewing it was he who fished the needles from the cracks in the floor rubbed the blackboards and scrubbed the slates talking busily the while jiminy i take that back miss kate we cant let jimmy buck have no more needles he sows em thick as seed round his chair now now jis look yere ef that battles chap haint scratched the hull top of this table with a buzzer id lam him good ef i was you i would do you think our kindergarten would be the pleasant place it is if i whipped little boys every day nooo but there is times yes i know patsy but i have never found them jims stayin out nights this week said he one day nd i hez to stay along o mis kennett till nine oclock why i thought jim always stayed at home in the evening yes he allers used ter but hes busy now lookin up a girl dont yer know looking up a girl what do you mean patsy patsy scratched his head with the tentoothed comb of nature a habit which prevailed with terrible and suggestive frequency when i first came into my kingdom and answered lookin up a girl why i sposed yer knew that i dunno zackly jim says all the fellers does he says he hates to git the feed an wash the dishes orfly nd girls likes ter do it best of anything oh cried i light bursting in upon my darkened intellect when dishwashing was mentioned he wants to get married well he has ter look up a girl first dont yer spose yes of course but i dont see how jim can get money enough to take care of a wife he only has thirty dollars a month well hes goin ter get a girl whatll go halveys dont yer know and pay for her keep hed ruther have a millingnary girl theyre the nicest but if he cant hes goin to try for one out of the box factory oh patsy i wish why didnt i ought ter say that i wish you had a mother dear if i had id know more n i do now and a great sigh heaved itself upward from beneath the blue jacket no you wouldnt know so much patsy or at least you would get the right end first never mind dear boy you cant understand jim says mis kennett nd i neednt set such store by you cause the fust chance you gits youll git married i always did have an elective antipathy for jim shall yer miss kate why dear i think we are very happy as we are dont you yes ef i could only stay frever nd not go ter the reel school jim says i ought ter be gittin book learnin pretty soon did you tell him that miss helen was teaching you to read and write a little while every afternoon yes i told him he liked it fust rate mis kennett said shed let her childern stay frever with yer ef they never larned a thing nd so would i dear dear miss kate oh i bet god would like to see you in that pretty blue dress and he hung over me with a speechless caress his first and last indeed for he was shy and reticent in emotion and never once showed his affection in the presence of the other children illustration paulinas goodmornings to johnny cass chapter vii patsy finds his three lost years now god be thanked for years enwrought with love which softens yet now god he thanked for every thought which is so tender it has caught earths guerdon of regret well jim did not succeed in finding his girl although he looked industriously either the millingnaries did not smile upon him and his slender bank account or they were not willing to wash the dishes and halve the financial responsibilities besides but as the winter days slipped by we could not help seeing that patsys pale face grew paler and his soft dark eyes larger and more pathetic in spite of better care than he had ever had before he was often kept at home by suffering all too intense for a child to bear it was almost as if a sixth sense came to him in those days so full was he of strange thoughts and intuitions his eyes followed me wistfully as i passed from one child to another and when my glance fell upon him his loving gaze seemed always waiting for mine when we were alone as he pored over picturebooks or sat silently by the window watching the drops chase each other down the pane his talk was often of heaven and the angels illustration he sat silently by the window daga ohlsen had left us her baby eyes had opened under norway skies but her tongue had learned the trick of our language when her father and mother could not speak nor understand a word and so she became a childish interpreter of manners and customs in general but we knew that mothers hearts are the same the world over and lacking the power to put our sympathy in words we sent dagas last bit of sewing to her mother sure enough no word was needed the message explained itself and when we went to take a last look at the dear child the scrap of cardboard lay in the still hand the needle threaded with yellow wool the childish knot soiled and cumbersome hanging below the pattern just as she had left it it was her only funeral offering her only funeral service and was it not something of a sermon it told the history of her industry her sudden call from earthly things and her mothers tender thought it chanced to be a symbol too as things do chance sometimes for it was a butterfly dropping its cocoon behind it and spreading its wings for flight patsy had been our messenger during dagas illness and his mind was evidently on that mystery which has puzzled souls since the beginning of time for no anxious weary waiting heart has ever ceased to beat without its passionate desire to look into the beyond nixy joness mother died yesterday miss kate they had an orful nice funeral yes im sorry for the poor little children they will miss their mamma not nuff to hurt em them joneses never cared nuthin for nobody they was playing on tin oyster cans the hull blessed evnin till jim went nd stopt em nd told em it warnt perlite say how dretful it must be to go down into the cold dark ground and be shut up in a tight box nd want to git out git out nd keep hollerin nd ahollerin and nobody come to fetch yer cause yers dead oh patsy child stop such fearful thoughts i hope people are glad and willing to stay when they are dead the part of them that wonders and thinks and feels and loves and is happy or sad you know what i mean dont you yes he said slowly leaning his head on his hand god takes care of that part it is his own and he makes it all right and as for our bodies patsy you dont care about keeping your poor little aching back do you you talk about the cold dark earth why i think of it as the tender warm earth that holds the little brown acorn until it begins to grow into a spreading oaktree and nurses the little seeds till they grow into lovely blossoming flowers now we must trot home patsy wrap this shawl over your shoulders and come under my umbrella oh i dont need any shawl please im so orful hot thats just the reason i replied as i looked with anxious eyes at his flushed cheeks i left him at the little door on anna street and persuaded mrs kennett to give him some hot soup at dinnertime the next morning i was startled from a profound sleep by a tremendous peal of the doorbell though only half awakened my forebodings seemed realized and the bell rang patsy in my ears i hastily slipped on my dress and going to the door saw just whom i expected jim whats the matter with patsy hes turrible bad miss he got took with one o them fits the worst kind in the night and liked ter died yer could a heerd him screech a block off oh my poor boy have you had a doctor what did he say well he said he guessed it was the last one miss nd im afraid it is sure who is with him now are you going right back yes miss soon as i go nd git leave from the boss mis kennetts went to her washin she couldnt ford ter lose a job i found mr kennett nd hes mindin patsy he cries for you he says he dont want nothin but jest miss kate and hes that crazy he wants to git up nd come to the kindergarten dear little lad i said trying to keep back the tears here jim take the school keys to miss helen and ask her to take my place today ill start in ten minutes for patsy thank yer miss i tell yer hes a crooked little chap but hes as smart as they make em nd annyhow hes all the folks ive got in the world nd i hope we kin pull him through pull him through had years passed over patsys head since i saw him last he seemed to have grown old with the nights pain but the eyes shone out with new lustre and brilliancy making ready i thought to receive the heavenly visions we were alone i could not bear mr kennetts presence and had dispatched him for the doctor i knelt by the bedside and took his cold hand in mine i could not pray god to spare him it was so clear that he had better take him to himself i knowed youd come miss kate he said faintly i knowed youd hurry up yous allers hurryin up for us boys oh how beautiful how awesome it is to be the messenger of peace to an unhappy soul so great a joy is it to bear that it is not given to many twice in a lifetime the rain beat upon the frail roof the wind blew about the little house and a darkness of fastgathering black clouds fell into the room in place of the morning sunbeams it was a gloomy day for a journey but if one were traveling from shadow into sunshine i thought it would not matter much mis kennett says i must hev a priest but i dont want no priest but you whispered the faint voice as i bent over the pillows what does priests do when folks is sick miss kate they pray patsy what fur i paused for in my grief i could think of no simple way of telling that ignorant little child what they did pray for they will pray for you dear i said at length because they will want to talk to god about the little boy who is coming to him to tell him how glad they are that he is to be happy at last but that they shall miss him very very much the priest lives clear out market street nd he wouldnt git ere fore god knew the hull thing thout his tellin of it you pray miss kate o thou dear loving father in heaven patsys father and mine who givest all the little children into their mothers arms if one of them is lost and wandering about the world forlorn and alone surely thou wilt take him to a better home we send little patsy to thee and pray that his heart may be fitted with joy and thankfulness when he comes to live in thy house tell im bout them three years what i lost so t hell make lowance jest as you did o god who saw fit to lay a heavy burden on patsys little shoulders and take away his three years make them up to him in his heavenly life yer never said amen t aint no good thout yer say amen amen silence for many minutes the brain was alive with thoughts but the poor tired body was weakened already with the labor of telling them when he spoke again it was more slowly and with greater difficulty i guess heaven is kind o like our kindergartent dont you nd so i aint goin to feel strange therell be beautiful places with flowers bloomin in em nd birds nd brooks mebbe like those in the stories you tell us and lots of singin like we have and the peoples are good to each other like our children ceptin jimmy battles nd theyll do each others work nd wait on the angels nd run errants for god i spose and everybodyll wear clean white aprons like in the picturebooks but i shant like it much thout you git there pretty quick miss kate but i aint goin to cry oh patsy my boy it is for those who are left behind to cry it must be better to go well im willin ive got enough o this i tell yer with backaches nd fits nd boys callin sassy names nd no gravy ever on my pertater but i hate to go way from the kindergartent only praps heaven is just like only bigger nd more children nd no jimmy battleses sing about the pleasant mornin light will yer please miss kate and in a voice choked with tears as jim came in and lifted patsy in his arms i sang the hymn that he had sung with folded hands and reverent mien every morning of his life in the kindergarten father we thank thee for the night and for the pleasant morning light for rest and gladness love and care and all that makes the day so fair help us to do the things we should to be to others kind and good in all we do in work or play to grow more loving every day the last lingering trembling note fell upon the deathlike stillness of the room as with one sharp brief struggle one look of ineffable love and peace the tired lids drooped heavily over the eyes never to be lifted again light had gleamed upon the darkened pathway but the silent room the dying fire the failing light and the falling rain were all in fellowship with death my blessed boy god had given him back his three lost years oh it is hard to take to heart the lesson that such deaths will teach but let no man reject it for it is one that all must learn when death strikes down the innocent and young from every fragile form from which he lets the panting spirit free a hundred virtues rise in shapes of mercy charity and love to walk the world and bless it of every tear that sorrowing mortals shed on such green graves some good is born some gentler nature comes illustration tailpiece
